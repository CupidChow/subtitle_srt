=Episode 5=

3
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,860
It's almost time.

4
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,990
Let's see if he's on time today.

5
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,980
Stop pretending to work.

6
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,700
Today's workload isn't that heavy.

7
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,460
Leave early

8
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,910
before you get stuck in traffic.

9
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,060
Let's go!

10
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,300
Don't you guys think

11
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,980
our new director is pretty funny?

12
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,360
He's more punctual about leaving work

13
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,100
than he is about coming in.

14
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,380
Qian, do you really love
working overtime that much?

15
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,700
Do you even have a life outside of work?

16
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,020
Come on,

17
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,780
let me tell you what "life" really is.

18
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,700
Take "life" as living

19
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,060
and "life" as alive.

20
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,020
When the two of you are separate,
it's super chill.

21
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,020
But one day,

22
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,500
when you're combined,

23
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,140
you'll understand what life truly is.

24
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,300
That kind of makes sense.

25
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,820
Who are you trying to match up, though?

26
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,780
So boring.

27
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,420
See you tomorrow.

28
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,940
See you.

29
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,140
Wait for me!

30
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,410
Why are you just sitting there?

31
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,540
Grab a drink, have a drink!

32
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,380
- Let's all drink together!
- Right?

33
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,620
It's been years. Come on!

34
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,420
Hey, what's this?

35
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,860
What?

36
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,040
I've already had one, aren't you
going to clink glasses with me?

37
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,340
- Hi! Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

38
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,860
What, no invite for me?

39
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,820
Hu,

40
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
if I remember correctly,

41
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,860
your wife works
for some foreign company now, right?

42
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,340
Nonsense.

43
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,660
Hu's wife is a public interest lawyer.

44
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,180
No, wasn't she

45
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,700
Hu's boss before?

46
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,180
She switched careers to become a lawyer?

47
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,660
That's my ex-wife.

48
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,900
That was ages ago.

49
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,180
- Oh, I didn't know.
- Let's drink.

50
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,780
Can't keep it all straight.

51
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,140
Come on.

52
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,100
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

53
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,100
Do you know where he got
his first fortune?

54
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,940
Where?

55
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,340
Wasn't it from
divorcing his wealthy ex-wife?

56
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,460
And now he's here pretending
to be some start-up elite.

57
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,420
Well,

58
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,220
now he's rich.

59
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,180
Right?

60
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,100
It's so easy for him to just trade up

61
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,420
and marry some do-gooder lawyer.

62
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,020
What's he trying to balance out?

63
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,330
I'm not putting up with him.

64
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,340
Remember back in college?

65
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,740
He even stole our stuff.

66
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,140
Stop making stuff up.

67
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,450
He didn't steal from you.

68
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,060
You remember it wrong.

69
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,180
I remember it wrong?

70
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,740
- Come on, cheers!
- Long time no see.

71
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,500
Let's drink!

72
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,300
Come on, cheers.

73
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,300
Sorry everyone,

74
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,380
I'm late.

75
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,260
Xuanxuan!

76
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,300
- Xuanxuan!
- Xuanxuan!

77
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,540
You finally made it!

78
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,260
Alright, let's make room
for the school belle,

79
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,220
shall we?

80
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,140
- Go back to your seat.
- I do.

81
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,740
- Come on.
- I do.

82
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,420
Still pretending?

83
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,260
- Your goddess is here.
- Xuanxuan.

84
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,420
It's been ages.

85
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,580
It really has.

86
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,030
You've changed so much,

87
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,460
I almost didn't recognize you.

88
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,940
You haven't changed a bit.

89
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,140
Still the same as always.

90
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,100
Can you not butt in?

91
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,460
Xuanxuan,

92
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,340
let me introduce properly.

93
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,300
This is Hu...

94
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,540
Wait,

95
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,740
we can't call him Hu anymore.

96
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,100
He's now Mr. Hu.

97
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,940
Mr. Hu.

98
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,780
CEO of a soon-to-be-listed company.

99
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,980
He's super busy these days.

100
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,900
If it weren't for

101
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,220
your visit back home,

102
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,620
we probably wouldn't
have had the chance to see him.

103
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,180
Does anyone here still remember

104
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,590
back in school,

105
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,080
Mr. Hu wrote

106
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,820
something

107
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,900
to Xuanxuan.

108
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,940
- A love letter.
- Love letter.

109
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,780
Right!

110
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,380
There was no love letter!

111
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,940
Stop picking on me, seriously.

112
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,820
No love letter.

113
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,220
Why can't I remember this at all?

114
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,540
They're both denying it,

115
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,020
- but I'm sure there was one.
- Xuanxuan.

116
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,820
I have to say,

117
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,340
anyone can forget about it,

118
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,460
yet you can't have forgotten that.

119
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,620
You broke Mr. Hu's heart.

120
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,060
Don't make stuff up.

121
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,260
Then again,

122
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,180
Xuanxuan was so beautiful back then.

123
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,940
She must have received
loads of love letters.

124
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,420
It's normal if she doesn't remember.

125
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,380
But,

126
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,740
Hu

127
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,060
only wrote a love letter

128
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,100
to one person in his entire life,

129
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,100
right?

130
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,070
Hu, is that true?

131
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,980
I think he's underestimating me.

132
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,110
Hu,

133
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,340
that's an interesting comment.

134
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,930
- Is that how it is?
- Good for you.

135
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,580
Hu says he doesn't remember.

136
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,660
Should I spill the beans?

137
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,080
- Go ahead.
- Sure.

138
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,180
Alright, I'll skip

139
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,700
the steamy details.

140
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,420
Who told you to skip that part?

141
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Have you seen my watch?

142
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,660
Where's my watch? Move!

143
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,100
- What are you doing?
- Searching your place.

144
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,220
What are you doing? Stop.

145
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,700
Why are you searching my stuff?

146
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,940
Why are you suspecting me?

147
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,740
I am suspecting you.

148
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,580
So what?

149
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,210
You're always in the dorm reading.

150
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,260
If it wasn't you, who else could it be?

151
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,220
I'm telling you,

152
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,310
give my watch back now,

153
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,220
or I swear I'll beat you up!

154
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,460
Let's go eat.

155
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,140
Did you see the love letter
he wrote to Xuanxuan?

156
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,220
Talk about a toad lusting after a swan.

157
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,420
Like the campus belle would ever
look at a bookworm like him.

158
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,080
You're overacting.

159
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,200
Mind your own business.

160
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,990
How about this,

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,260
- later...
- Yeah.

162
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,100
Guys.

163
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,180
Mr. Hu has prepared

164
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,140
some small gifts for everyone.

165
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,480
Let me hand them out.

166
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,590
Hu.

167
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,900
- Is this appropriate?
- Come on.

168
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,220
It's just some promotional items

169
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,340
from a business project
my company is working on.

170
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,980
Just take it for fun.

171
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,380
Please take it.

172
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,940
- Okay.
- Thank you.

173
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,930
Here.

174
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,710
- Let me see.
- You're so kind.

175
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,700
Look, look.

176
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,980
- Take it.
- It's too kind.

177
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,940
Yeah.

178
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,980
Hu.

179
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,180
- Sorry.
- Let's toast to Hu.

180
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,180
That's it.

181
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,620
I've got one at home.

182
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,780
Sorry.

183
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,980
The market price for this
is 7,000 to 8,000 yuan!

184
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,960
- More like 8,000 plus!
- Come on.

185
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,300
Check it out. Am I right?

186
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,140
Yeah.

187
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,460
This is way too generous.

188
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,940
- By the way,
- Right?

189
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,420
about your son's school,

190
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,460
I've already spoken to the principal.

191
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,660
Next week, you can take your son

192
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,500
to register.

193
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,650
This...

194
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,340
I have to come

195
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,660
thank you personally,

196
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,060
Hu.

197
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,180
I've been worrying about this

198
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,780
for ages.

199
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,660
I can't thank you enough.

200
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,370
- No need. It was nothing.
- Come on.

201
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,860
Mr. Hu,

202
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,220
my company just developed a new app.

203
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,580
- We'll talk about it.
- My financing...

204
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,060
- Hu. Hu.
- Don't worry.

205
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,620
- I'll keep all your matters in mind.
- Come on.

206
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,820
What are you doing?

207
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,380
Let's toast to Mr. Hu!

208
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,260
Cheers.

209
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,570
We're all old classmates.

210
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,100
Cheers.

211
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,300
We're classmates.

212
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,280
- Hu Cheng.
- We must not be estranged.

213
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,580
Let me add you on WeChat.

214
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,210
- Sure.
- Let's help each other out, right?

215
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,980
Okay.

216
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,620
You two should add each other too.

217
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,740
We should meet up more often, Hu.

218
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,580
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

219
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,460
Thanks for everything.

220
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,660
You're welcome.

221
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,980
Well, wait until the weekends.

222
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,180
- I'll be free.
- Okay.

223
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,820
Don't worry.

224
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,940
Just call me by then.

225
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,140
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

226
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,140
Bye-bye.

227
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,420
Hold him.

228
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,090
What's wrong?

229
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,820
Hu Cheng, what's wrong?

230
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,170
Why didn't you approve
my WeChat request?

231
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,020
Bad signal?

232
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,060
Why are you here?

233
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,980
Come in.

234
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,020
What's up?

235
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,180
Nothing.

236
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,900
I just wanted to check on you.

237
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,860
Did the gathering upset you?

238
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
It's better not to go.

239
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,500
Whatever happens,

240
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,860
I'm always here for you.

241
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,260
I know.

242
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,900
You'll always stay by my side.

243
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,010
Did I wake you up?

244
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,980
Did the gathering go well?

245
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,060
It went great.

246
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,260
Very great.

247
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,940
We had such a good time,

248
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,020
and even lost track of time.

249
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,380
Didn't expect it to go so late.

250
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,590
Still up this late?

251
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,510
You've got time to

252
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,480
listen to this music.

253
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,680
It's just that

254
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,820
whenever I see this group of guys,

255
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,620
it reminds me

256
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,660
of the happy,

257
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,180
carefree days in college.

258
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,220
What are you doing?

259
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,500
- Searching your place.
- Stop.

260
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,560
Why are you searching my stuff?

261
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,580
What are you suspecting me?

262
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,660
I am suspecting you.

263
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,500
So what?

264
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,700
You're always in the dorm reading.

265
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,740
If it wasn't you, who else could it be?

266
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,070
We don't stay in touch much,

267
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,060
but

268
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,460
they're a group of
genuinely close friends.

269
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,300
Mr. Hu,

270
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,020
didn't you write

271
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,940
something to Xuanxuan?

272
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,680
- A love letter.
- Love letter.

273
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,820
Exactly! Hu was so determined
to win you over.

274
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,940
Every weekend, he'd go learn piano,

275
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,700
while the rest of us
hit the internet cafe for gaming.

276
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,060
- I can vouch for that.
- He worked so hard,

277
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,120
sacrificing everything for it.

278
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,660
The most amazing thing is,

279
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,180
after all these years,

280
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,900
they haven't changed a bit.

281
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,300
No pretentiousness,

282
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,780
no ulterior motives,

283
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,020
just pure,

284
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,700
genuine friendships.

285
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,020
It's like they'd give you

286
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,980
their hearts if you asked.

287
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,580
As long as you're happy.

288
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,540
I am.

289
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,020
Honey.

290
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,860
Go get some rest.

291
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,060
I want to stay here a little longer.

292
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,060
Alright.

293
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,900
But don't stay up too late.

294
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,860
Whatever happens,

295
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,580
I'm always here for you.

296
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,580
I know.

297
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,420
You'll always stay by my side.

298
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,900
- The path is a bit rough.
- Careful.

299
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,820
What kind of place is this?

300
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,660
Seriously,

301
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,020
I think this is nice.

302
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,940
You think this is nice?

303
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,660
We drove for an hour,

304
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,660
walked forever,

305
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,540
and there's nothing here!

306
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,700
What do you mean "nothing"?

307
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,620
There are mountains, water,

308
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,900
flowers, grass, sunlight.

309
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,220
And most importantly,

310
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,180
there are

311
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,020
fish.

312
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,940
So we did all this

313
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,220
just to go fishing?

314
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,540
Hurry, take out the food.

315
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,780
I told you

316
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,860
the boss loves fishing.

317
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,540
You didn't believe me.

318
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,300
Do whatever you want.

319
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,620
Didn't you say

320
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,100
this was a team-building trip?

321
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,740
Exactly.

322
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,260
Fishing

323
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,340
improves

324
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,780
teamwork

325
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,180
and strengthens bonds within the team.

326
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,510
You're just using this
as an excuse for your own fun.

327
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,740
I want to take photos.

328
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,580
I want to have a picnic.

329
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,740
I want to gossip.

330
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,860
Why am I the only woman
in this department?

331
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,740
Boss, can't we hire another girl?

332
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,700
I need some company!

333
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,460
We're fully staffed.

334
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,140
Why don't we play Werewolf?

335
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,180
Or poker?

336
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,380
Or maybe a game online?

337
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,220
Straight guys.

338
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,740
Still working while we're out?

339
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,020
Boring.

340
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,340
You young people don't understand life.

341
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,700
Am I working right now?

342
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,620
No, I'm providing for my family.

343
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,580
You're just middle-aged.

344
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,110
Look over there, we've got an old man.

345
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,020
Boss, you're still young.

346
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,500
Why do you act like an old man?

347
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,980
Thanks for the blessing.

348
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,940
I hope I'll still enjoy this

349
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,820
when I'm old.

350
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,320
The ultimate overachiever.

351
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,580
How about a game of cards?

352
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,780
(Starlight Kindergarten)

353
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,260
Sorry.

354
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,220
Ziyuan.

355
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,580
Mommy! Mommy!

356
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,820
You aren't the first
to pick me up today.

357
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,140
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Tomorrow I'll be the first, okay?

358
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,460
- Bye-bye!
- Okay.

359
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,420
Let's go home.

360
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,700
Mommy, Mommy!

361
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,300
I want to wait with Qin Jiaojiao
until her mom comes.

362
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,180
Otherwise, she'll cry again.

363
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,660
Her mom hasn't come yet?

364
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,350
She's crying. Her mom's not here.

365
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,220
Jiaojiao,

366
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,060
don't cry, poor thing.

367
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,090
Qin Jiaojiao,

368
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,620
will your mom pick you up today?

369
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,260
Of course, my mom

370
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,740
always picks me up every day.

371
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,830
You're lying!

372
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,180
Recently, your mom hasn't been coming.

373
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,100
You're lying!

374
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,580
You're the liar!

375
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,420
Jiaojiao, let's not cry anymore, okay?

376
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,540
No more crying.

377
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,020
How about this,

378
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,780
me and Ziyuan

379
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,620
will stay here with you

380
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,020
until your mom comes.

381
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,300
Alright?

382
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,380
Auntie,

383
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,100
you know what?

384
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,340
Today is my birthday.

385
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,180
My mom will definitely
come to pick me up.

386
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,540
Your mom will absolutely come.

387
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,140
Jiaojiao,

388
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,460
happy birthday.

389
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,260
Happy birthday, Qin Jiaojiao.

390
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,860
Here's a gift for you.

391
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,300
Jiaojiao,

392
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,180
your family's driver
will come to pick you up soon.

393
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,140
Don't worry.

394
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,060
Mommy is mean!

395
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,820
Mommy's a liar!

396
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,860
Ziyuan, think of something.

397
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,340
Qin Jiaojiao,

398
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,660
stop crying.

399
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,620
I'll play with you, okay?

400
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,060
How about Ziyuan plays with you?

401
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,280
We'll celebrate your birthday early.

402
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,300
Let's go to the slide!

403
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,820
Come on, go!

404
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,500
Take care.

405
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,980
Careful.

406
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,060
What's up with Jiaojiao's mom?

407
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,620
Not even picking up her kid
on her birthday?

408
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,740
I heard Jiaojiao's mom
just got promoted.

409
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,020
She's an executive now,

410
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,420
working overtime every day.

411
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,740
This past month,

412
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,900
- I haven't seen her even once.
- I'll go first.

413
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,740
Careful.

414
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,340
And her dad?

415
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,740
Even busier.

416
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,780
Honestly,

417
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,540
Jiaojiao's family is well off.

418
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,720
If her parents don't pick her up,

419
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,420
there's still a driver to take her home.

420
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,460
Imagine regular working-class families,

421
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,820
that's the real struggle.

422
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,620
There's always a way.

423
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,580
No need to stress yourself out.

424
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,580
You probably don't know,

425
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,260
we're all so envious of you.

426
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,700
You don't have to worry about anything.

427
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,420
It's such a blessing!

428
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,380
Honey, we're back.

429
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,500
Dad.

430
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,140
You're back, son.

431
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,620
Why so late today?

432
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,700
Were you causing trouble again?

433
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,460
Dad.

434
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,820
Today,

435
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,700
Mom and I waited with Qin Jiaojiao
for her mom to come pick her up.

436
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,140
Who's Qin Jiaojiao?

437
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,500
Qin Jiaojiao

438
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,660
is his classmate.

439
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,100
My classmate.

440
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,420
Honey,

441
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,100
I felt so looked down on today.

442
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,620
Who dared to look down on you?

443
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,940
His teacher.

444
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,380
She talked about Jiaojiao's mom

445
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,580
with such admiration.

446
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,340
She said Jiaojiao's mom
is a strong, capable woman,

447
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,580
a company executive

448
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,020
flying all over the world

449
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,020
for business deals.

450
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,100
And then she looked at me.

451
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,420
It's like

452
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,020
I'm just some mom

453
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,460
who only picks up and drops off kids.

454
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,940
Are you saying

455
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,820
you want to go back to work?

456
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,020
I think

457
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,980
I've had

458
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,980
enough rest.

459
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,780
It's time for me to get back out there.

460
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,220
I'm going to put my bag away.

461
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,580
(Organizer Association)
This association's president

462
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,900
(Organizer)
is actually my client.

463
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,940
They've helped a lot of
stay-at-home moms

464
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,460
who've been away from work
for a long time.

465
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,900
Of course,

466
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,660
I know this job

467
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,860
might not be your dream role.

468
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,540
But,

469
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,020
your online reputation

470
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,420
is still taking hits.

471
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,980
It still affects you a lot.

472
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,180
Finding a perfect job

473
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,500
won't be easy for you

474
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,620
right now.

475
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,540
I have sent out resumes before,

476
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,340
but they all ended up going nowhere.

477
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,020
Being a professional organizer

478
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,020
sounds trendy.

479
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,700
Exactly!

480
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,060
It's in demand.

481
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,300
You know, it requires
extensive training

482
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,700
and expertise.

483
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,140
It's very good.

484
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,900
It could even help me

485
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,100
organize our home better.

486
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,940
Right?

487
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,180
Honey,

488
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,090
I'll support you no matter what.

489
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,460
Whatever job you choose,

490
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,350
you'll be amazing at it.

491
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,140
He allows me to go out.

492
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
But if I want freedom?

493
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,780
Fine,

494
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,860
(Organizer Association)
but only on his terms.

495
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,180
Everything

496
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,860
has to go according to his plan.

497
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,980
What about the service center?

498
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,300
Isn't that okay?

499
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,340
Back then,

500
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,060
he thought I was just killing time

501
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,300
at the service center.

502
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,220
Who knew I'd actually succeed there?

503
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,460
Now,

504
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,400
he wants to completely kill my dream

505
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,940
of being a lawyer.

506
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,620
A man like Hu Cheng

507
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,140
doesn't want a wife.

508
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,020
He wants a perfectly controlled

509
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,300
chess piece.

510
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,100
You've seen plenty of men

511
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,660
like that, haven't you?

512
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,340
Yes.

513
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,300
Seeing so many

514
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,900
has made it clear.

515
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,460
Do you think

516
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,940
I should reach out to the director?

517
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,220
With his connections,

518
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,500
getting me an entry-level job

519
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,660
shouldn't be hard.

520
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,220
Entry-level?

521
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,700
You want to start from scratch?

522
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,260
What Hu Cheng said

523
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,300
wasn't an exaggeration.

524
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,540
Because of Congcong's situation,

525
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,140
finding a suitable job

526
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,570
is really difficult for me right now.

527
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:05,140
(Director, are you busy these days?
I'd like to come by and chat with you.)

528
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,180
(Confirm deletion)

529
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,740
Honey,

530
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,820
did you send your resume

531
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,340
to the Organizer Association?

532
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,900
Don't rush me!

533
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,780
I'm still

534
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,900
tweaking my wording,

535
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,300
trying to make it perfect

536
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,420
before I send it over.

537
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,300
Alright,

538
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,380
no rush.

539
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,420
Anyway,

540
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,340
I've already spoken to them.

541
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,620
I know them well.

542
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,980
Just let me know when you're ready.

543
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,940
Don't worry.

544
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,460
Director,

545
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,180
this is

546
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,460
the situation.

547
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,420
Now

548
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,740
I really hope

549
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,580
to return to the law firm.

550
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,940
Well,

551
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,460
our firm now is like a puzzle,

552
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,380
every piece fits perfectly.

553
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,580
There's no one we could ask to leave.

554
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,620
Ning,

555
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,780
if only you had come back to work

556
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,010
right after your maternity leave,

557
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,560
things would be different now,
wouldn't they?

558
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,060
Back then, I insisted on

559
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,750
keeping your position open for you.

560
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,820
Come in.

561
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,540
Director.

562
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,620
Qin, you're here.

563
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,240
Ning Yue!

564
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,900
Qin.

565
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,140
Here to see Director?

566
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,250
Long time no see.

567
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,660
Qin,

568
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,260
here are the files you wanted.

569
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,100
And this contract.

570
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,040
- Take a seat.
- Director Zhou,

571
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,000
I brought you a small gift.

572
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,860
I'll leave it here.

573
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,020
Great.

574
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,940
Have some water.

575
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,500
I can get it myself.

576
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,740
Qin,

577
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,380
how's your new position at Zhongzhi?

578
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,060
Everything going smoothly?

579
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,460
It's a career shift for you.

580
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,420
A lot of the work overlaps

581
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,020
with my previous experience.

582
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,860
For the unfamiliar areas,

583
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,050
I'm catching up quickly.

584
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,940
Qin,

585
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,580
did you switch to legal affairs?

586
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,860
Yes.

587
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,220
See?

588
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,340
Even your mentor is surprised.

589
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,500
Ning,

590
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,460
do you remember

591
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,540
when Qin first joined our firm?

592
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,020
He was just a rookie.

593
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,140
Then he became your assistant,

594
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,060
and in five years,

595
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,740
he rose to senior attorney.

596
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,620
That was some impressive progress.

597
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,820
Honestly, not staying as a lawyer

598
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,540
is such a waste for you.

599
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,100
Yue,

600
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,630
what are you working on these days?

601
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,540
By the way, Qin,

602
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,620
is your company hiring right now?

603
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,580
I don't think we have any openings.

604
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,740
Oh, wait,

605
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,640
there's an assistant position
still available.

606
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,940
Yue,

607
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,340
I didn't know

608
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,900
Director was asking for you.

609
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,980
You're an excellent lawyer,

610
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,740
and with your skills,

611
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,940
you'll find a suitable job in no time.

612
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,020
I could be

613
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,780
your assistant.

614
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,100
I know, I know.

615
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,700
Still up?

616
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,420
Go to bed first.

617
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,580
I just wanted to let you know

618
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,780
I got a job.

619
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,060
How's it going?

620
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,350
It's going great.

621
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,740
He's an old friend,
very kind and helpful.

622
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,820
That's good to hear.

623
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,020
Get some rest soon.

624
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,140
Okay.

625
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,580
Can you give me an exact time?

626
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,980
When will the sample be ready?

627
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,220
Our company's legal department
is split into three divisions.

628
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,580
Our division handles

629
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,140
intellectual property, data,

630
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,980
investments,

631
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,460
and internal audits.

632
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,780
Mainly about these.

633
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:04,900
Some cases,

634
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,220
like patent rights in IP,

635
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,340
are very similar
to the commercial litigation

636
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,380
we handled before.

637
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,460
For now, your top priority

638
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,140
is to catch up on the updated regulations
from the past two years.

639
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,170
Also, Pan Jie will help you

640
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,460
understand the situation.

641
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,780
There are a few closed case files

642
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,500
you can start reviewing.

643
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,020
Got it.

644
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,900
Yue, have a seat.

645
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,700
I still feel a bit off

646
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,920
about making you a legal assistant.

647
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,760
Director Qin,

648
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,590
I really need this job.

649
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,080
Thank you so much
for giving me this opportunity.

650
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,270
Whether I can handle it or not,

651
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,380
just watch my performance.

652
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,940
Then aim to move up to legal specialist.

653
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,820
Yue,

654
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,620
let's start fresh.

655
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,020
I'll get to work now.

656
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,100
This stack is for you.

657
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,140
Take what you need.

658
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,500
She's the new assistant?

659
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,340
Didn't Boss say
he didn't want an assistant?

660
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,060
Must be a connection.

661
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,540
No way.

662
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,740
Come in.

663
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,500
Director.

664
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,570
This is the contract just came
from the Procurement Department.

665
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,900
- Take a look.
- Thanks.

666
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,580
I'm getting back to work.

667
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,340
(Technical Equipment
Procurement Project Contract)

668
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,300
(Yaofeng Tech)

669
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,740
(Yaofeng Technology Co., Ltd.
Representative: Yang Qing)

670
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,100
(Yaofeng Tech?)

671
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,940
Have some water.

672
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,860
Thank you.

673
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,300
Mr. Hu,

674
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,500
I came today

675
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,020
mainly to talk

676
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,100
about this contract.

677
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,740
Let's not rush into it just yet.

678
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,420
No rush, no rush.

679
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,500
Yaofeng and Zhongzhi
are old partners, after all.

680
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,340
And besides,

681
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,580
Mr. Chen,

682
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,060
you wouldn't delay me, would you?

683
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,620
When Zhang was here,

684
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,980
it only took one word from me

685
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,460
to get things done.

686
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,340
But now that he's gone,

687
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,100
we've got a new
legal department director.

688
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,980
What's his name?

689
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,650
I'm not too familiar with him yet.

690
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,140
Can't quite figure him out.

691
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,810
So

692
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,180
why don't we have dinner together

693
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,030
to get to know each other?

694
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,300
The usual rules.

695
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,100
The usual spot.

696
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,540
Here, Director Qin,

697
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,460
this way.

698
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,820
Mr. Chen, I can't stay too long today.

699
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,220
I have other matters later.

700
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,220
Director Qin, you're already here.

701
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,540
Everyone's waiting for you.

702
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,700
Everyone?

703
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,340
All familiar people.

704
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,870
Our long-term

705
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,420
strategic partners.

706
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,980
I told them

707
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,260
I have high hopes for you.

708
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,260
Because

709
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,660
you are the rising star

710
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,380
of our Legal Department.

711
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,260
Please.

712
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,660
I'm free these days.

713
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,140
It depends on your schedule.

714
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,460
Let me know in advance
once you decide,

715
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,300
and we can book the room
ahead of time.

716
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,740
Mr. Hu, Manager Tian,

717
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,930
sorry to keep you waiting.

718
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,060
Let me introduce you.

719
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,440
This is

720
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,620
the director of Legal Department,

721
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,900
Qin Can.

722
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,260
(Qin Can)
I'm Mr. Song's attorney,

723
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,500
Qin Can.

724
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,740
Hu Cheng from Yaofeng Tech.

725
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,340
And this is

726
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,340
Hu Cheng, founder of Yaofeng Tech.

727
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,020
Mr. Hu, we meet again.

728
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,220
You two

729
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,420
know each other?

730
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,140
Not only do we know each other,

731
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,900
but Mr. Hu also taught me
a very important lesson.

732
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,740
We're all old friends here.

733
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,140
Knowing each other
makes things easier.

734
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,100
Lawyer Qin,

735
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,500
we really seem to have a connection.

736
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,340
Now

737
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,220
you've joined Zhongzhi?

738
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,620
You advised me
to change careers before,

739
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,500
but I didn't agree.

740
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,940
Looking at it now,

741
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,940
since I'm working
with Mr. Hu anyway,

742
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,100
I might as well choose

743
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,900
a more comfortable
environment for myself.

744
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,220
Lawyer Qin,

745
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,580
you're like gold.

746
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,260
You'll shine wherever you go.

747
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,300
Mr. Hu,

748
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,460
I'm not a lawyer anymore.

749
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,140
Since we're all old friends,

750
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,460
let's skip the formalities.

751
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,940
Let's sit, eat,

752
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,230
and catch up properly.

753
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,420
- Come on, let's sit.
- Okay.

754
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,620
I won't eat.

755
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,780
Mr. Chen, don't worry.

756
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,260
I'll handle Mr. Hu's project

757
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,740
carefully

758
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,300
and won't let anything slide.

759
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,140
Take your time eating.

760
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,100
I'll take my leave first.

761
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,340
It's already dinnertime.

762
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,300
Wait, wait.

763
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,580
I'll walk you out, Director Qin.

764
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,380
I'll take care of it.

765
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,860
Director Qin, wait.

766
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,020
Director Qin,

767
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,060
is there any bad blood

768
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,900
between you and Mr. Hu?

769
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,860
No.

770
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,980
That's good to hear.

771
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,500
Go ahead and get busy.

772
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,940
Next time, let's set aside some time

773
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,260
to discuss

774
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,980
how to expedite

775
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,380
this contract process.

776
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,020
I'm always thinking about
the company's best interests.

777
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,260
Don't worry, Mr. Chen.

778
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,860
I'll prioritize

779
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,180
the company's interests.

780
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,900
See? We're on the same page.

781
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,180
Take care, take care.

782
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,140
Leave a margin for others,

783
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,580
so you can meet again.

784
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,020
Caught in his hands, huh?

785
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,660
Whose side are you on?

786
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,580
I'm on whoever treats me well.

787
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,820
Alright,

788
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,140
such a greenhorn

789
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,780
won't trouble our Mr. Hu.

790
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,300
You're a sly fox.

791
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,220
Nothing can stump you.

792
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,420
Don't be angry.

793
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,060
Don't be angry.

794
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,380
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

795
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,820
- Bye-bye, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

796
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,180
Ziyuan!

797
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,420
Sorry.

798
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,100
Mommy!

799
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,580
Good boy.

800
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,380
Mommy, you finally came!

801
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,180
I'm sorry, Mommy was late.

802
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,220
Ziyuan's mom,

803
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,420
have you

804
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,340
started working?

805
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,220
Yes, I've just started,
and I'm still adjusting.

806
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,220
I'm really sorry.

807
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,260
I hurried as much as I could.

808
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,340
It's fine.

809
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,740
We just finished school,

810
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,640
and the kids who are still here
can keep playing for a while.

811
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,820
- Thank you.
- It's fine.

812
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,640
Ziyuan, you need to be more
understanding of your mom.

813
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,220
She works really hard.

814
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,740
I know, teacher.

815
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,260
When Dad gets home tired,
he doesn't do housework.

816
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,100
Mom doesn't have to do it today either.

817
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,100
If Mom doesn't cook,

818
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,500
what will you eat?

819
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,860
I'll treat Mom to dinner.

820
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,980
You'll treat Mom?

821
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,060
Where did you get the money?

822
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,540
I want to be like Dad
and make lots of money

823
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,660
to treat Mom to dinner.

824
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,100
Ziyuan,

825
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,900
Mom doesn't need you
to make lots of money.

826
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,620
Mom only needs you

827
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,460
to be healthy

828
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,540
and happy,

829
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,420
okay?

830
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,500
Okay, Mom.

831
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,820
But

832
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,060
Dad said that

833
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,980
a man must make lots of money

834
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,420
to protect his family.

835
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,540
Protecting your family

836
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,380
isn't just about making money.

837
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,100
There are many ways to do it.

838
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,620
The most important thing

839
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,820
is to be honest and kind

840
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,220
to your family.

841
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,820
I understand, Mom.

842
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,220
What's with this long list

843
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,460
of penalties?

844
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,980
Since when has Yaofeng signed

845
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,580
such unfair contracts?

846
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,740
Of course, delete them all.

847
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,140
Do you even need to ask?

848
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,480
Who's the legal expert here,

849
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,820
you or me?

850
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,780
If not, just give me your salary

851
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,900
and quit!

852
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,620
Dad,

853
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,780
don't be mad.

854
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,140
I'm not mad.

855
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,150
I'm just frustrated
with my subordinate.

856
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,300
Being so incompetent,
yet still getting paid so much.

857
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,420
Making money has become
way too easy for them.

858
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,740
Dad,

859
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,300
the most important thing
for a man isn't making money.

860
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,820
Then what is it?

861
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,740
It's being honest.

862
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,420
Who told you that?

863
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,660
I did.

864
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,180
Is it wrong?

865
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
How will we live if there's no money?

866
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,620
Hello,

867
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,020
did you get it done?

868
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,700
Sure, I told you to delete them.

869
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,180
Have the soup.

870
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,340
Still up?

871
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,860
I'm waiting for you.

872
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,260
Honey, I've had lots of things going on.

873
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,340
It's annoying.

874
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,140
Honey, I wanted to talk to you

875
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,500
about my job.

876
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,580
Honey,

877
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,620
I'm really tired today.

878
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,260
Let's talk tomorrow.

879
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,940
Alright, get some rest.

880
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,700
By the way,

881
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,900
there's a big company event tomorrow.

882
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,980
I might come home late.

883
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,980
Don't wait up,

884
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,900
go to bed early.

885
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:36,580
(Yaofeng Tech
Appreciation Banquet)

886
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,860
I'll have Nie attend as well.

887
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,020
Tian Qiuzi should also be there.

888
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,060
Let's hope they can gather
some useful information.

889
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,220
Tell Nie

890
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,260
this is the last time.

891
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,060
I've almost finalized
the house purchase.

892
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,340
Next week, I'll sign the contract
and pay the deposit.

893
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,660
After that,

894
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,460
I'll formally file for divorce with him.

895
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,240
(Yaofeng Tech Appreciation Banquet)
Mr. Yao, Mr. Zhang,

896
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,100
thank you for coming.

897
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,660
Mr. Zhang, it seems
you're doing well financially.

898
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,260
Really?

899
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,160
Congratulations!

900
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,540
Mr. Zhang, you must
lead us to make big money!

901
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,540
Of course.

902
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,500
- Let's drink.
- This is more like it.

903
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,580
Director Tian,

904
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,820
long time no see.

905
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,090
You're here in a hurry, aren't you?

906
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,060
Yes.

907
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,260
Do we have
any new projects coming up?

908
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,820
Your red dress today looks stunning.

909
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,630
Let's make money together.

910
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,260
- Very elegant.
- Really? Thank you.

911
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,430
Here.

912
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,730
(Make a good speech later.)

913
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,050
(Don't forget to recommend me.)

914
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,620
Ning,

915
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,620
here are the professional
materials you needed.

916
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,300
I've got them prepared.

917
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,400
Thank you, Director.

918
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,100
I'll return them as soon as I'm done.

919
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:04,940
No need,

920
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,190
just keep them.

921
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,520
They're no use to me anyway.

922
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,460
Ning,

923
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,710
you and Qin

924
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,530
used to be my right-hand people.

925
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,100
Now you're both in new positions,

926
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,820
starting fresh.

927
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,060
It's not easy.

928
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,260
Director Qin is much more
capable than me now.

929
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,700
I can't compare.

930
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,780
Don't say that.

931
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,980
Do you know

932
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,820
how much he admired you back then?

933
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,580
You've been his inspiration and goal

934
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,700
for all these years.

935
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,940
Yue,

936
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,900
here's your file for the fieldwork.

937
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,580
Qin, on duty now.

938
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,420
Sure.

939
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,660
But now, seeing me like this,

940
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,620
he must be disappointed, right?

941
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,700
Not at all.

942
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,500
If it weren't for the severe illness

943
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,420
you had after childbirth,

944
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,380
things wouldn't have
turned out this way, right?

945
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,340
Director,

946
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,740
that day

947
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,580
you mentioned

948
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,460
after my maternity leave,

949
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,260
you had kept my position open for me.

950
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,100
Yes,

951
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,060
I kept it open for you all along.

952
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,200
But then your

953
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,180
severe postpartum depression

954
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,820
made it impossible for you to return.

955
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,380
I did experience

956
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,020
postpartum depression for a while,

957
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,100
but it wasn't very severe

958
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,540
or long-lasting.

959
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,660
How did you

960
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,770
hear about this?

961
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,980
Your husband told us.

962
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,340
My husband?

963
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,740
Did he also say

964
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,980
that I had severe postpartum depression

965
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,060
and violent tendencies,

966
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,500
and that I could

967
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,940
harm people around me,

968
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,100
including my child?

969
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,140
Yes, that's exactly what he said.

970
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,780
We've always thought highly of you

971
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,140
and wanted you to return.

972
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,220
To be cautious,

973
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,220
I even sent you a message on WeChat.

974
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,380
You replied,

975
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,340
saying you had no will to live

976
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,540
and didn't want to work anymore.

977
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,380
So, we couldn't do anything.

978
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,170
But I never

979
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,740
received your message.

980
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,180
That's impossible.

981
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,660
It must have been my husband

982
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,500
replying to you using my phone.

983
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,820
Your husband?

984
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,020
Why would he do that?

985
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,300
I'm not surprised at all.

986
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,120
This is exactly
the kind of thing he would do.
