00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,250
To be honest,

4
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,610
things like personal morality,

5
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,000
generally,

6
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,890
has nothing to do with work.

7
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,450
But in terms of public opinion,

8
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,480
it...

9
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,530
At that time, my words were a bit harsh.

10
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,970
But that was also for your future.

11
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,170
I didn't expect you

12
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,560
to just leave like that.

13
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,400
After all, the content of the letter,

14
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,520
we haven't completely...

15
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,130
I don't want to bring this up again.

16
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,290
That's fine.

17
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,480
Sorry for getting you wronged.

18
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,330
In the future, we must

19
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,450
eliminate this malicious competition.

20
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,130
Malicious competition?

21
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,290
What do you mean by that?

22
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,980
(Ruixin Investment Bank)

23
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,640
Manager Tian, what brings you here?

24
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,220
How dare you stabbed me in the back!

25
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,820
It's true that you're a mistress.

26
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,780
What does it have to do with you?

27
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,460
(Email)

28
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,870
He's the first one to arrive at work

29
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,030
and the last one to leave work.

30
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,660
He is very competitive.

31
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,260
That's right.

32
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,230
If it were me,

33
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,310
my uncle is the boss,

34
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,530
I would have already slacked off.

35
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,840
Anyway, whether I work or not,

36
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,230
the company will pay me.

37
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,210
We're different, though.

38
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,380
Now I announce that

39
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,140
regardless of work performance

40
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,340
and the quality of work,

41
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,420
those who are among the best performers

42
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,700
are Zhao Hua's group.

43
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,260
- Bravo!
- And

44
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,020
Lin Zhi's group.

45
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,340
Everyone should take them as examples

46
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,980
to create better results for the team.

47
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,220
Zhao Hua.

48
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,220
You're so great!

49
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,620
Mom.

50
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,220
Have you eaten?

51
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,220
I'm eating right now.

52
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,220
I just ordered takeout.

53
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,740
Braised pork.

54
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,490
Your dad said to me a few days ago

55
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,260
that you should eat less takeout

56
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,340
and try to learn to cook for yourself.

57
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,500
Or

58
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,020
let me teach you.

59
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,860
Mom,

60
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,220
I want to go home now.

61
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,140
You just started working and already miss home.

62
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,780
It's hard to take leave, right?

63
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,580
That's not what I meant.

64
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,050
I want to say,

65
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,340
I want to quit.

66
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,920
Zibo,

67
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,780
my surgery

68
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,340
is scheduled to be done next month.

69
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,780
Isn't it the end of the year?

70
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,260
Your uncle found a connection.

71
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,460
The hospitalization fees and surgery fees

72
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,340
will be covered by your uncle.

73
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,020
And also,

74
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,580
about your sister's wedding,

75
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,340
after your uncle knew it later,

76
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,100
he paid the full amount for the house.

77
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,620
This way

78
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,100
this makes your sister feel so confident

79
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,580
at her in-laws'.

80
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,700
Who would dare to bully her?

81
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,820
Your uncle's help

82
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,660
to our family is really significant.

83
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,460
He is your biological uncle.

84
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,340
It's nothing to suffer a little grievance.

85
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,020
Work well with him.

86
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,980
In the future,

87
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,020
you will definitely succeed.

88
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,260
Our family

89
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,020
all depends on you.

90
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,460
Ok, Mom, I understand.

91
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,380
Don't worry.

92
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,700
Do you know why our group

93
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,220
always can't get first place?

94
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,060
Why?

95
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,220
Avoid suspicion.

96
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,460
We are in the same group as him.

97
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,860
We really have bad luck.

98
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,740
With his relationship with the boss,

99
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,540
it would be good to casually spend time

100
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,100
in an insignificant department.

101
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,660
Why come here to cause trouble?

102
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,540
I didn't cause trouble.

103
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,780
- What did you say?
- I said I didn't cause trouble.

104
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,180
You did cause trouble.

105
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,020
Let's go.

106
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,780
Darn it!

107
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,060
Go.

108
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,350
Who do you think you are?

109
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,460
Don't fight.

110
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,540
Talk nicely.

111
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,610
Yeah.

112
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,460
When I was young, I was just like you.

113
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Unconfident.

114
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,100
Sensitive.

115
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,220
Concerned about others' opinions.

116
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,220
Impulsive fighting,

117
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,340
aside from proving your incompetence,

118
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,660
serves no purpose.

119
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,540
Winner makes the rules, you know?

120
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,780
If one day you succeed,

121
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,180
no one dares to point fingers at you.

122
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,260
So

123
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,060
you must be successful.

124
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,060
You must succeed by any means.

125
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,540
Hu Zibo, remember this.

126
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,300
We are a family.

127
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,180
Some things...

128
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,940
I will only trust you to do it.

129
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,820
You must not

130
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,260
let me down on my expectations of you.

131
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,420
I remember, Unc...

132
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,500
Mr. Hu.

133
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,340
Grandma,

134
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,900
are these all my sister's?

135
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,140
Yeah.

136
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,140
(Tian Qiuzi, Model Student)

137
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,180
She has been amazing since childhood.

138
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,180
Exactly.

139
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,820
Qiuzi has always been very competitive.

140
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,060
She's smart.

141
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,380
How did you teach her to be so smart

142
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,420
but me so stupid?

143
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,200
You're not stupid either.

144
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,900
It's great that you're happy every day.

145
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,940
Isn't my sister unhappy?

(Math exam answer sheet)

147
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,510
(Sis, not expect you to be so outstanding,)

148
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,910
(with excellent grades and so many awards.)

149
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,380
(Teachers and classmates must like you a lot.)

Tian Qiuzi! Tian Qiuzi! Tian Qiuzi!

151

Tian Qiuzi!

152
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,940
A top student actually falls in love.

153
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,180
Really impressive.

154
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,300
Falling in love, falling in love.

155
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,940
Let me tidy up your clothes too.

156
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,060
Here.

157
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,580
And the front.

158
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,920
Give me the backpack.

159
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,940
Aren't you a top student?

160
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,500
How could a top student fall in love?

161
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,900
How are you so amazing?

162
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,300
Nothing gets delayed.

163
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,220
Come here.

164
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,500
- Coward.
- What are you looking at?

165
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,540
Come here.

166
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,500
If you find another boyfriend,

167
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,260
find someone stronger.

168
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,660
Qiuzi,

169
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,420
why are you back so late?

170
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,660
Your parents came to see you.

171
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,740
Come with me.

172
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,180
This is my mom's home.

173
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,180
I want to come back

174
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,180
whenever I want.

175
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,420
You are so capable.

176
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,960
You even changed the child's surname.

177
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,300
Since she is not my family member,

178
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,580
why do you make my mom look after her?

179
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,780
Look. Look.

180
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,960
These are all Qiuzi's achievements.

181
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,500
Top ten in the whole grade every time.

182
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,730
No subject has been neglected.

183
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,780
Look at your precious daughter.

184
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,940
How great she is!

185
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,420
And you,

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,370
we only get to see you once in a while,

187
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,300
but you come back so late.

188
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,700
Look at you.

189
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,560
I didn't mean to, Dad.

190
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,000
Mom.

191
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,900
Mom.

192
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,180
Why are you still keeping this thing?

193
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,140
What a rubbish!

194
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,020
Others have discarded it,

195
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,380
but you treat it like a treasure.

196
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,940
You really let me down.

197
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,300
This is the birthday gift my dad gave me.

198
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,380
Your dad?

199
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,580
Then go live with your dad.

200
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:58,980
Mom...

208
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,780
I found the contract with Licheng Anping.

209
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,060
Do you know Yue seems

210
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,660
to have signed an outsourcing contract?

211
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,780
Why bother?

212
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,940
With her abilities,

213
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,820
she could definitely find another job.

214
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,540
I used to think she is quite shrewd.

215
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,890
Indeed,

216
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,140
one cannot stay at home for too long;

217
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,660
they become disconnected from society,

218
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,540
willingly being exploited and squeezed

219
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,580
by the company.

220
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,440
Indeed.

221
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,780
How could she sign...

222
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,300
What gossip are you talking about?

223
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,180
I have finished my work.

224
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,900
Me too. Boss, have one.

225
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,820
There's a new case.

226
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,260
Exploited,

227
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,140
squeezed.

228
00:14:59,090 --> 00:14:59,930
By the way,

229
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,700
about the matter of outsourcing Yue,

230
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,820
don't mention it outside for now.

231
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,700
After this month is over,

232
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,090
I'll find a way to make her a regular worker.

233
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,940
Did you hear that?

234
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,760
Thank you.

235
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,580
Do you feel

236
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,180
that the boss is particularly

237
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,400
concerned about Yue's situation?

238
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,700
You're really interested in others' gossip.

239
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,900
If I had gossips myself,

240
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,820
I would still be concerned.

241
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,280
Yue,

242
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,020
the boss is going too far.

243
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,380
He gave me so much extra work.

244
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,900
Do you want me to help you?

245
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,140
I've finished organizing, thanks.

246
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,540
Alright, you go ahead.

247
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,940
Don't you rest at noon?

248
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,420
No, I have something to do.

249
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,420
What's wrong?

250
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,940
I've finished organizing the contract.

251
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,300
I'm going to eat first.

252
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,620
Go ahead.

253
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,420
Yue doesn't

254
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,420
rest at noon.

255
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,820
How would I know?

256
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,700
Please help me make a copy of this.

257
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,140
Put them together in my office.

258
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,680
Again?

259
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,100
Yue.

260
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,180
I know what you've been doing these days

261
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,900
is not about the investigation.

262
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,780
But I haven't delayed

263
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,060
my own job.

264
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,260
Yes,

265
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,630
you've finished all your work.

266
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,900
I'm on the layoff list this time.

267
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,900
I think this is unfair.

268
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,940
It's not normal either.

269
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,700
I just want to figure out why.

270
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,700
Anyway,

271
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,820
I hope

272
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,620
you can do your job well

273
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,540
without being affected by personal matters.

274
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,420
But,

275
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,300
you absolutely cannot

276
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,740
do things that violate the law

277
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,860
and harm the company's interests.

278
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,940
Absolutely not.

279
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,380
You can rest assured.

280
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,940
We are a team.

281
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,700
I can help you

282
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,140
with anything you need.

283
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,780
Thank you.

284
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,340
Look at this.

285
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,820
Licheng Anping.

286
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,060
It mainly acts as an agent.

287
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,980
I found the contract that this company signed

288
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,140
with the Purchasing Department of Zhongzhi.

289
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,980
It was handled

290
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,780
by Chen Pingzhang, GM of the Purchasing Dept.

291
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,340
Strangely enough,

292
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,250
shortly after the contract was signed,

293
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,950
this company was deregistered.

294
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,100
There must be a problem here.

295
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,980
Can you still follow up on that?

296
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,060
I'll give it a try.

297
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,940
Hello? Mr. Mo.

298
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,100
Participate in the forum?

299
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,100
I have received the invitation letter.

300
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,220
(Please check the invitation letter.)

301
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,470
(Look forward to your arrival.)

302
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,320
Ok.

303
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,860
I arrange for Mr. Zhou to go over, ok?

304
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,460
You have to come in person.

305
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,460
What?

306
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,620
Sure.

307
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,420
I will definitely show respect to you.

308
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,740
Fine,

309
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,900
I will go.

310
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,460
I will attend in person.

311
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,240
Eat this.

312
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,140
After dinner, help me tidy up some clothes.

313
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,140
I need to go on a business trip.

314
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,140
Where are you going?

315
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,180
What?

316
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,040
Want to check which hotel I'm staying in?

317
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,420
The meal isn't finished yet.

318
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,150
Honey,

319
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,130
sit down.

320
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,140
Ziyuan,

321
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,140
after eating, I play Lego with you, ok?

322
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,220
Ok.

323
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,460
Eat.

324
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,140
Thank you, honey.

325
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,420
You're welcome.

326
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,460
How is the resignation process going?

327
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,940
Didn't I tell you

328
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,820
I will work until the end of this month?

329
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,300
A week.

330
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,780
And

331
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,380
you can't meet with that divorce lawyer.

332
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,620
I promised that I wouldn't cheat again.

333
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,660
What I say counts.

334
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
I hope you

335
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,620
don't meet with Mu Xiao again.

336
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,380
Do you think

337
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,860
only cheating hurts me?

338
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,700
What else is there?

339
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,860
I want to work.

340
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,020
I do not allow.

341
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,620
What right do you have to forbid it?

342
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,940
Aren't we supposed to start over?

343
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,580
I tried.

344
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,860
You tried too.

345
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,900
We all tried.

346
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,860
What about the results?

347
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,100
You have seen it.

348
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,860
We have already lost trust.

349
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,060
We can rebuild trust.

350
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,100
There were cracks long ago.

351
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,780
It's impossible to fix it no matter how we try.

352
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,660
I'm just about to go on a business trip.

353
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,140
For a week.

354
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,700
Wait for me to come back in a week.

355
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,100
I hope

356
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,020
you have already adjusted your mindset.

357
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,620
What if I can't adjust well?

358
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,860
Honey,

359
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,180
I believe

360
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,900
you can do it.

361
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,260
Hu Cheng,

362
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,820
when will you

363
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,420
truly learn

364
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,380
to have an equal conversation with me

365
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,300
and care about my needs?

366
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,620
I have always stood in your shoes

367
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,020
and tried to understand the equality you want.

368
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,620
But what did I get in return?

369
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,100
It's that you want to tear this family apart.

370
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,020
I'll never allow anyone to tear it apart.

371
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,180
No one can do it.

372
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,460
Hello, Mr. Hu.

373
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,780
Please get in the car first.

374
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,220
Hello, Mr. Hu.

375
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,620
Please.

376
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,900
Excuse me.

377
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,060
Are we heading to the hotel now?

378
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,620
As for the schedule, you can ask Miss Tian.

379
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,940
I'm not too clear about it either.

380
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,420
Mr. Mo originally arranged for everyone

381
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,440
to meet directly with the young entrepreneurs

382
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,440
and go hiking together.

383
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,460
I just explained this to Mr. Mo.

384
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,860
You are not aware of the arrangements.

385
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,700
You have no suitable equipment.

386
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,380
Then you head to the hotel to rest.

387
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,180
Thank you.

388
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,140
Hurry up.

389
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,100
Everyone else has gone ahead.

390
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,820
- All right.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

391
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,380
Do you want to take a break?

392
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,220
How about me carrying you?

393
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,220
No, no need.

394
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,620
Do you want to take a break?

395
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,140
There is a place to rest.

396
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,510
Keep walking up a bit more.

397
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,600
Come, come.

398
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,620
Let me help you.

399
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,110
Well, your stamina is much worse

400
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,700
than when we were studying abroad.

401
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,140
Definitely.

402
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,340
We were so young back then.

403
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,280
Just hang in there for a while.

404
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,460
What are you looking at?

405
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,300
- Is it ok to sit here?
- Ok.

406
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,380
Mr. Mo,

407
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,180
with your stamina,

408
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,900
you still want to go hiking with the young.

409
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,060
Aren't you just humiliating yourself?

410
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,900
I was doing that

411
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,420
for getting some vitality from the young.

412
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,420
Self-humiliation is an essential quality.

413
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,620
But,

414
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,100
with you around,

415
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,780
I just give up.

416
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,620
It's really hot.

417
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,220
Do you still love eating cold food now?

418
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,180
I like drinking cold drinks the most.

419
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,300
I've liked it since I was little.

420
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,620
Once we went hiking...

421
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,420
What happened then?

422
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,380
What treasure are you holding?

423
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,060
What is inside here?

424
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,700
Look.

425
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,200
I brought you

426
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,460
your favorite iced watermelon.

427
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,380
Come on. Hu Cheng carried a watermelon.

428
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,220
I can't believe it!

429
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,060
Come quickly.

430
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,060
He brought a watermelon here.

431
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,420
- Why drink water?
- What are you doing?

432
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,540
I brought it for Ms. Luo.

433
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,860
None of you can eat.

434
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,650
Only Ms. Luo can eat.

435
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,540
Is it?

436
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,300
(Bring the fridge to eat iced watermelon.)

437
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,140
What are you thinking about?

438
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Thinking of someone.

439
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,140
What kind of person makes you lost in thought?

440
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,700
An important person?

441
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,460
Not important.

442
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,860
A former employee of the company.

443
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,780
He's that kind of person

444
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,100
who is determined to climb up.

445
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,020
To flatter the boss,

446
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,860
he can do anything.

447
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,900
One year, our company

448
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,820
organized a mountain-climbing event.

449
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,860
He actually carried a fridge on his back

450
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,900
and climbed to the top of the mountain.

451
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,580
Carrying a refrigerator?

452
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,540
Car fridge.

453
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,700
Do you know what's in the fridge?

454
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,620
What is it?

455
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,620
Iced watermelon.

456
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,420
He knows I like to eat iced watermelon.

457
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,180
He specifically carried it all the way up.

458
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,700
I was quite touched at that moment.

459
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,140
(No need.)
Feel that he is very thoughtful

460
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,140
and can also endure hardships.

461
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,380
He's also strict with himself.

462
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,100
He can achieve success in the future.

463
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,780
Did you hear me?

464
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,180
I'm listening.

465
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,340
Iced watermelon.

466
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,820
Why are you laughing?

467
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,700
- Nothing.
- What are you laughing about?

468
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Nothing.

469
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,920
Come on.

470
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,100
I also remembered someone.

471
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,100
He is a business partner of mine.

472
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,820
He has always wanted me to invest.

473
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,780
I ignored him.

474
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,500
Later,

475
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,220
he knew I play games,

476
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,380
so he played games with me.

477
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,860
Two years.

478
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,060
He played games with me every day.

479
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,620
He didn't say anything about the investment.

480
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,540
I found out later

481
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,380
he never played games before.

482
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,300
Now he plays better than I do.

483
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,420
I admire this person greatly.

484
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,660
So did you invest in him?

485
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,500
Yes.

486
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,380
Definitely. The contract is in progress.

487
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,700
Mr. Mo,

488
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,300
as for such people,

489
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,660
you'd better be cautious.

490
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,780
No need. I'm not making friends with him.

491
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,820
What I value

492
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,060
is his ambition and ability.

493
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,180
To cooperate with such a person

494
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,000
who is determined to achieve his goals

495
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,940
at all costs, without hesitation,

496
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,340
for me,

497
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,180
it's worry-free and pleasant.

498
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,220
Why not?

499
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,460
You're right.

500
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,820
I have some matters to attend to.

501
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,940
What about

502
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,930
going down the mountain?

503
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,140
Anyway, you can't climb anymore.

504
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,380
I have to go back.

505
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,360
All right.

506
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,300
Let's go.

507
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,420
- Hello. I have a room reservation.
- Hello.

508
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,020
- Name.
- Tian Qiuzi.

509
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,030
Here we are.

510
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,700
Please stay.

511
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,740
No need to see me off.

512
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,140
Are you really not staying another day?

513
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,820
The forum will be very interesting.

514
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,380
Young people have a lot of ideas.

515
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,780
Don't you want to listen to them?

516
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,660
I wish you all the best for your event.

517
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,300
We're having a city marathon next month.

518
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,380
Aren't we meeting again?

519
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,770
I'm going. Bye.

520
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,910
Alright, bye.

521
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,540
Let's go.

522
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,220
I will inform you of the dinner time later.

523
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,060
Honey,

524
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,100
let's head back earlier.

525
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,500
Ms. Luo is such an outstanding woman.

526
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,580
But she chose you.

527
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,980
What abilities do you have?

528
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,860
Exactly.

529
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,370
Hu Cheng

530
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,260
has one merit

531
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,620
that no one can compare to him.

532
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,940
Hu listens to Ms. Luo more than anyone else.

533
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,340
That's right.

534
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,940
There is no second man in the world

535
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,320
like Hu Cheng who listens to women so well.

536
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,500
Exactly.

537
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,220
Honey,

538
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,340
drink less.

539
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,870
Don't drink.

540
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,620
Honey.

541
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,820
Let go!

542
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,540
I told you to move away.

543
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,540
(Forum Exchange Meeting
Sign-in Desk)

544
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,700
This way, please.

545
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,100

546
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,540
Hello, could you please sign here?

Ok.

548
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,060
After you.

549
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,140
Hello.

550
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,980
I am Hu Cheng from Yaofeng Tech.

551
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,460
Hello, Mr. Hu, could you please sign here?

552
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,300
Ok.

553
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,780
Are you looking for a friend?

554
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,860
May I ask if you have invited

555
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,060
people from Xunda Tech this time?

556
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,660
No.

557
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,580
Did you invite Ms. Luo?

558
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,500
The name?

559
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,180
Luo Yating.

560
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,300
It seems we didn't invite this person.

561
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,570
I may have mistaken the person.

562
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,300
(Contract No.)

563
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,420
Ma.

564
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,260
Yue.

565
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,940
What are you doing here?

566
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,620
Choosing clothes for your girlfriend?

567
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,620
I'm just browsing around.

568
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,100
That's great.

569
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,310
You can help me with something.

570
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,460
I'm picking a birthday gift for my mom.

571
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,500
I haven't finished yet.

572
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,060
Ziyuan is getting off school.

573
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,340
Can you help me pick up Ziyuan?

574
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,960
You know

575
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,690
how much Mr. Hu loves his son.

576
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,420
You should get along better with Ziyuan.

577
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,580
It's not bad for you.

578
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,790
Go quickly.

579
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,300
Thank you.

580
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,020
About your experience,

581
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,580
I really sympathize with you.

582
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,180
Make sure to remember what I just said.

583
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,860
What is most important for you right now

584
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,580
is to collect solid evidence.

585
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,140
The we discuss the situation later.

586
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,180
I won't take up your time.

587
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,460
Waiting for your call.

588
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
Thank you.

589
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,500
It's you.

590
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,540
Do you have hypoglycemia?

591
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,380
I have candy here.

592
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,340
Thank you.

593
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,420
Are you feeling better?

594
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,580
Much better.

595
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,380
Thank you for last time.

596
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,460
It's fine.

597
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,650
You go ahead. I'll leave first.

598
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,700
My client.

599
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,900
She came to consult a few questions.

600
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,860
Let's care

601
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,980
about our progress.

602
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,660
Right.

603
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,660
Take a look.

604
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,620
I found the company's process records

605
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,340
show that He Kuan from the Sales Department

606
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,220
also participated in this project,

607
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,060
but it was eventually signed

608
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,380
by Chen Pingzhang.

609
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,380
He Kuan

610
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,740
completely disappeared.

611
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,700
And he has

612
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,980
already resigned.

613
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,660
You suspect it?

614
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,260
Chen Pingzhang was very likely

615
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,420
to collaborate with the Sales Center

616
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,900
and invest in Hu Cheng

617
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,700
with the company's money.

618
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,740
Do you think

619
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,580
if Hu Cheng knows it?

620
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,620
I don't know.

621
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,460
But if the company continues the investigation,

622
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,900
they will definitely find Chen Pingzhang.

623
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,660
If...

624
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,740
If Hu Cheng is aware of it,

625
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,140
the risks and dangers are very high.

626
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,140
If something happens to him,

627
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,540
you and Ziyuan will both be implicated.

628
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,980
Do you still want to investigate further?

629
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,900
I just want to find out

630
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,860
where Hu Cheng transferred the money.

631
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,510
By the way,

632
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,780
can you help me look into Licheng Anping?

633
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,540
Come on, come on.

634
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,060
- Cheers to Mr. Hu.
- Cheers to Mr. Hu.

635
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,940
Here. Here.

636
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,940
- Drink well.
- Take it easy.

637
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,940
Be more positive today.

638
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,380
- Definitely.
- Eating together

639
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,420
is not easy.

640
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,320
Isn't it?

641
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,620
- Exactly.
- Yes, yes, yes.

642
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,460
Come on.

643
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,980
(Mr. Hu, Yue went shopping today.)

644
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,620
Really good. Let's do it again later.

645
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,540
- Drink.
- Come on.

646
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,780
Come on, come on.

647
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,380
- Come on.
- Pour more.

648
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,220
In this kind of situation,

649
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,100
the more people, the livelier it gets.

650
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,340
It's ok.

651
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,220
Let's raise a glass. Come on.

652
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,420
Come on, come on.

653
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,180
- Come.
- Mr. Hu, Mr. Hu.

654
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,940
Sit down. Don't just stand there.

655
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,500
After finishing this cup, let's sit down.

656
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,380
Haven't finished drinking yet.

657
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,940
(Woman)

658
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,580
I have sent you the schedule.

659
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,740
Please rest early today.

660
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,880
Can he satisfy you?

661
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,120
I'm talking about your boyfriend.

662
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,570
Didn't you dislike such weak men?

663
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,620
Mr. Hu,

664
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,700
you drank too much, right?

665
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,140
Does he know

666
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,740
that you have been a mistress before?
