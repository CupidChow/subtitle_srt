(Tian Qiuzi)

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,630
Cheng,

6
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
what brings you here?

7
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,470
Why don't you go in?

8
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,910
Mrs. Zhou,

9
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,630
let Wei take a good rest.

10
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,350
I just

11
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,000
came to see him.

12
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,840
Yue came by this morning.

13
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,320
I was thinking

14
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,320
why you didn't come together.

15
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,600
You guys

16
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,840
haven't made up yet?

17
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,560
It's ok.

18
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,070
We just had some small disagreements.

19
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,720
It will be fine after a while.

20
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,070
Don't let him worry about me.

21
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,350
Let him cooperate with the doctor.

22
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,030
Cheng,

23
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,070
if you have anything to do, then go ahead.

24
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,950
I'm here with him.

25
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,280
Fine.

26
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,750
Cheng,

27
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,470
take good care of the company.

28
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,720
Don't wait until I'm discharged

29
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,230
to help you clean up the mess.

30
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,600
Wei,

31
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,180
don't worry.

32
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,990
I will handle it well.

33
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,680
Mr. Mo.

34
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,200
Mr. Mo, look,

35
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,200
Mr. Hu is indeed not here.

36
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,310
Mr. Mo,

37
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,520
I have already told him we are coming over.

38
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,430
However, we are visiting suddenly.

39
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,350
How about waiting for him in another place?

40
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,600
I'll go prepare now.

41
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,350
Just wait here.

42
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,350
Do you think this place looks

43
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,840
like a company about to go public?

44
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,910
Maybe Mr. Hu has encountered

45
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,520
some other tricky issues.

46
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,600
For example?

47
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,910
Bribery and corruption,

48
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,280
misappropriation of company funds.

49
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,860
I've heard that these matters

50
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,340
have nothing to do with Mr. Hu.

51
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,420
And you know Mr. Hu's capabilities.

52
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,460
I believe the company will

53
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,780
get back on track very soon.

54
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,300
The only thing

55
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
worth me staying awake for now

56
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,460
is asking myself

57
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,020
whether I might be misjudging someone.

58
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,020
These documents are already

59
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,260
half a month old,

60
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,260
and he hasn't read them.

61
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,140
When do you think he can get back on track?

62
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,140
Mr. Mo,

63
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,540
I didn't know you would come.

64
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,540
Please sit down.

65
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,460
Have a seat.

66
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,540
Why didn't you serve tea to Mr. Mo?

67
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,820
Forget it.

68
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,420
Chen Pingzhang

69
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,780
misappropriated the company funds.

70
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,620
You know?

71
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,580
This person

72
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,620
has always been a bit shady.

73
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,460
Getting exposed was just a matter of time.

74
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,100
You know him so well.

75
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,240
Why do you still cooperate with him?

76
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,140
He said that's personal investment.

77
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,700
I don't need

78
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,900
to investigate thoroughly

79
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,740
his source of funds, do I?

80
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,740
Mr. Mo,

81
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,300
Chen Pingzhang

82
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,460
embezzled the company funds to invest.

83
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,460
I had no clue

84
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,540
about this matter beforehand.

85
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,980
It's fortunate that the amount isn't too big.

86
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,060
I've already returned his money.

87
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,380
Look at here.

88
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,860
What a mess!

89
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,780
I have indeed been delayed by some matters.

90
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,820
But you can rest assured.

91
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,460
It definitely won't affect our schedule.

92
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,860
I understand

93
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,940
you have concerns in your heart.

94
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's take this opportunity to clarify things,

95
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,100
so it won't affect our cooperation.

96
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,380
Sorry to interrupt.

97
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,580
What do some matter you just said

98
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,100
refer to?

99
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,940
In front of everyone's eyes,

100
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,590
you hit your wife

101
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,620
and were detained.

102
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,220
Does that count?

103
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,980
You don't have to look at her.

104
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,620
It doesn't matter how I know.

105
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,260
Mr. Mo,

106
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,900
there is a misunderstanding.

107
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,220
It is not what you see.

108
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,180
Besides, it is my family matter.

109
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,820
It will not affect the company at all.

110
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,220
I don't intend to interfere you.

111
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,620
It doesn't matter how I see it.

112
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,390
But what matters is

113
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,020
that your image

114
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,700
will be directly linked to the stock price.

115
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,300
A leader of a company about to go public

116
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,620
did such a thing

117
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,820
at this critical moment.

118
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,940
How should I view our future?

119
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,700
I understand.

120
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,580
I should get a good night's sleep.

121
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,340
I haven't slept for three days.

122
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,740
Then

123
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,060
let's have

124
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,020
Qiuzi

125
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,820
handle the contract termination.

126
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,650
I'm coming down. Come pick me up.

127
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,570
Mr. Mo, I...

128
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,670
I...

129
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,300
You don't have to send me off.

130
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,220
It's fine.

131
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,820
This road is not feasible,

132
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,100
so we will think of other ways.

133
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,420
(Summons
Divorce Dispute)

134
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,620
They actually teamed up to target me.

135
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,660
What did I do wrong?

136
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,600
I did nothing wrong.

137
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,660
(Summons Divorce Dispute
Hu Cheng)

138
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,940
It's not your fault.

139
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
It's her fault.

140
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,980
She did something wrong.

141
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,220
She is ungrateful.

142
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,540
It's all their fault.

143
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,900
As long as we get through,

144
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,660
things will definitely get better.

145
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,340
I will always be by your side.

146
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,780
Hu Cheng,

147
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,660
you are invincible

148
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,780
and unbeatable.

149
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,140
They can't bring me down.

150
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,460
Without me,

151
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,220
they are nothing.

152
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,900
Yes,

153
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,140
they are nothing.

154
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,020
Mr. Xu,

155
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,900
here.

156
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,740
- Hello.
- Have a seat.

157
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,740
Sit down.

158
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,500
Don't be so constrained.

159
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,180
Mr. Xu, you called me out this time.

160
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,300
Is there something going on?

161
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,560
Take it slow.

162
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,780
You will definitely recover.

163
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,260
The police are investigating

164
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,900
the causing-trouble vehicle.

165
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,580
You can rest assured.

166
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,500
It's just a matter of time.

167
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,180
I will definitely make Hu Cheng

168
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,700
pay the price.

169
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,350
Don't worry about me.

170
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,410
The court has

171
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,060
filed the case.

172
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,460
Hu Cheng

173
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,100
also received a copy of the complaint.

174
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,780
Before the court opens,

175
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,740
I will definitely be prepared

176
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,020
to leave him no way out.

177
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,260
Rest well.

178
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,900
Yue,

179
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,180
I have reported

180
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,540
and frozen the account of that club.

181
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,660
You can rest assured.

182
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,300
The money is no longer accessible to Hu Cheng.

183
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,580
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

184
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,860
By the way, there's one more thing.

185
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,020
Before Mu. Mu had the accident,

186
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,260
she asked me to investigate who is

187
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,340
behind the legal person of Mingdu Club.

188
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,180
Is it Hu Cheng?

189
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,680
No.

190
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,660
It's Ruan Meiying.

191
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,260
I know.

192
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,100
I'm safe here.

193
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,500
Don't worry.

194
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,740
Alright, I'll hang up now.

195
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,540
How is it going?

196
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,740
Recently,

197
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,460
are you getting used to living here?

198
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,200
Your ex-husband

199
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,900
shouldn't have bothered you, right?

200
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,660
I am safe, thank you.

201
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,300
It's quite coincidental.

202
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,940
I have been investigating a person.

203
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,940
That person is from the same hometown as you.

204
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,180
Your town

205
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,220
is not large.

206
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,420
He knows quite a bit about you.

207
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,780
He told me,

208
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,260
besides your ex-husband,

209
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,190
you have another unforgettable love.

210
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,660
Why did you inquire about my privacy?

211
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,060
Because within your privacy,

212
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,460
there is me.

213
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,620
You already know it all.

214
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,260
The person who helps Hu Cheng hide money

215
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,430
is you.

216
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,460
What's wrong with you? Are you ok?

217
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,860
- I have candy.
- It's ok.

218
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,700
Mom!

219
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,460
Ziyuan.

220
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,180
Mom. Mom.

221
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,310
You really came early today.

222
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,380
It's you who is late today.

223
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,460
Little boy.

224
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,300
Here.

225
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,700
If you need anything, just call me.

226
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,820
Thank you.

227
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,680
It's ok.

228
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,580
I really don't know

229
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,700
she has nowhere to go.

230
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,300
She is quite pitiful.

231
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,140
Yes.

232
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,300
Pretty pitiful.

233
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,900
Hello? It's me.

234
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,500
I need some money.

235
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,260
Got it.

236
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,670
We attended middle school,

237
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,990
and high school together.

238
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,540
He got into a university in the city later.

239
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,740
I didn't get accepted.

240
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,860
At that time, my conditions were not good.

241
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,620
His family's conditions were even worse.

242
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,260
But he said

243
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,660
after graduating from college,

244
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,500
he came back to find a stable job

245
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,020
and then we got married.

246
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,020
So I took a part-time job

247
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,700
to help support the family

248
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,420
and send him tuition fees,

249
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,340
living expenses...

250
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,220
As we spent more time apart,

251
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
the contact with each other decreased.

252
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,660
After graduation, he said

253
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,060
there were more opportunities in cities.

254
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,860
He never came back after that.

255
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,700
Hu Cheng!

256
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,740
Hu Cheng!

257
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,620
Hu Cheng!

258
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,620
A few years later, I heard from others

259
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,340
he built a new house for his parents.

260
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,860
Even so,

261
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,620
he didn't come back to see me.

262
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,060
Later, we each got married.

263
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,020
About my part of the story,

264
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,900
I have already told

265
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,100
you and Ms. Mu.

266
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,460
I did not lie.

267
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,300
As for him,

268
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,780
he is successful in his career

269
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,180
and has a happy family.

270
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,780
I came to this city to work three years ago

271
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,540
and bumped into him by chance.

272
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,660
I didn't mean to disturb his happiness.

273
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,820
He may feel that he abandoned me back then,

274
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,860
so he has been compensating me.

275
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,940
He used to treat you like that.

276
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,220
That is treachery.

277
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,060
And now

278
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,660
he is taking advantage of your weakness.

279
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,550
Maybe.

280
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,060
We are not in that kind of relationship

281
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,860
as you said.

282
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,860
We simply help each other

283
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,100
and make use of each other.

284
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,860
He gives me a portion of money regularly

285
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,260
and help me economically.

286
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,300
I help him keep some secrets.

287
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,020
For example,

288
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,540
his properties

289
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,820
that he doesn't want his wife to know.

290
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,740
You're committing a crime.

291
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,420
You don't have to scare me.

292
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,300
I don't understand those.

293
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,700
But I believe him.

294
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,940
He is very shrewd.

295
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,500
He won't leave any handles.

296
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,180
If you find evidence today,

297
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,100
you wouldn't come here to look for me.

298
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,260
If you want to report it to the police,

299
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,620
I will transfer the money immediately.

300
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,900
Even if they catch me,

301
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,460
you won't get a single cent of it.

302
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,260
What exactly did he promise you?

303
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,620
Do you trust him this much?

304
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,820
He said he would always take care of me,

305
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,660
and not let me worry about food and clothing.

306
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,100
So are you willing

307
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,100
to live in days

308
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
where you can never see the light

309
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,100
and you don't have dignity all?

310
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:17,980
Dignity?

311
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,860
You know what?

312
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,260
If he hadn't helped me,

313
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,300
I would still be suffering at my in-laws.

314
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,900
Is that kind of life dignified?

315
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,340
Mingdu Club's accounts are under investigation.

316
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,780
I only know that it is part of all his assets.

317
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,660
Where is the rest?

318
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,540
I won't betray Hu Cheng.

319
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,060
Those who betray him

320
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,500
end up badly.

321
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,820
I really hope

322
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,020
you're not that cowardly.

323
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,660
You should have a hard time too.

324
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,220
I believe you about the story

325
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,300
that you told me regarding you

326
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,460
and your ex-husband.

327
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,700
So you can still continue to live here.

328
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,060
But I hope you can think clearly

329
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,240
how you want

330
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,740
to live your later half of life.

331
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,500
(Financing Contract)

332
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,060
Mr. Hu,

333
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,500
you want to meet me?

334
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,620
Were these contracts signed by you?

335
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,900
I heard

336
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,700
that your company has recently

337
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,940
encountered a small issue.

338
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,860
Let me tell you, Zibo.

339
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,420
At this time,

340
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,180
whether you can help your uncle

341
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,620
get through this difficult time

342
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,460
is up to you.

343
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,500
Yes.

344
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,780
They were signed by me.

345
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,940
Don't get too close to that Xu.

346
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,460
But Mr. Xu is helping us get through.

347
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,060
I don't see anything wrong with that.

348
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,900
Who?

349
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,140
Help us?

350
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,620
I tell you not

351
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,440
to consider someone a good person

352
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,800
just because he said some nice words to you.

353
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,020
The money that Mr. Xu

354
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,500
uses to invest

355
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,660
has questionable origins.

356
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,620
We can't cooperate

357
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,460
with someone who is dishonest.

358
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,900
Find a way to terminate this contract.

359
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,460
Even if we have to lose some money.

360
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,900
Uncle,

361
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,860
this is not like what you usually say.

362
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,220
What did I say?

363
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,620
Didn't you also contact

364
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,620
with Mr. Chen?

365
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,020
Is he clean-handed?

366
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,660
I did not cooperate with Chen Pingzhang.

367
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,460
There is no contract.

368
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,700
Once he gets into trouble,

369
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,900
I just need to pay back the money.

370
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,300
I am just clean.

371
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,620
No contract means

372
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,460
no evidence.

373
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,340
Uncle, you are really impressive.

374
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,060
Don't make me point it out for you.

375
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,660
Who helped them approve the bid?

376
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,260
Do you still want to go public?

377
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,140
It's not up to you.

378
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,580
We are going through continuous turmoil.

379
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,420
Many companies

380
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,900
plan to withdraw investment.

381
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,700
Mr. Xu is helping us out of trouble.

382
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,700
With his help,

383
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,260
going public should be no problem.

384
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,940
Let me tell you,

385
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,700
I won't do business with this person.

386
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,860
Put the matter of going public aside

387
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,100
and discuss it when Mr. Zhou returns.

388
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,540
You

389
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,260
don't worry about this matter anymore.

390
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
It's a matter of a single breath now.

391
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,940
If you delay any longer,

392
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,460
then you might as well not go public

393
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,300
and go home...

394
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,460
Darn it!

395
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,060
How dare you!

396
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,260
Just one last step.

397
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,820
Anyway, we must succeed.

398
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,660
The winner takes all.

399
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,900
You taught me this.

400
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,260
(Haikang Hospital)

401
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,900
I really didn't expect

402
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,540
that it's actually Ruan Meiying.

403
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,260
So it was intentional for her

404
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,740
to approach us back then.

405
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,500
The reason Hu Cheng believes in Ruan Meiying

406
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,260
is that he thinks

407
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,260
Ruan Meiying

408
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,460
is helpless in this world

409
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,860
and has no other choices or way out.

410
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,420
If she leaves Hu Cheng,

411
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,260
she can't possibly survive.

412
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,980
So Hu Cheng thinks

413
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,020
that Ruan Meiying's place is the safest.

414
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,940
Hand this over to the Finance Dept.

415
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,940
Transfer all the money from these accounts

416
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,340
to the company's account.

417
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,880
Mr. Hu, this is...

418
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,920
This is my personal account's money.

419
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,660
The projects still need to be continued.

420
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,540
Everyone's bonuses and red envelopes

421
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,620
cannot be missed.

422
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,900
Don't let the employees worry.

423
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,270
Ok, Mr. Hu.

424
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,050
Wei,

425
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,300
the company will get better.

426
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,120
But I always have a strange feeling.

427
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,010
Why did Ruan Meiying

428
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,540
tried to get close

429
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,270
to you and me?

430
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,820
Even though her ex-husband

431
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,820
found her again,

432
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,820
she can use the money given by Hu Cheng

433
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,100
to rent another place.

434
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,350
Why did she have to get close to me

435
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,950
and let me help her?

436
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,610
Don't you think it's strange?

437
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,420
Oh no.

438
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,060
I need to go to the service station.

439
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,900
What's wrong?

440
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,340
I'll tell you when I get back.

441
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,700
Tell you later.

442
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,900
Ms. Xia.

443
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,460
Where is Ruan Meiying?

444
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,020
I was just looking for you.

445
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,860
This morning, our station's account

446
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,420
suddenly received a lot of money.

447
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,460
It's specially noted that it is for you.

448
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,340
Do you know what's going on?

449
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,060
Do not tell anyone about this matter.

450
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,620
I will definitely handle it well, ok?

451
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,460
Trust me.

452
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,330
That account

453
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,620
is not the one

454
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,140
that Mr. Hu sponsored to us before.

455
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,700
Fine. Let's go find Ruan Meiying first.

456
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,660
Ok.

457
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,140
Ruan said the day before yesterday

458
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,500
she has found a new place to live.

459
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,540
Don't you know?

460
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,220
Besides saying this,

461
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,500
what else did she say?

462
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,340
She thanked me

463
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,860
and you for our care.

464
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,920
She also said she will move to another city

465
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,820
and not come back.

466
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,260
You want to find her?

467
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,500
Let me help you give her a call.

468
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,180
Hello.

469
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,580
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

470
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,420
Sorry...

471
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,100
What happened?

472
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,140
She didn't trick you, did she?

473
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,580
She tricked everyone.

474
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,700
Let me help you with your backpack.

475
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,640
Ms.

476
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,730
My mom said

477
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,620
you just moved to a new home.

478
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,840
This little flower is for you.

479
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,060
It's really beautiful.

480
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,290
Is it beautiful?

481
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,370
It is beautiful.

482
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,220
Thank you, Ziyuan.

483
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,260
I also have something for you.

484
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,660
What is it?

485
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,180
An airplane.

486
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,060
Do you like it?

487
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,740
I like it.

488
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,060
I heard your dad say

489
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,020
you like planes very much.

490
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,300
Ms.

491
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,460
Do you know my dad?

492
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,420
A long, long time ago,

493
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,940
your dad said

494
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,300
he would take me to ride on a big plane.

495
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,930
Have you guys

496
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,100
gotten on the plane later?

497
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,820
My dad often takes me on airplanes.

498
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,820
Really impressive.

499
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,060
Mr. Hu.

500
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,180
The Finance Department said

501
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,300
there is no money left in these accounts.

502
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,380
What?

503
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,100
Impossible!

504
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,580
I said the same thing.

505
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,540
But he said

506
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,460
he has already confirmed it several times.

507
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,500
Hello.

508
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,650
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

509
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,640
Sorry...

510
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,860
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

511
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,810
This is impossible!

512
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,860
This is impossible!

513
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,460
Mr. Hu, you have a package.

514
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,060
(Express Delivery)

515
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,100
Sorry.

516
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,900
Ms. Li.

517
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,900
Mrs. Hu.

518
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,960
I came to pick up Ziyuan.

519
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,700
Didn't you trust a friend to pick Ziyuan up?

520
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,540
Thank you.

521
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,340
Hello.

522
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,700
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

523
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,580
Sorry...

524
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,620
Where is my son?

525
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,740
Hu Ziyuan is a very cute little friend.

526
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,700
I like him very much.

527
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,020
Where's my son?

528
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,020
Tell me where my son is.

529
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,860
Mom.

530
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,100
Ziyuan.

531
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,100
Mom.

532
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
Let me take a look at you.

533
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,940
Is everything ok?

534
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,900
Is everything ok?

535
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,860
You scared me to death.

536
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,300
Ziyuan, you scared me to death.

537
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,820
Mom, are you ok?

538
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,700
I'm fine.

539
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,020
Are you all right?

540
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,820
Where are you?

541
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,180
Hu Cheng's company ran into problems.

542
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,860
I don't plan to pay him back that money.

543
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,420
But we have no grievances against each other.

544
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,620
I will leave the money

545
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,860
that belongs to you.

546
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,020
Ning Yue.

547
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,500
I approached you and Ziyuan on purpose.

548
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,100
Three years ago,

549
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,740
I ran into Hu Cheng by chance.

550
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,420
He is so successful,

551
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,060
so happy.

552
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,580
He has you

553
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,260
and Ziyuan,

554
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,820
and so much money.

555
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,660
But after

556
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,660
being abandoned by him,

557
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,740
I became the laughingstock of everyone.

558
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,740
I was forced to marry my ex-husband.

559
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,700
I could have had a child.

560
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,100
But I unexpectedly miscarried.

561
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,500
This is all caused by Hu Cheng.

562
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,020
He should get his comeuppance.

563
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,820
I planned to take all of his possessions

564
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,020
and Ziyuan

565
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,900
and let him feel the pain I endured.

566
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,730
But

567
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,940
I really don't want to hurt you.

568
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,020
During the time I've spent with you,

569
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,860
you have been sincerely helping me.

570
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,580
I haven't been cared for a long time.

571
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,780
Thank you.

572
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,220
I'm leaving.

573
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,540
I won't come back again.

574
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,740
Please say goodbye to Hu Ziyuan

575
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,220
for me.

576
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,540
Take good care of him.

577
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,380
What's wrong, Mom?

578
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,260
Hello.

579
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,420
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

580
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,740
Hu Cheng,

581
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,020
I have been waiting for this moment.

582
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,980
From the day we reunited,

583
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,780
I have been looking forward to it.

584
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,660
When we reunited,

585
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,180
I'm living a tough life.

586
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,260
Not good.

587
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,580
You sympathize with me,

588
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,260
pity me,

589
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,500
and help me out of my predicament.

590
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,900
You think you are my savior,

591
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,020
right?

592
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,340
Hu Cheng,

593
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,060
do you remember?

594
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,260
Back when you were in college,

595
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,180
you needed money urgently.

596
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,940
I felt sorry for you

597
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,020
and saved up by cutting back on expenses

598
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,060
to gather 2000 yuan.

599
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,180
Later I found out

600
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,580
that you took this money to learn piano

601
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,420
to pursue the class beauty.

602
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,380
I supported you

603
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,980
to go to college,

604
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,580
hoping that after you graduate,

605
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,980
you would take me away from this place

606
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,820
to a better one.

607
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,690
As a result, you abandoned me.

608
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,920
I married someone whom I don't love

609
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,780
and fell

610
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,940
into an even more tragic situation.

611
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,980
But I don't blame them.

612
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,980
Because the culprit

613
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,660
is you.

614
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,340
Hu Cheng!

615
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,300
Hu Cheng!

616
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,580
We are childhood sweethearts.

617
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,420
Hu Cheng!

618
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,260
All my love

619
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,580
was given to you.

620
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,780
Do you think

621
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,380
I will keep vigil for you forever?

622
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,100
No.

623
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,500
I want you to taste what it feels like

624
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,540
to be betrayed by the one you trust the most.

625
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,700
Have you found a new job?

626
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,160
I heard

627
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,460
the Finance Department is also leaving.

628
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,460
Hello?

629
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,940
Mr. Fei,

630
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,090
I am Hu Cheng.

631
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,380
How have you been lately?

632
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,340
Do you have time tonight?

633
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,220
Let's gather together.

634
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:04,870
It's ok, it's ok.

635
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,940
I'll wait until you have time.

636
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,140
I'm fine with it.

637
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,740
Hello?

638
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,610
Hello?

639
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,340
Mr. Hu.

640
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,940
This is my resignation letter.

641
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,340
(Resignation Letter)

642
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,500
Here.

643
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,960
Buckle your seatbelt yourself.

644
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,020
Ok.

645
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,620
Hello?

646
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,140
Hello? Yue.

647
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,500
The police found the car that injured Ms. Mu.

648
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,340
It's a car from Yaofeng Tech.

649
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,320
Ok, I got it.

650
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,300
Uncle, it is a critical moment now.

651
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,300
Are you going to watch Yaofeng go bankrupt?

652
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,460
I have already clearly rejected Mr. Xu.

653
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,380
Don't bring this up again.

654
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,860
I am your nephew, not an outsider.

655
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,940
You don't need to put on an act in front of me.

656
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,340
Zibo,

657
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:40,410
I admit

658
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,820
I've never been a morally upright person.

659
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,820
I climbed up from the bottom,

660
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,300
struggling my way to where I am today.

661
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,540
I have faced countless dead ends

662
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,980
and have contemplated taking risks

663
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,300
many times.

664
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,020
But I hope you can understand a principle:

665
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,620
if a person can't resist temptation,

666
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,900
and uphold their bottom line,

667
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,380
they will take one wrong step after another

668
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,380
and eventually be consumed by darkness.

669
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,300
Uncle,

670
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,740
is it a bit late

671
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,860
to say that now?

672
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,540
It may be a bit late for me.

673
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,900
But it's still not too late for you.

674
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,700
I hope you can be a decent person.

675
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,700
Don't do things that will make you regret.

676
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,420
This is my heartfelt advice.

677
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,780
While you are with me,

678
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,580
I haven't taught you well.

679
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,700
This is my responsibility.

680
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,940
But what I want to tell you is

681
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,060
taking a gamble may yield benefits,

682
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,420
but if it's a path that risks everything,

683
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,900
you must not take it.

684
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,280
I can't turn back now.

685
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,600
What did you say?

686
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,980
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

687
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,820
The female lawyer...

688
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:36,910
What?

689
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,020
What female lawyer?

690
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,620
Mu Xiao.
