3
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,160
(My name is Ning Yue.)

4
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,510
(I'm an award-winning employee on the Wall of Honor,)

5
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,040
(a senior lawyer,)

6
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,950
(a courtroom champion who rarely loses,)

7
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,750
(and a rising star with a bright future in law.)

8
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,320
(The script of my life

9
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,720
was written for a powerful career woman.)

10
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,180
Honey.

11
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,060
My dear.

12
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,420
Wake up.

13
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,940
If you don't get up now, you'll be late.

14
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:48,800
Come on.

15
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,700
Get up.

16
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,100
Not fully awake.

17
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,500
Then sleep a little longer.

18
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,150
(But)

19
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,950
(that was me four years ago.)

20
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,380
(Now, it's the day-to-day trivialities)

21
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,920
(that have become my battlefield.)

22
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,560
Honey, Ziyuan,

23
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,820
breakfast is ready.

24
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,460
What's wrong?

25
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,540
This color

26
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,700
doesn't suit you at all.

27
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,620
Darker shades look better on you.

28
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,060
This house really can't do without you.

29
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Of course not.

30
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,460
(I take care of the home.)

31
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,960
(So that my husband, Hu Cheng,)

32
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,140
(can focus on his work.)

33
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,190
(Yaofeng Technology.)
(Yaofeng Technology that he established)

34
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,060
(has now become a unicorn.)

35
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,220
(In a way, that's another kind of victory)

36
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,740
(for me in this arena.)

37
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,500
Honey,

38
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,340
I'm ready.

39
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,580
Let's go.

40
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,340
What's this?

41
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,100
Naughty.

42
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,220
Dad. Mom.

43
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,820
I'm ready!

44
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,260
I want a hug, too!

45
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,060
Come here.

46
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,020
It's time to go to school.

47
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,860
Let's go.

48
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,100
(My friends say)

49
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,980
(giving up my career during its peak for family)

50
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,340
(is quite a pity.)

51
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,140
(How could it be?)

52
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,540
(Life)

53
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,940
(isn't a single road to the destination.)

54
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,660
(Exploring other paths)

55
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,620
(offers different scenery.)

56
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,140
(Besides,)

57
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,500
(this is only a temporary retreat.)

58
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,540
(As for my first step toward returning to work…)

59
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,520
(Over the past six months, I've been offering online consultations.)

60
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,940
(Livestreamer Ning Yue: You need to provide the court with proof
of your salary and expenses to show difficulty in paying child support.)

61
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,300
(With my husband's support,)

62
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,340
(I work as a pro bono lawyer.)

63
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,260
My cat scratched the neighbor's dog,

64
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,220
and they want me to pay for it.

65
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,740
But those cats…

66
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,700
They're strays!

67
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,860
They're not mine!

68
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,030
If you've been regularly feeding

69
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,690
these stray cats at a fixed location,

70
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,580
In fact,

71
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,470
you've formed a dependency.

72
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,660
Legally,

73
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,090
you're considered their owner.

74
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,340
(Although the income is negligible and not worth mentioning,)

75
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,980
(and the cases are all about trivial matters,)

76
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,180
(Chen Binkan: Thank you, Ms. Ning!)

77
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,380
(helping so many people in need)

78
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,500
I want a divorce from my wife!

79
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,940
This is my washbowl,

80
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,960
but she uses it to wash her feet!

81
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,310
(makes me feel)

82
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,820
(I've realized my value.)

83
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,620
Ning is so professional,

84
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,220
responsible and patient.

85
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,900
Yue, you're amazing as always.

86
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,580
How do you manage

87
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,260
to face the danger brought by the washbowl?

88
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,500
(Legal Consultation)

89
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,180
Compared to last month's case

90
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,780
about brushing the toilet with a toothbrush,

91
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,860
this is nothing.

92
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,700
Ning,

93
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,780
since you arrived,

94
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,060
you've helped us

95
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,840
solve so many community issues.

96
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,820
Doing pro bono work isn't easy.

97
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,740
Whether we can keep this going

98
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,940
depends on you.

99
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,700
On us.

100
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,380
On us.
- Indeed.

101
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,220
Lunch time.

102
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,220

103
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,060
Zhu,

104
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,260
how long has Yue been here?

105
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,780
Since the project launched,

106
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,220
probably over six months.

107
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,300
Full-time?

108
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,860
Then she must be rich.

109
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,460
You're being superficial.

110
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,260
Yue is someone with a strong sense of social responsibility and purpose.

111
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,660
Her husband is rich.

112
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,420
That explains it.

113
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,580
Hurry up, the clients are waiting.

114
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,260
(Yaofeng Techonology)

115
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,780
Cheng,

116
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,300
here's last month's performance report.

117
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,500
Take a look.

118
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,050
Zhou Wei,

119
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,340
I've invited Ms. Lan to dinner at my house tonight.

120
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,700
You and your wife should come too.

121
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,140
No problem.

122
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,980
I think

123
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,860
Ms. Lan's project looks very promising.

124
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,060
If she makes any requests or suggestions,

125
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,100
do your best to meet them.

126
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,940
Don't worry.

127
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,660
Oh, by the way,

128
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,220
it's Tongtong's birthday in a few days.

129
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,500
Here's a gift for him.

130
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,020
Ziyuan picked it out specially for him.

131
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,620
I'll thank you on his behalf then.

132
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,940
You're welcome.

133
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,140
There's another one – what's this?

134
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,660
Ning Yue made for him by hand.

135
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,740
It's a pop-up book.

136
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,020
Such a talent.

137
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,620
Yue is so thoughtful.

138
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,740
Excuse me, Ms. Ning.

139
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,500
Sorry, we're already closed for the day.

140
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,860
If you have any business,

141
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,540
please come back tomorrow to queue and register.

142
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,580
I…

143
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,180
Have you talked to your son?

144
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,700
Take a seat.

145
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,780
Ms. Ning,

146
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,540
I’ve already talked to my son,

147
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,700
but he just doesn't believe

148
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,540
that his father is having an affair.

149
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,380
In his mind,

150
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,740
his dad

151
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,260
is the best dad in the world.

152
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,700
Isn't this just a huge joke?

153
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,540
What should I do, Ms. Ning?

154
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,460
Don't worry.

155
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,620
Your child needs more time.

156
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,410
Rest assured,

157
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,340
the law will protect you.

158
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,020
As for the divorce,

159
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,780
even though your husband is the one at fault,

160
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,660
in order to protect you and your child's interests,

161
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,860
you need to try your best

162
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,740
to collect evidence of his infidelity

163
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,190
and of him transferring assets.

164
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,740
The custody of your son,

165
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,140
You must want to fight for it, right?

166
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,740
Yes.

167
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,300
Then you need to prove

168
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,470
that his father

169
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,860
is unfit to raise the child.

170
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,700
Mom!

171
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,300

172
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,780
what are you doing here?

173
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,860
Mom, let’s go home.

174
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,700
I…

175
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,860
Ms. Ning,

176
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,700

(In divorce cases)

178
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,380

185
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,820
Have you changed into your new cheongsam yet?

186
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,060
Ning,

187
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,420
This cheongsam looks really beautiful on you.

188
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,300
Thank you, Ms. Lan.

00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,420
you're a cheongsam enthusiast,

191
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,260
aren't you?

192
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,100
I think Chinese women look more graceful

193
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,340
in cheongsams.

194
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,140
Mrs. Hu, you've got real class.

195
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,580
What do you do for a living?

196
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,300
Ms. Lan, you see,

197
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,260
Yue is quite amazing.

198
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,940
She works as pro bono lawyer

199
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,660
in a non-profit group.

200
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,260
Incredible!

201
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,700
I'm impressed.

202
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,900
You're truly

203
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,420
contributing to the society.

204
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,460
I'm flattered.

205
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,220
I just wanted to

206
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,460
find something meaningful to do.

207
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,700
Still,

208
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,700
it's thanks to my husband's support.

209
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,660
The key is your kindness

210
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,580
and willingness to help.

211
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,260
Together with Cheng's support,

212
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,580
it becomes more valuable

213
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,420
and meaningful,

214
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,500
isn't it, Cheng?

215
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,780
Now I've seen

216
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,100
what it means to be a perfect match

217
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,380
that treats each other with courtesy.

218
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,580
You two are truly a model couple.

219
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,540
Ms. Lan, how can you use "courtesy"?

220
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,820
If you're already being courteous,

221
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,020
can you still be a couple?

222
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,460
I actually agree with "treats each other with courtesy."

223
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,900
The point is courtesy.

224
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,060
For husband and wife,

225
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,660
it's about mutual respect.

226
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,700
I think that's right.

227
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,940
- True.
- Everyone,

228
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,220
let's propose a toast

229
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,300
to mutual respect and courtesy.

230
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,380
To mutual respect and courtesy.

231
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,420
Mutual respect and courtesy.

232
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,940
Hold on.

233
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,980
Sorry,

234
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,380
my wife can't drink alcohol lately,

235
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,220
so I'll drink this on her behalf.

236
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,580
Wow, you two planning for a second child?

237
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,980
Well, we're still…

238
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,380
- Not…
- I think

239
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,700
we'll let things happen naturally.

240
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,820
Let things happen naturally.

241
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,540
Honey,

242
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,700
Ziyuan's been in kindergarten almost a year now.

243
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,460
He’s getting more and more sensible.

244
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,180
Don’t you think we should really consider…

245
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,000
Honey, there’s something

246
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,420
I forgot to tell you.

247
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,880
A company

248
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,220
has offered me a job.

249
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,350
They want me to be their legal advisor.

250
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,540
Although the company's still in its growth phase,

251
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,380
they…

252
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,700
they have decent potential.

253
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,920
When did you even go looking for a job?

254
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,850
They were my clients when I was a lawyer.

255
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,700
They reached out to me last week.

256
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,860
Why didn't you discuss it with me beforehand?

257
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,500
I just had a casual chat with their HR,

258
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,260
and didn't expect them to be so open to it.

259
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,970
I can leave work a bit early to pick up Ziyuan every day,

260
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,740
so I thought I'd give it a try.

261
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,900
What are you doing? You scared me there.

262
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,820
What about your work at the non-profit service station?

263
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,340
Aren't you still going?

264
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,480
I was thinking,

265
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,060
once I get settled in this new job,

266
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,500
I'll talk to Xia,

267
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,460
and see if I can help out on weekends.

268
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,100
Honey,

269
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,180
so…

270
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,900
about the second child,

271
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,260
could we maybe push that off a little bit?

272
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,260
Honey,

273
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,340
You've taken such good care

274
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,220
of Ziyuan

275
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,660
and this home.

276
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,980
I'm really,

277
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,700
truly grateful to you.

278
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,260
You see,

279
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,580
even though I’ve been out there hustling,

280
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,740
working hard and making money,

281
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,300
I'm very aware

282
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,100
that the value you've created at home

283
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,630
is no less than what I've contributed.

284
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,660
Your work and your effort

285
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,220
are just as much as mine, if not more.

286
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,100
You're already so tired,

287
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,260
how could I bear

288
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,100
to let you go out and work too?

289
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,500
Actually,

290
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,220
I'm doing this for myself.

291
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,620
Didn't we agree

292
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,460
that I'd take these three years off to rest,

293
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,660
to take care of you and Ziyuan?

294
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,940
Now that Ziyuan is in kindergarten,

295
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,420
and your company is on track,

296
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,900
I think it's time for me to pursue my own career again.

297
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,740
What do you think?

298
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,900
You don't know

299
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,540
how competitive the workplace is these days.

300
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,140
I'm really worried you'll get too stressed out

301
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,980
and relapse.

302
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,300
It won't.

303
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,380
The symptoms of my depression

304
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,300
haven't appeared in a long time.

305
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,220
Don't worry.

306
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,700
I'm fine now.

307
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,660
I really want to return to the workforce.

308
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,500
Can you understand that?

309
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,940
But aren't you already working at the non-profit service station?

310
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,700
The work there is meaningful,

311
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,500
and it's helped me get back into a better state.

312
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,660
But it's different from what I truly want.

313
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,580
I still miss

314
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,580
the busy, fast-paced days

315
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,860
at the law firm.

316
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,700
That's the stage I've always aspired to be on.

317
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,580
Honey,

318
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,020
support me,

319
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,380
okay?

320
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,060
Alright, alright.

321
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,940
I support you.

322
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,180
I fully, completely support you.

323
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,580
The two of us,

324
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,540
we respect and understand each other.

325
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,260
Thank you, honey.

326
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,480
Mr. Zhang, it's Ning Yue.

327
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,060
Yes, yes, I've reviewed the contract,

328
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,020
There's no problem with it.

329
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,660
If the timing works out,

330
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,690
I can start next month.

331
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,100
- Yes.
- Ning.

332
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,100
I'll confirm with you later, okay?

333
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,300
Thanks.

334
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,460
You're quitting?

335
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,500
Xia, I just wanted

336
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,620
to discuss something with you.

337
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
I'm not quitting.

338
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,980
I'll still come back on weekends.

339
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,500
You know, we have more jobs to do on weekends.

340
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,780
it won't cause any trouble.

341
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,100
Ning,

342
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,780
please think it over carefully?

343
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,620
We really can't do this without you.

344
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,460
You're the backbone of the team!

345
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,460
You don't know

346
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,060
how important you are to us.

347
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,780
Alright, Xia, I understand.

348
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,700
I'll handle it.

349
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,700
(My wife is at home today.)

350
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,700
(Don't worry about saving money for me. What's mine is yours.)
He only gives me 3,000 yuan per month,

351
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,220
but he's willing to buy that woman a random purse

352
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,390
that costs thirty to forty thousand.

353
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,580
(Legal Consultation)
Here's the evidence.

354
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,700
I've sent everything over to you.

355
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,340
Got it.

356
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,780
Can we still

357
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,800
get back these tens of thousands?

358
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,340
Yes, we can recover it.

359
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,420
It can be done through unilateral gifts from joint assets,

360
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,840
and the rights can be limited and reclaimed.

361
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,620
Ms. Ning,

362
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,100
please make sure

363
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,980
to keep these pieces of evidence safe.

364
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,660
Make sure no one else sees this.

365
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,090
I don't want my son to find out

366
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,020
what his dad has done.

367
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,100
I'm afraid it'll hurt him.

368
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,620
Ms. Ho,

369
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,220
among all my clients,

370
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,580
ninety percent of them

371
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,300
have the same concern as you.

372
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,340
But I have to tell you,

373
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,220
once you take this step,

374
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,120
your child will be affected,

375
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,650
even if just a little.

376
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,140
So you need to

377
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,940
prepare yourself mentally for that.

378
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,940
Don't blame yourself.

379
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,140
This isn't your fault.

380
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,020
In a marriage,

381
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,180
no one can predict that their partner will betray them.

382
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,700
Don't worry,

383
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,140
Ms. Ho,

384
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,420
you'll get through this.

385
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,420
I'll leave this in the hands of you three,

386
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,660
Mr. Guo, Mr. Hu, I'm counting on you.

387
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,170
Have a seat.

388
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,620
Ms. Tian, not bad!

389
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,580
Last time you couldn't even play,

390
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,420
and now you're playing so smoothly.

391
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,580
Huge progress!

392
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,020
Crash course.

393
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,020
I only learned this one piece.

394
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,420
You're being modest.

395
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,380
Thanks for hosting us!

396
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,420
About your matter,

397
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,260
leave it to me.

398
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,340
Alright, bye, take care!

399
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,180
Bye.

400
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,180
Mind your step.

401
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,500
Didn't you say you only learned one piece?

402
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,380
That one was for them.

403
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,740
You played it wrong.

404
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,500
I did that on purpose.

405
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,620
You lost!

406
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,820
Take a sip of water.

407
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,420
Dad,

408
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,980
you're a big tree

409
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,540
Come on, sit down.

410
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,180
Standing on the chair is dangerous!

411
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,340
that shields the family from storms.

412
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,580
What about me?

413
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,620
Mom, you're a little fairy.

414
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,980
Such a sweet talker.

415
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,820
Son,

416
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,180
that's some serious favoritism.

417
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,060
I'm not even human now?

418
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,860
Dad, I mean

419
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,940
you're like a guardian angel protecting me and Mom!

420
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,220
Honey, you're a guardian angel now.

421
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,660
Alright, let me toast to you.

422
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,130
Let's toast.

423
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,540
- Cheers.
- Let me toast you too.

424
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,940
Cheers.

425
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,180
Honey,

426
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,260
it's getting late. Time for bed.

427
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,220
How’s your job?

428
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,180
You know, the one you applied for.

429
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,460
Don't worry.

430
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,380
I've already made everything clear with them.

431
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,900
Next month,

432
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,100
I'll officially start working.

433
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,940
Let's sleep.

434
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,180
I am tired!

435
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,360
Congcong,

436
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,820
adult matters are hard for kids to understand.

437
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,020
Your mom and dad

438
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,300
will take care of their own issues.

439
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,580
Come on, have some water.

440
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,780
Lawyer Ning will help your mom,

441
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,980
trust her.

442
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,620
Yue.

443
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,700
Congcong,

444
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,340
why are you trying to ruin my parents' relationship?

445
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,540
I'm not ruining your parents' relationship.

446
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,180
The adult world is complicated,

447
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,940
and there's a lot of things

448
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,260
your mom hasn't figured out.

449
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,620
How can she explain to you.

450
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,900
You're still too young.

451
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,540
I know everything.

452
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,860
I just know.

453
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,260
One of my classmates' parents got divorced.

454
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,380
His dad quickly remarried

455
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,650
and completely ignored him after that.

456
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,820
Congcong, but…

457
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,620
Do you care about how your mom feels?

458
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,180
Do you care if she's happy?

459
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,740
She's happy.

460
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,380
They were fine before.

461
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,980
It's all because of you.

462
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,340
You're the one who pushed my mom to get a divorce.

463
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,980
You're not a good person.

464
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,890
You'll get what's coming to you.

465
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,880
Congcong,

466
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,860
Things aren't what you think.

467
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,100
They won't divorce.

468
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,500
They're doing this for me.

469
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,660
They will NEVER divorce.

470
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,180
- Congcong!
- Congcong!

471
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,100
Ms. Ning, you're finally back.

472
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,540
I need to talk to you about something.

473
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,540
Ms. Ning,

474
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,180
This is urgent.

475
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,500
I want my mom to come home.

476
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,660
Why is it so noisy downstairs?

477
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,460
Hey, boy, that's dangerous.

478
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,500
I just thought it was noisy downstairs,

479
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,540
so I went to the window to take a look.

480
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,060
- Please calm down.
- Then,

481
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,700
I saw someone

482
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,940
jump down…

483
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,380
Have you seen them

484
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,020
before?

485
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,940
Did you talk to them?

486
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,180
What did they say to you?

487
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,380
Why did you post those photos online?

488
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,620
You promised me

489
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,260
you'd keep them safe.

490
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,540
Congcing can't bear it.

491
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,060
How can a son

492
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,700
believe his father did something like that?

493
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

494
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,500
If something happens to my son,

495
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,820
I won't let you get away with it.

496
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,740
What's going on?

497
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,900
Honey.

498
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,220
She's hurting my son!

499
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,180
The one who did this to your son

500
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,220
is your husband.

501
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,860
(One can a day, peaceful sleep every day.)

502
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,180
Honey,

503
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,860
What's going on with these photos?

504
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,060
I never posted these photos.

505
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,180
Who posted them online?

506
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,180
Don't look at them.

507
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,740
No wonder Congcong reacted like that.

508
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,380
When I went to the hospital earlier,

509
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,580
his mom kept asking me

510
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,700
why these photos were posted.

511
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,780
Honestly, I didn’t post them.

512
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,820
It wasn’t me.

513
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,420
But only I have these photos.

514
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,980
I don’t know how they got out.

515
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,220
I asked the doctor,

516
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,420
the building wasn't too high.

517
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,580
The kid's lucky.

518
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,260
He just has some fractures and bruises,

519
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,420
and probably

520
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,780
a concussion,

521
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,100
but no serious lasting damage.

522
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,940
How did you end up at the hospital?

523
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,820
I tried calling you, but you didn't answer.

524
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,580
Then I called the service station,

525
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,820
and they told me you're at the hospital.

526
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,500
Can you believe it?

527
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,180
This kid has such a temper!

528
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,820
Who could’ve expected this?

529
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,780
Honey,

530
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,940
you know where the tie is.

531
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,260
Thanks to your help,

532
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,940
how can I not know.

533
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:30,980
Ziyuan.

534
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,420
Dad, I'm coming.

535
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,380
Say goodbye to mom.

536
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,180
Bye, Mom.

537
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,060
I'll pick you up in the afternoon, okay?

538
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,340
Okay, Mom.

539
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,260
See you in the afternoon.

540
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,020
I'll go pick him up this afternoon.

541
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,540
You rest some more.

542
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,020
Alright.

543
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,620
Ziyuan, let's go.

544
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,710
Dad, are you going to send me to school every day,

545
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,580
aren't you?

546
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,420
Of course.

547
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,100
(Attorney Ning Yue leaks client's evidence.)

548
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,180
(Pro bono lawyer Ning Yue suspected of leaking client's evidence.)

549
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,900
I contacted the PR team we were discussing cooperation with

550
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,980
and told them to remove the trending topic right away.

551
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,460
These marketing accounts are truly shameless.

552
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,500
Hurry up and fix it.

553
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,710
How's Yue?

554
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,740
Is it hitting her hard?

555
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,430
It's my fault.

556
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,940
I failed to protect her.

557
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,140
How could it be your fault?

558
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,450
Actually, back then,

559
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,530
when she wanted to go back to work,

560
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,000
I shouldn't have agreed.

561
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,820
Now it's clear

562
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,500
I was right.

563
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,980
You can't say it like that.

564
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,140
Before Ziyuan was born,

565
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,500
she was doing just fine.

566
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:44,420
(Ning Yue)

(Comments)

568
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,700
Some lawyers will do anything for money
even they'll lose their conscience.

569
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,940
(Attorney Ning Yue, shame on you.)

570
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,880
(You're conscienceless.)

571
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,840
(How can there be such a lawyer?)

572
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,960
(A disgrace to the legal profession.
Ms. Ning, you're ruining the industry’s reputation.)

573
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:55,980
(Attorney Ning Yue, you monster.)

574
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,740
(Mr. Zhang.)

575
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,620
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

576
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,690
Ms. Ning.

577
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,560
I’m calling

578
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,900
to talk to you

579
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,020
about the position we discussed earlier.

580
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,860
I can start this week.

581
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,540
No.

582
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:22,980
I’m just letting you know

583
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,300
there’s no need to rush.

584
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,780
We’ve found someone more suitable.

585
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,380
You can go on your break.

586
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,140
Mr. Zhang, if there are other positions available,

587
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,980
I…

588
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,340
(It feels like three years ago again.)

589
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,900
(I can’t argue with this.)

590
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,060
(I have no strength to fight back.)

591
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,500
(Why did things turn out like this?)

592
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,060
(Is it all my fault?)

593
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,700
Honey,

594
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,580
what's wrong?

595
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,420
Is it relapsing?

596
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,100
Take it easy.

597
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,700
I'm here.

598
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,380
Take it easy.

(Honor Certificate: Most Beautiful Mental Health Worker)

600
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,740
My wife...

601
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,350
She's had these symptoms before.

602
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,200
Twice.

603
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:40,410
Once

604
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,760
was when I first met her.

605
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,100
Back then,

606
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,580
her father had just passed,

607
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,540
and it hit her really hard.

608
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,780
The other time

609
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,580
was after she gave birth.

610
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,820
About six months ago,

611
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,300
my wife said she wanted to go back to work.

612
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,780
I thought

613
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,580
supporting her decision

614
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,020
would make her happy,

615
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,060
but I was wrong.

616
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,020
She's not in a state to work right now.

617
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,380
Her depression relapse is my fault

618
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,140
as her husband.

619
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,920
Honestly, I really regret it.

620
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,900
It's all my fault.

621
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,300
Ms. Ning,

622
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,140
Have you been experiencing shortness of breath

623
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,940
or rapid heartbeat lately?

624
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,810
I'm not sure

625
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,340
whether it's the same…

626
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,240
Compared to your previous symptoms,

627
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,580
is there any difference this time?

628
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,580
Doctor,

629
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,860
Is my wife's current condition

630
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,860
unsuitable for going back to work?

631
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,260
Well, not exactly.

632
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,900
It's still too early

633
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,620
to say if this is a relapse of her depression.

634
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,100
Depression can vary in severity.

635
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,460
Whether she can go back to work

636
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,060
will depend on her condition.

637
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,060
Doctor,

638
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,420
We're married.

639
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,890
No one knows her better than I do.

640
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,020
Her current state is really bad.

641
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,690
Please give her something

642
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,500
to ease her symptoms.

643
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,660
Ms. Ning,

644
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,980
Please think carefully

645
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,420
before answering the questions.

(Self-rating Depression Scale)

647
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,220
Honey,

648
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,060
Take your time writing,

649
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,900
Don't rush.

650
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,140
I'll wait for you.

651
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,820
Honey,

652
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,060
I'm just anxious about Congcong.

653
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,460
Do I really need medication?

654
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,180
How can you say that?

655
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,860
Honey, I'm not that ill.

656
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,380
Last time,

657
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,220
it's due to the changes of my hormone levels.

658
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,420
- This time…
- Do you know

659
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,620
you've been having nightmares every night?

660
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,860
You don't even realize how often you wake up at night.

661
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,940
Sorry,

662
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,260
did I disturb your rest?

663
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,500
It's fine.

664
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,180
I'm just worried.

665
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,700
Alright,

666
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,940
let’s start with

667
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,860
these meds.

668
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,540
Once you've truly moved on from all this,

669
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,820
you can stop the medication.

670
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,740
Okay?

671
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,900
Then,

672
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,790
we can focus on getting ready to

673
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,900
conceive.

674
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,140
Put them in a bag.

675
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,300
Thank you.

Ning.

680
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,540
Look, even though the accident happened,

681
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,780
there are still so many people here who need us

682
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,060
and your help.

683
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,250
Take a couple of days to rest.

684
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,090
I can understand you.

685
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,260
But we can't let one little setback

686
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,140
make us give up.

687
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,580
We still need to keep going, right?

688
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,020
I haven't thought about giving up.

689
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,500
Once

690
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
we can start again,

691
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,580
I'll be back right away.

692
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,540
That's great!

693
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,540
Go talk to Mr. Hu and make sure

694
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,940
he won't withdraw the funding.

695
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,260
You mean...

696
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,020
This service station

697
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,940
is sponsored by Hu Cheng, right?

698
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,580
Xia.

699
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,860
why is she saying all this to you?

700
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,020
I just told her to close the doors for a few days

701
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,940
to lay low.

702
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,980
I didn't say we were stopping the project.

703
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,500
Why was she so anxious?

704
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,340
I…

705
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,220
Why didn't you tell me

706
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,580
that the sponsor was you?

707
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,340
Were you worried about hurting my pride?

708
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,700
Well,

709
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,180
no wonder Xia keeps saying

710
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,580
how much she needs me

711
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,900
and believes in my abilities.

712
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,820
But what she really needs isn’t my abilities at all.

713
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,380
She needs your money.

714
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,300
Honey,

715
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,140
don't think that way.

716
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,820
I only kept it from you

717
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,380
because I was worried that you'd feel bad.

718
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,540
Your abilities

719
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,180
are undeniable.

720
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,100
Look, you went for an interview,

721
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,900
and they hired you on the spot, right?

722
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,620
I swear,

723
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,340
I didn't arrange that.

724
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,100
It's already fallen through anyway.

725
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,860
Honey,

726
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,220
you're…

727
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,820
You're not upset with me, are you?

728
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,340
Why would I be upset with you?

729
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,860
Of course not.

730
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,300
You're just looking out for me.

731
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,340
(I trust Hu Cheng.)

732
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,140
(Everything he does is because he loves me.)

733
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,340
(He's just doing what he thinks is best for me.)

734
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,410
(But lately, I've started)

735
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,540
(to feel like something is...)

736
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,300
(slowly changing.)

737
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,660
Here she comes.

738
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,860
Hello, Ning Yue.

739
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,820
I'm your neighbor.

740
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,700
I live in Building 5.

741
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,700
- Hello.
- my little girl, Niuniu,

742
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,540
and your son, Ziyuan,

743
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,900
go to the same kindergarten.

744
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,780
Niuniu's having a birthday party this weekend,

745
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,700
and she wanted to invite Ziyuan along.

746
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,500
Sorry, I...

747
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,620
Niuniu and Ziyuan are really close.

748
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,660
She told me she definitely wanted Ziyuan to come.

749
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,700
It's a casual get-together,

750
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,860
just to hang out with the kids.

751
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,940
As their parents,

752
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,980
we can chat a bit too.

753
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,300
- Alright then.
- By the way,

754
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,860
let me add you on WeChat.

755
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,780
Sure.

756
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,980
(Moms Group)

757
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,660
I've made a new friend.

758
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,380
Don't even get me started.

759
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,700
Niuniu's mom

760
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,100
is way too enthusiastic.

761
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,780
She invited me to Niuniu's birthday party,

762
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,380
and it hasn't stopped since then.

763
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,260
Afternoon tea,

764
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,140
spa treatments...

765
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,220
It’s exhausting.

766
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,620
What can I say, my wife is really popular.

767
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,660
Everyone loves her.

768
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,900
(@Ning Yue – Ziyuan's mom,
how about we go swimming together tomorrow?)

769
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,600
We could also grab some afternoon tea after. It's a date.)

770
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,500
Here she goes again.

771
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,860
Yeah, she's asking me to

772
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,180
go swimming with her tomorrow.

773
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,260
I'm so worn out

774
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,140
just trying to

775
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,140
keep up with her.

776
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,260
Sometimes I don't even know what to say.

777
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,860
But it's probably good for you, right?

778
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,260
The kids are in the same kindergarten,

779
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,020
and you're neighbors,

780
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,260
so it's a good way to distract yourself a bit.

781
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,580
It' be good for your mood.

782
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,660
You're right.

783
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,500
I've been texting her

784
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,660
over and over,

785
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,620
but she never replies.

786
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,020
Did you tell Hu Cheng about it?

787
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,540
I did.

788
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,220
If she doesn't want to hang out with us, fine.

789
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,420
I've never been this tired before.

790
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,100
She's the one talking about doing charity work,

791
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,220
but when things go wrong, it's always her husband fixing it.

792
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
She's being pretentious.

793
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,900
Well, Hu Cheng's promised us the funding,

794
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,580
so whatever happens,

795
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,100
we've done our best.

796
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,460
We don't need to be friends with her.

797
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,660
Anyway,

798
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,980
we're not in her league.

799
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,220
Whatever,

800
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,300
Hu Cheng is really good to his wife.

801
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,620
He actually pays out of his own pocket

802
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,380
to keep his wife happy.

803
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,020
You see her smile?

804
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,620
People are just different.

805
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,880
There's always someone bigger than you.

806
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,520
She's got such a good husband,

807
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,620
but she's still not satisfied.

808
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,580
Yes.

809
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,500
Who's she frowning for?

810
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,700
Yue, don't move.

811
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,100
Sit down and take a break.

812
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,940
I can do it.

813
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,000
- No, sit still.
- Humph,

814
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,860
you're not match for me.

815
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,560
Yue, leave that. Just rest.

816
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,260
Be careful when you're playing the ball, okay?

817
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,500
Don't kick it into the water.

818
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,900
- Okay.
- Got it.

819
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,300
- Let me show you my little treasure.
- Okay.

820
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,020
Hand-brewed coffee, I brought it just for you.

821
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,220
- Cheng's meeting is about to end.
- Let me show you.

822
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,220
He'll come and join us for lunch.

823
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,940
Well, Hu Cheng's promised us

824
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,500
the funding.

825
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,420
Hu Cheng is really good to his wife.

826
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,780
He actually pays out of his own pocket

827
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,340
to keep his wife happy.

828
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,460
Go talk to Mr. Hu and make sure

829
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,940
he won't withdraw the funding.

830
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,780
The tent!

831
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:06,820
Mom.

832
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,380
Come on, Ms. Ning.

833
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,540
Mom, come on.

834
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,660
What a strong blow.

835
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,500
Come on, Ms. Ning.

836
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,340
It's okay.

837
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,380
- Leave it to me.
- Be careful.

838
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,820
Zhou Wei, catch it.

839
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,780
Mom, come on.

840
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,860
My mom is a superhero.

841
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,700
Come here.

842
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,560
- Don't let yourself get cold.
- Come and help.
Come on, Ms. Ning.

843
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,530
- Go take a seat.
- Okay.

844
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,180
- It's settled.
- How reckless you are. To jump into the water.

845
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,780
I'm alright.

846
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,100
- Mom.
- Come here.

847
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,540
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay, Ziyuan.

848
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,740
- Are you cold?
- Come and kiss.

849
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,580
I'm fine.

850
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,860
I quite enjoy myself.

851
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,620
When I was little, I liked to play in the water.

852
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,140
It's cold out there. Don't be such reckless again.

853
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,620
If you truly get cold…

854
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,140
Dad, let's go.

855
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:56,960
Xia.

856
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,820
Honey.

857
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,860
Here you are.

858
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,380
Change your clothes.

859
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,980
Honey, you know what,

860
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,420
when I was in the water

861
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,540
to get the tent out,

862
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,340
your son called me

863
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,420
superwoman.

864
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,780
"Mom is a superwoman."

865
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,260
So funny.

866
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,900
- Ziyuan.
- You're so reckless.

867
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,940
How much can a tent cost?

868
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,100
What are you trying to fish it out for?

869
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,820
Don't freeze yourself, okay?

870
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,100
Be good.

871
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,100
Go change your clothes.

872
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,980
You want me to wear this?

873
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,640
The specs are... and it's already been used.

874
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,090
Seriously, how can you even walk in this thing?

875
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,020
It looks good. I'll take a couple of photos of you later.

876
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,180
It's pretty.

877
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,700
I'll take some pictures for you.

878
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,980
Just sit here and rest for now.

879
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,580
- It looks good.
- Leave it to me.

880
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,820
Here.

881
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,540
- Let me help.
- Here you are.

882
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,380
You go keep her company.

883
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,660
Add some more oil.

884
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,620
- So much oil.
- Exactly.

885
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,740
Honey,

886
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,020
Honey, don't be upset.

887
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,540
When I came home earlier,

888
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,700
I saw the clothes were dry.

889
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,540
I got them off,

890
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,380
but I didn't pay much attention.

891
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,020
That's why I brought a cheongsam.

892
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,780
Alright, I won't argue with you.

893
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,060
Come here.

894
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,580
You don't need to do anything.

895
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,420
Did you add chili?

896
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,660
Be a good girl, look pretty.

897
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,090
- Sit here.
- Want some more oil?

898
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,460
- Just wait for food.
- No need.

899
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,540
- No, it’s fine.
- Almost done.

900
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,340
Freshly grilled meat.

901
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,340
Wait, wait a minute.

902
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,420
Xia,

903
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,900
this one has chili in it.

904
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,100
She's got acnes recently.

905
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,380
On her back.

906
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,900
Look at Cheng, he's so concerned about Yue.

907
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,660
I didn't even know

908
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,980
I have acnes on my back.

909
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,140
You just don't get as much care from your husband as you do.

910
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:38,980
Not like him.

911
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,900
If I get a bump on my forehead, he doesn't even notice.

912
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,980
You'd look even more beautiful with a bump.

913
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,700
Nonsense.

914
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,220
Drink some tea.

915
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,740
Here, freshly made.

916
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,580
No chili in this one.

917
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,580
This one's good, you can eat it.

918
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,900
By the way, honey,

919
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,260
When you have the time,

920
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,580
I think you should take Xia with you to get a skin care.

921
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,020
Look at the results,

922
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,300
so firm and tight.

923
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,340
I'm not going any more.

924
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,380
Why not?

925
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,580
Zhou Wei, I've been hearing that someone from the company

926
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,100
says there's a popular beauty salon.

927
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,980
It has good reputation.

928
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,260
Next time, we can try that place.

929
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,420
I don't need it.

930
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,020
Well,

931
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,500
Yue is naturally beautiful.

932
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,180
Okay, okay.

933
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,180
No need.

934
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,540
No need to go.

935
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,620
Look at him.

936
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,260
He values his wife's opinions.

937
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,020
Zhou Wei's also really good to his wife.

938
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,060
Compared to you, he's not worth mentioning.

939
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,340
No one can compare to him.

940
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,260
He's famous for being a wife-doting husband.

941
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,380
You could learn a thing or two.

942
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,900
Come on, the skewers are ready.

943
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,540
They’re all done.

944
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,380
Ziyuan, come on.

945
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,300
All grilled.

946
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,700
- Here you are.
- Share this

947
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,740
with your friend.

948
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,000
(Everyone is envious.)

949
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,900
Be careful.

950
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,500
(His love for me is so meticulous.)

951
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,180
(But I'm only starting to feel more and more uncomfortable.)

952
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,300
(He's built for me...)

953
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,500
(a seemingly perfect world,)

954
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,220
(a world I don't need to look at,)

955
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,500
Don't be afraid,

956
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,660
I'm here.

957
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,380
(a world I don't need to listen to,)

958
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,460
- (let alone to think about.)
- Come on.

959
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,620
(I only need to follow his instructions.)

960
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,980
(Go forward.)

961
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:25,980
(Go back.)

962
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,540
(Turn left.)

963
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,420
(Turn right.)

964
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,940
(And then tell myself,)

965
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,860
(everything he's doing,)

966
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,460
(is for me)

967
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,020
(and for this family.)

968
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,420
(But...)

969
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,180
(When did it start?)

970
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,140
I think Chinese women

971
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,420
look elegant in a cheongsam.

972
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:51,820
My wife doesn't drink.

973
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,740
that the value you've created at home

974
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,100
is no less than what I've contributed.

975
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,860
We can focus on getting ready to

976
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:57,940
conceive.

977
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,660
I only kept it from you

978
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,020
because I was worried that you'd feel bad.

979
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,100
What can I say, my wife is really popular.

980
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,980
She's not in a state to work right now.

981
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,260
It's all my fault.

982
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,580
We're husband and wife,

983
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,860
No one knows her better than I do.

984
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,500
