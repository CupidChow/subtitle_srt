=Episode 15=

3
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,610
I have sent you the schedule.

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,760
Please rest early today.

5
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,760
Can he satisfy you?

6
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,450
Didn't you dislike such weak men?

7
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,450
Mr. Hu,

8
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,690
you drank too much.

9
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,890
Does he know

10
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,730
you have been a mistress before?

11
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,050
Hu Cheng,

12
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,410
are you jealous?

13
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,520
Do you think you are that amazing?

14
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,050
Has your wife seen you like this now?

15
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,010
What?

16
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,480
Is there a problem

17
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,080
in your relationship with your wife?

18
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,690
I warn you.

19
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,410
Don't mention my wife again.

20
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
Turns out without me,

21
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,760
you guys are still unable to continue.

22
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,760
Isn't it time to break up?

23
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,080
Hu Cheng!

24
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,170
Hello? Ziyuan.

25
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,220
I miss you.

26
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,360
Are you asleep?

27
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,480
I love you.

28
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,160
Cheng,

29
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,290
why are you still not asleep?

30
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,020
Wei...

31
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,560
Did something happen?

32
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,050
Today...

33
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,000
Today,

34
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,780
Ziyuan called me.

35
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,480
He's so cute.

36
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,650
He said...

37
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,120
He said he missed me.

38
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,730
You call me in the middle of the night

39
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,240
to specifically tell me

40
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,530
your son is really cute.

41
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,650
I miss my son.

42
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,970
It's only been two days.

43
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,240
You'll go back in a couple of days.

44
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,130
Wei...

45
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,130
Wei,

46
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,640
you know what?

47
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,210
I really think

48
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,410
my son is awesome.

49
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,210
He can prevent me

50
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,000
from making mistakes

51
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,770
at the most critical moment.

52
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,680
What's the mistake?

53
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,410
Do you know this woman...

54
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,920
Ning Yue is completely different from her.

55
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,770
Between Ning Yue and me,

56
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,000
I feel that she loves me.

57
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,050
I also love her.

58
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,000
I absolutely do not allow...

59
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,560
I absolutely do not allow us to take that step.

60
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
Do you understand?

61
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,730
Cheng, are you drunk?

62
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,650
Stop drinking.

63
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,800
Just sleep.

64
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,050
Wei...

65
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,680
I really feel very troubled.

66
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,680
Do you know?

67
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,880
Ning Yue she...

68
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,170
I really don't want to divorce Ning Yue.

69
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,000
I want to keep this family.

70
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,970
I can't be without this family.

71
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,480
I have never wanted to leave her.

72
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,530
Do you understand?

73
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,770
But she doesn't understand.

74
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,880
She has never understood this.

75
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:00,890
Wei,

76
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,360
why?

77
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,850
Why can't she understand me?

78
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,920
Today we're having the same omelette rice.

79
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,000
- Is it ok?
- Ok.

80
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,130
Yue.

81
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,010
Yue.

82
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,240
- Wei.
- Hello, Mr. Zhou.

83
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,520
Ziyuan.

84
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,410
- Why are you here?
- Look.

85
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,920
What did I bring you?

86
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,250
My wife asked me to buy this for you.

87
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,490
- Say thank you.
- Do you like it?

88
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,330
Thank you.

89
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,800
It's nothing.

90
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,530
Are you waiting for me here?

91
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,080
I want to talk to you.

92
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,680
Ok.

93
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,370
- Let me take him inside first.
- Ok.

94
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,370
Say goodbye.

95
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,410
Goodbye.

96
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,680
Have fun.

97
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,200
Shall we have omelette rice first?

98
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,890
- Ok.
- Hello.

99
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,050
Could you please order omelette rice?

100
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,210
Well,

101
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,490
let him eat first.

102
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,720
I am talking to a friend outside.

103
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,770
I will pick him up later, ok?

104
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,960
- Ok, no worries.
- Thank you.

105
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,010
Thank you.

106
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,850
Eat first, Ziyuan.

107
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,490
I bought it for you.

108
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,010
- Iced Americano.
- Thank you.

109
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,790
Wei,

110
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,250
just tell me what you need from me.

111
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,890
You really are just like Cheng in this regard.

112
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,530
Your eyes are particularly sharp.

113
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,920
Nothing can be hidden from you.

114
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,290
You are an honest person.

115
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,680
What's on your mind

116
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,200
is all written on your face.

117
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,010
Here is the thing.

118
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:50,850
You might

119
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,250
also feel Cheng

120
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,680
has been under a lot of pressure lately.

121
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,720
Mainly because

122
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,530
the company encountered some issues before.

123
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,680
He put all his money into it

124
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
to help the company get through the crisis.

125
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,050
He used his money?

126
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,770
It seems you don't know at all.

127
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,050
But you can rest assured.

128
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,050
Now the company has turned around

129
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,530
and hasn't been affected much.

130
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,370
He didn't tell you mainly because

131
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,920
he was afraid it would worry you.

132
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,050
He just has

133
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,080
this flaw.

134
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,290
He doesn't like to say or explain.

135
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,800
He bears everything by himself.

136
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,960
I have to talk about this with him later.

137
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,440
Although it may be useless to say it.

138
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:35,970
But there is one thing

139
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,250
which is beyond doubt.

140
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,440
No matter how hard he is,

141
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,440
he will not make you and Ziyuan suffer.

142
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,290
I am certain of this.

143
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:47,970
Wei,

144
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,160
does Hu Cheng

145
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,490
get very close

146
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,890
to Chen Pingzhang?

147
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,680
Chen Pingzhang?

148
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,890
GM of the Purchasing Department of Zhongzhi.

149
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:57,850
I know him.

150
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
Just regular business interactions.

151
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,650
We provide technical services to Zhongzhi.

152
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,760
What's wrong?

153
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,800
I'm afraid

154
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,960
he will take the wrong path.

155
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,370
How is that possible?

156
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,290
Of course he won't.

157
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,250
Besides, I'm here watching over him.

158
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,680
I won't let anything happen to him.

159
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,540
Yue, why did you ask that?

160
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,610
It's nothing.

161
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,170
I overthought it.

162
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,530
My surname is Mo,

163
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,890
Mo Xianbin.

164
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,250
That means

165
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,290
this company

166
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,920
was started by me and my partners.

167
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,200
There will be communication.

168
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,650
Let me take a look at this.

169
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,890
Has it been adjusted, right?

170
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,210
Ok.

171
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,800
Manager Tian Qiuzi

172
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
is the main force

173
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,840
at the company.

174
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,560
Alright.

175
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,130
Please consider our project

176
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,290
and invest a little in us.

177
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,640
Sure.

178
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,290
Mr. Hu, your company's technology...

179
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,680
Qiuzi,

180
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:11,890
can we talk privately?

181
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,440
- Alright, Mr. Mo.
- You go first.

182
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,370
Ok, Mr. Mo.

183
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
What are you nervous about?

184
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,520
Nothing.

185
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,410
If what I say next is a bit harsh,

186
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,720
please don't mind me.

187
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,520
Please go ahead.

188
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,530
I know you are very capable

189
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,330
at Ruixin.

190
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,600
Your business skills are strong.

191
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,840
They said Manager Tian is very skilled

192
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,890
in communication.

193
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,080
Dealing with you

194
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,800
is very pleasant.

195
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,050
I think this is all absolutely positive.

196
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,600
I value your abilities.

197
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,250
And I also value your connections.

198
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,250
As for me,

199
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,560
I am pragmatic.

200
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,490
I will never use

201
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,490
moral standards to manipulate anyone.

202
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,720
I won't ask anyone

203
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
to do what I can't do.

204
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,410
And my company

205
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,530
won't be like

206
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,680
other companies

207
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
that interfere with employees'

208
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,290
personal life.

209
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,290
I only value two things the most.

210
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,440
Performance,

211
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:28,970
interests.

212
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,800
So I hope

213
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,080
during the collaboration process,

214
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,440
you can leverage your greatest strengths

215
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,970
to achieve the best outcomes

216
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,440
with the projects and connections

217
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,720
you are familiar with.

218
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,320
I understand what you mean, Mr. Mo.

219
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,280
Don't worry.

220
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,250
Thank you.

221
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,410
Are you trying to scald me?

222
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,370
Here.

223
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,680
Yue.

224
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,920
Didn't you get fired?

225
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,890
Why are you still not home all day?

226
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,330
I have to say,

227
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,650
only by staying at home

228
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,890
can there be an opportunity.

229
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,890
You're often not at home every day.

230
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,080
In case one day

231
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,800
Hu Cheng divorces you,

232
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,840
what should you do?

233
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,010
You have time now.

234
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,440
Just be with your mom

235
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,440
to cook together

236
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,050
and clean up the house.

237
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,370
This is what a wife of Hu family

238
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,800
should do.

239
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,370
Where is she?

240
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,220
(Mu Xiao)

241
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,010
(Hello, the number you dialed is busy.)

242
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,490
(Please call back later.)

243
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,330
Dad.

244
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,130
You...

245
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,890
I, I went back to my room.

246
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,680
I just got dizzy when I walked here,

247
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,130
so I leaned against the door.

248
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,370
Well...

249
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,080
How about I take you to the hospital?

250
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,920
No need, it's fine.

251
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,800
I feel much better now.

252
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,530
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

253
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,980
(Housekeeping Center)

254
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,140
(Hello, I want to hire a nanny tomorrow.)

255
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,080
It's cold. Why not heat it up for me?

256
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,920
Did you hear me?

257
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,920
Who are you?

258
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,050
You scared me to death.

259
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,050
Who are you?

260
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,920
Who are you?

261
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,200
Mom,

262
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,930
do you want to give it a try too?

263
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,050
I can't do it.

264
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,010
I haven't painted for many years. I can't.

265
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,010
It's ok. Teachers can teach you.

266
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,320
Look at how well they draw!

267
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,450
You hired a nanny.

268
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,600
It's such a big deal.

269
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,490
You should have informed me in advance.

270
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,930
I nearly had a heart attack.

271
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,320
I almost called the police.

272
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,120
Alright, let your mom come back.

273
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,680
What?

274
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,970
What the hell!

275
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,640
She is too old to draw.

276
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,450
She knows nothing!

277
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,930
Ask her to come back quickly.

278
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,600
She's intentionally bullying me.

279
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,640
She has bad intentions.

280
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,290
Sir,

281
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,010
don't just sit on the sofa watching TV.

282
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,560
This is not good for the body.

283
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,530
My previous employer, you know,

284
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,930
is about the same age as you.

285
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,970
Every morning,

286
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,450
he gets up early for a run.

287
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,010
He looks young and vibrant.

288
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,130
Looks like

289
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,490
he's just in his sixties.

290
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,120
Do I not look like I'm 60 years old?

291
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,690
60?

292
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,880
You look like you're about 75.

293
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,320
Ridiculous!

294
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,180
It's all because

295
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,800
you sit on this sofa watching TV every day.

296
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,250
That's not good for your health.

297
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,930
As time goes by,

298
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,690
your limbs will degenerate.

299
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,320
Then your hands and feet will become useless.

300
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,640
I hope you don't mind.

301
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,320
These are all true words.

302
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,060
Honesty is effective.

303
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,010
My previous employer, you know,

304
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,640
just doesn't like to hear the truth.

305
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,160
He prefers to hear lies,

306
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,160
pretty words.

307
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,640
I don't lie.

308
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,690
Why not find a professional liar?

309
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,560
Alright, alright.

310
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,330
Go.

311
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,080
Pour me a cup of tea.

312
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,120
Sir, you can brew it yourself.

313
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,090
I have to work.

314
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,980
What did you say?

315
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,250
My leader said

316
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,250
we need to learn to say no

317
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,880
and we must protect our rights.

318
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,800
We can't listen to whatever the employers say

319
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,320
for fear that they bully us.

320
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,450
Besides,

321
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,930
the contract states

322
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,600
serving tea is not within my work scope.

323
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,320
You can check the contract.

324
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,160
You are just a nanny.

325
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,120
According to previous statements,

326
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,640
that means a servant.

327
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,210
The servant has to serve tea to the master.

328
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,720
Servant?!

329
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,640
Sir,

330
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,690
I work in the housekeeping industry.

331
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,250
We have signed a contract.

332
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,290
It's written in the contract

333
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,490
both parties are equal.

334
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,530
So you need to respect me.

335
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,840
Alright, alright, alright.

336
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,290
Just go.

337
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,400
I don't need you.

338
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,800
I can't.

339
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,840
The contract is signed by the pretty girl.

340
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,050
I have to listen to her.

341
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,240
Pretty girl?

342
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,050
Who?

343
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,720
Ning Yue.

344
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,210
You call her pretty girl,

345
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,730
but call me sir.

346
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,360
What the hell!

347
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,330
What else?

348
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,080
She looks so young.

349
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,640
Get lost.

350
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,000
Sir,

351
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,840
if you keep speaking so unpleasantly,

352
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,530
I might stop respecting you.

353
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,090
Have a seat.

354
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,580
(MAXMINI)

355
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,730
Oh my god.

356
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,200
Ziyuan.

357
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,600
Ziyuan, come here.

358
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,360
Baby, how about going to another place today?

359
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,560
Too many people.

360
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,930
We've been waiting for more than an hour.

361
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:33,930
Mom is hungry.

362
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:34,770
Is that ok?

363
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,210
I just want to eat at this restaurant.

364
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,290
We don't know how long we'll have to wait.

365
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,770
I see it's you.

366
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,010
It's really you.

367
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,670
You work here, huh?

368
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,290
What a coincidence!

369
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,400
Have you been waiting?

370
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,240
Yeah.

371
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,740
What are you here for?

372
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,290
Are you eating or playing with toys?

373
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,980
I want to eat burgers.

374
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,080
I love the burgers here the most.

375
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,120
Our burgers are unique.

376
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,250
All the kids love them.

377
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,640
Let me take you there, ok?

378
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,320
Great!

379
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,970
- This way.
- We have been waiting.

380
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,490
There are a lot of people today.

381
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,360
- I think it's you.
- Great.

382
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,770
- So, I come to you.
- Thank you.

383
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,930
When painting,

384
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,640
make the light soften the dark.

385
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,010
First, let's draw a stroke with the dark ink.

386
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,730
Then, use the light ink

387
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,050
to soften the stroke we just made.

388
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,840
At the same time, when you paint,

389
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,880
pay attention to the layout and lines.

390
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,230
In that case,

391
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,880
the effect will be better.

392
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,840
I'll go take a look at other people.

393
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,450
Ma'am, you go ahead.

394
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,400
Thank you.

395
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,530
Let me tell you,

396
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,730
don't be afraid.

397
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,800
Just draw boldly.

398
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,120
Draw and sketch more

399
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,960
and then

400
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,730
go see more art exhibitions.

401
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,490
Actually, after we retire,

402
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,930
we should come out to have some fun.

403
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:57,770
You look

404
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,840
a few years younger than me.

405
00:21:59,130 --> 00:21:59,970
Retired?

406
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,210
I have been staying at home.

407
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,050
Then let's go out and paint well.

408
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,690
Draw boldly.

409
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,160
You draw quite well.

410
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,570
Go ahead.

411
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,720
Is it delicious?

412
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,930
I don't want to eat anymore.

413
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,640
Then what do you want to do?

414
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,120
I want to go play.

415
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,240
You can't.

416
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,930
Finish this burger before you go.

417
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,970
Mom will go with you.

418
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,080
- No.
- I'm almost done eating.

419
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,640
Go after eating it.

420
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
- I will go with you.
- No.

421
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,010
- No way.
- I just want to play.

422
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,850
Hu Ziyuan,

423
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,800
you asked to eat burgers here today.

424
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,250
I have been waiting with you for so long.

425
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,360
It was not easy to get in.

426
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,490
Once you finish it,

427
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,730
we can play. Do you understand?

428
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,930
I just want to go play right now.

429
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,250
What are you doing?

430
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,480
I'm sorry.

431
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,800
Ziyuan, what are you doing?

432
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,130
Hu Ziyuan,

433
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,250
you can't waste food like this.

434
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,840
- Do you know?
- Let me.

435
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,880
Why are you so willful?

436
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,930
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

437
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,770
Don't cry, don't cry.

438
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,840
You can't do this, you know?

439
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,690
Sit nicely.

440
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,880
Are you feeling wronged?

441
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,800
I will clean it up.

442
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,400
- It's ok.
- Really sorry about this.

443
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,840
Don't... Let me clean it up.

444
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,320
- So willful.
- It's fine. Let me do it.

445
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,400
- Really sorry.
- It's fine.

446
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,880
Leave it to me.

447
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,400
Still crying, huh?

448
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,600
You think you are right?

449
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,680
Forget it.

450
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,250
- Here.
- You make me mad.

451
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,210
Here. Wipe your hands.

452
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,690
- It's fine.
- Sorry to trouble you.

453
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,640
Nothing. Just call me if you need.

454
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,490
Alright, alright.

455
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,530
It's ok.

456
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,800
I have cleaned it up.

457
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,010
Thank you.

458
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,370
You're welcome.

459
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,730
It's ok.

460
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,640
It's normal for a kid.

461
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,490
Eat it.

462
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,080
Now you are thoughtful.

463
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,450
Huh?

464
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,290
You are thoughtful.

465
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,450
What were you just doing?

466
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,930
You can't do this in the future, you know?

467
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,950
Many kids in Africa can't get enough food.

468
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,600
Don't waste food, do you understand?

469
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,730
Be good, don't cry, don't cry.

470
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,970
I feel heartbroken. Don't cry.

471
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,430
Don't cry anymore.

472
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,960
Hello.

473
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,530
You have finished playing.

474
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,160
Thank you.

475
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,360
You're too polite.

476
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,770
I have a small gift for you.

477
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,160
Ms.,

478
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,770
how did you know I like this?

479
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,320
Because many kids like it.

480
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,450
When you have time,

481
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,160
come often with your mom, ok?

482
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,840
Next time

483
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,840
I want to bring many kids here.

484
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,560
I also want to bring my dad.

485
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:14,930
Good boy!

486
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:17,770
We are going.

487
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,970
If you need any more help,

488
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,360
you can go find Ms. Mu to discuss.

489
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,050
She is a very nice person.

490
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,390
She's very professional too.

491
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,960
I'm leaving.

492
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,220
Goodbye.

493
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,830
- Pretty good.
- Grandma.

494
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,480
Grandma.

495
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,250
- Good boy.
- Is this your grandson?

496
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,640
- Mom.
- Here you are.

497
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,160
Look at your grandma's painting.

498
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,770
I draw it randomly.

499
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,610
It's not good.

500
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,560
It's flowers.

501
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,770
The flowers you painted are really good.

502
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,770
Mom, you paint really well.

503
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,640
Yeah, your mom said

504
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,080
she loved painting when she was young.

505
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,840
It's a pity she got married later.

506
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,120
She never painted again.

507
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,560
I didn't expect you to draw so well

508
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,490
after not drawing for so many years.

509
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,640
In terms of color usage,

510
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,050
she presents such a strong vitality.

511
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,080
It's really good.

512
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,530
That's great, Mom.

513
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,970
Come often and draw more in the future.

514
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,130
Yeah.

515
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,530
Elderly people

516
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,160
need support and encouragement from family.

517
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,400
I support Grandma in painting.

518
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,770
- Good boy.
- Mom, I support you too.

519
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,840
We all support you.

520
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:39,890
Grandma.

521
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,240
Mom,

522
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,250
I haven't seen you so happy in a long time.

523
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,010
Grandpa.

524
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,370
Dad.

525
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,730
Ziyuan, go back to your room and study English.

526
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,210
I will come to find you in a bit, ok?

527
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,050
Go quickly.

528
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,600
- Go quickly.
- I am going

529
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,730
to learn.

530
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,160
Come here.

531
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,970
Let's have a family meeting.

532
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,130
Sit down.

533
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,400
Yue.

534
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,600
Get that little girl

535
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,440
fired.

536
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,530
Right away.

537
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,600
Are you referring to

538
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,530
Xiaosui?

539
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,970
Who else could it be?

540
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,730
She just spoke to me on the phone

541
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,360
and said she gets along very well with you.

542
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,770
She did a good job too.

543
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,930
I've figured it out.

544
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,680
You

545
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,600
have bad intentions

546
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,160
and deliberately find such a girl

547
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,050
to go against me.

548
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,000
Is it?

549
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,530
Dad,

550
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,450
I specially hired someone to take care of you.

551
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,450
If you keep saying this,

552
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,320
I'm really quite sad about that.

553
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,000
Alright, alright, alright.

554
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,490
Then

555
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,840
wait for my son to come back.

556
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,160
I'll have Cheng deal with you.

557
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,200
Dad,

558
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,490
I have already

559
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,250
talked to Hu Cheng about this.

560
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,090
He knows.

561
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,600
I will resign and go home in a few days.

562
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,120
It's just right that Xiaosui came over

563
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,010
to help me for two days. Isn't that great?

564
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,560
And this money was paid by Hu Cheng.

565
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,970
He paid for a month.

566
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,730
If you really don't like her

567
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,690
and want to fire her,

568
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,530
it's ok.

569
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,770
But we have to compensate her.

570
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,120
I don't know how to explain to Hu.

571
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,320
He is in a meeting these two days

572
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,400
and still under a lot of pressure.

573
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
I dare not call him to say these things.

574
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,360
If you really don't want this,

575
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,800
why don't you give him a call?

576
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,930
You talk to him.

577
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,490
Well, he is my son.

578
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,970
What's wrong with me calling him?

579
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,210
Where have you gone?

580
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,050
Dad,

581
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,840
starting from today,

582
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,840
Mom is going to start learning to paint.

583
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,690
I signed her up for the course.

584
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,930
Don't stop her.

585
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,080
Hu Cheng isn't at home these days.

586
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,050
I will decide the matters

587
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,490
of this household.

588
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,320
Hu Cheng is not at home.

589
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,560
You are planning a rebellion,

590
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,400
aren't you?

591
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,560
You traitor!

592
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,000
Mom.

593
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,970
Sit.

594
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,570
Sit there.

595
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,680
Eat oranges.

596
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,290
Mom, don't be afraid.

597
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,290
I know you clearly understand

598
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,690
who can't live without whom

599
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,050
and who needs who between you and him.

600
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,010
It's that Dad can't live without you.

601
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,770
It's time for him to know.

602
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,640
What's going on here?

603
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Are you really

604
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,600
going to learn how to paint?

605
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,120
Yue signed me up for the course.

606
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,490
She dressed me up.

607
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,600
Oh my goodness.

608
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,600
You're already an old woman.

609
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,530
And you still want to learn painting.

610
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,930
You just sit in the painting class

611
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,120
and the teacher sees your painting.

612
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,290
What kind of scene is this?

613
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,450
I like it.

614
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,730
Are you really going to go?

615
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,880
Then what should I do?

616
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,090
Ma'am,

617
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,970
you look great today.

618
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,130
You're here.

619
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,890
Take care.

620
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,970
- Well...
- Sir.

621
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,200
Morning.

622
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,560
Oh my!

623
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,290
Let's go to exercise.

624
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,800
I thought He Kuan was sneaky

625
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,840
at that time.

626
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,880
His product was absolutely completed

627
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,560
at Zhongzhi.

628
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,210
He even lied about not finishing it.

629
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,160
Now he has taken it out for profit.

630
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,080
If what you say is true,

631
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,120
Xiya Tech is suspected of plagiarizing

632
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,250
our products, infringement

633
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,290
and violates employee non-compete agreements.

634
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,770
He plagiarizes our research results

635
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,730
and infringes on our legitimate rights.

636
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,160
It's a very serious issue.

637
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,570
Director Qin,

638
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,930
this contract will be handled by you.

639
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,570
Ok.

640
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,360
Oh my!

641
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,210
It's making my head spin.

642
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,160
What case is it

643
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,730
that has made Lawyer Pan like this?

644
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,290
Don't mention it.

645
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,640
Do you think

646
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,450
if He Kuan plagiarized?

647
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,750
I found the company's process records

648
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,320
(Contract Number)
show that He Kuan from the Sales Department

649
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,360
also participated in this project,

650
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,340
but it was eventually signed by Chen Pingzhang.

651
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,050
He Kuan

652
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,350
completely disappeared.

653
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,020
and he

654
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,460
(Licheng Anping Co., Ltd.)
has already resigned.

655
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,740
(Zhongzhi Group Co., Ltd.)

656
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,360
He Kuan?

657
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,360
Plagiarize?

658
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,730
What does he do?

659
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,320
He Kuan from the Sales Department.

660
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,120
He resigned,

661
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,050
but took away a technical team.

662
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,290
He started his own company

663
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,360
called Xiya Tech.

664
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,840
Mr. Feng insisted

665
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,450
that he plagiarized our products.

666
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,770
Can I take a look at it?

667
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,090
Thank you.

668
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,000
Pan Jie,

669
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,770
look at this procurement contract.

670
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,530
Its factory

671
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,450
is not even the same as our factory.

672
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,200
Director Qin.

673
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,240
Are you going out?

674
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,570
Yes.

675
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,320
He Kuan's case?

676
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,770
You have some understanding.

677
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,050
Is Zhongzhi going to sue him?

678
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,530
They are thinking about it now.

679
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,360
But I think we should understand the situation,

680
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,970
so I should be able to make it if I go now.

681
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,210
Can I go with you?

682
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,320
Their company is really far away.

683
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,360
It is in the neighboring city.

684
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,450
It'll be midnight when we get back.

685
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,290
Can you?

686
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
I'm ok with it.

687
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,640
I'll go get the car and you pack up the things.

688
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,600
See you downstairs in a while.

689
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,610
Ok.

690
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,840
Ma, are you looking for me?

691
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:59,810
Yue.

692
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,080
You must be tired following me every day.

693
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,640
Yue,

694
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,830
you misunderstood me.

695
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,320
Was it Mr. Hu who asked you to do this?

696
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,050
Yue,

697
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,320
please don't make it difficult for me.

698
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,930
I really have no choice.

699
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:21,770
Ma,

700
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,010
I don't want to make it difficult for you.

701
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,160
But you have to report

702
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,840
to Mr. Hu as I say.

703
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,360
I believe that most of you here, like me,

704
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,400
came today to hear

705
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,050
about Mr. Hu's successful experiences

706
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,210
at Yaofeng Tech.

707
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,770
You personally come to host this event.

708
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,330
It is truly dazzling.

709
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,530
You take away the brilliance of Yaofeng.

710
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:14,900
Mr. Hu, you can rest assured.

711
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,280
Today, you are the star.

712
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,560
I conduct this interview without a script.

713
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,160
Mr. Hu didn't get prepared either.

714
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,410
So, you need to stay focused

715
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,850
and answer my questions well.

716
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,560
Sue me if you want.

717
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,370
I will definitely win this lawsuit.

718
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:32,850
Additionally,

719
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,490
I am preparing to counter-sue Zhongzhi.

720
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,280
You all should get ready as well.

721
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,500
(Non-disclosure Agreement)

722
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,540
We will take these materials back

723
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,200
and study them carefully.

724
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,920
Mr. He,

725
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,410
I would like to remind you.

726
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,010
Once

727
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,640
the lawsuit has begun,

728
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,490
the development, promotion, and operations

729
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,490
all of your products

730
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,930
need to be stopped.

731
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,240
If I remember correctly,

732
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,970
your company is currently

733
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,350
in the financing stage, right?

734
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,330
If the investors know that

735
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,760
the product you are promoting

736
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,140
has encountered copyright issues,

737
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,640
and is currently in litigation,

738
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,240
do you think they will invest in you?

739
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,640
I hate it when someone threatens me.

740
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,930
I don't want to threaten you.

741
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,760
I just want to remind you

742
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
and just state the objective facts.

743
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,410
I know that once this lawsuit begins,

744
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,120
there are no benefits for either side.

745
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,640
However, I think

746
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,560
it may be even less favorable for you.

747
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,140
In a word,

748
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,280
we, Yaofeng Tech,

749
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,560
and Xianbin Capital

750
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,240
are committed to jointly creating a platform

751
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,630
for high-level dialogue and cooperation

752
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,160
for sustainable development.

753
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,650
Green,

754
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,170
environmental protection and energy saving

755
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,120
are

756
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,720
the theme we eternally pursue.

757
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,450
This is not an idealism detached from reality.

758
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,370
Therefore, Xianbin Capital firmly believe it.

759
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,450
Yaofeng Tech makes us believe that

760
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,890
capital and ideals are not in conflict.

761
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,810
Doing the right thing is the most valuable.

762
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,080
Xianbin Capital will always

763
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,010
support and invest in these enterprises

764
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,370
with a sense of belief and ideals.

765
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,530
Mr. Mo, please take a look at this video.

766
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,050
Mr. Zhou, please look at this.

767
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:46,760
Quickly think of a solution.

768
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,810
See if it can be withdrawn.

769
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:48,810
Ok.

770
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,760
I am very confident in the lawsuit

771
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,120
for legitimate rights and interests.

772
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,960
Then...

773
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,580
(Mu Xiao)

774
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,560
I'm sorry.

775
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,210
What about

776
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,120
talking to my legal team?

777
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,330
Mr. He.

778
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,560
Between you and Mr. Feng,

779
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,160
is there

780
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,330
personal grudges?

781
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,760
What's the matter?

782
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,850
Who uploaded it?

783
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,120
No matter who upload it,

784
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,720
we are already dealing with it now.

785
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,490
Luckily, the video doesn't have many views.

786
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,930
Not many people saw it.

787
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,810
Cheng, I'm not criticizing you.

788
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,280
Why aren't you being more careful?

789
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,370
Did you do it?

790
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,410
Why do I need to do this?

791
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,040
During this special period,

792
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,200
it's better for us to keep a distance,

793
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,370
Manager Tian.

794
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,930
Be careful. The stairs.

795
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,640
Here. Take it slow.

796
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,080
Mr. He,

797
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:35,960
please wait.

798
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,370
It's already this late.

799
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:39,850
It's too late.

800
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,730
It's too exhausting for you to go back.

801
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,560
I'll arrange for you to stay overnight.

802
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,760
No, no, no, no need for that.

803
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,720
It was me who forced you to drink.

804
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,760
It's my fault.

805
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:49,850
However,

806
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,560
Ms. Ning's communication skills are impressive.

807
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,700
She is also straightforward.

808
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:55,890
This drink is worth it.

809
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,970
We were wrong about you before.

810
00:38:58,850 --> 00:38:59,690
Mr. He,

811
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,330
thank you for understanding.

812
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,760
I just never understood

813
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,560
why Feng keeps clings to me.

814
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,370
But as you said,

815
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,820
the misunderstanding has been cleared up.

816
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,490
Neither side has suffered losses.

817
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,850
That's a good thing.

818
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:15,850
Mr. He,

819
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,160
regarding Licheng Anping,

820
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,760
if you know something,

821
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,930
please

822
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,040
tell me.

823
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:26,930
Ok, Ms. Ning.

824
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,490
I'm leaving first.

825
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,760
Ok, thank you.

826
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,050
Are you ok, Yue?

827
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:36,850
Take care.

828
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,170
Ok.

829
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,410
Fortunately,

830
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,530
we came in person today.

831
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,970
He Kuan gave those materials.

832
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,050
By comparing the two versions slightly,

833
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,200
we can know they are two different products.

834
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,930
I knew Feng was unreliable.

835
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,120
He lost the project himself

836
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,560
but looked for a scapegoat everywhere.

837
00:39:58,970 --> 00:39:59,930
Yue, let's...

838
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:01,810
This way.

839
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:02,690
Go.

840
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,920
Be careful.

841
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,250
Qin,

842
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,050
I have been telling you

843
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,410
that you don't put your heart into your work,

844
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:12,690
haven't I?

845
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,760
I'm not saying you don't work seriously.

846
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,810
You work very seriously.

847
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,240
But there's a very important point.

848
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,930
You always look down on the ways of the world.

849
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,680
Be careful, be careful.

850
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,450
But this is very important.

851
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,290
Ok.

852
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,600
And,

853
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,490
some people

854
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,560
is too smooth,

855
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,560
versatile and sophisticated.

856
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,850
But you

857
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,560
are too sharp-edged.

858
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,600
Having sharp edges is not a flaw.

859
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,930
But you can't go with the flow.

860
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,490
You can't change

861
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,560
into people without bottom lines.

862
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,960
Yue,

863
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,120
what kind of person do you want me to be?

864
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,530
That kind of person

865
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,930
is terrifying.

866
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:05,770
Who are you talking about?

867
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,330
Yue.

868
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,450
What exactly is Licheng Anping?

869
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,000
Qin,

870
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,410
I am really drunk.

871
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,050
I'm very dizzy.

872
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,560
Licheng Anping,

873
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,530
this is why you came

874
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,890
to meet Mr. He today, right?

875
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,600
Yue,

876
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:49,010
you've gone through so much trouble

877
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,050
and suffered so many grievances

878
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,370
to stay at Zhongzhi.

879
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:54,690
