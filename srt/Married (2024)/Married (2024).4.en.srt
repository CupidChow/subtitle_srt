00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,350
Mom just finished trimming the plants,

4
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,910
and they sprouted again so quickly.

5
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,440
Do you know why we need aquatic plants

6
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,040
though they are so difficult to manage?

7
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,940
Because this fish tank

8
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,980
cannot do without that touch of

9
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,120
green

10
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,260
Dad,

11
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,070
when will mom be back?

12
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,320
Yeah,

13
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,840
what time is it already?

14
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,400
Let's

15
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,630
give mom a surprise, shall we?

16
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,880
Okay.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,840
Let's go.

18
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,070
Mr. Hu has mentioned many times

19
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,230
that he hopes you can return home.

20
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,070
He has no choice

21
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,160
but

22
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,600
want you to make a small mistake

23
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,440
at work,

24
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,470
and then…

25
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,470
Everyone around me

26
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,950
praises him,

27
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,720
and thinks he treats me quite well.

28
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,470
I used to think so too.

29
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,400
I always believed

30
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,000
that I was living a very happy life.

31
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,880
Your happiness

32
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,070
is not necessarily an illusion.

33
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,400
But the problem is

34
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,120
I don't know what's real

35
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,560
and what's fake.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,790
Anyway, I just feel like

37
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,040
I'm living in The Truman Show.

38
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,400
As long as he's by my side,

39
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,350
I can't see anything clearly.

40
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,470
So maybe only

41
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,000
if I leave him,

42
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,070
I can see clearly

43
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,170
the whole picture of the situation.

44
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,630
However,

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,790
for someone as scheming as him,

46
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,470
if you want a divorce,

47
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,320
it's not easy.

48
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,440
So I need to be prepared.

49
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,440
I need to gather evidence

50
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,570
of his infidelity during the marriage.

51
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,750
But before the evidence is complete,

52
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,720
I must not alert him.

53
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,910
Have you checked the asset allocation?

54
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,880
He has not transferred assets.

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,670
You said you are a

56
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,320
very excellent lawyer.

57
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,880
For this kind of thing,

58
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,560
you can completely handle it.

59
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,000
Why do you still come to me?

60
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
I want to change my situation soon.

61
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,910
So I need a partner.

62
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,990
Let's go to pick up mother.

63
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,310
Let's go.

64
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,520
Still keep in touch with the director?

65
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,230
Rarely since I started flying solo.

66
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,160
Thank you for taking my case.

67
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,040
We're close friends, aren't we?

68
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,230
Actually,

69
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
I understand you better than anyone.

70
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,520
Alright, just stop here.

71
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,110
You're still the same as before.

72
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,200
Not a bit has changed.

73
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,560
Leaving.

74
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,750
Ning Yue

75
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,110
you're just like before indeed.

76
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
Dad,

77
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,560
where's mom?

78
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,080
Let's go find her.

79
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,830
Okay.

80
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,000
Mom.

81
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,070
Ziyuan.

82
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,560
Honey,

83
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,550
why are you here?

84
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,400
You bought so many delicious things.

85
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,400
Come and take a look.

86
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,920
Is there anything else you want?

87
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,920
Why are you here?

88
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,400
We want

89
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,190
to give you a surprise.

90
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,150
What a surprise!

91
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,720
Do you want to buy something?

92
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,230
It's so nice

93
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,080
you came to pick me up.

94
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,670
Is something wrong?

95
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,430
It's evil not to pick you up.

96
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,990
My Senior Brother said I drank too much

97
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,060
and lost my manners last night.

98
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,140
Did I

99
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,340
scare you?

100
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,660
I always thought

101
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,500
it's impossible

102
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,620
to get completely drunk.

103
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,460
Usually, the things said when drunk

104
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,820
are what one wants to tell.

105
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,980
Until I met you

106
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,820
did I realize

107
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,420
you truly black out.

108
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,060
Isn't it the same when drinking so much?

109
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,220
Senior Brother treats you so well,

110
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,540
you should treat him better.

111
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,300
Otherwise, he might ignore you,

112
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,460
and what would you do?

113
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,340
No, it won't happen.

114
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,220
He's long been used to it.

115
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,460
I treated him like this back in college.

116
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,500
However,

117
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,420
I don't like getting drunk.

118
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,660
Because I hate that kind of

119
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,580
out-of-control state.

120
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,140
Really?

121
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,820
I've put away the medicine inside.

122
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,540
Honey,

123
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,860
I've been feeling much better

124
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,020
for the past few days.

125
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,180
I feel quite fit

126
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,340
and sleeping well.

127
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,700
I'm not anxious anymore.

128
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,540
- Really?
- Yes, indeed.

129
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,020
It seems

130
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,140
I'm not as fragile as I imagined.

131
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,180
Congcong's matter

132
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,660
didn't defeat me.

133
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,140
It's great you're in a good mood.

134
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,980
I can't

135
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,660
be sickly all day.

136
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,500
Isn't it?

137
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,460
Honey,

138
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,140
I hope you are happy every day

139
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,220
and move on.

140
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,280
Take it slow.

141
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,840
What's going on?

142
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,140
What is it?

143
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,190
Please have a seat, my dear wife.

144
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,340
These are all your favorite foods.

145
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,540
My dear wife,

146
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,540
seeing you feeling better day by day,

147
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,340
I'm truly happy.

148
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,060
Cheers!

149
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,260
Cheers!

150
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,660
Let's dig in.

151
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,340
Honey,

152
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,820
is it okay?

153
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,260
No wonder you treated me well.

154
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,300
So there was an ulterior motive.

155
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,700
This is called

156
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,900
painstaking effort.

157
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,580
Let me show you this.

158
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,500
(Obstetrics)
What is this?

159
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,900
Today I

160
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,420
went for a prenatal check-up.

161
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,180
I was just thinking,

162
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,580
since we are already prepared for it,

163
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,380
then I should be well-prepared.

164
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,460
This kind of thing,

165
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,060
you can never be fully prepared for.

166
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,540
Ziyuan was often ill when little.

167
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,780
At that time, I suspected

168
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,580
something's wrong with the check-ups.

169
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,020
Now

170
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,140
I'm older now than I was back then.

171
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,340
We still

172
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,440
need to prepare thoroughly

173
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,390
to ensure everything is fine.

174
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,340
Alright,

175
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,700
I'll listen to you.

176
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,060
Honey,

177
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,740
I especially miss the first two years

178
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,020
after Ziyuan was born, when I felt

179
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,300
particularly at ease and content.

180
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,220
No matter how tired I was outside,

181
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
as soon as I got home,

182
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
seeing you all,

183
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,420
I immediately came back to life.

184
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,340
I really wish to return to those days.

185
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,810
Once you give birth to a second baby,

186
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,020
we'll definitely be happier than before.

187
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,380
and live even more happily.

188
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,820
Lawyer Li,

189
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,180
First,

190
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,820
it's Mr. Ge's fault that led to

191
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,940
his marriage breakdown,

192
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,260
and Ms. Zhao has no fault whatsoever.

193
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,100
Second, due to Mr. Ge's various faults,

194
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,500
he's not suitable to raise the kids.

195
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,320
As both kids are still young,

196
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,660
Ms. Zhao is capable of raising them.

197
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,020
Third,

198
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,300
Regarding the division of property,

199
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,620
the agreement isn't just for fidelity

200
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,660
but rather what Mr. Ge had promised,

201
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,860
in the event of his breach of loyalty,

202
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,220
for the purpose of property division.

203
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,700
All the agreements regarding

204
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,940
property division are valid.

205
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,680
Ms. Zhao enjoys

206
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,180
all the rights to property division.

207
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:15,410
Of course,

208
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,990
although Mr. Ge has

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,600
many faults and bad habits,

210
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,620
he is the children's father.

211
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,180
Ms. Zhao, for the children's health,

212
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,520
is willing to cooperate and ensure

213
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,580
Mr. Ge's visitation rights.

214
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,260
This will not affect

215
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,740
the affection between them.

216
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,180
If Mr. Ge firmly disagrees,

217
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,020
we don't mind going to court.

218
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,800
These pieces of evidence

219
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,820
will surely be submitted to the court.

220
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,900
What is this?

221
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,300
The images about Mr. Ge's bad habits

222
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,540
may make you feel uncomfortable.

223
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,720
By that time,

224
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,830
these pieces of evidence

225
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,100
will also be presented in public.

226
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,220
You can request cross-examination

227
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,410
and the court will investigate.

228
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,780
Can we conclude the mediation today?

229
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,660
Lawyer Mu,

230
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,140
as for the controversial points,

231
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,780
we can discuss further,

232
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,740
okay?

233
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,540
Lawyer Li,

234
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,660
being a lawyer is indeed our profession,

235
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,500
but it also represents justice.

236
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,580
The apartment of Tian Qiuzi

237
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,940
was purchased by her with a loan.

238
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,020
Hu Cheng did not contribute financially.

239
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,220
As it stands now,

240
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,500
they

241
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,980
only appear together

242
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,740
in the workplace

243
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,740
and there is nothing

244
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,380
inappropriate in their behavior.

245
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,340
It seems

246
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,060
they both

247
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,940
are quite cautious.

248
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,860
Otherwise,

249
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,730
why don't you put some more pressure.

250
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,300
Hu Cheng is quite a sensitive person.

251
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,220
If I use the exact same trick,

252
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,300
he will quickly notice.

253
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,100
I remember going out with him before.

254
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,550
I noticed he isn't very good at

255
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,540
booking hotels with cell phone.

256
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,730
When he is on a business trip,

257
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,940
his assistant would make the bookings.

258
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,700
Maybe I can think of a way

259
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,500
to get some information

260
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,300
from his assistant.

261
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,780
How've you been getting along recently?

262
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,300
He's still waiting for a second child.

263
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,940
So what will you do?

264
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,580
Sure

265
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,340
I'll cooperate with him well.

266
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,300
(Haikang Hospital Outpatient Department)

267
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:55,900
(Department Index Respiratory Andrology)

268
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,080
(Pregnancy Preparation Pre-pregnancy Checkup)

269
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,540
Honey,

270
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,780
what are you reading?

271
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,700
So intently.

272
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,340
I'm reading

273
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,220
the childbirth strategy.

274
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,420
Why are you reading that?

275
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,620
No need.

276
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,100
We

277
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,540
will make our own strategy.

278
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,020
Honey,

279
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,300
could you

280
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,700
take a leave tomorrow?

281
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,020
I registered.

282
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,660
Registered for what?

283
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,900
Registered for you.

284
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,660
Haven't you

285
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,180
already been to the hospital?

286
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,140
They said there's no problem.

287
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,380
Why register for me?

288
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,060
Yes, I talked to the doctor.

289
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,900
Then the doctor inquired your condition.

290
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,500
He said, for someone like you,

291
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,380
sitting at a desk with no exercise

292
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,300
and often socializing and drinking,

293
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,860
surely,

294
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,780
the quality isn't very good.

295
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,660
What? What quality?

296
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,980
The quality of the sperm.

297
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,820
Oh my.

298
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,380
Can you

299
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,620
think of something positive?

300
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,500
Honey,

301
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,940
this is very important.

302
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,860
We've decided to have a second child

303
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,700
and we need to be well-prepared.

304
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,850
Otherwise, what if the child is born

305
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,860
unhealthy?

306
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,980
You must go there.

307
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,940
Stop messing around.

308
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,140
I think I'm quite well-prepared.

309
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,980
For men of your age,

310
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,780
there are some issues more or less.

311
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,020
You're the one who's sick.

312
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,620
If you really don't want to go there,

313
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,460
that's fine.

314
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,100
Then just take these.

315
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,940
This is lycopene,

316
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,010
folic acid,

317
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,060
and zinc.

318
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,780
The doctor said men should

319
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,580
take just as much as women do.

320
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,540
After all,

321
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,820
the quality depends on you.

322
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,260
Why asking me to take so much medicine?

323
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,660
You're the one who's sick.

324
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,420
You neither take it

325
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,660
nor visit the doctor.

326
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,740
Why not just visit Andrology?

327
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,590
No, I won't.

328
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,050
When I was in the hospital today,

329
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,540
there were so many people at Andrology.

330
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,540
A long queue of people

331
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,220
were waiting there.

332
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,700
If you go tomorrow,

333
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,740
you might run into your colleague.

334
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,740
Say hello when you see them.

335
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,500
It would be great to have company.

336
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,540
Don't you think so?

337
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,780
Are you going to sleep or not?

338
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,740
Good night.

What are you doing?

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,700
Thinking of you.

346
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,960

Where

352
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,340
are we going?

353

The first birthday I've spent with you.

354
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,460
It must be of special significance.

355
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,460
Is it far?

356
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,500
Take a nap.

357
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,630
I'll wake you up when we arrive.

358
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,700
Then I will

359
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,800
take a nap.

360
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,070
Sure.

361
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,020

362
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,940
we've arrived.

Wake up.

364
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,220
How did we end up here?

365
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,820
How did you know about this place?

366
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,290
I said

367
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,390
it should have special significance.

368
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,200
What are you doing?

371

Can't I?

373
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,820
Coming.

- Yue.
- Ma.

I'm really sorry

376
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,500
about the errands.

377
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,380
Come in.

378
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,500
Yue, I better not go in.

379
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,340
It's fine, come in.

Alright, Yue.

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,730
Come in and have a glass of water.

383
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,580
Okay.

384
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,780
Sit here.

385
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,020
Okay.

386
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,710
- Thank you, Yue.
- Have a glass of water.

387
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,100
Eat some fruit.

388
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,300
Well,

389
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,900
Yue, if I had known

390
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,660
your back pain was so severe,

391
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,460
I would have sent it over earlier.

392
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,420
It's nothing.

393
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,980
Hu Cheng always talks about you

394
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,140
handling various matters in the company.

395
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,340
If it weren't for you,

396
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,140
such a capable assistant,

397
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,140
he would have been overwhelmed.

398
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,820
I'm flattered.

399
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,100
Mr. Hu is very capable.

400
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,060
He takes charge of

401
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,060
all the matters in the company,

402
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,180
and handles them pretty well.

403
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,340
We really admire him.

404
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,620
He is truly amazing.

405
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,300
How could he?

406
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,580
When we travelled,

407
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,380
he didn't even know how to book a hotel.

408
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,740
He was floundering there,

409
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,700
and in the end, I did the booking.

410
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,660
That's true.

411
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,780
Whenever Mr. Hu travels,

412
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,540
I always help book a hotel.

413
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,380
Sometimes I wonder

414
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,780
about his business.

415
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,820
Is he really out there doing business

416
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,620
or finding excuses to hang out?

417
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,300
The same this time.

418
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,580
Playing ball while talking business,

419
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,100
can it really be effective?

420
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,660
Indeed.

421
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,420
How he play ball at the seaside?

422
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,180
Who knows?

423
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,980
Don't worry.

424
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,020
I'll definitely talk to Hu Cheng,

425
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,320
asking him to increase your salary.

426
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,180
Thank you.

427
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,700
- I'm leaving now.
- Take care.

428
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,820
Goodbye.

429
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,140
(Tian Qiuzi)

430
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,260
(Thanks for an unforgettable birthday.)

431
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,860
Sorry

432
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,900
about asking you out

433
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,860
during this period.

434
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,120
I really couldn't bear to see you

435
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,780
staying in the house every day.

436
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,220
It's really beautiful here.

437
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,110
Starting from today,

438
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,770
I am your family.

439
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,370
I will always accompany you,

440
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,560
protect you.

441
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,520
I swear.

442
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,420
I will always be here.

443
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,780
Come quickly!

444
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,380
Coming.

445
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,820
Be careful.

446
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,220
Hello.

447
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,980
Got some information from his assistant,

448
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,380
who told me about the hotels.

449
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,660
I'll send it to you later.

450
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,860
Great!

451
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,030
Then hurry and send it to me.

452
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,340
There's a hotel.

453
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,940
Hu Cheng and Tian Qiuzi

454
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,620
should be there now.

455
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,700
Where is it?

456
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,900
I'll have Nie go over right away.

457
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,900
I've never seen such a beautiful sunset.

458
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,820
This birthday

459
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,080
was worth it.

460
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,060
Actually,

461
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,530
- Between us...
- I know what you want to say

462
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,330
But today is my birthday,

463
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,620
Can you not say it for now?

464
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,700
You shouldn't have chosen this place.

465
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,420
Really.

466
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,860
When I was a child, on my birthday,

467
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,620
only my grandma celebrated with me.

468
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,660
My parents never remembered.

469
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,060
It was always my grandma

470
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,260
to remind them on the phone.

471
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,830
Only then would they send a gift to me.

472
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,660
They only remembered

473
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,260
the birthday of their second child.

474
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,220
Are you talking about

475
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,540
the child born

476
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,470
after your parents remarried?

477
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,180
Although every gift my parents give me

478
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,860
is not something valuable

479
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,580
and quite shabby,

480
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,580
I still cherish them very much.

481
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,220
I treat each gift

482
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,220
as if it were a treasure.

483
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,620
But later on,

484
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,060
By the time I was 7 or 8 years old,

485
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,300
I realized that

486
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,580
those were toys for 3 or 4-year-old.

487
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,540
They were

488
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,420
things

489
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,580
their second child disliked.

490
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,060
Do you think I'm very pitiful?

491
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,590
I will give you

492
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,020
a gift that belongs only to you.

493
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,860
One that belongs only to me?

494
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,260
All I want is you.

495
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,540
Hello, I'd like to apply for membership.

496
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,850
Please fill out the application form.

497
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,100
Thank you.

498
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,840
Hello.

499
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,980
What room types are available here?

500
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,340
Sir, please take a look.

501
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,660
These are the room types at our hotel.

502
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,740
Okay, thank you.

503
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,380
Miss, your card is ready.

504
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,860
Thank you.

505
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,500
It's a diamond membership card.

506
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,140
Besides the 12% discount,

507
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,060
there're priority room selection rights,

508
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,900
is it?

509
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,830
Yes, rest assured.

510
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,660
These benefits will be guaranteed.

511
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,100
Thank you.

512
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,780
Sir.

513
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,730
Thank you.

514
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,580
It's nothing.

515
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,680
(Membership card application form)

516
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,140
Tian Qiuzi deposited $200,000

517
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,380
to get a membership card for the hotel.

518
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,150
She said it's a gift for her boyfriend.

519
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,080
She should know we've been there.

520
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,220
What did she mean by that?

521
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,460
Is it to erase memories,

522
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,080
or to declare sovereignty?

523
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,250
Her possessiveness is too strong.

524
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,540
Hu Cheng chose the wrong person.

525
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,420
I really don't understand

526
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,020
how those men

527
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,860
take their lovers to places

528
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,380
where they once dated their wives.

529
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,820
If only they would use their brains

530
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,940
and put in some effort,

531
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,700
they wouldn't end up

532
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,820
giving the same gifts

533
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,860
and going to the same places.

534
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,230
I thought

535
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,900
someone as meticulous as Hu Cheng

536
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,180
would not make such a basic mistake.

537
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,780
He is indeed meticulous,

538
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,860
but like all unfaithful men,

539
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,380
he is arrogant

540
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,940
and conceited.

541
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,620
In any case,

542
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,140
this membership card

543
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,060
is crucial evidence.

544
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,340
It would be best to find a way

545
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,500
to get it in hand.

546
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,620
When did you get the card?

547
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,180
Just when I checked out.

548
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,900
Aren't you afraid I might be upset?

549
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,420
I spent my own money.

550
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,460
Are you

551
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,860
constantly testing my limits?

552
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,220
It's my birthday.

553
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,140
I give myself a birthday gift

554
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,380
Is it not okay?

555
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,500
I said

556
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,580
I'd give a gift

557
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,740
for your birthday.

558
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,020
But I dislike spending your money.

559
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,060
The password is your birthdate

560
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,420
I really like it here.

561
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,740
I also hope

562
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,180
this place can hold memories for us.

563
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,460
Hope next time you come to the seaside,

564
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,500
you only remember

565
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,140
me.

566
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,740
Hello, Miss Li,

567
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,100
I am Ziyuan's mother.

568
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,660
Yes.

569
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,500
Ziyuan's water bottle was left there.

570
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,140
We had agreed to pick it up on Monday,

571
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,520
but he insisted

572
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,900
taking that water bottle.

573
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,540
Could you please send it over?

574
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,100
Make sure it's cash on delivery.

575
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,290
Please don't be polite with me.

576
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,330
Okay.

577
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,340
Alright.

578
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,490
See you on Monday.

579
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,340
Goodbye, teacher.

580
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,610
The door is open.

581
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,710
The door is closed.

582
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,960
Honey, you're back.

583
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,180
The internet is down again.

584
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,300
When you're free, could you check it?

585
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,260
Right over there.

586
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,780
Get someone to fix it.

587
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,140
It breaks often.

588
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,930
You are tired, have a glass of water.

589
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,620
Who is it?

590
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,980
It's the delivery.

591
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,420
Ziyuan left his water bottle

592
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,980
at the kindergarten.

593
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,420
I asked the teacher for a favor.

594
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,940
- Hello.
- Hello.

595
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,660
Poor signal and the internet is down.

596
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,620
I can't make the payment.

597
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,220
How about

598
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,180
with cash?

599
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,060
- Sure.
- Okay, thank you.

600
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,260
- Alright.
- Thank you.

601
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,310
Here you go.

602
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,300
Honey,

603
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,350
what card is this?

604
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,270
It seems to be

605
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,050
the hotel we used to frequent.

606
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,500
Have you been there recently?

607
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,380
It was a meeting with a client there.

608
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,270
As soon as I got there,

609
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,070
it brought back countless memories.

610
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,700
I guess the client manager noticed it.

611
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,980
I was completely fooled,

612
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,420
ended up getting a card.

613
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,460
Honey,

614
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,980
will you blame me

615
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,700
for spending money recklessly?

616
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,560
Someone as smart as you

617
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,420
can still be fooled?

618
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,260
Maybe,

619
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,300
deep down inside,

620
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,620
I just wanted to be fooled.

621
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,700
After all,

622
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,220
this place is very important to us.

623
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,180
It's very important.

624
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,540
Honey,

625
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,540
I didn't expect

626
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,140
you and I think alike.

627
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,540
I also feel

628
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,780
this place is very important to us.

629
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,180
Do you still remember

630
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,580
when

631
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,820
my dad passed away?

632
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,060
At that seaside,

633
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,540
you stayed with me for many days.

634
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,940
I said,

635
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,610
I only have one family member left.

636
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,460
You said,

637
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,620
you are also my family member.

638
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,660
I said,

639
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,660
I no longer have a complete family.

640
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,780
You said,

641
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,980
I will give you a complete home.

642
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,860
Everything is vivid in my memory.

643
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,100
Honey,

644
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,220
this place is really meaningful to us.

645
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,220
It truly holds great significance.

646
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,620
It seems this card was a right choice.

647
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,300
In a few days,

648
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,660
let's take Ziyuan with us

649
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,260
to revisit old places.

650
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,660
How about that?

651
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,030
Honey,

652
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,300
don't be sad anymore.

653
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,620
Are you thinking about the past?

654
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,060
The promise I made to you,

655
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,540
I have not forgotten it.

656
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,140
I will definitely fulfill it.

657
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,460
I will always be good to you.
