00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,750
I want to discuss something with you.

4
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,440
Can I go home a bit earlier these days?

5
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,720
The house is being renovated, you know.

6
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,350
Everyday after I get off work,

7
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,630
I go check the progress and pick out flaws.

8
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,350
My wife is at home alone.

9
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,350
I'm worried.

10
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,470
The renovation, right?

11
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,830
I would have forgotten about it.

12
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,350
However, the renovation

13
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,070
really needs to be monitored closely.

14
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,950
Otherwise, there will be many flaws.

15
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,720
Let's do like this.

16
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,510
I approve you to go home early.

17
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,030
Thank you.

18
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,070
After a while, when I'm done with it,

19
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,670
I'll treat you to a good meal.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,840
Let's talk about it later.

21
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,350
What stage is the renovation at now?

22
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,440
Seems like

23
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,070
the water and electricity are finished.

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,670
We are renovating the bathroom.

25
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,880
I'll go choose the appliances

26
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,470
and furniture in a few days.

27
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,350
Then it's all done.

28
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,950
Let me know if you need anything.

29
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,120
Let me know if you don't have enough money.

30
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,630
It's enough, it's enough.

31
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,600
Don't worry.

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,070
You don't have to worry about this.

33
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,240
Thank you.

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,440
With our relationship,

35
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,910
don't be so polite with me.

36
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,190
Ok, let's do this.

37
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,670
Could you repeat your quote for me?

38
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,310
How much?

39
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,000
Go ahead.

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,680
What are you looking at?

41
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,160
So focused.

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,560
Are you still here?

43
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,880
Luo Yating.

44
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,120
What do you mean by that?

45
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,600
Don't you know we are on a date?

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,670
I've already tolerated you for a long time.

47
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,590
All right.

48
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,600
I really hope

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,070
that you will be able to appreciate the man

50
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,880
whom you will be with in the future.

51
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,750
Just eat yourself.

52
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,880
Mr. Mo.

53
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,750
What a coincidence!

54
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,160
Ms. Luo.

55
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,610
Did you make an appointment with someone?

56
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,400
No, I came over to have a meal.

57
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,120
Let's eat together.

58
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,070
Ok.

59
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,040
Could you please help me bring over the food?

60
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,880
Thank you.

61
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,630
I thought

62
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,670
you had a quarrel.

63
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,600
With him?

64
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,560
Impossible.

65
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,880
So sure?

66
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,310
I don't associate with men I can't control.

67
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,350
You should know.

68
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,240
Come on.

69
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,470
Do you know

70
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,960
what I just came over for?

71
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,310
I thought

72
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,600
I could be a hero and save the beauty.

73
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,910
A hero saves a beauty?

74
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,800
Just you?

75
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,840
With your build,

76
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,790
can you beat him?

77
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,350
He is much younger than you.

78
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,360
I'm working out.

79
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,550
So I have

80
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,520
to exercise more with you.

81
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,470
What's the point of exercising with me?

82
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,960
Exercise with your girlfriend.

83
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,040
Here.

84
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,760
Girlfriend?

85
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,960
My girlfriend has already

86
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,040
dumped me.

87
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,840
Better not to mention it.

88
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,950
I have a presumptuous question.

89
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,360
Are you also one of those

90
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,040
who are against marriage?

91
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,630
I am right now.

92
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,920
Here.

93
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,120
Cheers

94
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,750
to our choices.

95
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,790
I wish I could have chosen

96
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,310
the path of being single

97
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,360
earlier.

98
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,480
What does it mean?

99
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,310
Long

100
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,350
long

101
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,360
long ago,

102
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,120
I had a

103
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,920
brief marriage.

104
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,870
It lasted for 49 days.

105
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,070
For me,

106
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,430
that was a disaster.

107
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,230
It was my disaster, not yours.

108
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,470
Don't look at me like that.

109
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,510
It's all over.

110
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,390
Being single.

111
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,510
Dad.

112
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,120
No matter what happens,

113
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,630
Dad will never leave you.

114
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,680
Dad loves you.

115
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,920
I love you too, Dad.

116
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,720
I have bought tickets for tomorrow

117
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,600
to let my parents go back to hometown.

118
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,680
I have also fired the cleaner.

119
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,190
We can go back to the way things were

120
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,040
and restore our life as a family of three.

121
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,720
I don't want my son

122
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,630
to live a life without his parents.

123
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,950
You are overthinking.

124
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,300
(Shangshi Center)

125
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,910
I have important matters to discuss.

126
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,600
- Why are you stopping me?
- Mr. Chen...

127
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,790
Mr. Chen.

128
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,030
It's ok. You go out first.

129
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,200
Please close the door for me.

130
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,480
Mr. Chen, have a seat.

131
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
What's the matter?

132
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
You are so anxious.

133
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,510
Ms. Luo, I have something to discuss with you.

134
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Before

135
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,790
Director Qin was investigated.

136
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,000
Turns out he was falsely accused.

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,910
Now it has unexpectedly fallen on me.

138
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,190
I think the company should investigate

139
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,070
those cowards who wrote report letters.

140
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,360
It shouldn't investigate people like us

141
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,710
who work diligently

142
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,480
for many years in the company.

143
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,320
Is it?

144
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,720
Mr. Chen,

145
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,280
how are you so sure

146
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,960
that someone reported you?

147
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,600
There must be someone

148
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,600
who deliberately retaliates against me.

149
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,880
Mr. Chen,

150
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,310
you need to think carefully

151
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,270
with whom

152
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,510
you've had conflicts in the past.

153
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,320
Impossible.

154
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,150
I have been in the company for so many years.

155
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,480
When I first came here,

156
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,150
I was just a salesperson.

157
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,120
Now I have become the GM of a department.

158
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,270
What do I rely on?

159
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,360
No background, resources, or connections.

160
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,200
What I rely on is

161
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,200
reputation,

162
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,760
business ability

163
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,800
interpersonal relationships

164
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,790
and value

165
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,600
I created for the company.

166
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,120
Exactly.

167
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,640
When a person reaches a certain height,

168
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,750
he will definitely be framed by someone.

169
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,880
No matter it's me

170
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,160
or Director Qin,

171
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,510
we are definitely framed by someone.

172
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,480
The investigation should stop immediately.

173
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,320
Is it?

174
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,790
What you said makes sense.

175
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,320
But Mr. Chen,

176
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,120
you have been in the company for so many years.

177
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,720
You should be confident in the company.

178
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,720
You can rest assured.

179
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,750
The investigation

180
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,270
will definitely go on.

181
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,910
And we will investigate it thoroughly.

182
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,280
The company's investigation

183
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,190
is also to provide you

184
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,320
with fairness and clarity.

185
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,070
You need to understand.

186
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,750
If it goes on, it will delay matters.

187
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,870
You came just in time.

188
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,720
I actually have something to ask you.

189
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,510
Your department and that...

190
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,910
Yaofeng Tech.

191
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,080
How long have you been collaborating?

192
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,360
Yaofeng Tech.

193
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,670
It's been

194
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,790
about a year or two.

195
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,270
Ms. Luo,

196
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,720
is there

197
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,270
anything

198
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,670
you want to know?

199
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,070
There is nothing I want to know.

200
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,560
I'm just asking casually, no big deal.

201
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:23,960
Something else?

202
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,750
Does the company

203
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,950
have to investigate me like this?

204
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,520
Staying stagnant like this

205
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
will delay the work.

206
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,910
This is a loss for the company.

207
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,750
Mr. Chen,

208
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,990
I have clearly said everything

209
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,990
that needs to be said.

210
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,670
Ok, then I will

211
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,270
cooperate with it.

212
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,480
I get back to work now.

213
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,600
Mr. Chen.

214
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,270
Be confident

215
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,390
in the company.

216
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,270
Confident.

217
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,200
Mr. Chen, I have inquired about it.

218
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,320
Is it Qin Can?

219
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,560
Qin Can has been investigating us recently.

220
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,560
But it's a task

221
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,480
assigned by Ms. Luo.

222
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,510
You mean

223
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,960
it's not Qin Can who reported me.

224
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,440
Why did Luo think of investigating me?

225
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,630
Things aren't that simple.

226
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,360
Check it thoroughly again.

227
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,040
Especially if anyone has investigated

228
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,840
the contracts in the past couple of years.

229
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,630
- Understand?
- Understand.

230
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,120
I want to see

231
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,480
who is trying to mess with me behind my back.

232
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,860
(Employee Personnel File Card)

233
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,360
The legal representatives of Licheng Anping

234
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,600
and Mingdu Club are the same person.

235
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,240
He has no special identity or background.

236
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,750
He's just an ordinary worker.

237
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,520
Currently, there is no way to prove

238
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,790
that he has a connection with Hu Cheng.

239
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,910
But there is one thing.

240
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,320
Look at his place of birth.

241
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,100
(Fengting Town, Tonghe County)

242
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,630
He and Hu Cheng are from the same hometown.

243
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,540
That's right.

244
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,120
I plan to go there

245
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,200
to meet this person.

246
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,390
You go there alone.

247
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,830
You must be careful.

248
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,670
Don't worry.

249
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,580
By the way, there is one thing

250
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,500
I've actually always wanted to ask you.

251
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,060
Say it.

252
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,700
Have you

253
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,340
been doing well?

254
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,500
I heard

255
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,140
that you two have broken up.

256
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,940
It's pretty good.

257
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,260
Those unpleasant things

258
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,300
have all passed.

259
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,820
Over time goes by,

260
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,940
it's easier to accept many things.

261
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,860
That's good.

262
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,940
Actually, we are all quite worried about you.

263
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
Standing in front of a big mountain,

264
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,500
only by climbing over

265
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,260
can you live your life easily.

266
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,220
But only you know

267
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,260
the pain and suffering in the process.

268
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,940
None of us expected it either.

269
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,900
Who would have thought

270
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,500
you two fell in love after that gathering.

271
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,980
In our opinion,

272
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,940
you both are not from the same world at all.

273
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,540
Yeah.

274
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,060
Perhaps what lies behind the mystery

275
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,260
is what makes people feel disgusted.

276
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,100
You know what?

277
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,140
During that time, I often thought

278
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,300
if I really did something wrong.

279
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,820
I always felt

280
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,540
he set up a firewall in front of me

281
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,940
to stop me seeing another world.

282
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,060
Really, when I think about it now,

283
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,100
it's just too terrifying.

284
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,660
I understand you very well.

285
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,340
I mean it.

286
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,780
So I should learn from you.

287
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,100
Be a little braver.

288
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,580
Bravely move forward

289
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,940
and then greet victory

290
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,180
with a smile.

291
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,420
Actually,

292
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,620
no matter if it's a victory

293
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,500
or a defeat,

294
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,740
it's not that important.

295
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,490
To start over is the most important thing.

296
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,180
You're right.

297
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,820
So we must remember clearly

298
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,340
that the steering wheel of our lives

299
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,620
is in our own hands.

300
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,460
Is that correct?

301
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,300
Let's work hard together.

302
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,100
You keep it up too.

303
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,460
(Sunkin Center)

304
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,300
Uncle,

305
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,380
Yue went to meet Lawyer Mu Xiao

306
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,740
this afternoon.

307
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,580
Ok.

308
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
Continue to follow her.

309
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,860
Report to me at any time

310
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,980
if there is any situation.

311
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,820
Ok, Uncle.

312
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,700
I was quite worried about you before coming.

313
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,900
It seems

314
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,900
that everything is good now.

315
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,420
It's just because you came.

316
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,540
Don't think like that.

317
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,620
Wei, come over for tea.

318
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,260
Ok, ok, I'm coming.

319
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,900
Let's go eat something.

320
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,380
Come here.

321
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,700
Be careful.

322
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,500
We just finished dinner,

323
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,700
and now we're eating so much again.

324
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,820
It can help you digest.

325
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,660
Have some tea.

326
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,580
Let me help me.

327
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,380
- Ok.
- Thank you.

328
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,220
You're welcome.

329
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,100
By the way, Cheng,

330
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,660
I interviewed several people today.

331
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,620
One of them is wearing a black shirt.

332
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,540
Do you remember?

333
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,380
I have to say,

334
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,940
as soon as I saw him,

335
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,020
I immediately thought of

336
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,100
how Cheng looked like back in the day.

337
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,500
Compared to my days back then,

338
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,660
he's far behind, right?

339
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,820
Yes, yes, yes.

340
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,660
There is a bit of a gap in appearance.

341
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,260
But Yue, do you know?

342
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,620
When Cheng entered the student council,

343
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,220
I immediately felt that this person

344
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,510
was not ordinary and could success.

345
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,460
He will be promising.

346
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,660
See?

347
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,820
Sure enough.

348
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,500
Doesn't that confirm what I said?

349
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,980
In what way is he not ordinary?

350
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,780
His eyes.

351
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,020
This guy has a fierce look

352
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,260
in his eyes.

353
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,500
How frightening!

354
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,220
With fierce look,

355
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,460
he must have scared all the girls away.

356
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,180
Not that.

357
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,580
There were so many girls who like Cheng.

358
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,260
It's hard to tell how long the line is.

359
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,660
Wei,

360
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,260
in college,

361
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,700
did he have a girlfriend?

362
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,020
He is quite mysterious.

363
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,300
He has never told me about it.

364
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,860
I haven't dated anyone.

365
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,660
You are my first love.

366
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,100
Haven't you been married once?

367
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,660
Why so serious?

368
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,940
Can't we talk

369
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,180
about this topic?

370
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,740
There's nothing that can't be mentioned.

371
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,260
What do you want to know?

372
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,300
Yue,

373
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,940
things from the past

374
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,140
have passed.

375
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,900
You are doing very well now.

376
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,930
This is the most important thing.

377
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,980
Don't be so nervous.

378
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,500
I am just purely curious.

379
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,700
A man as excellent as my husband,

380
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,100
successful in his career,

381
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,300
and kind to people.

382
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,420
How could anyone

383
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,900
bear to leave him?

384
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,580
Yeah, Yue.

385
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,940
Cheng is great.

386
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,300
Especially for you,

387
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,700
he is really good.

388
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,820
Was he not good to his ex-wife?

389
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,060
It's my fault

390
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,220
to choose the wrong person.

391
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,180
If I had met you earlier,

392
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,940
I could have avoided a lot of detours.

393
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,620
Is it?

394
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,540
Wei and his wife

395
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,140
are still so focused on health.

396
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,940
We should learn from them too.

397
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,020
What you are actually afraid of

398
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,580
is not losing me at all.

399
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,420
What is it?

400
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,220
What you are afraid of

401
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,540
is losing the marriage.

402
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,540
We have talked about this issue many times.

403
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,620
I told you

404
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,620
that my last marriage was a huge failure.

405
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,300
I really don't want to mention it again.

406
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,180
Can you show me some respect?

407
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,940
Ok.

408
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,460
I respect you.

409
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,380
(Mu Xiao)

410
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,860
(Can you help me check who is Hu Cheng's ex?)

411
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,590
Listen to the teacher today as well.

412
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,220
- Good boy.
- Goodbye.

413
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,180
We haven't arrived yet.

414
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,300
- Ms. Li.
- Ziyuan.

415
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,540
Thank you.

416
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,380
Mom, be careful on the road.

417
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,900
Hurry up, bye.

418
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,980
- Bye, Ziyuan.
- Bye.

419
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,820
Thank you.

420
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,740
I fount out

421
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,110
who is Hu Cheng's ex-wife.

422
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,340
You know her.

423
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,380
Ms. Luo.

424
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,740
After you.

425
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,540
After you.

426
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,700
Director Qin.

427
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,420
Have a seat.

428
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,540
Yue,

429
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,420
you've been absent for three consecutive days.

430
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,780
You can deduct my salary

431
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,240
according to the number of days I was absent.

432
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,980
Being absent without leave is a violation.

433
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,140
You might be fired by the company.

434
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,140
I came today to apply for remote work.

435
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,260
Please give me a week.

436
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,060
Yue,

437
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,420
do you know what you are doing?

438
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,580
Luo Yating

439
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,660
is investigating Chen Pingzhang.

440
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,580
If Hu Cheng has anything to do with Chen,

441
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,340
it will be found out soon.

442
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,380
I just want to help you.

443
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,460
But the premise is

444
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,820
that you have to trust me.

445
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,220
You've already helped me a lot.

446
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,020
Trust me.

447
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,420
Give me a week.

448
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,860
One week later,

449
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,660
everything will return to normal.

450
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,540
We have three classes.

451
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,100
A teacher handles about ten students.

452
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,220
It is more suitable for kids' growth.

453
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,300
Our teachers are also

454
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,180
professionally trained preschool teachers.

455
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,500
What do you think?

456
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,540
It's pretty good.

457
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,660
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

458
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,820
After the procedures are completed,

459
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,100
directly take the kid here.

460
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,460
Fine. Next week,

461
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,780
I'll bring Ziyuan over to take a look

462
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,020
and adapt to it first.

463
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,860
Ok.

464
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,060
Looking forward to Hu Ziyuan joining us.

465
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,100
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

466
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,940
Thank you.

467
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,940
Take care.

468
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,940
Ok.

469
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,780
Mom.

470
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,460
Niuniu went back to kindergarten today.

471
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,300
Really?

472
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Niuniu

473
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,540
played with us for a little while.

474
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,420
She was taken away by her mom.

475
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,020
Qin Jiaojiao cried very sadly.

476
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,300
I promised Qin Jiaojiao

477
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,500
that I won't leave.

478
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,780
Ziyuan,

479
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,580
even if

480
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,860
you and Jiaojiao have separated,

481
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,580
you are still good friends.

482
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,420
Is that correct?

483
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,380
Well,

484
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,900
will I break up with Qin Jiaojiao?

485
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,020
Little boy,

486
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,820
here are the food you want.

487
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,740
Thank you.

488
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,650
No need to be so polite.

489
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,540
You...

490
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,740
Why does your face look so bad?

491
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,500
Thank you.

492
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,340
What exactly happened to you?

493
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,140
You can talk to me about it.

494
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,540
He found me.

495
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,060
Who?

496
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,820
Who found you?

497
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,900
My ex-husband.

498
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,900
Do you have other places to go?

499
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,900
I really have no other way out.

500
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,180
I can try to help you find a place.

501
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,620
Wei, do you remember?

502
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,860
Back in the day,

503
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,500
we had a farewell meal

504
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,380
right here.

505
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,020
I remember.

506
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,780
Thinking back now,

507
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,700
the farewell dinner truly

508
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,940
lives up to its name.

509
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,420
It's just the two of us left.

510
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,140
Those people don't matter.

511
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,380
Out of sight, out of mind.

512
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,660
You are just too lonely,

513
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,940
lonely in a solitary and dictatorial way.

514
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,260
How come you don't stay in touch

515
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,660
with none of our classmates?

516
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,340
They excluded me.

517
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,620
Wei,

518
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,980
if they hadn't excluded me,

519
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,580
we wouldn't have had the chance to get close.

520
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,780
Back in the day,

521
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,580
you said to me,

522
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,500
"Cheng,

523
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,860
are we men?

524
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,140
A man must have ambitions.

525
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,700
We must climb higher."

526
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,420
I...

527
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,660
Did I say that?

528
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,500
Later, for your words,

529
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,860
for the sake of becoming a successful man,

530
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,340
I have sacrificed a lot.

531
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,620
I sacrificed my dignity.

532
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,940
I was trampled by others

533
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,020
and insulted by others.

534
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,580
Wei, do you still remember

535
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,980
that woman from back then?

536
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,220
After the divorce,

537
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,540
she tried

538
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,940
to take everything from me.

539
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,700
She has been blacklisting me everywhere,

540
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,140
making it impossible for me to find a job.

541
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,060
I went to your house to look for you.

542
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,400
You were so hungry that you looked unkempt.

543
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,180
In a whole year...

544
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,340
In a whole year,

545
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,740
I didn't make a single penny.

546
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,580
I was forced

547
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,980
to study patents at home.

548
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,500
That's how Yaofeng Tech was developed.

549
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,060
So in this case,

550
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,020
I should thank her, right?

551
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,020
Go in and take a look.

552
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,260
Come in.

553
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,740
This is the lounge.

554
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,820
The conditions might be a little worse.

555
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,940
But you can stay as long as you want.

556
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,620
It's pretty good.

557
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,780
Thank you.

558
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,140
Don't be afraid.

559
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,780
It's very safe here.

560
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,100
There are people in similar situations.

561
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,370
We have experience.

562
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,300
The community and the police

563
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,540
will also protect us.

564
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,720
So you can rest assured and live here.

565
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,580
Ms. Xia, thank you

566
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,640
for coming over this late.

567
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,500
I should thank you.

568
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,020
Thank you and Lawyer Mu

569
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,460
for helping us find the foundation.

570
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,800
As long as the service station can reopen,

571
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,840
that's fine.

572
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,180
Ning Yue,

573
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,140
when will you come back to join us again?

574
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,900
Soon.

575
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,260
Then we will leave first.

576
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,420
You have a good rest tonight.

577
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,910
If you need anything,

578
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,140
just call me.

579
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,900
You...

580
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,260
You and Yue haven't made up yet.

581
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,420
Don't push her too hard.

582
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,180
Really, don't push her too hard.

583
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,700
I have said all the good words.

584
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,220
But she just doesn't let me go.

585
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,380
Everyday she's making a fuss with me.

586
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,620
How can this woman's temper be so big?

587
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,340
For her,

588
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,780
I have already shown all the courage

589
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,140
and all the inclusiveness of a man.

590
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,220
Could it be that she wants

591
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,540
to hold this against me my whole life?

592
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,860
But Cheng,

593
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,180
about the matter with Manager Tian,

594
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,900
it ultimately comes down to you

595
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,660
being in the wrong.

596
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,820
The thing has already happened.

597
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,980
And I have already apologized to her.

598
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,820
Is that correct?

599
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,980
We are a family.

600
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,540
A family should embrace

601
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,100
all responsibilities and mistakes.

602
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,940
Is that correct?

603
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,380
When enjoying the good times,

604
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,340
why doesn't she speak so confidently?

605
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,340
You know you made a mistake, right?

606
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,580
Show some sincerity in admitting your fault.

607
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,020
Cherish your family.

608
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,300
Truly

609
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,380
cherish the people who care about you.

610
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,340
Everyone has their own way of living.

611
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,980
For me,

612
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,100
I have resolved all work-related matters

613
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,980
and made Ning Yue not leave me,

614
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,510
then I succeed.

615
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,940
All right.

616
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,420
You have the ability.

617
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,980
I can't persuade you.

618
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,860
Wenwen,

619
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,220
let's go, time to get off work.

620
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,660
Someone is slacking off at work.

621
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,500
I'll report you.

622
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,420
No, no, no.

623
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,420
Where's the boss?

624
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,940
He left early.

625
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,660
Why are you so sleepy?

626
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,380
Don't mention it.

627
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,570
The kid from my neighbor

628
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,660
was extremely noisy yesterday.

629
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,960
I didn't sleep at all last night.

630
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,700
I won't bother you anymore.

631
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,780
Go back to sleep soon.

632
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,620
Come on.

633
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,700
What's the matter?

634
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,460
Here's the thing.

635
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,140
I bought my grandma an electric fan.

636
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,180
It shows it has already arrived.

637
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,260
But it hasn't been delivered yet.

638
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,060
I want her to use it as soon as possible.

639
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,180
So I want to pick it up myself.

640
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,420
But I'm afraid...

641
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,260
Stop talking.

642
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,220
Let's go.

643
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,540
So straightforward!

644
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,020
Then I'll treat you to dinner.

645
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,100
No problem.

646
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,660
Yue showed up in the morning

647
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,380
to apply for working from home.

648
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,460
Maybe the child is too young

649
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,640
and she can't take care of everything.

650
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,060
Well,

651
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,260
why can't Dad apply

652
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,340
for working from home?

653
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,820
How do you know

654
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,220
Ning Yue's husband

655
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,860
doesn't take care of the kid at home?

656
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,380
Don't you think Ning Yue

657
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,540
looks like a single mother?

658
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,380
Sorry.

659
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,380
Let's each take one side.

660
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,220
No need.

661
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,820
Your method will make us

662
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,660
more tired.

663
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,700
The design of this box is really unreasonable.

664
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,100
There's not even a handle.

665
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,820
There's really no way to move it.

666
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,780
Isn't someone working out recently?

667
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,940
In vain?

668
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,700
How could it be in vain?

669
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,180
Feel my muscle here.

670
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,460
It's almost going to rip my clothes.

671
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,820
This is my tactic.

672
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,300
Fartlek training.

673
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,260
Do you understand?

674
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,100
What a strange method!

675
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,180
You must be hungry, right?

676
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,260
I'll treat you to a meal.

677
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,860
Eat?

678
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,580
I want to eat.

679
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,540
But

680
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,860
look at this way.

681
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,660
Where can we find a restaurant?

682
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,740
I'm familiar with this area.

683
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,700
Come with me.

684
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,220
Wait for me.

685
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,500
Let's sit there.

686
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,460
Ok, ok, ok.

687
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,140
Wei,

688
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,460
instead, it's you

689
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,020
who slacks off.

690
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,380
Each moment brings a different thought.

691
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,220
I used to desperately rush up

692
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,620
and climb up,

693
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,620
but for what?

694
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,100
Isn't it just to have a better life

695
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,660
with the kid and wife?

696
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,380
The current situation is pretty good.

697
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,020
I am quite satisfied.

698
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,620
You

699
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,060
have been tied up by your wife.

700
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,220
It's really not that.

701
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,020
My wife is not easy too.

702
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,540
She is still at work now.

703
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,060
And she has to take care of the kid.

704
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,460
I take care of the household more.

705
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,260
That's what I should do.

706
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,580
It's not that hard for women, is it?

707
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,900
What you said is not right.

708
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,060
Think about it. I had nothing at that time.

709
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,380
My wife was willing to follow me

710
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,980
and endure hardships together.

711
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,220
To be honest,

712
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,940
her contribution to this family

713
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,420
is much greater than mine.

714
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,780
I mean it.

715
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,580
I laughed so hard that I got a cramp.

716
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,740
That's not a cramp.

717
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,940
A cramp happens here.

718
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,180
You are covering the liver.

719
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,460
Your liver hurts.

720
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,380
Cook for yourself?

721
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,940
You actually know how to cook.

722
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,260
I notice that you have a stereotype

723
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,100
about me.

724
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,820
Isn't it normal for me to cook?

725
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,540
Ordering takeout is normal.

726
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,900
Are you a young person?

727
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,620
What does this have to do with age?

728
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,380
It seems I don't know you

729
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,540
well enough.

730
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:14,980
That's true.

731
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,300
You don't know me

732
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,260
at all.

733
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,660
It's good to be able to cook for yourself.

734
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,020
However, ordering takeout is more casual.

735
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,980
You can eat whatever you want.

736
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,340
Cooking for yourself is the same.

737
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,580
Cook whatever you want to eat.

738
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,820
Dishes that you couldn't cook

739
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,960
can be learned by searching online.

740
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,940
And you get an extra skill for no reason.

741
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,020
It's very rewarding.

742
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,620
Most importantly, cooking for yourself

743
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,860
is much cleaner than ordering takeout.

744
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,700
Stop, stop, stop.

745
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,820
You said the same words

746
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,780
as my mom.

747
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,740
Here comes the noodles.

748
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,500
Eat it while it's hot.

749
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,020
I'm telling you,

750
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,100
you will think that ordering takeout is better.

751
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,540
Recently,

752
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,940
I really feel tired.

753
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,940
Maybe it's because I'm getting older.

754
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,500
Powerless.

755
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,820
Wei,

756
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,740
don't say things like that.

757
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,180
We are both still in our prime.

758
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,700
I really want to take a break.

759
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,500
Wei,

760
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
are you just wanting to take a break

761
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,540
or

762
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,220
leave?

763
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,180
Don't joke around with me like that.

764
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,980
Has any headhunting company

765
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,140
contacted you again?

766
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,300
You know

767
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,100
I won't let you go no matter what.

768
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,380
Wei, the contract

769
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,900
with Xianbin Capital is almost done.

770
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,940
At such times,

771
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,540
how can you say such discouraging words?

772
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,900
Wei,

773
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,340
if you can't walk anymore,

774
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,420
I will carry you.

775
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,740
Don't worry. Just follow me,

776
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,460
I will definitely give you the best.

777
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,980
I will ensure you live the best life.

778
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,740
Here.

779
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,540
Don't be so hard on yourself.

780
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,580
I have already called for a car.

781
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,060
Thank you, Miss Pan.

782
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,060
Hello? Ning Yue.

783
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,580
Yes, the contract is with me.

784
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,980
I will send it to you in a while.

785
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,540
All right.

786
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,700
Why hasn't anyone taken the order yet?

787
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,220
May I ask

788
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,540
if you are from Zhongzhi?

789
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,940
Didn't expect it to be so coincidental.

790
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,180
Really sorry to trouble you.

791
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,740
It's not a bother.

792
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,980
I happen to be on my way.

793
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,140
That place you were just at

794
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,340
is not very easy to get a taxi.

795
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,700
By the way,

796
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,620
I often heard my wife

797
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,460
say

798
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,140
her colleagues take good care of her.

799
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,100
I didn't expect

800
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,860
you are all so young.

801
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,500
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

802
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Usually she takes care of us more.

803
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,300
So

804
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,140
she actually is very reluctant to leave.

805
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,460
I just heard you call my wife.

806
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,700
Is there still something work-related

807
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,860
that hasn't finished the handover?

808
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,100
She has a contract which is not completed.

809
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,380
Yue is really serious at work.

810
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,700
Yes.

811
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,780
She is someone

812
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,340
who finishes what has been started.

813
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,540
Yue is truly exceptional.

814
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,380
We should learn from her.

815
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,820
Thank you.

816
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,140
Is it easy to take?

817
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,180
Why did you pinch me just now?

818
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,820
I'm afraid you talk too much.

819
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,580
I know.

820
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,980
You're afraid that I will tell him

821
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,380
Yue is doing outsourcing, right?

822
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,700
Exactly.

823
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,380
He is Yue's husband.

824
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,820
But he doesn't know anything.

825
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,980
Moreover,

826
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,460
don't you think he is

827
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,660
getting my words out of me?

828
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,500
That's weird.

829
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,460
I thought you just like to see the fun.

830
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,940
I didn't expect you to be quite sensitive.

831
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,620
You don't understand this.

832
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,940
Onlookers

833
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,940
know the subtle nature of humanity the best.

834
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,780
What?

835
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,660
What nature? Wait for me!

836
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,980
It's subtle nature.

837
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,020
