3
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,370
Mom.

4
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,050
Haven't you learned how to use it yet?

5
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,840
Why are you still washing it by hands?

6
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,410
Are you crying?

7
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,410
Did Dad bully you?

8
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,410
I will go find him.

9
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,410
Mom.

10
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,080
Mom.

11
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,390
- Here, Dad.
- Have a drink.

12
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,730
Have a sip, come on.

13
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,570
Cheers.

14
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,610
I've heard

15
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,630
yesterday you...

16
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,080
Yue,

17
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,270
sorry to wake you up.

18
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,170
Come. Sit for a while.

19
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,760
I'm not sitting.

20
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,200
Your mom's thing,

21
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,240
it's all my fault.

22
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,650
Until your mom is in a better mood,

23
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,780
Cheng and I

24
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,300
will definitely bring her back.

25
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,860
I will bow to her

26
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,860
to apologize.

27
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,170
They hit together.

28
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,650
No need for that.

29
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,370
Right there.

30
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,420
Isn't the money

31
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,380
for the nursing home already paid

32
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,540
until next year?

33
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,440
Well...

34
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,540
I get it arranged in advance.

35
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,420
It's not necessarily a bad thing, right?

36
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,860
You had already planned this, right?

37
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,880
Here.

38
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,020
- Ziyuan.
- Here.

39
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,500
Have a sip, come on!

40
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,980
- Here.
- Have a sip.

41
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,940
- Cheers.
- Hu Ziyuan.

42
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,700
Go to bed early.

43
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,020
You have to go to school tomorrow.

44
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,340
Mom,

45
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,220
I want to play

46
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,500
with Grandpa and Dad

47
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,580
a little longer.

48
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,820
Sure.

49
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,980
Real man!

50
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,540
Hu family's man!

51
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,540
Good.

52
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,400
- Drink with me.
- Play a little longer.

53
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,540
Let's have a drink.

54
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,630
Drink deeply.

55
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,070
Try this.

56
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,100
Speak.

57
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,740
The R&D progress is behind again.

58
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,380
I urged them to submit the samples this week.

59
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,060
The design icon can be finalized soon.

60
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,820
Cheng.

61
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,140
I got it.

62
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,740
You keep an eye on it.

63
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,940
Fine.

64
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,300
My wife asked

65
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,100
when you and Yue are free

66
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,220
to come over for a meal.

67
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,380
You and Yue...

68
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,380
Is everything ok?

69
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,700
This is the divorce lawyer

70
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,020
she found behind my back.

71
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,780
In front of me,

72
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,580
she said she wants to start over.

73
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,900
But she is preparing for the divorce.

74
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,260
So what do you plan to do now?

75
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,740
(Mu Xiao)

76
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,780
I won't let her leave me.

77
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,660
Ning Yue.

78
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,060
Come and take a look.

79
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,020
I suspect

80
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,820
Hu Cheng secretly transferred assets.

81
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,540
Are you ok?

82
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,300
I was laid off by the company.

83
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,340
Laid off?

84
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,940
Weren't you just become a regular worker?

85
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,380
It's Hu Cheng again?

86
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,940
It's so hard.

87
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,820
We just built up the trust.

88
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,420
Ms. Mu,

89
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,420
a client for you.

90
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,060
Don't you know I'm in a meeting?

91
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,020
It's Mr. Hu from Yaofeng Tech.

92
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,100
(Partners' Office)

93
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,700
(Mu Xiao)

94
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,340
(Mu Xiao)

95
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,890
You are Ms. Mu, right?

96
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,900
Pretty impressive.

97
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,300
You and my wife

98
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,380
entered the profession at the same time.

99
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,820
Now you are already

100
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,140
a partner in the law firm.

101
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,060
If it weren't for the family,

102
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,660
Ning Yue

103
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,700
probably would have surpassed me long ago.

104
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,060
I think you are too modest.

105
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,900
It's not that.

106
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,820
So you mean

107
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,060
that my wife's talent has been hindered

108
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,380
by the family all these years?

109
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,460
I think

110
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,300
whether a woman is happy or not

111
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,500
mainly

112
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,140
depends on her family.

113
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,060
Isn't it, honey?

114
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,660
That also depends

115
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,340
on whether the family

116
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,020
has no betrayal,

117
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,140
no deception,

118
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,140
and no double

119
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,420
standards.

120
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,100
Right?

121
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,260
I completely agree.

122
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,620
Ms. Mu,

123
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,540
are you married?

124
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,540
Currently single.

125
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,340
Is that so?

126
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,620
Well,

127
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,500
that's too bad.

128
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,100
Nothing bad.

129
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,420
In this life,

130
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,420
one has to keep adjusting the steering wheel.

131
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,140
The bumpy road ahead

132
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,620
may not be all dark.

133
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,100
Similarly,

134
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,620
the seemingly flat road

135
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,260
may suddenly be confronted

136
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,180
by a pack of wolves and tigers.

137
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,340
As long as I can live an enjoyable life,

138
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,180
it's luck.

139
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,900
Luck?

140
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,980
Ms. Mu,

141
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,820
you are a divorce lawyer.

142
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,180
How many families do you break apart this year?

143
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,900
Do many people hate you for that?

144
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,780
You need to be careful.

145
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,260
Beware

146
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,060
of divine retribution.

147
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,540
Mr. Hu, you are wrong on this one.

148
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,420
As many people hate me,

149
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,420
there are as many people who thank me.

150
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,020
What's more,

151
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,660
I've never been

152
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,660
superstitious.

153
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,260
Ms. Mu has something else to attend to.

154
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,820
Let's head back first.

155
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,180
What do you want to do?

156
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,060
It's rare to have this opportunity

157
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,790
to catch up with your good girlfriend.

158
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,900
We should

159
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,620
have a good chat, don't we?

160
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,500
I consulted with Ms. Mu

161
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,860
about the layoff compensation

162
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,140
today.

163
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,980
Aren't you surprised?

164
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,740
About this matter,

165
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,540
Mr. Chen just informed me today.

166
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,220
It's not a bid deal.

167
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,540
Being laid off is better than being fired.

168
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,300
There's also severance pay.

169
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,820
This time

170
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,060
you can

171
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,940
spend more time with our son now.

172
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,180
Pretty good.

173
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,900
I know

174
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,180
Ning Yue's work ability well.

175
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,460
She is outstanding wherever she is.

176
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,540
Mr. Hu,

177
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,460
you are overthinking.

178
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,620
Ms. Mu,

179
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,900
I think you should be off work now.

180
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,140
Why don't you

181
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,300
come to my house and have a good chat?

182
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,940
I'm really sorry.

183
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,820
I have clients later.

184
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,020
Well,

185
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,260
honey,

186
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,060
we'll take our leave now.

187
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,780
Let's keep in touch often.

188
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,140
See you.

189
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,140
Did you follow me?

190
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,260
I thought

191
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,020
it was you who had her follow me.

192
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,540
What do you want to say?

193
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,820
Just say it directly.

194
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,060
I want to say,

195
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,060
since we're starting over,

196
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,820
we should show some sincerity.

197
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,140
Let's meet with sincerity.

198
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,020
Ok.

199
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,300
Then you tell me

200
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,580
whether it is related to you

201
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,940
that I was laid off from the company.

202
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
You suspect it was arranged by me?

203
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,250
Don't ask back.

204
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,460
Of course not.

205
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,020
You don't believe it?

206
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,380
No.

207
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,940
If you don't believe it,

208
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,460
what can I do about it?

209
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,540
But if you can stay at home,

210
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,660
it is indeed a good thing

211
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,140
for me and this family.

212
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,580
I want to ask you how long

213
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,660
have you been in contact with Ms. Mu?

214
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,300
I have already told you.

215
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,780
I contacted Ms. Mu

216
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,420
to inquire

217
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,460
about the severance pay.

218
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,040
Yue,

219
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
you said you want to start over.

220
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,180
Is it sincere?

221
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,140
Yes.

222
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,300
Of course.

223
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,760
Good morning, Ms. Luo.

224
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,540
You have achieved such success today.

225
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,940
You must be someone extraordinary.

226
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,300
I don't hope

227
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,700
or believe that

228
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,660
you become someone else's gunman,

229
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,580
without realizing it.

230
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,900
That's it.

231
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,660
Mr. Chen, take a look at this contract

232
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,880
and see if there are any other issue.

233
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,140
Mr. Chen.

234
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,100
Ms. Luo.

235
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,660
Leave it with me. You can go back first.

236
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,060
- Are you free?
- Here.

237
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,820
I am free. Come and sit here, please.

238
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,420
I have a meeting in about ten minutes.

239
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,940
What instructions do you have?

240
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,540
It's not an instruction.

241
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,780
I'll finish very soon.

242
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,260
Just chatting with you.

243
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,540
Ok, you go ahead.

244
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,420
There's nothing much to say.

245
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,180
About the company's

246
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,420
layoffs.

247
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,300
I just found out

248
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,700
that the company has been

249
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,420
tacitly allowing the Legal Department

250
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,180
not to participate in this layoff.

251
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,640
Yes.

252
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
Just because of this,

253
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,060
many departments think

254
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,420
they are given with special treatment.

255
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,940
They have many complaints.

256
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,420
Haven't I analyzed this matter with you?

257
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,780
You just joined the company,

258
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,140
seized the opportunity to rectify

259
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,300
and took the lead to show merit.

260
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,900
That's great.

261
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,140
Pretty good.

262
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,780
The employee who was laid off this time,

263
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,780
Ning Yue,

264
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,340
do you know her?

265
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,300
I don't know Ning Yue.

266
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,140
Is that so?

267
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,540
You must have seen her information too.

268
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,900
A housewife who is isolated from society.

269
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,820
She has missed the golden learning age.

270
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,780
What can such a person do?

271
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,720
What can she do?

272
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,820
She can't do anything.

273
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,780
The company's intention

274
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,820
is definitely to give her a job

275
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,540
and pay her some money

276
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,300
out of human sentiment and face-saving,

277
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,460
and only let her go

278
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,460
when the right opportunity arises.

279
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,580
Now the company

280
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,940
is laying off employees.

281
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,860
Someone like her who is idle

282
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,140
is just the right candidate, isn't she?

283
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,500
If not her, then who will be laid off?

284
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,740
I've heard that her ability is quite good.

285
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,900
Besides being able to complete her duties,

286
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,220
she can still help

287
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,260
colleagues.

288
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
Her abilities

289
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,020
have actually far exceeded

290
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,540
the scope of her work.

291
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,220
This time she was laid off.

292
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,180
You know

293
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,260
Director Qin is not very satisfied.

294
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,100
Is that so?

295
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,900
The subordinates are not rigorous

296
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,140
in their work.

297
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,900
What personal grudges are there

298
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,380
between you and Ning Yue?

299
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,620
Impossible. How could that be?

300
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,140
I don't even know this person.

301
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,260
But I heard

302
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,260
that she has some connections

303
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,140
and was forcefully pushed in.

304
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,340
Is that so?

305
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,780
The layoff list

306
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,220
has already been sent out.

307
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,420
If we go to the president because of this,

308
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,260
it is not very appropriate, right?

309
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,140
When did I say

310
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,300
that I will go to the president?

311
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,860
It's such a small matter.

312
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,780
- Yes.
- It's already in the past.

313
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,140
But Mr. Chen,

314
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,860
if I find out

315
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,380
that someone within the company

316
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,660
uses power for personal gain,

317
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,980
I won't easily let him go.

318
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,220
You take it seriously.

319
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,700
I will definitely conduct

320
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,660
a thorough review next time

321
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,600
and make a careful decision.

322
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,780
I mean what I say.

323
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,780
Take care.

324
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,140
Mr. Chen,

325
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,180
I have a particularly small matter

326
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,340
to ask you for help.

327
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,980
Go ahead.

328
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,140
There is an employee named Ning Yue

329
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,420
under Qin Can.

330
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,340
Ning Yue...

331
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,620
She is the wife of Mr. Hu.

332
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,620
My departure from Ruixin

333
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,980
is related to her.

334
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,660
She wrote an anonymous letter to my leader

335
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,620
and reported me,

336
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,580
so that I lost my job.

337
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,420
Anonymous letter?

338
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,460
Are you sure she wrote it?

339
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,700
Who else could it be but her?

340
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,940
How do you want me

341
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,660
to help you?

342
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,380
Since she made me lose my job,

343
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,580
she shouldn't work either.

344
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,820
This is the performance report

345
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,780
of Qin Can's department.

346
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,380
I believe it won't be difficult for you

347
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,780
to find some issues from this.

348
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,180
Whether it is difficult or not

349
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,900
depends on

350
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,860
that if you

351
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,540
can do me a favor.

352
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,980
What? You're also framed, Mr. Chen?

353
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,580
Wherever you go in the rivers and lakes,

354
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,900
you can't avoid getting your shoes wet.

355
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,300
I am the former PM of Ruixin Investment Bank.

356
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,540
I want to report Qin Can

357
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,700
for illegally accepting money

358
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,220
for personal gain by taking advantage

359
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,460
of his position at work.

360
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,900
Will this kind of report

361
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,380
be useful to them?

362
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,140
He can prove

363
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,300
his innocence quickly, right?

364
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,620
He is

365
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,220
at a critical moment for promotion.

366
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,460
This

367
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,620
could significantly impact his future.

368
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,100
Mr. Chen, do you really hate that guy?

369
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,900
Blocking others' financial path

370
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,980
is like

371
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,620
killing someone's parents.

372
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,900
Mr. Chen,

373
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,620
thank you for your help this time.

374
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,420
This is a small matter.

375
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,980
Mr. Hu,

376
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,060
I have a question.

377
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,340
Why do you want me to lay off Ning Yue?

378
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,620
As far as I know,

379
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,380
she is doing very well.

380
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,340
Let her go home and rest well.

381
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,100
Don't be so tired.

382
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,500
It's pretty good.

383
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,180
That's true.

384
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,380
After getting home,

385
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,620
she can take good care of the family.

386
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,540
You can work with peace of mind.

387
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,380
Yes, yes, yes.

388
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,660
If Hu Cheng deliberately transferred assets,

389
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,100
then why would he do that?

390
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,380
Because he no longer trusts me.

391
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,900
He thinks

392
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,820
I want to divorce him.

393
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,860
He misunderstood you?

394
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,580
Between us,

395
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,620
there is no trust left.

396
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,780
So what do you plan to do now?

397
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,580
I just want to figure out

398
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,860
where he exactly put the money.

399
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,300
I investigated into the transactions

400
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,720
of Hu Cheng's account for the past two years.

401
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,900
The largest deposit

402
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,150
comes from a company

403
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,100
called Licheng Anping.

404
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,300
When I did the investigations before,

405
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
it seems I've seen this name.

406
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,140
Can you continue to investigate?

407
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,540
This company

408
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,060
may be related to Hu's other accounts.

409
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,140
I can only work until the end of this month.

410
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,820
I do have a way that can allow you

411
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,140
to continue staying at Zhongzhi.

412
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,660
It's so late already.

413
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,900
Who are you calling?

414
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,980
There are still some work matters.

415
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,660
Didn't you stop working there?

416
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,820
Why are you still so serious about it?

417
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,500
Ning Yue.

418
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,980
Before, I was too careless with you

419
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,940
which led to some uncontrollable situations.

420
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,660
I won't do it anymore after this.

421
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,180
What do you mean?

422
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,980
Director, I have something to speak.

423
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,820
I'm busy right now. Talk about it later.

424
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,340
I have already been to the HR Department.

425
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,260
They said

426
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,620
if we want to keep Ning Yue,

427
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,140
we have to find someone to replace her.

428
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,620
Director, I made the mistake.

429
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,580
I replace Ning Yue

430
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,420
to leave Zhongzhi.

431
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,620
Go out. Go out.

432
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,460
Director!

433
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,900
None of you can leave.

434
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,900
Qian, wait a moment.

435
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,620
Let me take a look at this document.

436
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,220
(Outsourced Personnel List of Zhongzhi)

437
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,380
This way, this way, this way.

438
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,780
Director Qin,

439
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,620
what can't we talk about in the office?

440
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,180
Mr. Zhang,

441
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,460
see, the company's presidents

442
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,140
have come and gone

443
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,620
and GMs of the HR Department

444
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,980
have come and gone too.

445
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,060
But only you

446
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,180
are rooted in the company for years.

447
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,900
Qin,

448
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,300
what's wrong with you today?

449
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,140
You have laid off people from our department.

450
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,900
Our department is short-staffed.

451
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,300
Then I can only come to you.

452
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,900
I was thinking

453
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,380
if I outsource Ning Yue,

454
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,420
can she stay?

455
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,820
Turns out you are thinking about this.

456
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,660
There is no problem with the system.

457
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,660
The retention of outsourced personnel

458
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,060
is decided by the department head

459
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,140
and then is reported to HR

460
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,380
for a record filing.

461
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,660
But the outsourcing company

462
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,940
must be designated by us.

463
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,340
To control risks,

464
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,460
the labor contract of the outsourcing company

465
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,900
needs to be reviewed by you.

466
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,820
Additionally,

467
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,660
the salary of outsourced personnel

468
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,900
needs to use departmental funds.

469
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,540
The funds of your department

470
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,860
are not very high, right?

471
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,660
About this matter,

472
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,380
we will find a way ourselves.

473
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,700
And

474
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,460
many people are unwilling to accept it.

475
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,580
You have to ask Ning Yue for her opinion.

476
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,060
Director Qin,

477
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,420
I want to ask you a question.

478
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,620
Based on the requirements

479
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,660
of my position and my work performance

480
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,780
over the past three months,

481
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,340
are you satisfied

482
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,420
with my work abilities?

483
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,980
Not satisfied.

484
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,820
You sit first.

485
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,980
I feel regret

486
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,540
that you have not shown

487
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,420
your full capabilities.

488
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,300
You should

489
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,900
work in a more important position

490
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,620
and take more responsibilities.

491
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,300
Thank you.

492
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,900
If that's the case,

493
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,540
I have an idea.

494
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,540
I want to discuss it with you.

495
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,980
Go ahead.

496
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,340
I have studied my labor contract

497
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,980
as well as the company's policies.

498
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,900
I found out there are no detailed rules

499
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,340
for layoffs.

500
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,420
Since

501
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,900
you are satisfied with my ability,

502
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,700
can you sign a contract for outsourcing me?

503
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,700
Let me continue to finish

504
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,460
the work I haven't completed.

505
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,100
I was thinking the same way.

506
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,580
But you know doing it this way

507
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,980
is not the best solution.

508
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,060
Do you know what outsourcing means?

509
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,020
Work hard.

510
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,460
Take the blame.

511
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,980
Don't enjoy the benefits.

512
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,100
I know, when signing an outsourcing contract,

513
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,620
the costs are covered

514
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,980
by the department,

515
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,540
so in terms of salary,

516
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,580
I can also lower it a bit.

517
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,140
You stay here first.

518
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,940
I'm looking for HR to discuss

519
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,340
how to go through the outsourcing.

520
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,940
But with your work abilities,

521
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,140
even if you're not at Zhongzhi,

522
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,100
you can still find a very good job.

523
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,060
Don't you feel wronged?

524
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,940
No.

525
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,620
No matter what, it's still staying.

526
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,680
As long as there are green mountains left,

527
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,060
no fear of not having firewood to burn.

528
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,660
(I'll find contracts related to Licheng Anping)

529
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,780
(International Procurement Contract)

530
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,220
(Equipment Procurement Contract)

531
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,740
(International Procurement Contract)

532
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,900
(Ok.)

533
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,140
(I have received the contract template.)

534
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,540
(I will send you it after making the changes.)

535
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,660
(Older sister)

536
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,180
Hello? Sis.

537
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,420
Yue, you are picking up Ziyuan, right?

538
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,260
Take me with you.

539
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,980
Jiaojiao's mom has something to do?

540
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,060
Yes, she let me pick her up.

541
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,180
Yue,

542
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,420
don't worry about the outsourcing contract.

543
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,500
I'll strive for the same treatment

544
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,180
as regular workers.

545
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,060
Let's treat Jiaojiao to a big meal.

546
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,900
- Let's go.
- Have a feast!

547
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,060
Have a feast!

548
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,180
Jiaojiao, your uncle is here.

549
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,460
Ziyuan.

550
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,740
Uncle.

551
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,580
Hu Ziyuan wants to treat me to a big meal.

552
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,060
Yeah, treat her to a big meal.

553
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,820
No, let's go home and eat.

554
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,620
Jiaojiao,

555
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,140
your uncle has something to do at home.

556
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,140
You guys go back first.

557
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,620
I'll treat you another day, ok?

558
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,220
If you are busy,

559
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,940
let me take Jiaojiao out for a big meal.

560
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,380
After finishing eating, I guarantee

561
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,780
that I will return her to you perfectly.

562
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,820
Hu Ziyuan,

563
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,820
why do you want to treat Jiaojiao?

564
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,580
We lost the game.

565
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,420
I promised to treat her.

566
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,140
Uncle,

567
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,780
go with me.

568
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,620
Then let's

569
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,420
go together.

570
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,980
- Ok, let's go.
- Mom, hurry up.

571
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,380
Let's go.

572
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,820
- Let's go together.
- A big meal!

573
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,300
What good food should we eat?

574
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,820
Let's get in the car.

575
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,220
Look at Ziyuan.

576
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,100
At such a young age,

577
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,820
he just knows how to win a girl's heart.

578
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,300
Who does he resemble?

579
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,900
Between children,

580
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,540
there's not so much distance.

581
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,140
If they can get along,

582
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,140
then they play together.

583
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,420
Yeah, their relationship will be good.

584
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,540
They are all sincere.

585
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,700
I really envy them.

586
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,900
Unlike the adult world,

587
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,940
which is full of intrigue

588
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,900
and insincerity.

589
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,900
Not all adults are like that.

590
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,700
Maybe the environment

591
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,860
around me is too dangerous.

592
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
Unlike my wife,

593
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,140
she has colleagues and leaders

594
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,860
around her who care for

595
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,660
and look after her.

596
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,100
Director Qin,

597
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,420
thank you for taking care of my wife

598
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,540
during this time.

599
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,860
I make a toast to you.

600
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,420
Thank you

601
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,380
for your care and tolerance towards her.

602
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,380
You are welcome.

603
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,340
With Yue's ability...

604
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,300
Are you saying that

605
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,820
if my wife hadn't been

606
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,340
at home for so many years,

607
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,980
she would have probably achieved

608
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,660
far greater accomplishments than you.

609
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,780
Lawyer Ning.

610
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,580
- Mr. Chen.
- Mr. Hu.

611
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,740
You are here.

612
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,900
Sorry, Lawyer Ning,

613
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,180
I'm late. I just had a meeting.

614
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,420
But I still arrived late.

615
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,900
I'll punish myself with a drink later.

616
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,700
Director Qin, you are also here.

617
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,060
Mr. Chen,

618
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,460
what brings you here?

619
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,060
Isn't the farewell party for Lawyer Ning?

620
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,700
People from the Purchasing Department

621
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,140
come to hold a farewell party for her?

622
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,860
Are you very familiar with Lawyer Ning?

623
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,100
I am very familiar with Mr. Hu.

624
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,300
Here. Here.

625
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,460
- Here.
- Sit down, sit down.

626
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,700
The news that my wife was laid off

627
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,700
was informed by Mr. Chen temporarily.

628
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,980
I just knew it.

629
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,100
My wife

630
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,580
has a misunderstandings about me.

631
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,060
So today I called Mr. Chen over

632
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,380
to clarify for me.

633
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,180
The matter that my wife was laid off

634
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,060
has

635
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,380
nothing to do with me.

636
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,300
Lawyer Ning, you are overthinking.

637
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,940
Zhongzhi is blind to talent

638
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,900
and can't retain capable and talented people.

639
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,900
It has nothing to do with Mr. Hu.

640
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,860
I testify it has nothing to do with Mr. Hu.

641
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,780
But he looks

642
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,340
very happy.

643
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,460
Come on.

644
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,980
I also feel sorry for you.

645
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,900
If I become a housewife,

646
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,940
aren't you happy?

647
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,980
Of course I'm happy.

648
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,580
But what I want to say is

649
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,340
that you should see clearly

650
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,220
it really has nothing to do with me.

651
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,540
Actually,

652
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,380
this matter...

653
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,220
It is our regret.

654
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,220
Of course, it is your regret.

655
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,140
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

656
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,860
And Director Qin.

657
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,100
I raise my glass to you.

658
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,980
Thank you for seeing me off today.

659
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,380
Sorry for the trouble.

660
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,620
My pleasure.

661
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,940
But

662
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,420
Director Qin,

663
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,980
regret is regret.

664
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,380
But no one can stop my wife

665
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,780
from shining and thriving elsewhere.

666
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,260
What do you think,

667
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,620
Director Qin?

668
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,780
Even if

669
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,340
Director Qin wants to stop it, he can't.

670
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,300
Lawyer Ning,

671
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,860
you are the wife

672
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,900
of the president of Yaofeng Tech.

673
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,140
Don't stoop to their level.

674
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,460
Becoming the president's wife

675
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,580
is a dream for many girls.

676
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,450
You don't really understand my wife.

677
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,580
She is not like ordinary girls.

678
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,380
She doesn't want to be the boss's wife.

679
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,180
She wants

680
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,420
to be a boss.

681
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,980
I can see that.

682
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,180
What is this called?

683
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,180
There is a great wife

684
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,460
behind an excellent husband.

685
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,100
Hey.

686
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,140
You should say

687
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,380
we are evenly matched in strength

688
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,980
and respect each other like guests.

689
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,460
Yes, yes, yes.

690
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,900
I have a shallow understanding.

691
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,060
I misspoke, I misspoke.

692
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,180
Here, here, here.

693
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,220
Here.

694
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,820
Together, together.

695
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,740
Honey,

696
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,900
I know that being laid off

697
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,780
is a big blow for you.

698
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,380
You have a strong personality,

699
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,540
so being fired will make you emotional.

700
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,900
Even if you want to take it out on me,

701
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,900
I can understand that too.

702
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,300
You know me well.

703
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,300
You are right.

704
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,820
I don't want to be the boss's wife.

705
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,740
I want to be the boss.

706
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,300
You are my wife.

707
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,100
Yaofeng Tech is mine.

708
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,260
That's yours too.

709
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,380
You are the boss after all.

710
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,740
The work at hand is not finished yet;

711
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,380
I have to work

712
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,660
until the end of this month.

713
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,580
Of course.

714
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,540
When doing things,

715
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,980
one should see them through.

716
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,580
(...promise to mortgage the house...)

717
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,380
(Labor Outsourcing Agreement)

718
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,420
(Ning Yue)

719
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,020
(Responsibility for Breach of Contract)

720
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,180
Yue,

721
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,820
why do you modify the terms?

722
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,940
Director Qin,

723
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,340
let's talk in the office.

724
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,820
If the legal assistant assigned by Party B

725
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,340
no longer provides services to Party A

726
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,700
or resigns voluntarily,

727
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,180
the legal assistant assigned by Party B

728
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,860
is willing to bear the compensation.

729
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,500
Considering that the legal assistant

730
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,220
does not have a good work background

731
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,020
and can't guarantee repayment capability,

732
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,340
the legal assistant assigned by Party B

733
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,700
promises to mortgage the house as collateral.

734
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,340
Are you sure you want to sign this?

735
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,900
The legal assistant assigned by Party B

736
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,220
has fully understood the content

737
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,060
listed in this clause

738
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,900
and fully comprehended

739
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,780
the consequences

740
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,940
and risks

741
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,040
that may arise from this clause.

742
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,860
- Yue...
- I modified this contract myself.

743
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,260
I just want to express my sincerity.

744
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,100
You can rest assured.

745
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,260
I won't take the initiative to resign.

746
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,580
Are you really going to sign it?

747
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,740
If possible,

748
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,220
I hope to sign right away.

749
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,300
Ok.

750
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,340
Additionally,

751
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,660
about yesterday's matter,

752
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,020
thank you.

753
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,900
Yue, you can hide the outsourcing contract

754
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,780
for a while,

755
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,220
- but sooner or later...
- It's ok.

756
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,980
This time is enough for me.

757
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,940
Yue,

758
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,060
do you have any plans now?

759
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,780
But I think

760
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,980
this plan is very dangerous.

761
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,180
Am I overthinking it?

762
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,660
You're overthinking it,

763
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,740
Director Qin.

764
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,140
(Labor Outsourcing Agreement)

765
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,420
(Party B's stationed personnel Ning Yue)

766
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,380
Mrs. Hu, please wait a moment.

767
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,660
Ziyuan is on duty today.

768
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,980
It's ok. I'll wait.

769
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,860
Are you all right?

770
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,980
Are you hypoglycemic?

771
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,940
-I have candy.
- It's fine, it's fine.

772
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,900
Thank you, sorry to trouble you.

773
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,670
Thank you.

774
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,260
Do you want me to call 120 for you?

775
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,300
No need, it happens very often.

776
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,580
I will be fine after eating it.

777
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,260
Hurry up and eat it.

778
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,100
Mom!

779
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,380
- Ziyuan
- Mom.

780
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,820
Mom! Mom!

781
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,820
You really came early today.

782
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,060
You are late today, little boy.

783
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,020
Look at what I brought you.

784
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,900
Do you like it?

785
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,740
I like it.

786
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,740
Let's go, baby.

787
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,900
Let's go.

788
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,900
Could you please pour me a glass of water?

789
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,420
Tian.

790
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,900
What a coincidence!

791
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,940
Boss.

792
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,780
I heard

793
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,100
you went to Xianbin Capital later.

794
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,940
How is it?

795
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,020
It goes smoothly, right?

796
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,860
It's ok.

797
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,060
Actually, I've always

798
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,740
wanted to send you a message.

799
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,020
In the end, I found

800
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,940
that you blocked me.

801
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,180
I have completed

802
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,580
all the handover tasks at work.

803
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,100
Is there anything else?

804
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,540
Tian,

805
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,220
you have always worked hard

806
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,220
on your work.

807
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,660
To be honest,

808
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,980
personal morality

809
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,220
is not really

810
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,300
related to work.

811
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,580
But in terms of social opinion...

812
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,900
At that time, my words were a bit harsh.

813
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,380
But that was also for your future.

814
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,940
I didn't expect you to just leave.

815
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,820
After all, as for the content of the letter,

816
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,980
we haven't...

817
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,580
I don't want to bring this up again.

818
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,700
Fine.

819
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
Sorry to have you wronged.

820
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,740
In the future,

821
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,980
we must eliminate this malicious competition.

822
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,220
This greatly affects the unity

823
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,900
and atmosphere within our company.

824
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,900
