=Episode 16=

3
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,570
Qin,

4
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,050
I am really drunk.

5
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,610
I'm very dizzy.

6
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,170
Licheng Anping,

7
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,690
this is why you came

8
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,360
to meet Mr. He, right?

9
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,170
Yue,

10
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,560
you've gone through so much trouble

11
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,610
and endured so many grievances

12
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,920
to stay at Zhongzhi.

13
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,250
Why?

14
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,850
Yue.

15
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,130
Because...

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,200
Yue...

17
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,800
Be careful. Be careful.

18
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,040
Go.

19
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,240
Be careful. Be careful.

20
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,250
Be careful.

21
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,500
(Ning Yue)

22
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,340
(Ning Yue)

23
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,640
Sorry,

24
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,760
the subscriber you dialed is unable to answer.

25
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,050
Please call back later.

26
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,240
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed...

27
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,420
(Dad)

28
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,890
Hello?

29
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,570
Dad,

30
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,680
you called me?

31
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,080
I did it.

32
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,610
Didn't you see it?

33
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,110
Didn't I say

34
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,960
you can message me on WeChat while I'm working?

35
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,920
My eyesight is bad.

36
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,960
Typing is inconvenient.

37
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,050
Besides, I can't use the function

38
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,080
of converting speech to text.

39
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,200
When I use it,

40
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,170
the text doesn't make sense,

41
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,010
you know?

42
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,610
How are Ning Yue and Ziyuan doing?

43
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,200
Well,

44
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,970
son, I have to tell you something.

45
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,000
Your mom seems a bit off.

46
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,730
What's wrong with my mom?

47
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,970
She started learning to paint.

48
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,320
It's Yue.

49
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,770
Yue helped her sign up.

50
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:32,970
I have to say,

51
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,050
since your mom learnt to paint,

52
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,970
she seems like

53
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,610
a completely different person

54
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,850
inside and out.

55
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,050
I feel

56
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,410
she has changed.

57
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,050
It's all because of those bad women outside.

58
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,090
She learned to be bad from them.

59
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,970
My mom goes out to learn more things

60
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,610
to enrich her own life.

61
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,050
Isn't it pretty good?

62
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,920
You don't know.

63
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,850
Now no one cooks for me.

64
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,090
Every day, I eat cold food

65
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,530
or leftovers.

66
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,770
You are not at home.

67
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,810
In this family,

68
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,800
both the old and the young

69
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,770
are shitting on my neck.

70
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,800
Then you

71
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,560
learn to cook for yourself.

72
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,050
Your mom said the same thing.

73
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,210
I'm a big man.

74
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,480
Can I cook?

75
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,530
Besides, I've never cooked before.

76
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,130
And one more thing.

77
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
- She hired a cleaner...
- Dad.

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,080
I'm asking you

79
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,480
how Ning Yue and Ziyuan are doing now.

80
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,970
She said she is working overtime.

81
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:21,920
She's not back yet.

82
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,650
Ziyuan is already asleep.

83
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,090
She hasn't come back yet?

84
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,680
Yeah. Cheng,

85
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,440
didn't you say she was fired?

86
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,280
I get it.

87
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,240
- Be careful.
- It's fine, it's fine,

88
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
- Alright.
- I'm fine.

89
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,650
You go back first. I'll handle it myself.

90
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,880
I'm fine. You go back first.

91
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,530
- I know.
- You can go.

92
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,880
Be careful not to fall.

93
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,860
(Hu Cheng)

94
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,480
Yue,

95
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,730
the phone is ringing.

96
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,780
(Hu Cheng)

97
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,400
Hello?

98
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,530
Where are you? What are you doing?

99
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,680
Why didn't you answer the phone?

100
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,170
I just finished working.

101
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,520
What work?

102
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,680
What work keeps you out so late?

103
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,530
I'm not feeling very well right now.

104
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,970
Can I talk to you tomorrow?

105
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,040
Honey,

106
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,610
you saw

107
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,170
that video, didn't you?

108
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,170
I saw it.

109
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,050
Let me tell you,

110
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,210
things are not as you imagine.

111
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,320
Wait for me to come back

112
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,730
and explain it to you slowly, ok?

113
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,650
Honey.

114
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,680
Honey.

115
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,410
Yue, are you ok?

116
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,640
Be careful.

117
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,570
Be careful.

118
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,970
Go to bed.

119
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,440
(Ning Yue)
- Come.  - Thank you.

120
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,280
Come on.

121
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,610
Thank you.

122
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,610
Yue.

123
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,420
Yue.

124
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,010
We have arrived.

125
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,440
Go back to sleep for a while.

126
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,730
Ok, thank you.

127
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,360
Where have you been?

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,840
Work.

129
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,170
Work?

130
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,960
Work kept you out all night?

131
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,370
I went to a neighboring city for a case.

132
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,200
It was getting late,

133
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,490
so I've settled down nearby.

134
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,560
Is there any problem?

135
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,170
Last night, you and him...

136
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,410
How many rooms did you book?

137
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,840
Mr. Hu, Lawyer Ning and I

138
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,440
normally interact as colleagues.

139
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,280
Director Qin,

140
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,290
in the middle of the night,

141
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,080
you appeared in the female colleague's room.

142
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,960
As her family member,

143
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,720
isn't it appropriate to ask more?

144
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,560
Hu Cheng,

145
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,530
leave yourself some dignity.

146
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,130
It's you

147
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
who don't give me any dignity.

148
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,940
(Mu Xiao)

149
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,680
Director Qin,

150
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,650
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,560
I'll handle some matters at home.

152
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,530
I will return to the company once it's handled.

153
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:32,770
You go back first.

154
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,400
Mom.

155
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,050
Dad.

156
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,440
Ning Yue, open the door.

157
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,050
I am washing up.

158
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,500
(I met He Kuan yesterday. Talk about it later.)

159
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,890
I told you to open the door.

160
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:09,850
What's wrong?

161
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,600
Don't I have the freedom to close the door

162
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,770
when using the restroom?

163
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,410
The most important thing now

164
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,680
is that you explain what happened last night.

165
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,130
When you stayed out overnight,

166
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,440
did you ever explain it to me?

167
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,050
I have already told you.

168
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,890
I were working.

169
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,840
I am open and honest, unlike you.

170
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,680
Why do I have to explain?

171
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,370
Getting back at me because of the video?

172
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,050
I told you

173
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,170
nothing happened.

174
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,010
That is...

175
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,890
Someone did it on purpose.

176
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:36,730
Why?

177
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,720
Frame you?

178
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,650
Is it a PS video?

179
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,410
It's not PS.

180
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,170
That's a matter of shooting angle.

181
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,200
Shooting angle.

182
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,930
Do you believe in it yourself?

183
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,720
I'm telling you that nothing happened.

184
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:50,920
If you don't acknowledge it,

185
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,200
then what can I do?

186
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,920
Ning Yue.

187
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
What exactly do you want to do?

188
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,920
What do you want to do,

189
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,920
Hu Cheng?

190
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,530
What do I want to do?

191
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,250
I want to start over with you.

192
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,370
I want to forgive you.

193
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,330
I want to let go of everything from the past.

194
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,290
I tried.

195
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,440
I did it.

196
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,200
But only when you try,

197
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,250
do you know

198
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,010
how strong your inner self must be

199
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,050
if you want to believe in a person.

200
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,650
To choose to let go,

201
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,800
forgive,

202
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,840
and rebuild trust,

203
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,720
do you how difficult it is?

204
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,490
I tried.

205
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,250
I have tried everything.

206
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,010
I am trying very hard.

207
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,250
But I can't do it.

208
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,290
All of this is not my fault,

209
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,130
it's your fault.

210
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,840
I know.

211
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
I know I was wrong in the past.

212
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,440
I have already admitted my mistakes.

213
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,050
Why do you not let it go?

214
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,050
Do you really want to never let me go?

215
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,680
Things like this

216
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,530
will happen again in the future.

217
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,890
I told you this is false.

218
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,290
What I care about is not whether it's false.

219
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,890
What I care about is

220
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,010
that I can't go

221
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,250
on living days like this,

222
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,200
where we torment each other.

223
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,410
How do you want me to go on?

224
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,490
I want you to live normally.

225
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,440
Mom, Dad, please don't argue.

226
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,040
Ziyuan.

227
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,730
Ziyuan.

228
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,920
Ziyuan, I'm sorry.

229
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,650
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

230
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,800
- Mom...
- I'm sorry.

231
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,680
Sorry.

232
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,530
Sorry to scare you.

233
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,250
Can you please stop fighting with Dad?

234
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,490
Sorry, baby.

235
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,080
Sorry for scaring you.

236
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,800
Ziyuan, I was wrong.

237
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,010
Sorry, baby.

238
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,890
Sorry, baby.

239
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,600
Sorry for scaring you.

240
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,900
(Mo)

241
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,760
Hello? Mr. Mo.

242
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

243
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,920
I have some urgent matters at home,

244
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,440
so I just rushed back.

245
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,920
That video

246
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,840
is definitely a misunderstanding.

247
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,920
Manager Tian and I

248
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,840
are just in an ordinary relationship,

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
a friendly relationship.

250
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,680
That day she drank too much.

251
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,080
I just helped her a bit.

252
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,650
You know,

253
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,680
people nowadays like

254
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,010
to take pictures

255
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,720
and then put them online.

256
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,720
Those who don't know the truth

257
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,050
all believe it.

258
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,170
It's just a misunderstanding.

259
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,960
It was held very successfully.

260
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,160
Honestly, Mr. Mo,

261
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,600
I feel that I have benefited a lot.

262
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,760
Tell you in detail?

263
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,130
Well,

264
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,440
isn't it obvious?

265
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,560
Look.

266
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,170
Where is Ning Yue, Dad?

267
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,650
She sent Ziyuan to kindergarten.

268
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:58,970
Cheng,

269
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,050
talk to your wife when you have time.

270
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,530
She doesn't cook at home,

271
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,560
but takes your mom to learn painting.

272
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,560
I...

273
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,200
What the hell!

274
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,650
Yue said if you want

275
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,290
to know her whereabouts, just ask her directly.

276
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,770
Stop following her.

277
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,410
Hello? Mr. Hu.

278
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,040
Zibo,

279
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,840
put your current work aside for now.

280
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,130
There is something

281
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,840
that only you can help me with.

282
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,720
Qin,

283
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,890
wait for me.

284
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,720
I won.

285
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,250
I'm not convinced. Let's have another round.

286
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,730
Well,

287
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,370
Ziyuan, let's stop now today.

288
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,680
Jiaojiao's uncle will come to pick her up.

289
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,410
Let Qin Jiaojiao play for a little longer.

290
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,950
I don't want to go.

291
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,890
Let's go play.

292
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,280
Hello?

293
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,400
Ok, I got it.

294
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,530
I'll be there soon.

295
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,410
Let's have another round.

296
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,020
(Yue)

297
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,290
Hello? Yue.

298
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,800
Hello? Director Qin,

299
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,050
when will you arrive?

300
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,720
I'll be there soon.

301
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,170
- Yue.
- Director Qin.

302
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,130
I have to be away for a bit.

303
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,170
Can you look after my kid for me?

304
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,010
I'll be back very soon.

305
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,250
What is so urgent?

306
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,210
Help me look after Ziyuan.

307
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,200
I'll be back very soon.

308
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,160
Sir, the house is on fire!

309
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,010
What are you doing?

310
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,690
Are you trying to become an immortal?

311
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,050
The house is almost on fire.

312
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,640
My wife went out to have fun.

313
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,050
She doesn't care about me either.

314
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,290
I need to eat, right?

315
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,290
If you can't cook,

316
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,880
then order takeout.

317
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,530
You can't set the house on fire!

318
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,120
I can't order takeout.

319
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,010
Moreover,

320
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,250
I don't love eating the food

321
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,400
that others cook.

322
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:36,880
My wife can cook,

323
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,120
but she doesn't make it for me.

324
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,970
What a selfish wife!

325
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,970
You are going too far.

326
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,010
You can't do anything.

327
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,450
But you are still so picky.

328
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,120
Your wife spoiled you.

329
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,050
This is what she should do.

330
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,800
She has become like this now

331
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,160
because my daughter-in-law

332
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,250
has influenced her badly.

333
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,320
If you keep doing this,

334
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,930
no one will take care of you in the future.

335
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,770
I won't eat.

336
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
I am not the same.

337
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,210
I am getting paid

338
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,690
to work for you.

339
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,010
But your wife does everything

340
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,290
every day for free.

341
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,600
But she still has to endure anger.

342
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,690
Sooner or later she will stop working.

343
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,640
How dare she!

344
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,210
Anyway,

345
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,450
she is the wife of the Hu family.

346
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,210
The wife of the Hu family?

347
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
What's so great about it?

348
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,290
Royal relatives?

349
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,010
My previous employer,

350
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,250
the husband treats his wife

351
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,010
just like you treat your wife.

352
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,050
He extends a hand

353
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,290
for everything.

354
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,730
Later, he made his wife run away due to anger.

355
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,160
Then he was home alone.

356
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,010
One day,

357
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,600
when he was alone at home,

358
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,970
suddenly he had a sharp pain in his heart,

359
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,800
then he just...

360
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,920
What happened?

361
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,290
Dead?

362
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,840
He can do anything now.

363
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,360
What the hell!

364
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,610
Eat an orange.

365
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,560
There's one more thing.

366
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,840
I saw a real story online a couple of days ago.

367
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,400
Is everything you said earlier fake?

368
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,450
There is an old lady.

369
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,930
She can't

370
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,210
stand her husband

371
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,880
bossing her around all day long.

372
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,530
In a fit of anger, she ran away from home.

373
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,050
She drove alone on a self-guided tour.

374
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,560
Over the course of two or three years,

375
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,730
she traveled around most of China,

376
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,880
leaving her husband alone at home.

377
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,930
It's been really tough.

378
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,640
Why did these misfortunes happen to men?

379
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,070
Bad deeds are rewarded with bad results.

380
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,010
- Well...
- He deserves it.

381
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,970
You can't do anything at all.

382
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,360
You should have a bit of backbone.

383
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,530
You just learn to cook on your own.

384
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,440
Right?

385
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,480
Or

386
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,400
you face everyone with a smile.

387
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,800
How could all the benefits

388
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,400
be enjoyed by you alone?

389
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,320
So

390
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,050
you need to think this through.

391
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,800
Who really can't live without whom?

392
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,360
I'm really afraid of you.

393
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,490
I am not scary at all.

394
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,080
Mom, how's it?

395
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,080
Not bad, right?

396
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,600
This apartment is ready to move in.

397
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Everything is prepared for us.

398
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
We don't need to bring anything.

399
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,080
It's really quite complete.

400
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,050
It's enough for the three of us

401
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,210
to live here.

402
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,050
What do you mean?

403
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,770
Leave myself a way out.

404
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,880
Just in case.

405
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,010
What's going on between you and Cheng?

406
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,160
Mom,

407
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,600
don't worry about me.

408
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,320
I will handle it myself.

409
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,800
If Hu Cheng calls you

410
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,800
or if anyone calls you,

411
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,250
don't contact,

412
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,120
don't answer.

413
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,800
If the nursing home calls me,

414
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,010
I will do as you said.

415
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,370
Hello?

416
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,210
Well,

417
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,880
when can you come back?

418
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,160
I haven't finished class yet.

419
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,120
I can't cook.

420
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,640
I mean,

421
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,210
after you get back,

422
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,770
teach me.

423
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,770
Let's talk after the class.

424
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,160
You finally returned.

425
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,560
Why were you in such a hurry just now?

426
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:47,610
Jiaojiao.

427
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,770
It seems

428
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,360
they like you a lot.

429
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,250
You could consider it a side job now.

430
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,730
Just now a staff member

431
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,490
helped me with the toys

432
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,800
and water.

433
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,160
Otherwise, I

434
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,640
can't handle both of them alone.

435
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,730
She's here.

436
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,050
Tired of playing? Don't keep bothering him.

437
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,160
Drink some water.

438
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,290
Ok.

439
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,230
Thank you.

440
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,770
If you need anything, just call me.

441
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,810
Ok.

442
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,600
It's like a banana.

443
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,800
We'll come here next time.

444
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,560
Are you happy today?

445
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,400
Happy.

446
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,600
- The bear is coming.
- Attack him.

447
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,010
Jiaojiao! Protect Jiaojiao!

448
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,530
- Protect Jiaojiao.
- Jiaojiao, come on.

449
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,730
(Gulliver's Travels)
Every time I want to go

450
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,490
to the town to take a look, I always sit

451
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,970
in this small "cabin" used for traveling.

452
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,690
Glumdalclitch

453
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,560
put the "cabin" on my lap

454
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,560
and placed me on his knee,

455
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,160
sitting in a type of open sedan.

456
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,400
Four people carry us...

457
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,120
...followed by two spies of the queen behind.

458
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,080
Ziyuan.

459
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,530
- I'm back.
- Dad.

460
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,770
You are back!

461
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,290
Mom is telling me a story.

462
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,930
Mom is telling you a story, huh?

463
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,290
Come here.

464
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,160
Let me tell you one.

465
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,010
Let Dad tell you for a while.

466
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,560
Where were we?

467
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,010
Here.

468
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,680
Here?

469
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,480
I want to go to the town to take a look,

470
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,940
I always sit

471
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,140
in this small "cabin"

472
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,380
used for traveling.

473
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,060
Mr. Feng,

474
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,860
what we are talking about now is

475
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,940
your relationship with Chen Pingzhang.

476
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,340
The key issue you need to tell me is this.

477
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,620
I know, Ms. Luo.

478
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,860
He Kuan's matter

479
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,620
is also related to the Purchasing Department.

480
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,060
And the problem is even more serious.

481
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,920
You want to talk to me about He Kuan?

482
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,570
Let me reiterate to you once again.

483
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,340
About Chen Pingzhang,

484
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,220
do you have anything else to add?

485
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,620
Nothing to add for now.

486
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,860
I need to think about it again.

487
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,300
You better think it over.

488
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,820
If it gets discovered later,

489
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,020
this's not such a simple conversation

490
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,580
between you and me.

491
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,020
Keep a close eye on the Technical Department.

492
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,380
This is our first software launch.

493
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,940
We must not have any issues.

494
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,260
Besides,

495
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,540
prepare several backup plans

496
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,180
to avoid chaos

497
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,180
when there are loopholes.

498
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,620
I'm keeping an eye on it.

499
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,700
There is still time.

500
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,860
In short,

501
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,540
no issues can arise before the contract

502
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,580
with Xianbin Capital is signed.

503
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,260
Don't worry.

504
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,380
By the way,

505
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,140
there's something

506
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,420
I'm quite worried about you as well.

507
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,180
Previously, you used your own money

508
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,460
to fill in the company.

509
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,060
You haven't transferred the money back.

510
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,140
Does Yue know about this?

511
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,940
Apples and oranges.

512
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,580
Don't let Yue worry.

513
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,760
Yue hasn't come again today.

514
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,060
I knew it.

515
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,780
Yue is so capable.

516
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,580
She must have found a better job.

517
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,700
What job is better than a lawyer?

518
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,700
Make a copy of it.

519
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,380
You make me copy again!

520
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,020
If the legal assistant assigned by Party B

521
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,540
no longer provides services to Party A

522
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,860
or voluntarily resigns,

523
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,860
the legal assistant appointed by Party B

524
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,540
promises to mortgage the house as collateral.

525
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,140
I modified this contract myself.

526
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,580
I just want to express my sincerity.

527
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,140
I know that the work you've been doing

528
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,780
is not about the investigation.

529
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,300
Regarding Licheng Anping,

530
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,180
if you know anything,

531
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,460
please let me know.

532
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,700
Yue, what exactly is Licheng Anping?

533
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,340
Yue, you have any plans now, right?

534
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,420
But I think

535
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,860
this plan is very dangerous.

536
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,620
(Yue)

537
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,900
Today I will join you

538
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,180
for the kindergarten activities.

539
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,140
Aren't you going to work?

540
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,060
I think being with family is more important.

541
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,060
Honey.

542
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,140
I know

543
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,860
you are tired of the old clothes.

544
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,420
I ordered a new set for you.

545
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,220
This embroidery

546
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,220
and this craftsmanship

547
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,940
are so exquisite.

548
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,940
A wife

549
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,780
is the face of a family.

550
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,780
Of course I have to treat you with care.

551
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,700
Honey,

552
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,900
you really care about me, don't you?

553
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,140
Mrs. Hu,

554
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,580
you look so beautiful in that cheongsam.

555
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,420
Yes, it's really pretty.

556
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,460
Your figure is really good. I'm so envious.

557
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,060
Thank you.

558
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,100
My mom is a little fairy.

559
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,180
So you already knew

560
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,540
we are playing this game today, didn't you?

561
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,380
This is Ziyuan's favorite game.

562
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,700
Is it?

563
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,300
Hello, Mr. Hu, Mrs. Hu.

564
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,620
The next round of the game is about to start.

565
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,580
Please come with me.

566
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,420
Ziyuan.

567
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,340
You go there first.

568
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,380
Follow me.

569
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,500
Slow down.

570
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,860
Mom, Dad,

571
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,460
I am here.

572
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,250
What's wrong?

573
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,180
Ms. Li,

574
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,780
every time we play this game,

575
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,940
Dad always blindfolds Mom,

576
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,060
and then Dad gives the directions.

577
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,100
So boring!

578
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,220
How about we change it this time?

579
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,620
How about Mom blindfolds Dad

580
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,340
and Mom is the director this time?

581
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,580
Ok.

582
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,140
Ok, since the moms have spoken,

583
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,020
let's change it in the next round.

584
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,820
- Is that ok?
- Ok.

585
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,740
Come on.

586
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,060
Honey,

587
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,700
don't joke around.

588
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,140
You have no sense of direction.

589
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,580
Besides, shouldn't I be the one at the helm?

590
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,420
They've all been ready.

591
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,380
Do you want your son to wait?

592
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,940
I am here.

593
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,380
Hurry up.

594
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,460
Do you want to do it yourself?

595
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,810
♪Not to become someone♪

Let's go.

602
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,220
Honey.

603
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,820
Honey, you don't leave, right?

604
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,140
Do you want us to lose at the starting line?

605
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,180
Our son is still waiting.

Honey.

609
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,300
Left leg. Left leg.

610
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,200
You should have said it earlier.

611
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,160
I said to step with your left leg.

612
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,860
Left leg. I said left leg.

613
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,180
Honey, how come you...

614
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,930
...can't even tell the direction?

615
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,300
Lift your leg, lift the right leg.

616
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,600
Which leg? Just say it!

617
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,700
Lift the right...

618
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,700
I said it.

619
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,720
Lift your right leg.

620
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,940
That's right, that's right.

621
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,820
Walk to the right.

622
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,860
I said...

623
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,860
Honey.

624
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,660
No matter what I say, you don't listen.

625
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,300
Shouldn't a couple trust each other?

626
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,190
Come on.

627
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,420
Now we have lost.

628
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,540
What a messy game!

629
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,340
Not fun at all.

630
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,760
Mom.

631
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,820
- Here you are.
- Here you are.

632
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,620
Just in time.

633
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,460
Your dad cooked today.

634
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,860
Come on.

635
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,980
Try it.

636
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,180
Ziyuan, go try the food that Grandpa made.

637
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,460
- Ok.
- Come on. Sit down.

638
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,620
- Dad.
- Let's eat.

639
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,420
Why did you cook by yourself?

640
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,540
I should do it.

641
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,700
Come on, let's eat.

642
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,100
Dad, our company's receptionist said her son

643
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,140
loves to eat the food made by his grandpa.

644
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,100
They have a very good relationship.

645
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,660
Really good.

646
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,020
They are very close.

647
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,260
Very good.

648
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,020
Come on. Try it.

649
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,860
Yeah.

650
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,820
How is it?

651
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,020
Grandpa,

652
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,780
it's so salty!

653
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,620
Really?

654
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,110
Let me try it.

655
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,860
It's so salty!

656
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,620
This dish should be sweet.

657
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,900
I mistakenly put salt in it.

658
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,140
- Look at you.
- Grandpa,

659
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,020
is too tired.

660
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,020
You insist on making me do it.

661
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,460
I know that nobody likes

662
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,060
to eat the food I make.

663
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,140
I love to eat.

664
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,500
Grandpa, you can do it!

665
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,540
Be more careful when you cook next time.

666
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,500
Alright, I'll be more careful.

667
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,980
He really shows respect to you.

668
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,740
- Learn slowly.
- That's right.

669
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,020
I'll teach you later.

670
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,340
Ok.

671
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,460
Dad,

672
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,460
I think it's pretty good.

673
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,580
It's your first time to cook.

674
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,140
That's quite impressive.

675
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,660
And you can improve a lot.

676
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,900
Let's take it slow from now on.

677
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,780
Like mom,

678
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,940
it's great to learn new things.

679
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,500
Don't just nest on the sofa every day.

680
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,420
That's right.

681
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,720
Eat.

682
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,980
Try it.

683
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,540
Yummy.

684
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,780
Eat.

685
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,640
Ziyuan.

686
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,960
Try the shrimp made by Grandpa.

687
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,100
Ok.

688
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,620
How did you make it?

689
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,300
I improved your parents' relationship.

690
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,870
Shouldn't you thank me?

691
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,340
Cheng,

692
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,540
I have something to tell you.

693
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,610
Mom, I'm talking to Yue.

694
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,950
Come sit here.

695
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,980
You and Yue had a quarrel.

696
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,380
Is that so?

697
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,580
It's fine.

698
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,500
It's normal for a couple to have disputes.

699
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,960
Cheng, if Yue wants to work,

700
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,000
don't stop her.

701
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,460
You are a couple.

702
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,460
You should discuss things with each other.

703
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,340
If you insist on stopping her,

704
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,220
the effect will be exactly the opposite.

705
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,260
The whole family will be unhappy.

706
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,140
You should not always do things

707
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,980
according to your own ideas.

708
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,460
Learn to respect your wife.

709
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,420
Did you do something

710
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,620
that upset my mom?

711
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,540
You know that.

712
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,870
I have never done anything

713
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,240
to let your mom down.

714
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,060
Did you leave any evidence

715
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,180
in her hands?

716
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,020
No.

717
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,780
Is it

718
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,130
about my mom going out to learn painting?

719
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,060
Alright, it's fine.

720
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,700
- I'll have a talk with her.
- No, no, no.

721
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,330
If she wants to learn, let her learn.

722
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,980
Haven't you always wanted her to stay in?

723
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,630
Afraid she might pick up bad habits outside.

724
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,240
I'm more afraid of your mom being angry.

725
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,820
Dad,

726
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,030
you weren't like this before.

727
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,140
Well, men

728
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,340
should be flexible.

729
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,900
Being nicer to my wife

730
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,580
shows my demeanor.

731
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,860
You have never told me this

732
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,830
since I was young.

733
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,620
Well, that was then, this is now.

734
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,340
I'm being nice to your mom.

735
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,700
I am counting on growing old

736
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,260
with your mom.

737
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,380
If your mom doesn't take care of me anymore,

738
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,340
just like this,

739
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,460
those cleaners

740
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:50,980
will really make me furious.

741
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:52,820
If I rely on you two,

742
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,480
is that possible?

743
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,020
In the end,

744
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,360
your mom and I will grow old together.

745
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,900
We have to rely on ourselves.

746
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,140
You and Yue,

747
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,780
stop fighting.

748
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,500
Live a good life.

749
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,820
(Diaoyutai)

750
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,360
Ms. Luo, you want to meet me.

751
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,030
Director Qin, please sit.

752
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,380
You have to temporarily stop the work at hand.

753
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,180
There is something I need you to investigate.

754
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,240
Ok.

755
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,140
Chen Pingzhang, GM

756
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,180
from the Purchasing Department,

757
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,100
there are some issues with his transactions.

758
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,020
I've been investigating him for a while.

759
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,180
I haven't found any solid evidence yet.

760
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,060
Please help me look into it carefully.

761
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,200
No problem.

762
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,260
Mr. He.

763
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,220
Here.

764
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,600
Excuse me. Please give her a cup of coffee.

765
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,020
Mr. He, you said on the phone just now

766
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,320
that there is news about Licheng Anping.

767
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,640
Indeed.

768
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,800
However, I have a condition.

769
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,500
Go ahead.

770
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,620
I won't keep you in suspense.

771
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:13,730
Lawyer Ning,

772
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,160
I hope you can come

773
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,890
to our company as the legal director.

774
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,640
Your coffee.

775
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Our company

776
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,070
is still in the startup phase.

777
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,540
We're facing quite a few infringement issues.

778
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,540
I have witnessed your communication skills

779
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,790
and work efficiency.

780
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,020
It's such a waste

781
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,280
and a humiliation for you

782
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,930
to be an assistant at Zhongzhi.

783
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,260
I have a keen eye for judging people.

784
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,140
Although our company is not large,

785
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,020
it is relatively relaxed.

786
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,140
There aren't so many rules and regulations.

787
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,740
In terms of salary,

788
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,620
it can also meet your satisfaction.

789
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,540
Thank you, Mr. He.

790
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,500
If I want to change jobs

791
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,670
in the future,

792
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,100
I will definitely contact you first.

793
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,880
But not now.

794
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,840
Because now

795
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,820
I have reasons to stay at Zhongzhi.

796
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,040
Mingdu Club.

797
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,210
I don't know the specifics either.

798
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,820
I only know

799
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,860
there are financial transactions between them.

800
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,580
If you want,

801
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,180
then check into them.

802
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,300
Lawyer Ning,

803
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,700
I help you

804
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,700
hoping that you can owe me a favor.

805
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,500
Once you've finished your matters,

806
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,100
I still hope

807
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,220
you might consider coming over here.

808
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:36,980
You can rest assured.

809
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,180
I will definitely

810
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,660
repay the favor.

811
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,670
I want to discuss something with you.

812
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,350
Can I go home a bit earlier these days?

813
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,380
The house is being renovated, you know.

814
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,230
Every day after getting off work,

815
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,220
I go check the progress and pick out flaws.

816
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,160
My wife is at home alone.

817
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,080
I'm not worried.

818
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,200
Renovation, right?

819
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,720
I would have forgotten about it.

820
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,900
Let's do like this.

821
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,700
I approve you to go home early.

822
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,160
Thank you.

823
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,460
Mu Xiao, He Kuan said

824
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,540
Licheng Anping and Mingdu Club are related.

825
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,420
Can you help me

826
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,540
check into Mingdu Club?

827
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,800
