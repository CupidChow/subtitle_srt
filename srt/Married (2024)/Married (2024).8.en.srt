00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,240
Why are you crying even in your sleep?

4
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,750
Did you have a nightmare?

5
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,800
Dad is wiping mom's eye boogers.

6
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,600
Time for getting a shot.

7
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,160
It's fine.

8
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,510
Ziyuan.

9
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,100
The nurse

10
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,540
needs to give little fairies here

11
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,220
some weapons.

12
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,820
This is a battle.

13
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,140
It might hurt a little bit.

14
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,060
But

15
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,500
little fairies are very strong.

16
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,980
Give a lot of weapons

17
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,660
to fight against the bad guys,

18
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,300
so that the little fairies won't die.

19
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,140
Good boy.

20
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,620
Come. Lie down.

21
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,860
Honey,

22
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,060
you can go back now.

23
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,300
You can't sleep well here either.

24
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,580
I won't go back.

25
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,140
I'm not going anywhere.

26
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,980
I'll just stay here with you two.

27
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,740
By then,

28
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,760
let's go home together.

29
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,260
Ok.

30
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,020
Your kid is really well-behaved.

31
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,940
Does it hurt?

32
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,980
It doesn't hurt, right?

33
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,300
It's ok now.

34
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,260
The doctor will come
to make rounds soon.

35
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,380
If you have any questions,

36
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,460
you can talk to him.

37
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,140
The puncture test is scheduled

38
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,220
for around ten in the morning.

39
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,260
You and the kid should get ready.

40
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,500
Ok.

41
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,820
Thank you.

42
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,020
You're welcome.

43
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,420
Dad,

44
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,740
what is a puncture test?

45
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,180
It's...

46
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,900
The little fairies here are not enough.

47
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,420
We have to give fairies on your back

48
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,700
some more weapons.

49
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,180
Dad,

50
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,410
are there

51
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,660
so many little bad guys inside me?

52
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,660
Ziyuan.

53
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,100
In your body,

54
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,380
there are more fairies than bad guys.

55
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,780
Right?

56
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,740
But we can't go empty-handed,

57
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,580
can we?

58
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,900
Then I have to hurry up.

59
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,180
Don't be afraid later.

60
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,340
Be strong,

61
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,380
ok?

62
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,980
Dad says I'm a man.

63
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,940
I am not afraid of pain.

64
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,500
Good boy.

65
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,740
Ziyuan has been

66
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,860
afraid of pain since he was little.

67
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
You know,

68
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,420
how painful the puncture must be.

69
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,900
He is so young.

70
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,780
Why does such a little kid

71
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,380
have to go through this?

72
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,540
What if he...

73
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,820
he really...

74
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,220
- really suffers...
- It won't happen.

75
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,100
What if it happens?

76
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,300
Believe me.

77
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,060
What if...

78
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,300
What if he...

79
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,020
What if he really suffers it?

80
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,500
What should I do?

81
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,060
What should I do?

82
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,220
Impossible.

83
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,180
Believe me.

84
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,940
Our son can't have this disease.

85
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,020
He will definitely pull through.

86
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,460
(Adult's collapse)

87
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,420
(often happens in an instant.)

88
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,020
(The unknown outcome,)

89
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,180
(like the sword of Damocles,)

90
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,620
(hangs over the parents' hearts.)

91
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,860
(In the face of sudden accidents,)

92
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,380
(we are standing together again.)

93
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,380
(Haikang Hospital)

94
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,020
(Inpatient)

95
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,780
Is there anything wrong?

96
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,820
Nothing wrong.

97
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,660
Thank you.

98
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,540
Ziyuan,

99
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,340
are you feeling unwell?

100
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,500
Dad.

101
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,180
Mom.

102
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,660
Don't leave.

103
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,060
Silly kid,

104
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,100
Mom and Dad are always with you.

105
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,740
We won't leave.

106
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,180
Mom.

107
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,460
When I get home,

108
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,220
I'll go to bed earlier.

109
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,620
Is that ok?

110
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,260
Ok.

111
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,300
In the future,

112
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,580
I'll go to kindergarten for breakfast.

113
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,940
Is that ok?

114
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,140
Ziyuan,

115
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,820
after you are discharged,

116
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,460
you can do whatever you want.

117
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,740
I will listen to you.

118
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,740
Ok?

119
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,860
I won't make a fuss at night anymore.

120
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,100
I'll go to bed early and get up early.

121
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,420
In the morning, when you go to work,

122
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,220
I can walk with you.

123
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,900
I can stay with you a little longer.

124
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,660
Mom,

125
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,900
are you all right?

126
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,420
He is sick not because of your work.

127
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,260
If you have to blame someone,

128
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,140
then blame me.

129
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,220
It's all my fault.

130
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,940
Sorry.

131
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,420
The test results are out.

132
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,740
How is it?

133
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,620
It's normal.

134
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,060
Leukemia can be basically

135
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,220
ruled out.

136
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,900
The previous test

137
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,420
for EB virus antibodies is positive.

138
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,180
It can be confirmed that the child

139
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,660
has infectious mononucleosis.

140
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,060
You don't have to worry.

141
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,740
This disease is not very serious.

142
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,300
Treatment takes two to three weeks

143
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,460
and it can be basically cured.

144
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,900
What's more,

145
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,660
the child has some mild anemia.

146
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,500
In the future, you two

147
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,140
pay more attention

148
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,220
to his diet and rest.

149
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,700
- Ok.
- You all

150
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,140
need to pay attention to your rest too.

151
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,460
During this period,

152
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,820
you are busy running around

153
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,980
and you must be exhausted.

154
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,300
Work has also been delayed a lot.

155
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,420
I suggest that you ask relatives

156
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,620
for help to take care of the child.

157
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,260
That way you can get more rest.

158
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,180
I am also a parent.

159
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,060
It's not easy.

160
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,060
It's alright, thank you.

161
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,460
Thank you, thank you, doctor.

162
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,820
During this period,

163
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,260
you are quite tired.

164
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,780
Do you want to go back for a rest?

165
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,820
I can do it.

166
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,620
Aren't you the same?

167
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,340
I will stay with you.

168
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,390
We

169
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,300
go home together.

170
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,060
Let me check your temperature.

171
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,620
37.8.

172
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,980
Let's observe it a little longer.

173
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,500
It might fluctuate again tonight.

174
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,880
Do we need to do anything else?

175
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,340
You all don’t need to do anything.

176
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,020
Just rest well.

177
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,620
- Hu Ziyuan.
- I'm in the hospital.

178
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,020
- Mom and Dad...
- Message me on WeChat.

179
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,060
are so nice to you.

180
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,060
So, after you get better,

181
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:33,980
behave yourself.

182
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,820
Do you know?

183
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,420
I want to get this illness next time.

184
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,980
Little fairies fight little bad guys.

185
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,460
What are you talking about?

186
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,100
Stop nonsense.

187
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,900
Eat nutritious food.

188
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,140
Then the little fairies in your body

189
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,340
can fight little bad guys.

190
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
I am in the hospital.

191
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,580
Don't you know?

192
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,020
Can't you handle anything

193
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,500
without me?

194
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,780
Where's Mr. Zhou? Go find Mr. Zhou.

195
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,660
I am going out for a while.

196
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,940
Ok.

197
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,660
You go ahead.

198
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,220
I'm fine here.

199
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,060
I'll go to the office and be right back.

200
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,500
No worries.

201
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:28,380
(Fun together)

202
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,220
Uncle.

203
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,100
Hu Ziyuan has been absent for many days.

204
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,860
Ziyuan is sick and needs treatment.

205
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,260
He is hospitalized.

206
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,700
Will he be better tomorrow?

207
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,340
It's not that quick to get better.

208
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,900
Will he die?

209
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,980
No.

210
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,540
Ziyuan is very strong.

211
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,300
He will be able to see you soon.

212
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,140
Uncle.

213
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,780
Can you take me to see him?

214
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,580
Little kids should go there less often.

215
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,100
Otherwise, Mom will get angry.

216
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,180
Then can you go see him for me?

217
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,220
Let's go home first.

218
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,220
Let's go.

219
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,580
We have obtained Series B funding.

220
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,460
And our products

221
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,420
have been recognized

222
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,750
by large enterprises like Zhongzhi.

223
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,980
It proves that the path and strategy

224
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,380
are completely correct.

225
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,660
Everyone should have more confidence.

226
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,980
Deliver the products quickly,

227
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,620
continue to expand our core user base

228
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,620
and expand surrounding products.

229
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,300
Our only goal right now is

230
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,740
to secure Series C funding quickly

231
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,750
and make the company go public smoothly.

232
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,900
Feel free to say what you want.

233
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,180
Mr. Hu,

234
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,420
various industries are tightening up.

235
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,180
For a company like us,

236
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,860
financing and loans are not so smooth.

237
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,460
Actually,

238
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,140
we can slow down the pace

239
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,020
a bit more.

240
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,740
Isn't there a sum of money from Mr. Guo?

241
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,060
Originally, our account wasn't well-off.

242
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,740
Recently, we introduced new equipment.

243
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,860
Plus, we sent gifts to clients.

244
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,700
Calculating this way,

245
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,380
there's not much left.

246
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,060
You need to quickly think of a solution.

247
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,100
The money is about to run out.

248
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,380
You're a finance director.

249
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,300
All you can do is poor-mouthing, right?

250
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,940
Let me have a word with Mr. Hu first.

251
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,740
Wei, don't worry.

252
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,700
I'll find a way for the money issue.

253
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,860
There must be a way.

254
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,420
Cheng,

255
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,460
I mean,

256
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,580
we shouldn't be too aggressive.

257
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,780
Play for safety.

258
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,020
Regarding the listing or something,

259
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,220
let's not rush it.

260
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,060
What do you think?

261
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,500
Xunda Technology has gone public.

262
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,980
Several companies that started later

263
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,620
also announced

264
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,820
they will go public in the second half.

265
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,340
Where is Yaofeng inferior to them?

266
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,740
Cheng,

267
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,060
there is no rush

268
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,580
to go public at this moment.

269
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,300
Wei, it's really fortunate.

270
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,900
Ziyuan doesn't have leukemia.

271
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,620
If so, that's great!

272
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,260
After this,

273
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,900
I feel even more the importance of family.

274
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,620
That's good.

275
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,940
I really feel

276
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,940
that I haven't done enough for them.

277
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,460
So, you

278
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,700
should spend more time

279
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,380
accompanying them at home.

280
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,620
I mean,

281
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,820
for my wife and my kid,

282
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,500
I want Yaofeng

283
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,220
to be the top company.

284
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,340
I want to give them

285
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,980
the best and most prosperous life.

286
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,100
For this purpose,

287
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,020
I will spare no effort.

288
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,940
(Ms. Mu)
Is the kid doing better?

289
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,780
Yue.

290
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,300
Director Qin.

291
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,420
He's asleep.

292
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,020
Jiaojiao

293
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,700
let me see Ziyuan.

294
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,740
I specifically asked a colleague.

295
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,820
She said when seeing a sick kid,

296
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,180
you can't have snacks.

297
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,580
That will make Mom angry.

298
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,500
These days,

299
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,580
he has been very happy.

300
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,740
Staying in the hospital is enjoyable.

301
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,060
He actually said,

302
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,740
"Mom, I want to get sick again."

303
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,900
I was speechless.

304
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,180
Qin Jiaojiao is the same way.

305
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,620
She always thinks about getting sick.

306
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,190
She feels that whenever she is sick,

307
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,780
Mom will come to accompany her.

308
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,660
Working moms have a hard time.

309
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,980
Director Qin.

310
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,780
I am aware of the progress

311
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,380
that has fallen behind at work.

312
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,700
This weekend,

313
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,300
I will definitely catch up with it.

314
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,340
Yue,

315
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,140
I believe you.

316
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,060
Thank you for believing me at work.

317
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,220
You are already outstanding.

318
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,700
This recognition is what you deserve.

319
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,420
Actually, when I was young,

320
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,980
my situation was quite similar to them.

321
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,860
My Mom was always busy with work

322
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,420
and didn't have time to accompany me.

323
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,020
But whenever I got sick,

324
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,660
she would be by my side.

325
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,060
Every time I got better,

326
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,900
my Mom always changed jobs.

327
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,220
Life was getting more difficult.

328
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,820
My Mom's brows furrowed even deeper.

329
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,460
But I didn't care at all.

330
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,060
Every time I just thought

331
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,580
about getting sick

332
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,940
and making my Mom accompany me.

333
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,620
My Mom

334
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,300
passed away relatively early.

335
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,500
Pancreatic cancer.

336
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,860
When it was discovered,

337
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,460
it's already too late.

338
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,020
I didn't know at all

339
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,980
how much pressure she was under.

340
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,620
If I hadn't bothered her at that time,

341
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,420
hadn't dragged her down,

342
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,340
hadn't affected her work,

343
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,260
maybe

344
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,300
she wouldn't have...

345
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,660
I have always felt quite guilty,

346
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,700
and regretful.

347
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,660
- Director Qin.
- Yue.

348
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,380
I want to tell you

349
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,500
the choice you are making is right.

350
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,140
In the future, when Ziyuan grows up,

351
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,780
he will understand you.

352
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,500
Kids

353
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,820
are all like this when they're little.

354
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,300
Yue.

355
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,780
Dad, Mom,

356
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,260
what brings you here?

357
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,260
We are here to see our grandson.

358
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,380
He is my colleague.

359
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,260
- Come, come.
- Nice to meet you.

360
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,020
- Let me guide you.
- Ok.

361
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,140
Let's meet at the company.

362
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,260
Dad, Mom, it's here.

363
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,860
Grandpa, Grandma.

364
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,140
My sweetheart.

365
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,260
I'm sorry that you suffered a lot.

366
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,340
Look at him.

367
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,820
Why is he so dark and skinny?

368
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,740
Have a seat.

369
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,380
I will take care of you.

370
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,500
I promise

371
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,820
you won't suffer anymore.

372
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,100
I promise to make you fair, fat,

373
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,060
healthy and strong.

374
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
I miss you a lot.

375
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,900
Mom, why didn't you inform me

376
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,660
before you came here?

377
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,060
We originally thought to inform you.

378
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,220
He was sick.

379
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,980
Why didn't you tell us?

380
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,460
Dad, these days,

381
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,340
we have been taking care of him.

382
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,780
Ziyuan fell ill quite suddenly.

383
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,220
So we didn't want to disturb you.

384
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,180
How did you take care of him?

385
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,020
Sweetheart, are you hungry?

386
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,620
Grandma specifically made

387
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,820
the food you love the most.

388
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,740
Come.

389
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,220
Dad, actually,

390
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,940
the meals here are quite good.

391
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,820
No need to cook at home.

392
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,300
Anyway, home-made meals are reassuring.

393
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,660
Prawns.

394
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,700
Ziyuan still has a fever.

395
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,780
The doctor advised to eat less meat.

396
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,860
His food should be light.

397
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,070
He can only have porridge and soup.

398
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,300
I'm afraid he will have a fever.

399
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,180
How could a bland soup be nutritious?

400
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,700
All the nutrition is in the meat.

401
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,940
Come, honey.

402
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,340
This one.

403
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,540
How is it?

404
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,420
Grandpa, I can't eat anymore.

405
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,100
Even if you can't, you have to eat.

406
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,500
Only after eating can you regain energy.

407
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,220
- Dad, if he eats this...
- It's ok.

408
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,020
Please get ready to do nebulization.

409
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,380
What's wrong with you?

410
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,500
You guys, listen up.

411
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,140
The kid is currently sick.

412
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,140
The digestive system is weak.

413
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,060
So don't let him eat greasy food.

414
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,060
It may increase the burden.

415
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,380
Let him eat it once he is better.

416
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,220
Let me.

417
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,660
Thank you.

418
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,300
Well,

419
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,780
Dad, Mom,

420
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,660
have you booked the hotel?

421
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,580
Hotel?

422
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,100
Not yet, right?

423
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,300
It's ok. I will make the reservation.

424
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,020
You must have been tired

425
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,220
to take the train.

426
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,580
Go back and rest for a while first.

427
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,980
What do you think she means?

428
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,220
Not even allow us to go home.

429
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,900
Shall we go to the hotel?

430
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,260
How could we do that?

431
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,820
I'm going back to my son's house.

432
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,260
Does it matter if she speaks?

433
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,740
Hello? Cheng.

434
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,300
We arrived. We've been here for a while.

435
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,780
We have already seen my grandson.

436
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,740
How did you take care of him?

437
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,060
And

438
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,500
you don’t want us to go home, huh?

439
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,340
Why should we stay in a hotel?

440
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,100
Yue asked you to stay in a hotel?

441
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,780
Just listen to her.

442
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,420
Staying in a hotel is quite nice.

443
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,340
Let's leave it like this.

444
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,960
(Inpatient)

445
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,820
Honey,

446
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,220
since the first day Ziyuan got sick,

447
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,620
you waked up several times every night.

448
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,380
And you supervised him to do checks.

449
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,340
And medicine, injections, and nebulization.

450
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,740
If this continues,

451
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,220
he has not recovered,

452
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,500
but you are about to be exhausted.

453
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,780
This time my parents come

454
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,420
to take care of Ziyuan

455
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,980
and share the burden for us.

456
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,700
You

457
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,620
listen to me.

458
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,380
Go back and get a good sleep.

459
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,620
Ok?

460
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,340
Ok.

461
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,460
Honey,

462
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,340
after this time,

463
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,900
I finally understand

464
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,020
what is the most important thing to me.

465
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,100
You and the kid are safe and healthy.

466
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,140
We can return home together.

467
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,460
This is more important

468
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,700
than anything else.

469
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,620
Honey,

470
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,340
I

471
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,020
only care about you

472
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,100
and our family in my heart.

473
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,380
Wait until the kid is discharged.

474
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,060
You should go back and take a good rest.

475
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,660
Don't push yourself too hard.

476
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,500
I'm afraid

477
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,660
if I don't push myself,

478
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,460
I might...

479
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,940
I might soften my heart.

480
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,460
You have a kid

481
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,300
who is both cute and sensible,

482
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,580
and five years of marriage.

483
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,500
The kid is sick now.

484
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,900
He is the only one by your side.

485
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,140
You would feel soft-hearted

486
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,260
and fragile at this time.

487
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,860
It's nothing.

488
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,020
It's very normal.

489
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,140
Someone impulsively

490
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,140
wants to get a divorce.

491
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,820
The longer the time,

492
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,380
the more you think,

493
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,780
the harder it is.

494
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,660
Some people say

495
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,260
between the marriage and the divorce,

496
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,340
there is also a gray area.

497
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,380
Take this time to think it over

498
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,100
if you are willing to have another try.

499
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,380
I want

500
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,820
to have a open conversation with him.

501
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,460
I want to hear the truth from him.

502
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,460
(Haikang Hospital Outpatient)

503
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,480
Clamp the thermometer properly.

504
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,300
Have some water.

505
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,530
Olly, Double Gun.

506
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,980
Today you look good.

507
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,300
Let's take a look at the thermometer.

508
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,140
Mom.

509
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,620
Don't worry.

510
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,620
The fever has subsided.

511
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,660
Your child is recovering very well.

512
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,500
It's not a big problem.

513
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,340
Thank you.

514
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,860
Thank you.

515
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,500
We will be able to discharge soon.

516
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,740
Dad, Mom,

517
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,780
I'll take you to the hotel first.

518
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,500
Why aren't grandparents going home?

519
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,300
My sweetheart,

520
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,980
do you hope

521
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,020
that we will accompany you home?

522
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,460
I want you to accompany me home.

523
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,020
Good boy,

524
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,820
you really are my good grandson.

525
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,740
It was not in vain

526
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,300
to care for you.

527
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,940
Hu Cheng.

528
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,460
Your uncle made a call.

529
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,260
After knowing we stayed at a hotel,

530
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,300
he was very angry.

531
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,620
He kept asking

532
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,140
why.

533
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,580
He said you have always been filial.

534
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,780
But after we got here,

535
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,140
you didn't allow us to stay at home,

536
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,260
but a hotel.

537
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,580
Besides,

538
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,860
it's such a large house

539
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,180
with so many rooms. It's big enough.

540
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,500
Alright, you shut up.

541
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,660
He also asked if it was because

542
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,420
we did something annoying

543
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,780
that you all drove us out.

544
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,860
When we get back later

545
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,980
and meet your uncle

546
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,420
and my friends

547
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,600
who know about this matter,

548
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,100
how could we

549
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,300
face them?

550
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,860
Mom, this room.

551
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,900
It's so comfortable here.

552
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,580
This is much more comfortable than a hotel.

553
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,660
Look at this bed.

554
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,620
It's so comfortable to sleep at night.

555
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,580
Great!

556
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,860
Cheng.

557
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,740
Cheng.

558
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,620
You go take a break.

559
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,500
Let your Mom do it.

560
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,060
Mom, let me do it.

561
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,900
You take a rest.

562
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,340
Let me.

563
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,740
Leave it to me.

564
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,700
Cheng.

565
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,900
Cheng.

566
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,820
Let me ask you.

567
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,940
Did you give a handle

568
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,020
to your wife?

569
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,660
No, not at all.

570
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,740
But look at her expression.

571
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,140
It seems that someone owes her money.

572
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,220
Yue just started working.

573
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,980
Maybe she has been working hard lately.

574
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,660
Please be understanding.

575
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,460
Well,

576
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,020
if both of you work,

577
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,600
who will take care of the kid?

578
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,060
During this period,

579
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,500
we will take charge.

580
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,900
The kid will be close to babysitters.

581
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,980
Mom, have you eaten? Are you hungry?

582
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,980
Not hungry.

583
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,300
Cheng.

584
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,260
How is Zibo's situation?

585
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,460
He has already been interviewed

586
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,340
and just needs some training.

587
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,460
Some training?

588
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,820
Why is it so complicated?

589
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,340
Why not let him work directly?

590
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,100
The company has its own processes.

591
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,300
To be honest,

592
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,500
among them who you support for school,

593
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,660
only Zibo shows promise.

594
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,700
You need to manage him well,

595
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,660
and nurture him properly.

596
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,220
I think only he

597
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,740
can make you proud

598
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,260
and give you some face.

599
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,380
Your uncle and brother often asked me,

600
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,220
saying

601
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,460
how Zibo's work is arranged.

602
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,700
I said there’s no problem.

603
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,940
It's our own company.

604
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,980
No matter what,

605
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,580
we must arrange a position for him

606
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,180
as a vice president.

607
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,020
Is it?

608
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,220
What?

609
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,380
He is my nephew.

610
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,460
I will cultivate him well.

611
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,820
That's right.

612
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,700
Your company is so large.

613
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,420
Using our own people

614
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,140
will be relieved.

615
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:08,660
(Resume)

616
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,180
You went to Xunda after graduation?

617
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,820
It's true, uncle.

618
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,500
I heard

619
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,780
you also went to Xunda after graduation.

620
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,340
I resolutely followed in your footsteps.

621
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,140
I became a regular employee six months later

622
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,820
and then the team leader in a year and a half.

623
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,060
Of course, the leader appreciated me

624
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,300
and wanted to promote me to be a supervisor.

625
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,260
What is the name of your leader?

626
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,740
His surname is Zhao, Zhao Yu.

627
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,060
I don't know him.

628
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,180
Uncle,

629
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,420
I also followed up a few projects

630
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,620
at Xunda.

631
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,180
The resume is complicated.

632
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,980
Can I have a quick chat with you?

633
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,860
Weren't you doing well at Xunda?

634
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,820
The leader values you a lot.

635
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,020
Why did you come to Yaofeng?

636
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,940
My grandpa and my dad often asked me

637
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,180
to help you.

638
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,780
You help me?

639
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,940
Repay.

640
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,140
Repay.

641
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,660
From a career planning perspective,

642
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,020
Yaofeng has great development prospects.

643
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,980
Mainly, I can learn from you.

644
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,580
When Ziyuan grows up to take it over...

645
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,780
Help Ziyuan after I'm dead?

646
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,340
That's not what I meant.

647
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,660
Zibo, let me tell you.

648
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,300
The employees in my company

649
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,940
have put in tremendous effort

650
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,500
and have passed through assessments

651
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,500
to remain.

652
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,740
I don't want them to feel

653
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,780
that their leader is nepotistic

654
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,180
and abuses his power.

655
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,740
This is unfair to them.

656
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,540
What's more,

657
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,220
for you,

658
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,420
I do not want you

659
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,260
to be left with a reputation

660
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,740
of grabbing others' resources

661
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,660
and having connections.

662
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,940
In this case, no one in the company

663
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,820
will respect you.

664
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,620
Of course,

665
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,340
since I ask you here,

666
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,580
I will not give others

667
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,420
any excuses or handles.

668
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,260
But you have to remember.

669
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,980
Don't think that because I'm your uncle,

670
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,100
you have any privileges in the company.

671
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,420
You can't get promoted without effort.

672
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,220
On the contrary,

673
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,700
I will be stricter with you.

674
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,660
Do you remember what I said?

675
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,260
I remember, uncle.

676
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,460
Don't call me uncle at the company.

677
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,660
I get it, Mr. Hu.

678
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,140
Zibo.

679
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,580
It's Zibo, right?

680
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,500
You really look a bit like your uncle.

681
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,980
I recognize you at a glance.

682
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,420
He's so handsome and tall.

683
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,260
This young man is great.

684
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,580
Zhou Wei needs an executive assistant.

685
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,660
Follow him first.

686
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,380
Zibo, we are family.

687
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,900
Don't you trust your uncle?

688
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,780
You follow me first.

689
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,460
Let's team up and work together.

690
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,340
Let your uncle see your abilities.

691
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,580
I will.

692
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,500
Sure, sure.

693
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,340
Then I'll go first.

694
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,020
- Ok, ok.
- I'm going out.

695
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,060
Let's meet at the company.

696
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,900
Ok.

697
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,300
Goodbye, Mr. Hu.

698
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,660
I heard

699
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,500
Mr. Hu is also under pressure.

700
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,660
I read an interview before.

701
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,740
All the relatives' children around him

702
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,580
are sponsored by him to attend university.

703
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,740
In the future,

704
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,300
jobs, marriage, kids,

705
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,260
aren't they all relying on him?

706
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,060
A bloodsucking family.

707
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,900
Yes, it's true.

708
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,380
Mr. Hu is so miserable.

709
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,540
By the way, the name of the guy

710
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,880
who just started working today

711
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,380
is Hu Zibo.

712
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:53,300
(Yaofeng Tech Hu Zibo)

713
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,220
Why do you make him an assistant?

714
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,780
He is already a leader at Xunda.

715
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,020
He is too restless and impulsive.

716
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,620
I hope he can be a little more calm.

717
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,620
He is young.

718
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,260
It's normal to be ambitious.

719
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,660
When you first joined Xunda...

720
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,700
Forget it.

721
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,940
Wei,

722
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,460
I arrange him to work under you.

723
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,580
Be stricter with him.

724
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,820
Just scold him if you have to.

725
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,660
I wouldn't dare.

726
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,380
He is the junior.

727
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,100
Being strict with him is good for him.

728
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,220
Ok, ok.

729
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,180
Sure.

730
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,460
How is Ziyuan doing now?

731
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,420
He recovers quite quickly.

732
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,780
He keeps asking to play with Tongtong.

733
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,980
No problem.

734
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,460
You and Yue

735
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,300
should be fine now, right?

736
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,460
I don't know.

737
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,020
Ning Yue.

738
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,940
Can you help me

739
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,020
review these two contracts?

740
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,100
You are more attentive than those two.

741
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,980
Sure.

742
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,220
Thank you.

743
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:07,860
Yue.

744
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,420
This contract.

745
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,290
- Make copies.
- Make copies.

746
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,460
And these ones.

747
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,820
You need to get familiar with them.

748
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,820
We have a meeting at the subsidiary at 3 PM.

749
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,060
Ok, 3 PM.

750
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,980
You haven't changed a bit.

751
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,780
You printed all documents.

752
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,970
Only in this way can you feel at ease.

753
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,780
To be honest.

754
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,460
Actually, I dream every night

755
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,500
about

756
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,660
the demonic punishment

757
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,060
of deducting 100 yuan

758
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,220
for each typo.

759
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,500
The director was really harsh on us.

760
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,820
You were even harsher on me back then.

761
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,740
Go ahead. See you later.

762

Ok.

764
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,580
Let me watch the contract again

765
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,660
that we need to use later.

766
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,460
You've watched it so many times.

767
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,300
Everything will be fine.

768
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,140
Be more cautious.

769
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,300
Be careful.

770
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,460
Thank you.

771
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,780
This way.

772
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,700
Jiang,

00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,620

I will report regularly.

Ning Yue is professional and experienced.

776
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,100
You all can rest assured.

777
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,140
Of course, I am.

778
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,140

00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,660
Please rest assured, I will do my best.

780
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,100
Alright, go ahead.

781
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,160
I'll see you off.

782
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,100
Ning Yue, give a copy of meeting minutes

783
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,060
to them.

784

You were quick just now.

785
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,100
The meeting minutes are in your bag.

786
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,180
- Come.

787
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,780
Qin, can you help me take it?

788
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,620
Ok.

789
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,860
Director Qin,

790
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,580
Ms. Ning is so magnanimous.

00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,420
She is used to calling me that.

799
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,260
Let's go.

800
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,180
Ning... Ning Yue.

801
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,660
Alright, goodbye.

802
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,500
Sorry.

803
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,700
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

804
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,460
My bag, my bag.

Mr. Lei and Jiang are very professional.

811
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,380
This case could be resolved quickly.

812
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,540

813
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,940
please pay more attention to this case.

00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,660
Of course.

816
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,980
