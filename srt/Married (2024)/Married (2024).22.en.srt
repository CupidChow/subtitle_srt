What did you say?

5
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,040
Why didn't you tell me these earlier?

6
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,080
That… female lawyer.

7
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
What lawyer?

8
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,660
Mu Xiao.

9
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,880
Who told you to do this?

10
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,880
I did it for you!

11
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,790
For me?

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,160
Did I ask you to kill someone for me?

13
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,630
It's because of you!

14
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,630
You push me every day!

15
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,880
I wanted to please you,

16
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,280
to make you think

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,560
I'm useful.

18
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,070
Don't you always say

19
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,070
that we, the employees,

20
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,350
should solve problems

21
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,950
for you, the boss?

22
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,910
That we should

23
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,880
do whatever it takes

24
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,160
to get results?

25
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,190
How could I've followed
everything you said?

26
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,910
I shouldn't have

27
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,440
come to Yaofeng Tech in the first place.

28
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,590
Yeah,

29
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,750
I shouldn't have.

30
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,190
I should've stayed at Xunda Tech.

31
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,040
What about my mom?

32
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,670
My grandpa and dad kept telling me

33
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,880
to help you.

34
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,070
To repay you.

35
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
Repay you.

36
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,440
They mainly wanted me
to learn from you, Uncle.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,510
The AI project proposal,

38
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,070
where's it?

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,670
Downstairs? Okay.

40
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,240
He barely did anything

41
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,670
and you're praising him to the skies.

42
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,000
You're going to ruin him.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,950
Got it?

44
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,720
Hu Zibo, listen to me.

45
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,190
You don't deserve

46
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,160
to be here today.

47
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,280
Do you know that?

48
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,720
What?

49
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,560
You can't handle hearing this?

50
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,750
Can't take the pressure?

51
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,000
Then get lost!

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,600
The day you succeed,

53
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,230
no one will dare point a finger at you.

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,160
So

55
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,080
you have to succeed

56
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,980
by any means necessary.

57
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,120
Zibo,

58
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,790
put aside your work for now.

59
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,160
There's something

60
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,720
only you can do for me.

61
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,040
The police are investigating

62
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,310
who was driving

63
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,220
that Yaofeng Tech car

64
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,280
on the day of the incident.

65
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,800
The truth

66
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,520
will come out soon.

67
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,600
I heard

68
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,640
Yaofeng Tech is in serious trouble.

69
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,430
After Xianbin Capital pulled out,

70
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,310
all those small investment firms
followed suit,

71
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,720
even breaking contracts

72
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,990
to withdraw.

73
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,640
Most of Yaofeng's staff

74
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,230
have already left.

75
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,790
The ones still there

76
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,230
are either job hunting

77
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,990
or just coasting.

78
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
Even Hu Cheng

79
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,550
hasn't shown up at the office for days.

80
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,630
Hello?

81
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,720
Hi, Ms. Ning,

82
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,960
this is your property manager.

83
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,230
Are you home right now?

84
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Sorry,

85
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,910
I don't live there anymore.

86
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,000
Well,

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,510
your neighbor complained
about water leakage from your bathroom.

88
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,720
We knocked on the door,

89
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,870
but no one answered.

90
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,840
As the owner,

91
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,110
can you come and take a look?

92
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,310
You've already taken your stuff.

93
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,990
Why are you back?

94
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,040
The property manager called,

95
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,840
saying the bathroom's leaking.

96
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,430
Satisfied now?

97
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
I just don't get it.

98
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,280
The money I earned was all for you.

99
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,760
I could've given you a good life,

100
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,910
but you didn't want it.

101
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,470
You'd rather destroy this family,

102
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,790
destroy Yaofeng Tech,

103
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,280
and destroy me.

104
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,430

105
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,590
is you.

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,360
Fine.

107
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,260
I brought this on myself.

108
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,540
I deserve this.

109
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,860
But what about you?

110
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,780

but Yaofeng Tech

115
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,020
is drowning in debt.

116
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,660

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,860
he's changed a lot

196
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,220
these past years.

197
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,820
You must've suffered a lot.

198
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,540
Even I'm scared

199
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,100
of his temper sometimes

200
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,140
at the office,

201
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,340
not to mention you.

202
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,300
Wei,

203
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,540
- Cheng is kind at heart.
- let's not talk…

204
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,740
When I was in college, I had hep-B.

205
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,980
Everyone was scared
of catching it from me.

206
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,580
They stayed far away.

207
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,540
But Cheng

208
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,380
came to the hospital every day,

209
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,780
bringing me meals.

210
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,140
What a fool.

211
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,420
Wei, rest well.

212
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,820
Let's not talk about this.

213
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,500
Yue,

214
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,780
Cheng

215
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,780
has been suffering too.

216
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,980
He's frustrated.

217
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,580
I've never seen him
smile from the heart.

218
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,780
But when he

219
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,380
talks about you and Ziyuan,

220
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,580
he's truly happy.

221
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,380
I can see

222
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,820
he loves you both very much.

223
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,380
He really cares.

224
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,060
Trust me,

225
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,220
I'm telling the truth.

226
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,340
Cheng cares too much about you.

227
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,500
He means no harm,

228
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,100
just has a poor way of expressing it.

229
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,060
He knows he was wrong.

230
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,900
Please,

231
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,060
give him another chance.

232
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,140
He'll change.

233
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,620
Yue,

234
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,220
think it over, okay?

235
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,060
Yue…

236
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,740
If you need anything,

237
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,540
just call me.

238
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,220
I'll come to see you again.

239
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,300
No need.

240
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,660
The doctor said
he doesn't have much time left.

241
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,140
Let him rest well.

242
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,520
Hello.

243
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,380
(Police)
Are you Hu Cheng,

244
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,370
the head of Yaofeng Tech?

245
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,340
Yes, that's me.

246
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,450
We need your assistance

247
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,880
with an economic crime investigation.

248
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,940
Please come with us.

249
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,340
Can I say goodbye to my friend first?

Be with them.

262
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,420
You know you've made mistakes.

263

it'd be that I didn't get
to enjoy enough good days.

Cheng, remember this.

273
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,460
It's fine to aim higher,

274
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,700
but you've got to know

275
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,340

Book me a ticket

307
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,900
for the earliest flight on Saturday.

308
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,380
This time, I must sit down with Mr. Mo

309
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,780
and go through investment details.

310
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,660
I need him

311
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,980
to see the real potential

312
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,780

How's Xunda's marketing proposal
coming along?

314
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,540
Manager Peng is already
in Meeting Room 6

315
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,900
discussing it with Xunda's team.

316
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,510
Good.

317
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,940
We've signed the contract with them

318
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,900
and need your signature.

319
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,740
Great.

320
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,000
Is everything ready

321
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,100
for the online conference at 2 PM?

322
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,140
Yes, just waiting for you to start.

323
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,730
These two contracts aren't quite right.

324
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,540
Send them back to Legal Department
for a redo.

325
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,860
I've already posted amendments
in the group chat.

326
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,020
Please review them.

327
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,860
Hello, Ms. Ning.

328
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,700
Ms. Ning.

329
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,340
Hello, Ms. Ning.

00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,980
Word and rest.

335
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,300
I'll treat you to drinks later.

- Ms. Ning.
- Ms. Ning.

341
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,580
Take your seat.

342
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,900
Let's get started right now.

343
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,270
Manager Tian,

344
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,540
Ms. Ning is busy.

345
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,700
You can tell me what you need.

346
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,700
Ms. Tian, could you wait in the lounge?

347
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,740
Ms. Tian!

348
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,700
Ms. Tian,
Ms. Ning is in the middle of something.

349
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,540
Ms. Tian!

350
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,460
Ms. Tian,

351
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,140
could you meet her a bit later?

352
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,660
Ms. Tian, please speak to me.

353
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,900
Please step aside!

354
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,780
Ms. Ning, I'm sorry.

355
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,340
Why didn't you call me today?

356
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,460
Ms. Tian,

357
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,500
are you here to observe and learn?

358
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,540
Observe what?

359
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,020
This is a funding meeting.

360
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,340
I'm the sole liaison
for Xianbin Capital.

361
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,180
What's the meaning of not informing me?

362
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,380
Ms. Tian,

363
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,750
this meeting is
about our strategic partnership

364
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,060
with Jingbei Capital.

365
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,580
Maybe

366
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,060
it's best for you to step out.

367
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,400
Didn't Ms. Ning just say

368
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,860
I could sit in

369
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,060
and observe?

370
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,460
Here I am.

371
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,980
Of course, Ms. Tian,

372
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,700
you're welcome to sit in.

373
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,300
However, this meeting

374
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,020
involves a lot of
confidential information.

375
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,980
If Jingbei Capital's interests

376
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,300
suffer any loss,

377
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,510
Xianbin Capital will bear
full responsibility.

378
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,060
Are you okay with that?

379
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,340
Alright, let's proceed.

380
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,870
Ms. Ning,

381
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,140
the total project value
is estimated at 3,000,000 yuan.

382
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,460
The cooperation period

383
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,900
starts from project tracking

384
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,860
and ends after maintenance completion.

385
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,420
Before project registration

386
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,900
or prequalification,

387
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,100
Jingbei Capital must deposit

388
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,340
a good-faith fee of 1,000,000 yuan

389
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,340
to Yaofeng Tech
at least five days ahead.

390
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,640
If the project is awarded,

391
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,860
the fee will be refunded
to Jingbei Capital.

392
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,060
During the cooperation,

393
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,780
Jingbei Capital is responsible for,

394
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,740
but not limited to, project bidding,

395
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,260
engineering contract signing…

396
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,340
How dare she!

397
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,220
No manners.

398
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,060
Honestly,

399
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,420
Ms. Ning's being too polite.

400
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,940
If it were me,
I'd call security to drag her out.

401
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:55,860
It's infuriating.

402
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,900
How arrogant!

403
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,140
(Zhongzhi Group)

404
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,820
Thank you.

405
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,180
Mr. Lin.

406
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,060
Mr. Li.

407
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,020
- We'll follow up on the details.
- Yes.

408
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,540
If there are any issues later,

409
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,060
feel free to reach out to me

410
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,260
or Mr. He.

411
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,580
Okay.

412
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,540
Rest assured.

413
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,460
(Feasibility Study
on AI Medical Projects)

414
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,500
Mr. He.

415
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,500
Ms. Ning.

416
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,300
Even a smart robot

417
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,260
needs a recharge, doesn't it?

418
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,660
That Tian Qiuzi

419
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,940
is always overthinking,

420
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,500
afraid of being sidelined.

421
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,940
She's almost losing her mind over it.

422
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,060
I'm guessing

423
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,540
you played on her fears on purpose

424
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,220
so that she'd relay the message

425
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,860
to Mr. Mo,

426
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,420
giving him pressure.

427
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,420
Mr. He, it looks like

428
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,700
nothing escapes your eyes.

429
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,740
As a professional manager,

430
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,460
I must make myself worth the salary.

431
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,900
You're absolutely worth it.

432
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,260
If I had known

433
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,820
the mess Yaofeng Tech was in back then,

434
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,460
I'd never have agreed

435
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,020
to let you acquire my company.

436
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,460
Your company was already in trouble,

437
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,060
and you took out massive loans

438
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,300
to buy another near-bankrupt company.

439
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,060
The thought of it still freaks me out.

440
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,020
So

441
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,660
I'm a great actress, right?

442
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,620
No,

443
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,900
you're a gambler.

444
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,460
How bold you are!

445
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,300
You're a real gambler

446
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,060
who knows exactly what risks to take.

447
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,500
Honestly, Mr. He,

448
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,860
I'm really grateful to you.

449
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,620
Thank you

450
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,820
for joining Yaofeng.

451
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,660
Without you, your team,

452
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,340
your expertise and your skills,

453
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,340
I wouldn't have made it this far.

454
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,860
Yaofeng Tech's comeback

455
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,940
is all because of you.

456
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,540
When Hu Cheng got into trouble,

457
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,940
you surrendered all your funds

458
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,380
and properties

459
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,700
to reduce his sentence,

460
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,100
and then took over

461
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,740
the debt-ridden,
near-bankrupt Yaofeng Tech.

462
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,260
Over the past year,

463
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,820
I've watched you

464
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,620
persuade investors,

465
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,260
stabilize existing funds,

466
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,540
navigate the tricky waters
of the old employees,

467
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,580
restructure

468
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,540
Yaofeng's internal setup,

469
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,660
integrate resources,

470
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,140
and even restore
Xianbin Capital's confidence

471
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,220
in Yaofeng Tech.

472
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,620
You've held up

473
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,460
an entire sky on your own.

474
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,940
Alright, Mr. He,

475
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,250
what's with

476
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,260
all the compliments today?

477
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,660
You're planning to ask for a raise?

478
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,380
Exactly.

479
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,740
Well, nice try.

480
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,660
We're still deep in debt.

481
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,420
Let's keep working hard together.

482
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,660
Brush on some oil.

483
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,220
This looks good with the color.

484
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,700
Where's the cumin?

485
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,540
Here it is.

486
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,820
Sprinkle more sesame.

487
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,380
Ms. Luo.

488
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,380
Admit defeat?

489
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,340
Cutting my losses is the best policy.

490
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,020
Having a clear sense of the situation

491
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,340
is my strong suit.

492
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,380
It's called moving on,

493
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,300
you know?

494
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,740
Sometimes there are other ways.

495
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,780
Try my skewer.

496
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,700
It's burnt.

497
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,220
Let me get you a new one.

498
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,340
Boss, have some meat.

499
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,860
Thanks.

500
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,180
Caught one?

501
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,500
Ms. Luo, I told you

502
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,750
that you might win at everything else,

503
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,620
but in fishing,

504
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,900
our boss has never lost.

505
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,500
Fishing isn't hard.

506
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,900
It's all about luck.

507
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,940
Unlike grilling,

508
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,500
which requires skill and experience,

509
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,700
you know?

510
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,660
He's talking about you.

511
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,320
Talking about me?

512
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,730
He's obviously talking about Mr. Mo.

513
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,300
Fishing isn't just about luck.

514
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,140
Want to catch a big one?

515
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,700
Sure.

516
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,020
How big?

517
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,170
Come on, sprinkle some…

518
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,060
Ten kilograms.

519
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,880
Mr. Mo and Ms. Luo…

520
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,820
- Wait here.
- Don't ask me.

521
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,660
I don't know.

522
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,540
Out in the world, stay out of trouble.

523
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,940
Want some?

524
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,060
Mr. Mo,
you're usually so busy with business,

525
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,020
yet you still have time to enjoy this.

526
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,100
Impressive.

527
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,260
Well,
my intentions aren't really fishing.

528
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,540
Fresh off the grill.

529
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,380
Hooray.

530
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,060
Seems like

531
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,300
your life

532
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,540
is too comfortable.

533
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,260
That could be true.

534
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,980
Luo Yating is

535
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,140
an excellent conductor.

536
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,950
Her control of rhythm is impeccable.

537
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,020
So you enjoy

538
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,180
being controlled.

539
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,260
I wouldn't say that.

540
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,140
I'm thin,

541
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,300
always standing at the forefront.

542
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,990
Having someone hold me back

543
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,900
makes me feel safer.

544
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,460
Provocative.

545
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,460
Do me a favor.

546
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,020
You help me catch a fish.

547
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,500
Big one.

548
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,260
Use that rod.

549
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,340
Ziyuan.

550
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,660
You have classes tomorrow.

551
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,220
Why aren't you asleep yet?

552
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,340
Ziyuan,

553
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,620
don't cry.

554
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,060
Mom.

555
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,460
Does Dad not want me anymore?

556
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,940
Why doesn't he ever come to see me?

557
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,580
He…

558
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,660
Why doesn't he ever call me?

559
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,500
Come here.

560
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,340
Come on.

561
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,460
Let me give you a hug.

562
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,460
It'll be alright.

563
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,020
Ziyuan,

564
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,180
don't cry.

565
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,420
Listen to me,

566
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,180
your dad

567
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,900
made a small mistake.

568
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,260
And his punishment

569
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,500
is that he can't see you

570
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,700
for now.

571
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,940
Ziyuan, you have to understand

572
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,660
everyone

573
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,260
has to pay the price

574
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,500
for their actions.

575
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,180
So your dad

576
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,980
is taking responsibility

577
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,860
for his decisions.

578
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,580
But you have to believe

579
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,390
he loves you very, very much.

580
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,340
Okay?

581
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,200
Okay.

582
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,020
Let's not be sad, no more crying.

583
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,540
Be good and wait for him to come back.

584
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,340
Come here.

585
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,850
It's okay.

586
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,620
(Sunkin Center)

587
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,380
What's wrong?

588
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,260
It's still that Ms. Lan.

589
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,120
She's using her major project
as leverage

590
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,780
and refusing to sign
the renewal contract.

591
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,220
I've heard she's been stirring up

592
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,220
a few already hesitant shareholders.

593
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,180
The shareholders' meeting
is coming up soon.

594
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,780
I'm really worried
they might turn against us.

595
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,420
The one stirring things up

596
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,300
probably isn't Ms. Lan.

597
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,700
Then who is it?

598
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,420
Ms. Lan.

599
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,740
Mr. Yan.

600
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,580
Mr. Qi.

601
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,420
I know you're here

602
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,100
out of respect for Mr. Hu.

603
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,500
Rest assured.

604
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,900
I'll express your compliments

605
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,340
to Mr. Hu.

606
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,380
Mr. Yan

607
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,380
and Mr. Qi.

608
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,380
You two

609
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,950
are the founding members of Yaofeng.

610
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,740
You helped build the company
with Mr. Hu.

611
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,660
Ms. Lan.

612
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,300
You're a long-time friend of Zhou Wei.

613
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,930
It's been a tough year

614
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,260
for all of you.

615
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,660
Let me toast you.

616
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,100
To be honest,

617
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,500
this year, the old team at the company

618
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,620
has either left

619
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,540
or been dismissed.

620
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,100
If Mr. Hu were still the boss,

621
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,980
the company wouldn't be like this.

622
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,380
I admit

623
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,500
Ning Yue is a competent legal assistant,

624
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,700
but

625
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,580
she's completely unqualified
in technical matters,

626
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,020
and she's not suitable

627
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,620
to lead Yaofeng.

628
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,340
This year,

629
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,860
if it weren't for her,

630
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,420
Yaofeng Tech would've gone under.

631
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,900
If it weren't for her,

632
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,100
Mr. Hu wouldn't have been in trouble
in the first place.

633
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,940
And Yaofeng Tech

634
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,100
wouldn't have ended up in this state.

635
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,900
Yaofeng Tech

636
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,100
was built from the ground up
by Hu Cheng.

637
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,740
If we want to save Yaofeng,

638
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,740
only Hu Cheng has the ability to do it,

639
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,220
and only he is qualified

640
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,300
to take charge again.

641
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,500
Ms. Tian,

642
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,980
if you have something to say,

643
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,140
just say it.

644
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,540
At the next shareholders' meeting,

645
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,740
I hope

646
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,180
to have the support of you three.

647
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,580
To be precise,

648
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,620
it's what Mr. Hu hopes.

649
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,180
He hopes

650
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,860
you'll help him

651
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,020
kick out the usurper,

652
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,860
and bring Yaofeng Tech

653
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,500
back to

654
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,220
its rightful founder.

655
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,940
Rest assured.

656
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,060
Mr. Hu won't forget your favors.

657
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,820
As long as you're willing to help,

658
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,100
once he's back…

659
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,220
Who's coming back?

660
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,700
Yue.

661
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,580
Please sit down.

662
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,450
Ms. Lan,

663
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,700
Mr. Qi and Mr. Yan,

664
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,060
regarding the plan

665
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,660
to restructure the organization,

666
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,580
do you have any new thoughts?

667
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,140
Ms. Ning,

668
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,460
I invited them to…

669
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,260
This isn't your place to speak.

670
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,260
This is my meeting.

671
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,780
These three are my guests.

672
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,860
But they're my people.

673
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,100
What do you mean, your people?

674
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,260
Sorry, but today

675
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,340
I have some

676
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,900
very important company matters

677
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,900
to discuss with them.

678
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,620
I hope unrelated people

679
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,220
can get out.

680
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,100
- Do you mind?
- I'm related.

681
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,620
I'm representing Hu Cheng!

682
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,860
Let me repeat.

683
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,060
Today I have something important to say.

684
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,740
And I hope you'll get out.

685
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,020
You keep talking about the company.

686
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,180
Is Yaofeng yours?

687
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,060
It is now.

688
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,860
But it was Hu Cheng
who laid the foundation.

689
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,100
You stepped on him to rise to the top.

690
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,340
Foundation?

691
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,460
That was a pile of rubble.

692
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,260
I merely rebuilt on that rubble.

693
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,700
Then let me ask you, Ms. Ning.

694
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,380
Who created that rubble?

695
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,260
Do I need to explain that to you?

696
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,780
Who do you think you are?

697
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,260
So, the three of you,

698
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,460
are you really planning

699
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,700
to follow someone like her,

700
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,540
aren't you?

701
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,540
She's disloyal.

702
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,460
She could even

703
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,420
send her own husband to jail.

704
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,260
Am I wrong?

705
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,940
What about your promise of

706
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,300
weathering the storm together?

707
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,460
When your husband was rich,

708
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,940
you stayed at home,
lived a carefree life,

709
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,980
and got on your high horse.

710
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,460
Now that he's down,

711
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,620
you can't wait to kick him.

712
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,180
I've never seen someone
so lacking in loyalty.

713
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,100
Ms. Tian!

714
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,420
You're not part of the company.

715
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,950
Please leave.

716
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,420
If I were you,

717
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,900
I'd choose

718
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,740
to keep quiet at the right time.

719
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,380
Don't embarrass yourself.

720
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,260
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

721
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,620
This is Tian Qiuzi from Xianbin Capital.

722
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,060
When are you available?

723
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,300
I'd like to talk to you about Yaofeng.

724
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,500
Alright.

725
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,940
I'll wait for you.

726
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,180
Everyone,

727
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,420
today

728
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,300
I really have something

729
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,540
to tell you all.

730
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,500
Lately,

731
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,340
I haven't updated you

732
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,900
on the company's situation.

733
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,700
That's my mistake.

734
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,340
I'm sorry.

735
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,020
Starting tomorrow,

736
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,780
I'll make sure
to update all shareholders immediately

737
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,260
on the company's strategic goals,

738
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,260
future plans,

739
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,340
current profits, and any potential risks

740
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,260
we might face.

741
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,180
You have my word.

742
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,660
Also, I have some good news to share.

743
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,680
Recently, I've been in touch
with several investment institutions,

744
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,100
and many have shown interest
in partnering with us.

745
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,740
I know the past year hasn't been easy.

746
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,260
Thank you all

747
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,860
for your support and trust.

748
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,060
Even though I'm only

749
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,980
the interim head of Yaofeng Tech.

750
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,700
And I don't know

751
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,580
how long this interim period will last.

752
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,340
But during this period,

753
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,460
I still hope

754
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,420
to fight alongside all of you.

755
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,500
Thank you.

756
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,860
Ms. Ning.

757
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,260
This is on us.

758
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,220
It's what we should do.

759
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,300
