=Episode 23=

3
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,300
I know

4
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,540
the past year

5
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,380
hasn't been easy.

6
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,700
Thank you all

7
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,300
for your support and trust.

8
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,500
Even though I'm only

9
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,420
the interim head of Yaofeng Tech.

10
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,160
And I don't know

11
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,020
how long this interim period will last.

12
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,780
But during this period,

13
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,060
I still hope

14
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,020
to fight alongside all of you.

15
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,100
Thank you.

16
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,540
Ms. Ning.

17
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,860
This is on us.

18
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,900
It's what we should do.

19
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,900
Thank you.

20
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,620
Thank you.

21
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,300
Thank you.

22
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,860
Ms. Ning, Ms. Lan,

23
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,700
goodbye.

24
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,020
- Okay.
- See you.

25
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,850
Okay.

26
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,760
- We should go.
- Bye.

27
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,700
- Okay.
- Bye.

28
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,540
Yue,

29
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,100
you've changed.

30
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,900
From the first time
I had dinner at your place to now,

31
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,580
you've changed so much.

32
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,580
But, Ms. Lan,

33
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,100
I'm not enjoying any of this.

34
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,620
I had no choice.

35
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,780
To be honest,

36
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,860
from the first time I met Hu Cheng,

37
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,700
I told Zhou Wei

38
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,620
I didn't like him.

39
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,780
But I'm a businesswoman,

40
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,260
I stand by my interests.

41
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,700
If Hu Cheng

42
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,200
knocked you down,

43
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,180
I'd choose him without hesitation.

44
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,220
Of course.

45
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,540
That Tian Qiuzi

46
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,340
keeps making things difficult for me.

47
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,780
I'm so tired.

48
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,620
What's she done now?

49
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
The usual.

50
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,440
Stirring up Yaofeng's senior shareholders
to support her.

51
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,660
At the shareholders' meeting,

52
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,090
she wants to replace me.

53
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,900
She thinks you took over Yaofeng

54
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,820
to take everything away from Hu Cheng.

55
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,860
But she doesn't know

56
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,100
that you actually want
to return Yaofeng to him

57
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,300
after the debts are cleared.

58
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,460
Sorry,

59
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,100
the subscriber you dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

60
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,730
Please redial later.

61
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,600
Sorry,

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,120
- Where's Mr. Mo?
- the subscriber you dialed…

63
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,920
Ms. Tian, Mr. Mo is on a business trip.

64
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,380
Again?

65
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,580
Did he leave any tasks for me?

66
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,740
No, Ms. Tian.

67
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,180
Ms. Tian.

68
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,500
(Analysis Report on Yaofeng Tech)

69
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,780
Who gave you this?

70
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,100
Ms. Tian, the Yaofeng project

71
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,420
has been assigned to our team
since last week.

72
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,180
I've always been in charge
of the project.

73
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,540
Maybe you should check with Mr. Mo.

74
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,220
I need to hurry for a meeting with him.

75
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,260
- He is in the office?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,260
I have to go.

77
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,220
Bye.

78
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,860
What did you say?

79
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,500
You found Ruan Meiying?

80
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,500
Where is she?

81
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,420
They said

82
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,860
she's at a Chinese-owned bar
in Southeast Asia

83
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,740
as a cleaner.

84
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,340
When you finish, you can leave.

85
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,220
Hey Mary, let's go.

86
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,100
It's me.

87
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,740
I know where you are.

88
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,620
Ruan Meiying,

89
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,540
I'm well aware
of your current situation.

90
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,880
The agency that took you abroad
was illegal.

91
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,010
They scammed you.

92
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,510
They promised to help you
immigrate to Australia

93
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,700
and buy property for you.

94
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,000
But they took you
to Southeast Asia instead

95
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,540
and drained your money.

96
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,780
Now you're working as a cleaner

97
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,620
at a bar,

98
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,660
living worse than before.

99
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,260
Did you call me

100
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,980
to laugh at me?

101
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,470
To persuade you to turn yourself in.

102
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,040
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life

103
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,820
homeless and on the run,

104
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,690
always in fear?

105
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,540
You don't speak English well,

106
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,860
have no support,

107
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,420
and you can't even
guarantee your safety.

108
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,300
Do you really want a life like that?

109
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,100
Come back.

110
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,820
Ms. Mu and I

111
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,940
will help you fight the case.

112
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,220
Once you get through this,

113
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,900
you can start over.

114
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,540
Your future

115
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,420
will definitely be better than this.

116
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,940
Trust me.

117
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,700
I'll help you.

118
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,240
If you turn yourself in,

119
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,460
everything will get better.

158
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,460
As long as she gets

159
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,900
forgiveness from me and Hu Cheng,

160
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,660
her criminal liability

161
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,860
can be minimized.

00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,020

My boy.

173
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,540
You gain weight.

174
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,460
Did you miss me?

175
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,500
I'm fine.

176
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,180
You're so heavy.

177
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,740
Let's go home.

178
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,660
Alright?

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,140

How are you getting back?

182
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,120
Is someone picking you up?

183
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,540
Why are you riding with my dad?

184
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,540
Why isn't anyone picking you up?

185
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,980
Duoduo, don't be rude.

186
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,380
Because

187
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,420
I did something bad.

188
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,180
Did you do bad things with my dad?

189
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,820
It's okay.

190
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,900
Just fix your mistakes

191
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,740
together with my dad from now on.

192
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,580
Let me tell you.

193
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,780
Cheng's wife is so beautiful

194
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,780
and super young.

195
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,620
Cheng, your wife must be busy today,
right?

196
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,880
Isn't she always handling
your company's business?

197
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,380
Whenever she comes,
she's always talking business with you.

198
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,580
You guys are really into it.

199
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,140
She's clearly a career woman.

200
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,260
She's not my wife.

201
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,860
Here you are.

202
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,020
Ms. Ning,

203
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,900
people are saying

204
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,260
you're working so hard

205
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,140
just to hand a better Yaofeng back

206
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,260
to your husband when he returns.

207
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,020
I'm already divorced.

208
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,900
Ex-husband.

209
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,260
I've heard the older employees

210
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,820
compare you

211
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,260
to the former CEO the most.

212
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,220
Oh? What do they say?

213
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,900
They say

214
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,620
the previous one

215
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
was cold and iron-fisted.

216
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,540
And you?

217
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,380
You're like a breath of fresh air,

218
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,780
trustworthy.

219
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,300
I've never met Mr. Hu,

220
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,540
but from what they say,

221
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,260
everyone seems afraid of him.

222
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,220
Honestly, I'm curious.

223
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,500
What kind of person

224
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,740
is he?

225
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,660
No matter who leads Yaofeng
in the future,

226
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,380
I can promise you

227
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,700
that he must be a capable leader.

228
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,180
Mr. Hu?

229
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,620
Mr. Hu!

230
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,740
It's really you!

231
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,380
Still working at Yaofeng?

232
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,540
Yes.

233
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,100
Yue didn't dismiss

234
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,260
most of us old employees.

235
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,300
And during the toughest times
for the company,

236
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,940
she still treated us well.

237
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,190
Mr. Hu,

238
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,980
honestly,

239
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,100
Yue has had a hard time

240
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,740
managing everything in the company

241
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,140
on her own.

242
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,380
(Technical Development Contract)

243
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,740
Mr. Hu, I'll get back to work.

244
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,080
Let me know if you're in need.

245
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,060
Why didn't you call me?

246
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,140
I heard

247
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,100
you've been doing well.

248
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,700
This is your chance

249
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,140
to prove yourself, finally.

250
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,460
That's all you wanted to say?

251
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,620
Thank you

252
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,700
for keeping your promise

253
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,220
and not bringing Hu Ziyuan to see me.

254
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,740
Ziyuan misses you.

255
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,300
I did it for his sake.

256
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,940
I didn't want him to see me like this,

257
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,380
behind bars.

258
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,540
So, Hu Cheng,

259
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,780
you're still just thinking of yourself.

260
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,100
You didn't want him

261
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,340
to see you behind bars,

262
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,580
to see that you're down.

263
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,580
You didn't want

264
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,900
your perfect image as a father
to be tarnished.

265
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,220
But have you considered him?

266
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,020
Have you thought about what he wants?

267
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,980
He's your son.

268
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,620
He misses you.

269
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,740
He wants to see his father.

270
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,820
Aren't you the one

271
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,380
who's hoping I'll never see him again?

272
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,220
Hu Cheng, you haven't changed at all.

273
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,540
Never.

274
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,300
Given your attitude,

275
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,700
let's not talk about this now.

276
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,560
Call me when you're in a better mood.

277
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,620
Hello?

278
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,900
I'm sorry.

279
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,540
I didn't mean to argue with you.

280
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,980
My attitude was wrong.

281
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,260
I apologize.

282
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,940
You know,

283
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,820
honestly,

284
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,420
I really want to see Ziyuan.

285
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,780
I'll transfer some money to you.

286
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,860
Contact me when you're settled.

287
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,780
I'll count on you, Mr. Xing.

288
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,240
- Cheers.
- To money.

289
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,700
Mr. Xing

290
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,820
and all the bosses present,

291
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,900
with the arrangements today,

292
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,460
are you satisfied?

293
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,300
If my reception

294
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,300
didn't live up to your expectations,
I apologize.

295
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,940
About that favor I mentioned,

296
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,820
I'll count on you.

297
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,940
Right now,

298
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,300
let me toast you.

299
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,900
I need your help.

300
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,780
Thanks in advance.

301
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,020
I'll repay you.

302
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,140
- No problem.
- Good.

303
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,460
(Pick up Hu Cheng)

304
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,860
I'll freshen up.

305
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,020
You all go ahead.

306
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,100
Enjoy yourselves.

307
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,900
(I forgot.)

308
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,860
(Pick up Hu Cheng)

309
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,100
Enjoy your life.

310
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,860
Cheers.

311
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,580
Zibo has been back for a few months.

312
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,020
He's very well adjusted.

313
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,700
Don't worry.

314
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,420
Everything at home is good.

315
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,220
Well,

316
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,420
have you seen Yue and Ziyuan?

317
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,180
Yes.

318
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,700
Don't worry.

319
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,020
Do you have a place to stay?

320
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,860
Tell me.

321
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,860
Yes.

322
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,220
Don't worry, Mom, I'm fine.

323
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,380
(Sealed off by the People's Court)

324
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,820
If not, come home

325
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,300
and stay with us.

326
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,860
Okay?

327
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,020
Mom,

328
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,660
Yue's calling me.

329
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,660
Let's leave on that.

330
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,700
I'll call you back.

331
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,780
(Tian Qiuzi)

332
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,020
Welcome back.

333
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,500
Dear, you've had a hard day.

334
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,960
I set so many alarms

335
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,320
to make sure I'd pick you up today,

336
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,980
but it was so noisy.

337
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,120
I didn't hear them.

338
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,380
See,

339
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,700
I even booked a special car
to pick you up.

340
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,260
I'm really sorry.

341
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,860
I'm tired.

342
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,140
I did want to pick you up,

343
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,140
but our situation

344
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,940
is really precarious right now.

345
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,500
I don't know what kind of rumors
Mo Xianbin has been hearing,

346
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,260
but he's been so cold toward me.

347
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,780
But it doesn't matter.

348
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,220
I've already been in touch

349
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,380
with bigger investors.

350
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,980
Guess what?

351
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,780
Mr. Jiang from Haoya Group.

352
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,180
Over the past year,

353
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,340
he has been quietly acquiring

354
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,780
Yaofeng's shares.

355
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,380
Now he's the largest shareholder.

356
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,540
I've also

357
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,060
secured the support of Xiao and Fang.

358
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,580
They're on our side.

359
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,540
Now everyone is waiting for you

360
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,700
to make a comeback.

361
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,260
At the next
Yaofeng shareholders' meeting,

362
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,420
I have a big gift for you.

363
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,660
I'm really…

364
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,140
Hold on a second, dear.

365
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,820
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

366
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,500
I thought everyone was
almost done drinking.

367
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,060
Yeah.

368
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,660
Right now?

369
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
How about

370
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,500
tomorrow?

371
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,780
Tomorrow night, I'll host

372
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,780
and treat everyone to a proper meal.

373
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,540
Sorry for the inconvenience.

374
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,300
All right, rest assured.

375
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,560
I'll contact you tomorrow

376
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,860
and send you the address.

377
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,700
Okay?

378
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,180
Perfect, Mr. Jiang.

379
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,980
See you then.

380
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,540
He is Mr. Jiang's brother-in-law

381
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,860
and the second-in-command
in their group.

382
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,460
Most of the company's decisions

383
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,380
are made by him.

384
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,020
But I think you already know him.

385
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,100
He is Song…

386
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,280
What's his first name again?

387
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,260
I can't remember.

388
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,580
Let's meet him first.

389
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,860
Mr. Song, I'm sorry.

390
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,580
Traffic was a bit heavy.

391
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,420
Never mind.

392
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,380
This is Mr. Hu.

393
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,980
Cheng, sit down.

394
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,180
Have a seat.

395
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,780
Song,

396
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,740
if you need to rest,

397
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,060
you should rest properly.

398
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,180
Why would I fire him?

399
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,260
He was taking a high salary

400
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,140
while coasting along,

401
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,620
contributing nothing
to the company anymore.

402
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,620
And

403
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,340
he was lining his own pockets.

404
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,220
At Yaofeng,

405
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,500
we don't keep freeloaders.

406
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,580
Excuse me, Mr. Song.

407
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,500
What is it?

408
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,420
I don't think this meeting is necessary.

409
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,620
He's someone

410
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,460
I dismissed from Yaofeng.

411
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,460
So?

412
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,660
It doesn't matter.

413
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,000
So

414
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,940
is this meeting still necessary?

415
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,140
Fine.

416
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,460
I understand.

417
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,140
But under the circumstances,

418
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,140
can't we just endure this for now?

419
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,220
You know,

420
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,630
my situation

421
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,580
isn't much better than yours.

422
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,300
But I don't care.

423
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,260
As long as it helps you,

424
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,020
I don't mind

425
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,100
what I have to endure

426
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,580
or suffer.

427
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,260
So please,

428
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,900
let's put up with this.

429
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,610
Come on. Hu Cheng.

430
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,020
Let's go.

431
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,300
Just put up with it for now.

432
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Sorry, Mr. Song.

433
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Mr. Hu, please sit.

434
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,000
Mr. Song,

435
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,120
I heard you two were old friends?

436
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,340
Aren't we, Cheng?

437
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,980
We're old friends.

438
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,860
You're…

439
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,220
Let's set aside

440
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,460
Yaofeng

441
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,300
for a moment.

442
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,020
We're old classmates, aren't we?

443
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,860
You see me

444
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,220
and just turn away.

445
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,500
Is that appropriate?

446
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,420
I heard about

447
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,980
Zhou…

448
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,620
How come he…?

449
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,420
He was such a good person.

450
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,340
Do you know?

451
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,340
He came to me so many times

452
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,380
for the sake of us.

453
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,620
Zhou Wei was truly a good man.

454
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,540
Now that

455
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
you are meeting again,

456
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,660
if fate allows you

457
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,340
to work together again,

458
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,380
I'm sure Zhou Wei

459
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,620
will be at peace.

460
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,940
How about this?

461
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,400
I'll use tea to toast you both.

462
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,620
Mr. Song,

463
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,820
Mr. Hu.

464
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,300
Do you have to make things

465
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,540
so awkward?

466
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,580
I didn't ask you here today

467
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,940
to make you uncomfortable.

468
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,020
I just wanted to find an opportunity

469
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,140
to chat.

470
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,700
Fine.

471
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,820
Say what you want to say.

472
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,100
Back then, when I was in Yaofeng,

473
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,340
I only did

474
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,380
some private work

475
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,820
behind your back.

476
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,900
Did you really have to go that far?

477
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,380
When the company was new,

478
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,940
didn't I make significant contributions?

479
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,500
I'm sick,

480
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,060
but I have a family to support.

481
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,460
What are we?

482
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,160
We're practically family

483
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,540
in all but name.

484
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,740
Did you really have
to treat me like a thief?

485
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,460
Song,

486
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,070
you should know very well

487
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,540
how many benefits you took at Yaofeng.

488
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,940
Even when you left,

489
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,900
Yaofeng paid you
a significant severance.

490
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,780
I, Hu Cheng,
have never owed you anything.

491
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,900
Your path

492
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,140
is your own choice.

493
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,980
So that's what you mean.

494
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,340
I chose my path,

495
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,420
and yes,

496
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,540
I deserve it.

497
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,300
I brought this on myself.

498
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,620
That's what you mean, right?

499
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,460
Mr. Hu!

500
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,580
Mr. Hu,

501
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,660
please.

502
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,700
Mr. Song has let it go.

503
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,540
Can't you do the same?

504
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,060
We're all here today

505
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,940
to forget all the unpleasant memories

506
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,100
and move forward.

507
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,260
Cheng,

508
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,740
what I just said

509
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,380
wasn't meant to judge you

510
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,020
from a moral high ground.

511
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,620
We're just chatting, aren't we?

512
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,260
Then what exactly

513
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,500
did you want from me today?

514
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,020
I'm just saying,

515
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,820
at this stage,

516
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,180
let's not cling too tightly

517
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,780
to fame or profit.

518
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,660
Let's let go of the past.

519
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,220
Mr. Song,

520
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,300
about the cooperation with Mr. Jiang…

521
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,100
Ms. Tian,

522
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,180
don't worry about that.

523
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,020
Didn't Jiang agree?

524
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,660
As long as I'm here, no problem.

525
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,980
Rest assured.

526
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,140
Thank you.

527
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,740
Excuse me.

528
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,580
Excuse me.

529
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,700
Nature calls. I'll be back later.

530
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,060
Song, you…

531
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,860
My lingering health issues

532
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,100
have gotten worse.

533
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,260
That's why I'm telling you.

534
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,030
Don't be so hard on others

535
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,140
and yourself either.

536
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,260
Sit here and wait for me,

537
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,390
okay?

538
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,300
Here are all the materials
on Ruan Meiying.

539
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,460
Hu Cheng has been released.

540
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,620
I know.

541
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,540
Tian Qiuzi has been

542
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,780
secretly buying up Yaofeng's shares

543
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,870
and winning over the old shareholders.

544
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,180
Now that Hu Cheng is out,

545
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,220
I suspect

546
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,220
she'll make a big move soon.

547
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,500
What has to be faced

548
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,540
will be faced eventually.

549
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,780
It's better this way.

550
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,100
I'll be able to work for you sooner.

551
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,890
I'm off now. Got another meeting.

552
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,300
(Cheng, desire has no end.)

553
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,740
(Look back
and see the people you left behind.)

554
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,690
(Do you remember where home is?)

555
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:12,890
(When did we become so greedy?)

556
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,000
(Think of our wives and children.)

557
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,500
Zhou…

558
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,860
How come he…?

559
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,460
(You say you have no friends
and are skeptical.)

560
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,580
(I remember
as I was sick in college,)

561
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,340
(you were the only one with me.)
He was such a good person.

562
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,260
(What do you want?)
Do you know?

563
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,660
He came to me so many times

564
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,460
for the sake of us.

565
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,420
Song helped us

566
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,860
build the company.

567
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,540
Think it over.

568
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,700
I'm just worried that

569
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,900
if you let him go,

570
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,260
it might hurt the team's morale.

571
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,940
Let's compromise

572
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,740
and not hold it against him, okay?

573
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,740
I knew you

574
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,860
were magnanimous

575
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,980
and tolerant,

576
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,140
with great composure.

577
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,980
Wei,

578
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,740
if only you were here with me…

579
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,210
(You're too kind to need anything.)

580
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,250
(Cheng, you're really a good person.)

581
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:14,950
(I should have told you)

582
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,630
(and stopped you long ago,
no matter what the outcome.)

583
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,860
(I'm selfish too.
You're not the only one.)

584
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,260
Hu Cheng,

585
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,990
why didn't you answer my calls
or reply to my messages?

586
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,210
Why are you here?

587
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,790
I couldn't find you,

588
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,900
so I came here to wait.

589
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,900
Why did you come here?

590
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,670
I wanted to take a look up there.

591
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,780
In what capacity?

592
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,460
To let people laugh at you?

593
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,580
Tell me clearly.

594
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,420
Why are you here?

595
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,100
Do we really have to argue here?

596
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,100
I just want to help you.

597
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,980
And now there's nothing

598
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,020
between us,

599
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,900
right?

600
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,100
I've already planned everything for you.

601
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,700
Before long, you can return

602
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,940
to your old position.

603
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,380
I just want to be with you.

604
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,660
Not like her,

605
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,940
who stabbed you in the back

606
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,100
when you were at your weakest

607
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,820
and wrung it out of you.

608
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,020
What are you trying to do here?

609
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,420
She's the one who should feel guilty.

610
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,300
She's done so much

611
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,500
wrong to you.

612
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,860
I'm not afraid of her,
and you shouldn't be either.

613
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,660
She's the one who's wrong.

614
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,140
Shut up.

615
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,560
While you were inside,

616
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,100
I didn't just wait around doing nothing.

617
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,380
At next Monday's shareholders' meeting,

618
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,260
I'll make sure

619
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,700
you reclaim your position at Yaofeng.

620
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,740
You want to replace Ning Yue.

621
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,700
She never deserved it.

622
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,900
You don't need to do this.

623
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,860
I don't want to see you
like this anymore.

624
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,820
This isn't the real you,

625
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,660
Hu Cheng.

626
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,220
Come back.

627
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,260
Not for me,

628
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,540
but for yourself.

629
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,820
Everything is already arranged.

630
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,740
Next Monday,

631
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,060
you have to come.

632
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,780
I'll be waiting.

633
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,740
Hey, do you think

634
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,140
Yue has been really busy lately?

635
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,460
She hasn't replied to me.

636
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,820
She must be busy.

637
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,340
She'll reply when she has time.

638
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,060
Let's go.

639
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,260
The movie's about to start.

640
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,140
There's no rush.

641
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,860
Qian,

642
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,940
we have to go now.

643
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,060
See you tomorrow.

644
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,140
- Bye.
- Bye.

645
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,060
Director,

646
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,180
have you been fishing lately?

647
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,380
Not at all.

648
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,580
How wise!

649
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,020
I'm telling you,

650
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,460
fishing is such a waste of time.

651
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,470
If you have time to fish,

652
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,130
wouldn't it be better
to get a girlfriend?

653
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,620
You're at an ideal age.

654
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,900
Qian,

655
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,220
you worry too much.

656
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,100
Fine. I'll stop, okay?

657
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,220
Ning Yue?

658
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,700
Qian.

659
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,780
Hello.

660
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,820
Director,

661
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,100
I have to go.

662
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,300
I'll

663
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,940
pick up my wife.

664
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,340
Ms. Ning, I'll leave you to chat.

665
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,780
- Bye.
- See you.

666
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,140
- Yue.
- Director Qin.

667
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,980
Actually,

668
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,580
"Qin" sounds better.

669
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,580
I get used to calling you that.

670
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,180
It's hard to switch back.
