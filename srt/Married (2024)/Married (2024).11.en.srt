=Episode 11=

3
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,110
I understand, Mr. Hu.

4
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,630
I will go through the procedures now.

5
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,540
If there are no unexpected issues,

6
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,910
before getting off work,

7
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,080
I can transfer all your assets

8
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,800
into the company account.

9
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,630
The sooner the better.

10
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,360
Hello.

11
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,880
Cheng,

12
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,190
don't push yourself too hard.

13
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,070
It must be very hard for you

14
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,300
to raise that much money by yourself.

15
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,070
I advise to hold a shareholders' meeting.

16
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,950
Let's solve the difficulties together.

17
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,140
Mr. Mo is already in the conference room.

18
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Mr. Qin.

19
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,470
- Mr. Qin.
- Mr. Qin.

20
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,630
Mr. Qin.

21
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,910
Hello.

22
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,220
Boss.

23
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,120
Congratulations, boss.

24
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,430
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

25
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,440
- Congratulations.
- You have to treat.

26
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,400
Keep a low profile.

27
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,230
Thanks to Qian's reminder.

28
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,880
Only now did I realize it belatedly.

29
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
I dare not take credit for it.

30
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,400
We should thank Mr. Chen for this.

31
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,120
He came all the way here.

32
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,440
This is a done deal.

33
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,510
By the way,

34
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,510
today, Yue will go through the formalities.

35
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,630
Our department has double happiness.

36
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,000
Work, work, work.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,840
Ok.

38
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,820
Yue,

39
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,530
after you become an official worker,

40
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,470
I will readjust your work.

41
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,320
Lawyer Ning.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,950
Director Qin,

43
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
I'm not in a hurry.

44
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,750
You don't need to rush either.

45
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,720
Take it easy.

46
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,560
Mr. Zhang.

47
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,790
Please come in.

48
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,120
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

49
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,070
You are...

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,630
I am the former PM of Ruixin.

51
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,880
I want to report Qin Can

52
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,000
for illegally accepting money

53
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,600
for personal gain

54
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,950
using his position at work.

55
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,100
(Report Letter)

56
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,960
Where is Director Qin?

57
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,640
In the office over there.

58
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,400
Who is it?

59
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,230
Which department? He's so rude.

60
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,990
Do you know this person, Qian?

61
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,870
This person...

62
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,110
I think I've seen him in the HR Department.

63
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,200
HR Department?

64
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,960
Does that mean Director...

65
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
It means that the promotion

66
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,200
will be announced today, right?

67
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,230
I knew it.

68
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,480
Even though we are not in a hurry,

69
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,910
they should be in a hurry too.

70
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,420
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

71
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,640
Director Qin, I'll head back first.

72
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,080
Mr. Zhang is still waiting for you.

73
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,920
Ok.

74
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,310
Ok, you can rest assured.

75
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,170
You can rest assured.

76
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,600
I'll let you know as soon as he returns.

77
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,710
Where is the boss?

78
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,110
Not back yet?

79
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,640
Why don't you send him a WeChat message?

80
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,790
I've sent it already.

81
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,400
If he could, he would have returned by now.

82
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,670
This is all the evidence.

83
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,720
You can decide for yourselves.

84
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,560
Ok.

85
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,150
Excuse me.

86
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,280
I want to ask

87
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,960
if Director Qin has finished talking.

88
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,990
I have some work-related matters

89
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,990
to ask him.

90
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,640
He is still undergoing a verbal survey.

91
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,230
It won't be finished in a short while.

92
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,080
Verbal survey?

93
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,160
What is the survey about?

94
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,160
It's just like last time...

95
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,160
Nothing, just a simple conversation.

96
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,880
Where is Yue?

97
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,670
Yue just mentioned to find Director Qin.

98
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,200
Maybe she is going through the procedures.

99
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,200
That's a good thing.

100
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,600
We need to organize some activities

101
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,550
to celebrate.

102
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,740
Definitely.

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,160
Welcome to join the Zhongzhi Group.

108
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,100
(Ning Yue)

109
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,150
Mom,

110
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,400
I have good news to share with you.

111
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,110
I achieved great success at the company.

112
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,430
My uncle praised me by name.

113
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,870
He said he would treat me to dinner tonight

114
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,790
and introduce important resources to me.

115
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,920
Yes.

116
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,230
It's right to work with my uncle.

117
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,230
The company is about to go public soon.

118
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,010
As long as I ride a wave of it,

119
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,840
within two years,

120
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,530
I will definitely become a department manager.

121
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,740
Here, let's all toast to Mr. Mo.

122
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,790
Drink it up.

123
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,580
The hardest thing I've ever faced

124
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,120
is about spending money in the right thing.

125
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,430
But I think Xianbin Capital is lucky.

126
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,670
Because it encountered Yaofeng Tech.

127
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,670
Be rest assured, Hu.

128
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,040
I'll complete the due diligence quickly.

129
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,160
At the fasted speed, Xianbin Capital

130
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,780
will help Yaofeng Tech...

131
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,660
Sorry.

132
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,580
- I'm late.
- Zibo.

133
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,220
Who brought you here?

134
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,140
Me, me, me.

135
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,040
I asked him here. Zibo, come here.

136
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,340
Come here. Please take a chair.

137
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,140
Sorry, Mr. Mo.

138
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,300
- It's fine.
- He came to study.

139
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,340
- Come sit down.
- Thank you.

140
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,700
Here. Let's raise a glass

141
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,660
to Mr. Mo.

142
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,420
Here.

143
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,460
Excuse me. Please bring another glass.

144
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,580
Mr. Mo, please continue.

145
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,860
What was I just saying?

146
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,820
Actually, I mean

147
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,460
I hope that our cooperation

148
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,140
can achieve a win-win situation

149
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,220
that both parties can make money.

150
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,380
It's the most practical.

151
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,380
So next,

152
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,510
I hope Xianbin Capital

153
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,500
to be able to quickly

154
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,460
help Yaofeng Technology

155
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,500
go public.

156
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,940
Good.

157
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,900
Come on.

158
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,140
Generally,

159
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,540
people think that this kind of work

160
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,500
is very simple.

161
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,580
First, apply a patch

162
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,940
to just deal with it. That's it.

163
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,220
But Zibo

164
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,700
really put in the effort.

165
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,900
From checking to calibrating data,

166
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,220
this is a team's task.

167
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,900
He finished it all by himself.

168
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,380
This is not easy.

169
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,580
Mr. Zhou, you flatter me.

170
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,620
This is what I should do.

171
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,540
You are promising.

172
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,500
- Thank you.
- Keep it up.

173
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,340
I will.

174
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,660
- Work harder.
- Seeking rewards, huh?

175
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,740
Seeking rewards is right.

176
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,220
The solution he proposed

177
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,640
really improves work efficiency a lot.

178
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,380
Isn't it his duty to do these things?

179
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,980
Wei,

180
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,540
he just did something insignificant,

181
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,900
but you are keeping glorifying him.

182
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,140
I arranged for him to work under you,

183
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,580
so that you could discipline him well,

184
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,700
not to let you flatter him all day long.

185
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,980
What you are doing will only harm him.

186
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,340
- Do you know?
- Ok.

187
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,500
I won't say anymore.

188
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,500
Hu Zibo, listen up.

189
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,780
You don't deserve to sit here today.

190
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,900
Do you know?

191
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,220
You even bought yourself new clothes.

192
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,660
How much did this cost?

193
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,500
Your mother is in the hospital now,

194
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,340
waiting to have surgery.

195
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,020
Do you still have money to buy clothes?

196
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,580
What are you doing?

197
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,060
Have a sip of water.

198
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,940
I tell you,

199
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,700
don't let the tears fall

200
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,540
in front of me.

201
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,900
What?

202
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,820
You can't stand hearing this, huh?

203
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,260
If you can't stand it, then get out.

204
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,500
I can't stand to see a man like this.

205
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,580
I tell you,

206
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,500
when I brought you into the company,

207
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,300
what did I say to you on your first day?

208
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,460
You can't take everything for granted

209
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,260
just because of our relationship.

210
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,300
Both my senior and I

211
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,100
have come through hardships.

212
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,500
We come from the poorest and smallest places

213
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,580
to reach where we are today.

214
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,780
We have endured so much suffering

215
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,140
to stand here.

216
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,700
Who can we rely on?

217
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,660
Who do we have to rely on?

218
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,700
Zibo. Zibo.

219
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,060
Don't think too much.

220
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,340
Your uncle drank too much.

221
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,380
Alright, alright.

222
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,100
Drink some water again.

223
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,540
You will be ruined

224
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,740
by your mouth sooner or later.

225
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,060
It's nothing serious.

226
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,460
I got scolded way worse than this.

227
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,980
I made it through.

228
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,660
In the future, he will thank me.

229
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,730
Wei, do you remember?

230
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,030
The first time I went for an interview,

231
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,860
the suit was even borrowed from you.

232
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,020
It's truly not easy for me

233
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,660
to be here.

234
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,580
You have always worked hard.

235
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,820
These are all things you deserve.

236
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,420
Have you ever experienced the feeling

237
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,940
of being betrayed by the closest person?

238
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,700
I actually wanted to tell you last week.

239
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,020
I ran into Manager Tian

240
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,980
at Ruixin.

241
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,180
She was handling resignation procedures.

242
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,460
It seems she has found a boyfriend.

243
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,500
Cheng,

244
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,220
move on from Manager Tian's matter.

245
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,100
Isn't it good now?

246
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,300
Wei,

247
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,100
what I said

248
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,580
is not Manager Tian.

249
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,780
Then who is that referring to?

250
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,700
The wife of the Hu family

251
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,300
must be virtuous first.

252
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,940
Quick. Give it to Mom.

253
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,140
Mom.

254
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,020
Congratulations on becoming a regular worker.

255
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,620
Thank you, my good son.

256
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,500
Mom loves you.

257
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,500
I love you too, Mom.

258
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,460
Mom,

259
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,940
what does it mean?

260
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,540
You don't even know that.

261
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,100
What do you congratulate me for?

262
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,020
It means I have passed the assessment.

263
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,980
It shows that Mom is very excellent.

264
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,380
Mom is so great.

265
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,860
Of course.

266
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,500
My Mom is the best.

267
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,100
My son is also the best.

268
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,580
Over the years, Yue

269
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,820
has been contributing to this family.

270
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,900
Come, let's toast to Yue together.

271
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,890
Thank you, honey.

272
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,070
You too.

273
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,060
Thank you.

274
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,180
Mom.

275
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,050
Congratulations.

276
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,900
Thank you.

277
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,140
Here.

278
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,100
This one.

279
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,940
Wash it.

280
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,300
Just now when we had a meal,

281
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,500
look at Yue's smug expression,

282
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,460
I thought she would

283
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,140
have ascended to a higher level.

284
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,260
But when I asked around,

285
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,580
Cheng told me

286
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,260
that her salary

287
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,700
is just a fraction

288
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,620
of Cheng's.

289
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,500
She used to be a lawyer.

290
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,500
She's quite capable.

291
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,500
Don't look down on her.

292
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,140
I don't look down on her.

293
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,660
I'm worried about our son.

294
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,260
How pitiful Cheng is.

295
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,340
He works very hard outside.

296
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,540
He has to take care of them at home.

297
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,660
When we had a meal,

298
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,860
I observed it carefully.

299
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,580
Yue's mother

300
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,300
actually has no illness.

301
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,780
She insists on sitting in a wheelchair.

302
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,780
She just wants to rely on others.

303
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,700
What are you doing?

304
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,900
You freak me out.

305
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,580
Didn't he say

306
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,500
we should get along well with them?

307
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,540
I know.

308
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,220
We can get along well.

309
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,580
I remember.

310
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,540
This is a dishwasher.

311
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,900
So tall...

312
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,140
Can you do it?

313
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,500
If you can't, let me do it.

314
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,780
Well...

315
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,860
Why don't you use this dishwasher?

316
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
You always wash by hand.

317
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,300
If others know, they will laugh at you.

318
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,860
If you don't know how, then learn it!

319
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,300
It's nothing difficult.

320
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,060
Cheng...

321
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,540
He is good in every aspect.

322
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,460
It's just that he can't control women.

323
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,180
His ex

324
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,300
is in the past.

325
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,460
This one is spoiled.

326
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,900
Once healed, one forgets the pain.

327
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,860
Well,

328
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,380
I'm going to watch TV.

329
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,900
Make me a cup of tea.

330
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,060
You go ahead.

331
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,900
(Report Letter)

332
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,660
(Report Letter)
You also saw it.

333
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,900
More than one report material

334
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,940
were delivered to us.

335
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,060
They are under a real name.

336
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,260
It's all about your department.

337
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,420
We just handed over the work to you.

338
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,150
The whole company is watching you.

339
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,460
As a result, within your department,

340
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,980
there are problems on your side.

341
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,620
These are all false accusations.

342
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,540
They never happened at all.

343
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,900
You can find out the truth.

344
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,300
I asked you

345
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,820
if there is a lawyer named Qian.

346
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,540
Yes.

347
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,900
Someone reported

348
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,940
that he, posing as the legal director,

349
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,420
made clients treat him.

350
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,620
And the Marketing Department

351
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,620
is also very dissatisfied with his work.

352
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,020
It's all because you tolerated them.

353
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,260
All contracts related with Qian

354
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,700
have been approved by me.

355
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,840
As for other matters you mentioned,

356
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,060
we can investigate thoroughly.

357
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,820
If it's true, I will take full responsibility.

358
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,380
The company has decided

359
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,340
to organize personnel

360
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,860
to thoroughly investigate the reports.

361
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,620
Get ready to cooperate with them.

362
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,620
I don't know why you are so confident,

363
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,300
spreading you are the legal director.

364
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,500
The whole company is

365
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,540
talking about this back and forth.

366
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,940
What did I spread?

367
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,220
When did I spread the news?

368
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,100
Who said that?

369
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,780
I dare to confront him face to face.

370
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,580
It's fine for others to gossip.

371
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,620
Your own people weren't being low-key.

372
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,820
They even celebrated in advance,

373
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,820
including you.

374
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,300
Usually, you are quite down-to-earth.

375
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,060
But you show off at this moment.

376
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,660
Isn't that putting yourself in the fire?

377
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,220
I take my stuff.

378
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,020
Sorry.

379
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,260
Sit down.

380
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,410
You encountered something?

381
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,100
No.

382
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,900
In the past,

383
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,290
when I was in a bad mood,

384
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,620
I also came to this sea.

385
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,540
I also sat here.

386
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,940
I remember that an old man came once.

387
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,620
He talked to me,

388
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,340
"Young man,

389
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,820
look at this sea.

390
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,900
Is it big?"

391
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,740
I said, "It's big."

392
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,850
He took me there.

393
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,780
He said, "Lie down."

394
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,860
Come over here.

395
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:35,990
Come here.

396
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,540
He said, "You lie here

397
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,780
and take another look.

398
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:43,720
How do you feel?"

399
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,510
A little lower.

400
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,220
I said, "Seeing from here,

401
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,660
I feel...

402
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,820
I feel so small."

403
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,860
So,

404
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,380
not that many people care about you.

405
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
Just do it.

406
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,260
Thank you.

407
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,400
Someone who has been there.

408
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,700
You're welcome.

409
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,460
You didn't ask me to come over.

410
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,540
- Qian, morning.
- Morning.

411
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,210
Director Qin.

412
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,260
So early.

413
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,260
Morning, Yue.

414
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,470
This is the document

415
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,060
issued by the company yesterday.

416
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,420
- Take a look.
- Ok.

417
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,460
Take it easy.

418
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,520
I came so early today

419
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,780
because I was afraid you worry about me.

420
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,940
So I came to report to you.

421
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,780
Sit down.

422
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,900
The director position has become vacant.

423
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,740
I estimate there will be people

424
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,060
who come to ask you about my work.

425
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,740
We just speak the truth.

426
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,300
You actually

427
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,460
didn't do wrong.

428
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,100
I think

429
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,900
that some people are envious of you.

430
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,250
They can't stand to see you get promoted.

431
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,700
Yue,

432
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,860
you actually knew it long ago, right?

433
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,100
You told me not to rush at that time.

434
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,020
Actually, you let me not to be arrogant.

435
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,940
Director Qin,

436
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,660
I'm not in a hurry.

437
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,500
You don't need to rush either.

438
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,740
Take your time.

439
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,190
This makes me more angry

440
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,940
than being reported.

441
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,580
I'm usually

442
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,860
a laid-back person.

443
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,460
I'm indifferent to fame and fortune.

444
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,900
But when it happens,

445
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,500
it's still hard to remain unsullied.

446
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,820
Director Qin,

447
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,540
don't be too harsh on yourself.

448
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,740
In the face of fame and fortune,

449
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,060
everyone is weak and insignificant.

450
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,940
Who doesn't desire success?

451
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,780
To want to achieve success

452
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,940
and have accomplishments

453
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,020
is human nature.

454
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,540
It's human nature.

455
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,860
Don't force yourself to fight against it.

456
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,340
But on the road to pursuing success,

457
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,060
just don't lose your original intention.

458
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,780
Of course I believe you.

459
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,020
You definitely won't.

460
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
Thank you for your comfort,

461
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,860
Yue.

462
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,660
I

463
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,300
just do a good job as a director.

464
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,260
A loss may turn out to be a gain in the end.

465
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,780
The long road ahead, keep it up!

466
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,340
Ok.

467
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,740
Director Qin,

468
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,500
the Vice President would like to see you.

469
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,900
(Vice President's Office)

470
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,340
Come in.

471
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,580
- Director Qin.
- Yes.

472
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,820
Please sit.

473
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,140
I just started my job today.

474
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,820
Luo Yating.

475
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,940
Nice to meet you.

476
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,100
Starting today,

477
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,740
report all the work of your department

478
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,900
to me directly.

479
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,620
I also hope we can cooperate happily

480
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,820
in the coming days.

481
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,300
I heard that you're under investigation.

482
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,260
I wonder if you have received the notice.

483
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,060
During this period, the internal investigation

484
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,340
needs to be completely halted.

485
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,380
Director Qin,

486
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,620
did you hear what I said?

487
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,860
I heard you.

488
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,780
That's good.

489
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,060
There's one more thing.

490
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,860
Is there a lawyer surnamed Qian

491
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,220
in your department?

492
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,700
Yes, there is.

493
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,700
Let him come to my office right away.

494
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,780
Ok.

495
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,820
Thanks to Mr. Hu's

496
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,660
quick decision

497
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,460
to invest his personal funds.

498
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,620
We are able to continue

499
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,620
advancing several projects.

500
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,740
Not affected at all.

501
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,580
If this company can go public smoothly,

502
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,260
everyone will have to thank you.

503
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,840
You go ahead with your work.

504
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,340
Alright then, I'll get back to work.

505
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,700
You use your own money

506
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,020
to fill the company's hole.

507
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,620
Does Yue know about this?

508
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,980
Just stop glaring at me.

509
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,500
Shouldn't you discuss this with Yue?

510
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,900
Don't let her worry.

511
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,780
If I discuss work matters with her,

512
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,500
that will make her worry unnecessarily.

513
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,900
What I am about to say

514
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,260
is directed at the Legal Department.

515
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,380
I won't inquire further

516
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,780
about all the contracts before I joined.

517
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,900
But starting from this moment today,

518
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,120
all company agreements must comply

519
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,300
with the new contract template.

520
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,900
What?

521
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,580
Feel difficult?

522
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,700
Afraid of offending someone?

523
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,740
The company pays you

524
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,340
to come here

525
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,100
to use your professional knowledge

526
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,780
to safeguard its interests.

527
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,620
If you're afraid, then don't earn this money.

528
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,380
The Legal Department

529
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,740
is destined to offend others.

530
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,820
Other departments

531
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,580
are polite to you.

532
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,220
But you don't know

533
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,940
what they say behind your back.

534
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,380
That's not the case.

535
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,180
What?

536
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,660
Louder.

537
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,260
If you don't say,

538
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,220
just listen to me.

539
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,620
The Legal Department

540
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,820
acts as a gatekeeper for the company.

541
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,060
Anyone,

542
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,180
any department,

543
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,980
even if they are unhappy,

544
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,940
no matter how anxious,

545
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,580
not a single rule can be omitted.

546
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,460
This is what you should do.

547
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,540
Who pays your salary

548
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,660
is the company.

549
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,340
I hope you can remember that.

550
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,340
Let's call it a day.

551
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,700
I hope after you get back,

552
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,860
you can think it over.

553
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,740
Director Qin, please stay.

554
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,020
The investigation against Lawyer Qian

555
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,380
has yielded results.

556
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,660
But

557
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,860
regarding your personal complaint,

558
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,860
there are still some things

559
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,980
to investigate.

560
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,500
If you have new evidence...

561
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,100
Ms. Luo, the evidences I can submit

562
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,260
have all been submitted to Mr. Li.

563
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,100
I have also cc'd you a copy.

564
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,600
Director Qin,

565
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,100
you are studying law.

566
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,580
You should have respect for the rules.

567
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,740
I hope

568
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,380
you don't raise any misunderstandings.

569
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,620
Ms. Luo,

570
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,580
if you want to understand a project,

571
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,100
you should start from the grassroots level.

572
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,500
Your familiarity

573
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,460
and understanding of the situation

574
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,140
is even less than that of a legal staff.

575
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,340
Our time is very valuable.

576
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,620
My team and I

577
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,020
will finish the investigation soon.

578
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,340
I still hope you won't waste your time

579
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,740
on this matter.

580
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,180
Ms. Luo,

581
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,660
today's outfit

582
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,740
makes you look like a queen.

583
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,900
Who are we trying to eliminate?

584
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,100
Am I that familiar with you?

585
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,900
We will become familiar.

586
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,260
Which department are you from?

587
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,700
I am Chen Pingzhang,

588
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,990
the GM of the Procurement Department.

589
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,460
Chen Pingzhang.

590
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,820
Chen Pingzhang.

591
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,500
- Mr. Chen.
- Right.

592
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,660
Boss.

593
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,380
Boss.

594
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,380
Boss.

595
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,780
You finally came back.

596
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,580
The Sales Department went crazy

597
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,860
and found trouble with us.

598
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,020
They made a call

599
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,180
and scolded Yue.

600
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,220
Where is Ning Yue?

601
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,100
She went up to reason with them.

602
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,620
Mr. Feng, what you said is sensible.

603
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,820
We will timely

604
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,780
report these four projects

605
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,580
to Director Qin.

606
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,660
Then I can just go directly to him.

607
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,500
What are you rambling about here?

608
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,510
Mr. Feng.

609
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,300
Director Qin.

610
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,860
I remember the merger and acquisition

611
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,100
of Tianhua Group is Mr. He's responsibility.

612
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,500
You must know this, right?

613
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,380
The Finance Center made it clear last month

614
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,780
about Lixia Group's payment arrears.

615
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,860
They will offset it with overseas receivables.

616
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,300
If you have any questions,

617
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,590
you should contact the Finance Center,

618
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,740
not us.

619
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,980
How can we contact Lixia Group?

620
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,380
Regarding the Sida Wuyin project,

621
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,060
we signed the cooperation framework

622
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,800
two months ago.

623
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,980
If the Sales Center does not promote it,

624
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,340
how can we push it forward?

625
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,700
By the way,

626
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,740
the last project

627
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,300
is indeed our responsibility.

628
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,340
But Mr. He, Hu Kuan,

629
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,220
who was in charge of coordinating with us,

630
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,780
seems to have already left the company.

631
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,020
Didn't he

632
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,060
take the project with him?

633
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,020
Mr. Feng,

634
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,060
you have just taken office.

635
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,780
You haven't even settled in yet.

636
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,020
Such a big project is lost.

637
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,500
How do you report this to superiors?

638
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,020
You have to find a way to delay it.

639
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,020
So you found our department

640
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,460
to be the scapegoat.

641
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,180
But we will not

642
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,700
take this blame.

643
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,660
Director Qin,

644
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,780
what you said

645
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,380
is too much.

646
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,660
Recently, I

647
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,660
have been a little anxious.

648
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,260
Mr. Hu,

649
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,000
I want to tell you

650
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,380
special good news.

651
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,340
Qin Can

652
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,940
has become

653
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,700
an object of hatred.

654
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,100
Everyone is bullying him.

655
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,020
It's truly satisfying for everyone.

656
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,780
I don't know

657
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,020
who reported him.

658
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,990
Haven't you always said

659
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,340
that the heads of various departments

660
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,580
in Zhongzhi hate him a lot?

661
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,380
People who want to mess with him

662
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,900
should be quite a few, right?

663
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,100
Yeah.

664
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,380
Mr. Chen,

665
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,220
the last thing I asked you to do...

666
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,860
Have a drink

667
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,100
to celebrate in advance.

668
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,540
Everything is arranged. Don't worry.

669
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,940
Thank you.

670
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,660
Sis, did these help you?

671
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,700
You've been a great help.

672
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,700
I didn't expect

673
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,580
you would be interested in legal matters.

674
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,860
I learn it

675
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,340
to broaden my perspective.

676
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,860
These are all internal documents.

677
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,180
You didn't show it to others, did you?

678
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,180
And you didn't make a copy, right?

679
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,860
Now you're reminding me of these things,

680
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,660
isn't it a bit late?

681
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,700
No, I just glanced at it myself.

682
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,900
You scared me, sis.

683
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,980
The pasta here is quite good.

684
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,820
Try it.

685
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,500
It looks really delicious.

686
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,380
Eat more.

687
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,700
Not bad.

688
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,820
Thank you, sis.

689
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,460
Son, you are home.

690
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,500
Where is Ning Yue?

691
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,340
She and her Mom are in that small room,

692
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,020
chattering for a long time.

693
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,340
I heard

694
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,380
they seem

695
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,820
to scheme against someone.

696
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,340
Why are you looking at me?

697
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,580
I got it.

698
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,740
Ready.

699
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,740
Go from here.

700
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,620
Let's see who is back.

701
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,820
Dad, you are back!

702
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,660
I'm back.

703
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,500
Mom, it's time to eat.

704
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,780
I forgot about time.

705
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,340
Let's hurry up.

706
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,380
Grandma has already prepared it.

707
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,500
Don't keep Grandpa waiting.

708
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,500
Ziyuan, go wash your hands.

709
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,340
- Go wash hands.
- Ok.

710
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,380
Go.

711
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,140
Ok.

712
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,100
You all come quickly.

713
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,180
You go quickly.

714
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,260
Let's go together.

715
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,860
I

716
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,300
had too much at noon.

717
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,460
Not hungry at all.

718
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,380
Mom,

719
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,860
these years

720
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,700
I have always treated you like my own mother.

721
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,860
Yes.

722
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,700
How could we

723
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,860
leave an old person in the room

724
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,980
when we eat?

725
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,980
It's nothing.

726
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,500
I'm not hungry.

727
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,340
Really, you guys go eat quickly.

728
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,860
You've worked all day.

729
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,780
Let's go. Have a little.

730
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,620
If I go there

731
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,660
and just sit there,

732
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,100
it may affect everyone's appetite.

733
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,180
Nothing. It won't.

734
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,700
Then the sky was repaired later.

735
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,660
The flood receded.

736
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,900
Everything returned to normal.

737
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,580
What were the animals doing at that time?

738
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,980
The little animals came back.

739
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,380
Yes, they happily came back.

740
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,420
Is it?

741
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,940
Hurry up and eat.

742
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,820
Ziyuan.

743
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,460
Was the story good?

744
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,740
Yes.

745
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,500
Then next time you listen to a story,

746
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,020
invite me to join you.

747
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,620
I want to listen too.

748
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,220
Ok, Dad.

749
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,340
Next time I'll take you to listen.

750
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,660
Just eat.

751
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,340
Mom,

752
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,740
you can't just favor Yue and Ziyuan.

753
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,060
You're even jealous of your son now.

754
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,940
Mom has spoken well of you very often.

755
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,940
Every time I nag you,

756
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,540
my Mom always sides with you.

757
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,140
Here.

758
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,460
Have a chicken wing.

759
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,140
I'm going to take a call.

760
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,660
Hold on.

761
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,180
- Mom.
- I have no appetite at all.

762
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,780
Is what Yue said true?

763
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,700
You speak well of me a lot?

764
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,980
Thank you.

765
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,220
Why thank me? We're family.

766
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,580
But Mom,

767
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,780
if you want to praise me in the future,

768
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,340
it's best to do it in front of me.

769
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,540
That way I have more motivation.

770
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,780
Not only in front of me,

771
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,540
but also in front of Yue.

772
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,820
What do you think?

773
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,500
Ok.

774
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,020
What's wrong? Is there something urgent?

775
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,340
It's nothing. After I finish eating,

776
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,140
I will organize some data for him.

777
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,020
Take your time.

778
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,980
- Here. Take your time.
- Move this.

779
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,060
Move this.

780
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,820
You can't reach this, right?

781
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,140
It's ok.

782
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,460
I'm going to buy you that blind box.

783
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,820
- Are you happy?
- Happy.

784
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,380
Let's make a deal.

785
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,340
We buy only one today.

786
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,060
You can't buy everything what you want.

787
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,740
- Sure.
- All right.

788
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,340
Mom, what is that over there?

789
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,140
Run slower.

790
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,460
Look, it's lively now.

791
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,340
Let's give it a name.

792
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,700
Look how kind your son is.

793
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,140
He saved this bird.

794
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,060
Mom said

795
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,180
when you were young,

796
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,940
you also saved a little bird like this.

797
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,540
Yes.

798
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,780
Cheng took care

799
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,700
of the bird carefully.

800
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,780
- He fed the bird.
- Do you want to drink?

801
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,980
It was like taking care of his child.

802
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,260
He was responsible.

803
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,660
Mom, this bird seems to be injured.

804
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,980
What happened to this little bird?

805
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,180
Did you forget you brought back tadpoles?

806
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,780
Aren't you afraid your Dad will hit you again?

807
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,740
I'm not afraid. I want to protect it.

808
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,140
Ok, then I will cover for you.

809
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,740
Did you hear that, Ziyuan?

810
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,540
You need to be responsible like Dad.

811
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,260
You must take good care of it, ok?

812
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,580
Ok, Mom.

813
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,500
I will take good care of the bird.

814
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,260
Why can't I remember

815
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,500
this matter?

816
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,140
Cheng,

817
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,820
- when you were little,
- It wants to eat.

818
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,580
did you really catch a bird?

819
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,940
How long have you raised it?

820
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,700
I was too young.

821
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,100
I can't remember clearly.

822
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,940
Yes, I can't remember either.

823
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,860
I can't remember clearly.

824
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,220
It's been too long.

825
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,820
Later, he didn't raise it.

826
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,020
I guess he set it free after it was recovered.

827
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,980
Set it free?

828
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,300
Didn't you stew it and eat it?

829
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,300
It's definitely hungry.

830
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,260
I mean

831
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,620
you should set it free.

832
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,820
Cheng has been compassionate since childhood.

833
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,860
Me too.

834
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,700
That's true.

835
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,180
Yue,

836
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,220
it's your turn.

837
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,740
Routine investigation of the HR Dept.

838
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,860
I spoke a lot of good words about the boss.

839
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,580
I can't stand it myself.

840
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,500
Go ahead.

841
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,420
Pan Jie,

842
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,500
if you say that,

843
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,780
it actually seems more deliberate.

844
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,220
Zhong Tianming,

845
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,660
you don't say good things about the boss.

846
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,700
I'm reporting you.

847
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,700
Just go.

848
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,980
Ask the boss

849
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,140
if I'm right.

850
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,700
Director Qin is a person of integrity.

851
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,700
He works carefully

852
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,180
and is very responsible.

853
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,380
During the three months I worked with him,

854
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,660
as his assistant,

855
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,860
I have never heard of

856
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,060
and seen something

857
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,460
like what is mentioned in the accusations.

858
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,500
Do you have anything else to say?

859
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,220
He is a great leader.

860
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,220
Impressive, impressive, impressive.

861
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,580
I practiced hard but still failed.

862
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,340
After all, you're at a professional level.

863
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,660
I concede defeat.

864
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,140
Today I'm lucky.

865
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,980
Xianbin Capital brought me good luck.

866
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,700
The world is indeed unfair.

867
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,180
Handsome,

868
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,300
high IQ,

869
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,460
be able to make money,

870
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,660
play golf quite well.

871
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,500
You must be liked by many women, huh?

872
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,300
My family is very stable.

873
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,220
Let me take another shot.

874
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,700
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

875
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,340
I also invited an old friend.

876
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,540
My playing partner.

877
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:48,900
There you go.

878
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,020
Sorry, Mr. Mo.

879
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,020
I'm late.

880
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:52,980
It's fine.

881
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,780
Let me introduce you.

882
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,500
Mr. Hu, Hu Cheng from Yaofeng Tech.

883
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,660
This is my friend Tian Qiuzi.
