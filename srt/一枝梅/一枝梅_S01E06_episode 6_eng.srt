1
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:34,576
Can you help me look for someone?

2
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,177
Of course.

3
00:00:35,177 --> 00:00:38,035
An acquaintance of mine is looking for a runaway servant.

4
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:39,059
I heard you're looking for someone

5
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,282
It must be hidden in the Forbidden Palace

6
00:00:40,282 --> 00:00:40,582
Forbidden Palace?

7
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,618
I'll get it myself.

8
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:44,386
There's nothing to be afraid of.

9
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:45,487
Aigoo Aigoo!

10
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:46,504
It's dangerous!

11
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,616
Get out quickly!

12
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:55,635
What to do now?

13
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:57,896
No. N..no.

14
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:02,547
Before I die...I have something to tell you.

15
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:03,827
That's why I wrote these words..

16
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:04,706
Someone was looking for you.

17
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:05,427
Who was it?

18
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:07,368
He said he'd wait for you on the Nam Mun bridge

19
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:28,659
Your Excellency, he is here to see you.

20
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,792
What are you guys doing?

21
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:44,125
I'm sorry

22
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,363
Aigoo.

23
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:53,128
I'm sorry

24
00:01:53,128 --> 00:01:54,958
Are you blind?

25
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,256
Are you going to pick up the Miss, young Master?

26
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:07,500
You're a bit late today, young Master.

27
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,083
Go quickly! Or else you'll miss her.

28
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,833
What happened?

29
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,875
There...there was a man

30
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,500
who was bleeding a lot.

31
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,875
Blood?

32
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:48,000
Who are you?

33
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:26,125
Young Master! Young Master! Young Master!

34
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,000
What should we do now?

35
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,417
Brother!

36
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:32,750
Brother!

37
00:05:36,104 --> 00:05:37,555
One guy is dead already, the other one is badly injured.

38
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:40,417
He may be already dead.

39
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:43,315
Who suddenly appeared?

40
00:05:43,315 --> 00:05:47,304
Young Master of Lord Byun Shik.

41
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:49,672
What?

42
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:51,833
The second young master

43
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:02,600
Did he see your face?

44
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,292
No, he didn't, sir

45
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:08,583
Alright.

46
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,333
How did you find me?

47
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,821
Seung Seung accidentally bumped into a man.

48
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:24,339
She said that person was bleeding a lot

49
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:27,958
I heard that you went out to pick me up.

50
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,587
So I was worried...

51
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:31,827
You still went there even though you knew it was dangerous?

52
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,917
Are you crazy?

53
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:37,672
However...

54
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:40,167
This is the arm you injured last time...

55
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,067
What to do...

56
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,627
With this kind of injury

57
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:47,315
The exam...

58
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:50,195
I'll take it. No matter what.

59
00:06:50,195 --> 00:06:52,605
Don't tell anyone else about this.

60
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:54,803
Yes...

61
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:05,235
You're always here

62
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:06,835
Do you live here?

63
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:16,750
That girl...

64
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,375
I heard you got stabbed intefering in someone else's fight?

65
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,958
Don't go waltzing about everywhere.

66
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,458
You need to take care of your body, at least.

67
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,875
After all, what else do you have?

68
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,333
This jerk, really...

69
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:54,963
You old fool! 
 I'm sorry!

70
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:56,125
What's going on?

71
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:03,792
That man ran away with another woman in the middle of the night

72
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:07,167
and Slick tracked him all the way to Han Byung Do and brought him back.

73
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,958
Really?

74
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:12,008
You should ask Slick to find that father and daughter cons...

75
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,375
So, how did he get scammed?

76
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,500
Do you remember that cart they had?

77
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,375
Sticky Rice Story?

78
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,208
He invested in that and lost all his money!

79
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,624
ALL the money?

80
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:28,500
Yeah!

81
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:32,893
Just one moment!

82
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:33,792
Ah, what? What?

83
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:38,958
The thing I asked you for last time... How is that going?

84
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,208
What?

85
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:44,968
Oh, that person you wanted me to find?

86
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,083
I heard you got scammed.

87
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:49,960
Huh?

88
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,843
Ah, what are you talking about?

89
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:56,019
That pocket change?

90
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:58,044
It was embarrassing to see father and daughter

91
00:08:58,044 --> 00:08:59,707
Doing anything they could to make money

92
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:00,947
So I just thought of it as charity

93
00:09:00,947 --> 00:09:03,000
And just gave them some spare money I had left.

94
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,082
What, you think the great Yong wouldn't have money? Hahaha...

95
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:09,267
Ahh, is that so?

96
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:11,833
Then bring me some of that money.

97
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,728
I only start AFTER I see the money.

98
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:17,042
Okay, I understand.

99
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:20,250
I'll bring some money in,

100
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,280
So please find that person for me.

101
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,539
I'll trust in you.

102
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,458
He's looking for someone?

103
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,292
Ah, just

104
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:38,083
Just try to remember a bit more.

105
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,923
I'm trying to remember

106
00:09:39,923 --> 00:09:40,797
I'm trying...

107
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:41,779
So, Lee Won Ho?

108
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:46,088
Lee Won Ho, Lee Won Ho, Lee Won Ho...

109
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:49,523
Yes, I remember, yes yes.

110
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:52,509
Wow, it's been over 10 years now.

111
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,600
Back then,

112
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,269
Did all of the family die also?

113
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,256
Hmm...

114
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:02,280
The family...

115
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:09,576
Yes, his wife and daughter should still be alive.

116
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:11,709
Really?

117
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,249
Aigoo...

118
00:10:20,502 --> 00:10:22,459
Hey,

119
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:23,825
This is all fake.

120
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:25,613
Real? Yeah right.

121
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:26,521
Really?

122
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:28,165
Is it really fake?

123
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:31,249
And it was so expensive too...

124
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:33,021
I'll go and catch them,

125
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:34,419
So tell me.

126
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:36,168
How do you order this?

127
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,491
It's not all that complicated.

128
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:42,555
You just put in an order at that inn in Inchun, and it comes really quickly.

129
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:48,117
Is that him?

130
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:49,342
Yes.

131
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:52,466
You've heard how salt traders are better off than anyone else?

132
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:55,783
He's monopolized all of the salt coming in from the Inchun harbour.

133
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:56,507
Really?

134
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:57,949
There's more than that.

135
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,630
He's also well-known for being humble and kind to everyone.

136
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,486
Look, look at that.

137
00:11:04,486 --> 00:11:06,227
-Here, let me carry this. 
 -Young sir, it's okay, I can carry it.

138
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:11,412
Then, I will start the wedding arranagement as soon as possible.

139
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:14,293
By the way, what will do about the dowry?

140
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:19,358
Bong Soon doesn't have a mother, so I will take care of everything.

141
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:20,812
Dowry?

142
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:27,029
Bong Soon

143
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:27,760
Dad

144
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,404
My dear daugther

145
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:33,709
Dad, we're getting the contract tomorrow.

146
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:37,335
From now on, our life will no longer be unfortunate

147
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:43,779
This lass!

148
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:48,725
What's with this look on your face when you're going to be married to the rich family in In Choen?

149
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:51,611
What? Becoming a wife in a rich family?

150
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,220
HEY!

151
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,531
Where did they go?

152
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:06,293
Aishh!

153
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,645
Where is the son of this house?

154
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,733
I already said, our family only has three daughters. We don't have a son.

155
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,240
Have no son?I saw it with my eyes.

156
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,907
You were fooled by that lady and her kid. It's just...

157
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,782
You are the 7th person this month

158
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:30,648
My money

159
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:33,220
DAD!!

160
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,835
I'm here, Bong Soon

161
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:39,666
Aren't you gone yet?

162
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:44,239
I'm going nuts. All the money that I've spent my entire life to save has...

163
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:47,014
Aigoo... my money!

164
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:54,851
So cold

165
00:12:54,851 --> 00:13:00,421
How come he's not home yet?

166
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:29,476
Lets see if he will fall for this

167
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:34,543
The brothel Wol Hyang needs 100 Mo Hyang toys

168
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:40,005
50 leather gloves. If there's no shipment within three days, we will buy them from a different store.

169
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:45,433
I was fooled by that rascal and I feel like my life is cut short 10 years.

170
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:51,650
But he's just like me, a tricky lad

171
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,581
He also has a special reasoning skill

172
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:21,874
What are your doing young master?

173
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:25,125
Let GO!!

174
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,739
Please calm down, young master

175
00:14:26,739 --> 00:14:29,799
No more exams, it's over

176
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,402
Young master,

177
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,845
Are you able to withstand it any longer?

178
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:22,723
Why don't you try the other hand?

179
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:26,512
It's hard for the wounded arm to pull the bowstring

180
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:30,484
Take it!

181
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:34,852
It's not that easy

182
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:38,902
That's why you have to train the strength of your arm first.

183
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:42,581
The only way to do it is your willpower.

184
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:38,972
Young master has been there for three full days

185
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:41,423
I'm afraid that he will collapse

186
00:16:47,224 --> 00:16:50,905
They should have caught the bait by now.

187
00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:53,684
Could it be that they sense something already?

188
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:58,983
Yong, I'm starving. My feet are all numb, and my body is cold too.

189
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:01,395
I have to deliver stuff, too

190
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:03,096
Brothers, please wait for a little while, they're coming

191
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:05,274
They're coming..

192
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,441
You all have already waited for three full days

193
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:14,653
Please go home to change and come back here

194
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:16,565
It's smelly

195
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:19,449
I don't smell anything.

196
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:31,308
You placed a big order.  I will give you a discount.

197
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:33,388
You come to deliver this yourself?

198
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:34,262
What happened to your father?

199
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,094
That jerk, I have placed a restriction on him from entering the city.

200
00:17:38,094 --> 00:17:39,818
Ahh!  Why?

201
00:17:39,818 --> 00:17:44,769
He created a big problem, a grand one.

202
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:50,384
Please check if these are the items that you have ordered and are correct.

203
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:52,436
By the way,

204
00:17:52,436 --> 00:17:55,003
these are all fakes, aren't they?

205
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:58,660
What is this nonsense you are talking about?

206
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,967
Is this your first time doing business with me?

207
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:03,436
I will not give you any discount!  Hurry up and pay.

208
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:05,807
You are the one who should pay up.

209
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,445
You are caught red-handed.  You con-artist!  Give back my 200 coins.

210
00:18:13,445 --> 00:18:15,585
Ahh Bong Soon.  Bong Soon.

211
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:17,341
My daughter, Bong Soon.

212
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:18,814
My baby.

213
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:24,736
Hey, look here young man.  How many times have I told you?

214
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,627
I lost everything.  All I have are dog hairs.

215
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:29,702
Put me in there instead!

216
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:31,970
Yong!

217
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,030
What did my Yong do?

218
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,673
Why did you put him in jail? Yong! Are you alive in there?

219
00:18:40,673 --> 00:18:45,599
Hey you!

220
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,561
Aigoo Aigoo

221
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,711
Bong Soon...

222
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:56,340
Bong Soon.  My daughter, Bong Soon.

223
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:03,800
Who are you?

224
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:18,006
Yong will confiscate the wages from Bong Soon &amp; her father.  If they get caught trying to escape,

225
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:21,792
each defendant’s punishment will be 50 beatings each on their behind.

226
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:25,251
Prepared and overseen by officer, Hwang Soo Rhung.

227
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:28,109
Ok, here.  Both of you stamp it.

228
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:39,326
Now, Bong Soon's turn.

229
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,810
You people...

230
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,200
if wasn't for my father, I would not have let you go like this.

231
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,172
By the way, don't you ever try to trick my Yong about doing rice cake business.

232
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:57,387
Rice cake!?

233
00:19:57,387 --> 00:19:59,153
What rice cake?

234
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:03,940
Ok.

235
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,153
I understand.

236
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:08,962
I said I don't need it.

237
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:13,103
Keep the hostages here and Soe Dol will come here all the time!

238
00:20:13,103 --> 00:20:17,682
I am short-handed.

239
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:20,740
How about me?

240
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,800
I have to work this old man as my assistant.

241
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,380
have to share my meals...

242
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,011
he is old...how can he be my assistant?  He is like my boss.

243
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:30,905
You said that you didn't want to clean up the horse droppings.  Instruct him to do it.

244
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:32,688
He looks like he can tolerate nasty stuff well.

245
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,713
Ahh, Dae Shik...

246
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:44,032
make sure you deligently watch over these two con-artists so that they won't escape.

247
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:45,418
But why?

248
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:48,821
To get rid of these stuff so that we can recoup what we have lost.  Idiot!

249
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,198
That little...

250
00:20:59,198 --> 00:21:01,800
Stop drinking so much alcohol!

251
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,419
Here!

252
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:09,135
I can deposit 20 coins

253
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,918
Wow, you really brought me money.

254
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:17,289
If you found her for me. I'll give you more money.

255
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:25,290
Great! I'll found her quick.

256
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,777
Hey. Let's go!

257
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:34,744
Oh, boy!

258
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:38,230
Father!

259
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,131
You're eating at a time like this?

260
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:41,952
It tastes so good, huh?

261
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:45,871
I told you to fatten this little kid.

262
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,621
Hey. Bring him.

263
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:49,375
Father!

264
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,793
Did I say I was going to kill you?

265
00:21:52,793 --> 00:21:55,663
I'll send you to a far away and good nation.

266
00:21:55,663 --> 00:22:00,095
People are saying that there Joseon men are that popular!

267
00:22:00,095 --> 00:22:01,697
Hey, bring him.

268
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:02,702
No!

269
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:04,755
No!

270
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:07,580
Give me just a little bit of time.

271
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,227
Last time, I said exactly ten days.

272
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:15,869
I can't wait anymore. Do you think I live eating dirt? Let go of me!

273
00:22:19,034 --> 00:22:23,168
I have something very important to tell you.

274
00:22:25,972 --> 00:22:27,953
A traitor's child?

275
00:22:27,953 --> 00:22:29,798
That's what I said.

276
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:33,607
If we find the traitor's child, the compensation is huge!

277
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:37,159
So let's join forces.

278
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:40,241
How about we split the compensation in half?

279
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:45,591
If that kid is the traitor's child, that means I'm...

280
00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:47,411
... the king's child.

281
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:52,755
Wow, because you don't have money you're just making stories up!

282
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:56,803
Please believe in what I'm telling you.

283
00:22:56,803 --> 00:22:58,730
You're getting noisy.

284
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,297
I'll give you exactly 15 days from now.

285
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,479
Prepare that money by then.

286
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,449
Do you understand?

287
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:07,335
Guys!

288
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:08,692
Let's just go.

289
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:20,499
That guy is a traitor's son?

290
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,376
That's why...

291
00:23:22,376 --> 00:23:25,662
Am I crazy? Why would I share that with you?

292
00:23:25,662 --> 00:23:27,755
Hurray!

293
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:36,665
You worked hard.

294
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,761
You can finish for today.

295
00:23:38,761 --> 00:23:40,501
Yes.

296
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:47,162
I asked Father to fix the lantern...

297
00:24:11,293 --> 00:24:13,580
Miss! Please come out!

298
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,367
Shining your path is the only thing I can do.

299
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:59,294
I'm always thankful.

300
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:01,060
Eun Chae.

301
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:27,172
The lanterns shining this way and that.

302
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:29,053
Ahh... so cool.

303
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:30,801
Young master Shi Hoo?

304
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:31,763
With an arrow?

305
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,370
What are you doing, hanging out like this.

306
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:42,632
He lightened the lanterns?

307
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:47,052
If others saw, they would think he is Eun Chae's lover.

308
00:25:47,052 --> 00:25:49,498
Young master!

309
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:51,455
I polished your shoes.

310
00:25:51,455 --> 00:25:52,426
Aigoo.

311
00:26:05,007 --> 00:26:07,511
That little rude!

312
00:26:11,832 --> 00:26:13,319
Oh my...

313
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:17,829
Ahjussi! Ahjussi! Get yourself together!

314
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:28,904
Yong!

315
00:26:30,984 --> 00:26:33,953
Hey, Slick wants to see you right away.

316
00:26:33,953 --> 00:26:36,757
He said to tell you he found her. Who are you looking for again?

317
00:26:36,757 --> 00:26:37,368
What?

318
00:26:37,368 --> 00:26:38,766
He said he found her?

319
00:26:40,982 --> 00:26:42,655
What is that?

320
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:44,011
Who is that?

321
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:45,453
What's wrong with him?

322
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:47,933
Can you bring this person to a doctor?

323
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:49,614
Do it for me as a favor.

324
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:55,211
Geom! 
Geom!

325
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,052
Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

326
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:02,981
Get yourself together!

327
00:27:23,806 --> 00:27:27,398
Who could he have possibly wanted to give this to?

328
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:28,740
Exactly.

329
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,837
It must be...

330
00:27:30,837 --> 00:27:36,473
It seems he is related with Lee Won Ho.

331
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,295
It's not Kwon Doo Hyun.

332
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:54,215
Shim Gi Won and Kwon Doo-hyung made a blood pact with me

333
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:58,168
Do you really think I wouldn't be able to recognize Doo Hyun's handwriting?

334
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:06,643
Let's see.. Kwon Doo Hyun

335
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:12,078
Here it is.. He wrote so many petitions.

336
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:22,103
What...

337
00:28:22,103 --> 00:28:23,891
It's different.

338
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:28,357
Just hold on! Just bear it for a little.

339
00:28:28,357 --> 00:28:29,324
Geom!

340
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:30,925
It's alright. It's alright.

341
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:36,423
-There. There! 
 -It's alright.

342
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,338
Just hold on for a bit.

343
00:28:42,675 --> 00:28:44,774
Hey! Hey!

344
00:29:06,853 --> 00:29:09,661
Aigoo! Just hold on

345
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:12,380
Hold on!

346
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:17,531
Look here!

347
00:29:17,531 --> 00:29:18,585
Look here!

348
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:26,366
He was in a coma for the whole night and at dawn he...

349
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:29,138
He looks like he has been wounded for at least 3 days.

350
00:29:29,138 --> 00:29:32,429
He didn't treat the wound well so it developed an infection, which I believe is what killed him.

351
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:39,069
He's from Shim Gi Won's house?

352
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,165
Yes.

353
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:41,914
We just confirmed it.

354
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:45,036
But, why

355
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:48,045
Sir... from the corpse's ankle...

356
00:29:58,474 --> 00:30:01,404
Hong is busy now?

357
00:30:01,404 --> 00:30:02,951
I've never seen you around.

358
00:30:04,612 --> 00:30:06,956
Your little brother is looking for you.

359
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,527
You found the wrong person.

360
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:13,563
I don't have a younger brother.

361
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:16,427
Someone called Yong from Hanyang is looking for you.

362
00:30:16,427 --> 00:30:19,993
He said you would know if I told you it's from Geom.

363
00:30:19,993 --> 00:30:22,946
How did you.

364
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,264
Geom?

365
00:30:30,856 --> 00:30:33,090
Come here!

366
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,900
-Why are you doing this? 
 -Come here!

367
00:30:45,937 --> 00:30:47,591
Did you not hear?

368
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:50,234
Take your clothes off now!

369
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:55,826
We neither saw money in the Commander's pocket nor stole it.

370
00:30:55,826 --> 00:30:57,742
This low class thing...

371
00:30:57,742 --> 00:31:00,445
How dare you glare at me?

372
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:03,476
Someone...

373
00:31:03,476 --> 00:31:06,432
saw one of you...

374
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:09,861
steal the money.

375
00:31:09,861 --> 00:31:11,309
Right?

376
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:14,155
Of course. My own two eyes,

377
00:31:14,155 --> 00:31:16,125
I witnessed it.

378
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,716
This one is being difficult.

379
00:31:21,716 --> 00:31:24,890
Undress her first!

380
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:31,277
My prize is about to get away.

381
00:31:31,277 --> 00:31:34,031
If this continues, my work will be wasted.

382
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,877
Leave me alone! Let me go!

383
00:31:40,877 --> 00:31:44,304
Sorry to disturb you.

384
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:47,579
I think there's a problem with the pickled fish.

385
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:49,502
You!

386
00:31:49,502 --> 00:31:52,667
I must leave, go inside and bring it to me.

387
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:53,881
Let's go.

388
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:57,012
Don't you see I'm looking for a thief?

389
00:31:57,012 --> 00:32:01,801
We're going to check the pickled fish and come right back.

390
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:05,871
-You punk! 
 -This guy...

391
00:32:05,871 --> 00:32:09,293
Why this jerk...

392
00:32:09,293 --> 00:32:12,091
I can stand anything.

393
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:15,653
But if someone touches my head, I go crazy!

394
00:32:15,653 --> 00:32:18,023
You jerk!

395
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,021
You haven't tasted what it really means to "pour oil on the flame", have you?

396
00:32:35,642 --> 00:32:41,359
You can't handle my one fist, but bully everyone.

397
00:32:44,942 --> 00:32:45,970
Are you all right?

398
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,577
Yes

399
00:32:47,577 --> 00:32:50,443
Let's continue our conversation.

400
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:55,058
That's him.

401
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,713
What a brave guy!

402
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:59,405
You will die today!

403
00:33:25,766 --> 00:33:27,162
Stop hitting! Stop!

404
00:33:27,162 --> 00:33:28,592
Move aside!

405
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:31,507
I'm going to bury this jerk!

406
00:33:31,507 --> 00:33:32,752
I'll undress.

407
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:37,007
Really? I guess Nobles are smart.

408
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:39,004
They grasp the situation quick.

409
00:33:39,004 --> 00:33:46,811
But if you don't find the money, I'll petition the magistrate to punish you.

410
00:33:46,811 --> 00:33:47,943
What did you say?

411
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:48,852
Us, why?

412
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:51,783
If you don't find any money on me,

413
00:33:51,783 --> 00:33:55,281
It proves he is guilty of lying!

414
00:33:57,694 --> 00:34:01,274
Ok Ok! One minute.

415
00:34:05,584 --> 00:34:07,506
Let's not ruin our future

416
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:08,960
just trying to get her naked.

417
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,621
You guys, let's go! It's a misunderstanding.

418
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:16,859
Hey, what's this...

419
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:17,886
Wait and see,

420
00:34:17,886 --> 00:34:20,339
I'll get you for this.

421
00:34:29,055 --> 00:34:32,107
Are you all right?

422
00:34:32,107 --> 00:34:34,107
Aigoo

423
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:45,099
I'm sorry.

424
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:47,204
You got involved because of me

425
00:34:47,204 --> 00:34:48,475
What?

426
00:34:48,475 --> 00:34:50,133
No, it's not!

427
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:54,326
It's in my nature to stop unfairness.

428
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:58,193
But you and our Geom are...

429
00:34:58,193 --> 00:35:00,365
That is...

430
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:04,973
He's like a brother to me.

431
00:35:04,973 --> 00:35:09,908
There are no secrets between us. That cute boy!

432
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,490
Really?

433
00:35:14,093 --> 00:35:15,096
Thank you.

434
00:35:22,674 --> 00:35:25,025
Listen, tonight

435
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:27,135
Come to the Deokchan Harbor at eleven. Nobody must know.

436
00:35:27,135 --> 00:35:31,415
Yong, no, Geom and I will wait for you with a boat.

437
00:35:31,415 --> 00:35:34,047
You don't need to worry.

438
00:35:34,047 --> 00:35:38,210
You can live with your brother from now on.

439
00:35:59,014 --> 00:36:00,267
Come here!

440
00:36:06,258 --> 00:36:08,318
Let me go!

441
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:10,484
Your brother...

442
00:36:10,484 --> 00:36:12,973
is looking for you.

443
00:36:12,973 --> 00:36:14,618
I see.

444
00:36:14,618 --> 00:36:15,747
Of course he is.

445
00:36:15,747 --> 00:36:21,043
My mouth will stay shut if you behave well.

446
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:29,875
This wench!

447
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,230
Just kill me!

448
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,602
Fine. That's enough.

449
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:36,629
But how can I only kill you?

450
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:39,297
He's waiting at Deokchan harbor right?

451
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,408
I'm begging you

452
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:41,360
Follow me!

453
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,283
I'm...

454
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:40,376
Friend!

455
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,318
You've come.

456
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:46,750
Where is she?

457
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,929
Your sister?

458
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:52,603
How do you...

459
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,912
Don't worry. I'll help you both.

460
00:37:55,912 --> 00:37:57,194
Let's go!

461
00:38:12,788 --> 00:38:14,742
By the way,

462
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:16,169
Thank you.

463
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,713
I'll never forget this kindness.

464
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,371
I didn't do it for you.

465
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:27,474
I heard everything from Hunter Jang.

466
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,955
I planned to call you here, turn you in to the authorities and collect my reward.

467
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:38,209
But my heart changed.

468
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:41,176
Why?

469
00:38:41,176 --> 00:38:43,386
Why?

470
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:44,635
That is...

471
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,933
You know, your sister is that kind of person...

472
00:38:53,933 --> 00:39:00,968
You know, the kind of person you just want to help. She knows how to change people's hearts.

473
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:03,563
I'm going crazy.

474
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:07,183
Thank you.

475
00:39:07,183 --> 00:39:11,104
Sure, be thankful.

476
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:14,401
All that reward money...

477
00:39:14,401 --> 00:39:21,172
This guy! You...call me Brother from now on.

478
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:23,166
Got it?

479
00:39:24,844 --> 00:39:26,279
Brother

480
00:39:58,148 --> 00:39:59,366
Who are you?

481
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:01,975
Aigoo, you work hard.

482
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:04,763
We're merchants from Bong Hwa market.

483
00:40:04,763 --> 00:40:06,867
What are you doing here?

484
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:12,175
We must catch the first boat out in the morning to arrive at the market.

485
00:40:12,175 --> 00:40:17,312
We have no where to sleep, so we sit here drinking, killing time.

486
00:40:17,312 --> 00:40:20,870
By chance, have you seen a suspicious woman here?

487
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,472
Suspicious woman?

488
00:40:23,472 --> 00:40:27,111
A slave beat a guard down and ran away.

489
00:40:27,111 --> 00:40:30,509
What? How could such a thing...

490
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,700
Geom!

491
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,000
Geom!

492
00:41:19,169 --> 00:41:20,003
Sister!

493
00:41:20,003 --> 00:41:22,441
Let me go!

494
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:26,037
Do you want to die? To die horribly?

495
00:41:26,037 --> 00:41:27,677
But my sister's over there!

496
00:41:27,677 --> 00:41:29,399
She's being chased!

497
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:33,433
If you go after her right now, her life will really be doomed.

498
00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:57,704
If she's not caught by now,

499
00:41:57,704 --> 00:41:59,644
I'm sure she ran far away.

500
00:42:01,223 --> 00:42:04,416
I'll search the area here

501
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:06,371
with some people.

502
00:42:06,371 --> 00:42:08,009
You just go up first.

503
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:08,744
Thank you Brother,

504
00:42:08,744 --> 00:42:10,364
Don't worry.

505
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:11,909
I'll contact you soon.

506
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:13,859
I'm going to leave.

507
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,305
Now that I think about it,

508
00:42:23,305 --> 00:42:25,994
She may have gone to Hanyang.

509
00:42:25,994 --> 00:42:28,691
I told her you were living in Hanyang!

510
00:42:34,001 --> 00:42:34,773
Geez...

511
00:42:34,773 --> 00:42:35,992
She's so pretty!

512
00:42:35,992 --> 00:42:37,877
You two look alike.

513
00:42:37,877 --> 00:42:39,965
You'll recognize each other as soon as you meet.

514
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:41,680
That's blood.

515
00:42:57,916 --> 00:42:59,207
Yong

516
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:01,239
That man died.

517
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:02,654
He died?

518
00:43:02,654 --> 00:43:06,242
Yes as soon as you left, the authorities came and took his body.

519
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,099
By any chance...

520
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:10,663
Did he say anything before he died?

521
00:43:10,663 --> 00:43:13,346
No, he just called "Geom, Geom"

522
00:43:13,346 --> 00:43:16,401
Then he died.

523
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:18,498
But who is this Geom?

524
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:35,923
Is it good news?

525
00:43:35,923 --> 00:43:37,532
The civil exam is in two days.

526
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:40,164
Two days?

527
00:43:40,164 --> 00:43:41,258
That fast?

528
00:43:41,258 --> 00:43:42,719
You didn't know?

529
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,979
Yeah

530
00:43:43,979 --> 00:43:45,642
Yong didn't say anything.

531
00:43:45,642 --> 00:43:48,261
Does Dani know?

532
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:50,568
But this little brat...

533
00:43:50,568 --> 00:43:52,784
That brat.

534
00:43:52,784 --> 00:43:55,419
You brat, come here! Come here!

535
00:43:55,419 --> 00:43:56,292
What? Why?

536
00:43:56,292 --> 00:43:58,054
Come here!

537
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:03,179
Let me see some exam papers.

538
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:06,632
Ah, Yong is taking the civil exam?

539
00:44:06,632 --> 00:44:08,496
Yes

540
00:44:08,496 --> 00:44:10,160
Wait...

541
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,033
It's here, grass paper.

542
00:44:15,272 --> 00:44:17,594
Do you have anything better?

543
00:44:17,594 --> 00:44:20,419
Of course, I have Ja Moon paper.

544
00:44:20,419 --> 00:44:25,462
But it's very expensive. Only noble families can afford it.

545
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,331
Yes..

546
00:44:36,438 --> 00:44:37,974
The exam is in two days

547
00:44:37,974 --> 00:44:40,749
But you're still out playing around without me knowing about it?

548
00:44:40,749 --> 00:44:45,516
It's all about using your basic skills. 
Do you think cramming it all in would do it?

549
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,865
Be quiet!

550
00:44:46,865 --> 00:44:48,744
Read another page if you're talking! Hurry!

551
00:44:48,744 --> 00:44:49,747
Hurry!

552
00:44:49,747 --> 00:44:54,777
Dani, the exam is the day after tomorrow. You didn't know either, did you?

553
00:44:58,252 --> 00:44:59,701
What's this?

554
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:02,148
I did some sewing, but they said they didn't have money

555
00:45:02,148 --> 00:45:05,425
and gave me this useless piece of paper.

556
00:45:07,931 --> 00:45:09,569
It's so soft.

557
00:45:09,569 --> 00:45:12,767
Yong! You need to have paper for your exam, huh?

558
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:15,375
You can take this.

559
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:17,757
Hey.. this is expensive paper.

560
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:21,350
Only noblemen can afford to us this!

561
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,700
Mother!  I can really have it?

562
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:29,658
That's amazing! I'm going to go show it off.

563
00:45:29,658 --> 00:45:31,648
Hey! Where are you going?!

564
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:34,152
That rotten brat!

565
00:45:34,152 --> 00:45:35,308
That--

566
00:45:38,029 --> 00:45:39,893
Wait, Ja Dol must be taking it too.

567
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,400
Brother hasn't come back yet.

568
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,400
There wasn't any other news?

569
00:45:47,085 --> 00:45:48,519
Thanks.

570
00:45:54,077 --> 00:45:57,606
Sister... where are you?

571
00:46:54,306 --> 00:47:02,261
This is a special exam.  You have only one chance to pass.

572
00:47:03,374 --> 00:47:07,895
You'd better not miss this chance. You're not going to have another like this one.

573
00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:10,892
You are a prestigious person.

574
00:47:10,892 --> 00:47:12,467
Maybe you could use your influence...

575
00:47:12,467 --> 00:47:15,427
You bastard!

576
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:20,734
Play fair!

577
00:47:20,734 --> 00:47:22,434
Win on your own merit.

578
00:47:22,434 --> 00:47:28,346
This is the will of His Majesty, and I agree.

579
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:31,354
There shouldn't be any illegal activities.

580
00:47:31,354 --> 00:47:35,743
This is the exact order from His Majesty.

581
00:47:35,743 --> 00:47:40,166
Also, this is what I feel.

582
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:42,091
Yes, yes.

583
00:47:42,091 --> 00:47:45,294
I understand His Majesty's will.

584
00:47:45,294 --> 00:47:47,150
If somehow...

585
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:52,653
Should you fail and Shi Hoo should pass,

586
00:47:52,653 --> 00:47:58,741
I will erase your name from our family records.

587
00:47:58,741 --> 00:48:01,058
Just know that.

588
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:44,301
You bought it?

589
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:47,317
You bought that paper for Yong, didn't you?

590
00:48:48,188 --> 00:48:49,826
Stop speaking nonsense.

591
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,484
Ja Dol is taking the exam tomorrow, you know.

592
00:48:53,646 --> 00:48:55,077
A toothless idiot

593
00:48:55,077 --> 00:48:57,199
bought candy for him.

594
00:49:00,447 --> 00:49:04,547
Are you praying for Ja Dol or for Yong?

595
00:49:20,088 --> 00:49:23,851
This is to wish you good luck on your exam.

596
00:49:23,851 --> 00:49:25,396
It's fine.

597
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:28,470
I should use what I normally use. If I use something my hand is not used to...

598
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,421
It's nice.

599
00:49:46,771 --> 00:49:49,974
Go home please. You are ruining my image.

600
00:49:49,974 --> 00:49:51,760
Am I going into battle here?

601
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,465
I'm really losing face. Go!

602
00:49:53,465 --> 00:49:56,097
Okay okay, do well on your test okay.

603
00:49:56,097 --> 00:49:59,263
This will help you relax.

604
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:00,415
I'm not nervous.

605
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:01,791
You're not nervous?

606
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:05,134
My heart is racing inside.

607
00:50:05,134 --> 00:50:06,133
You're really not nervous?

608
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:09,252
I'm not nervous. I'm not nervous so could you please just wait for me over there?

609
00:50:09,252 --> 00:50:11,110
Yong...

610
00:50:15,373 --> 00:50:17,416
Yong!

611
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:18,313
Ta-da!

612
00:50:20,173 --> 00:50:22,957
Our Yong, Hooray!

613
00:50:26,121 --> 00:50:27,947
Ja!

614
00:50:27,947 --> 00:50:32,300
Yong is the winner!

615
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,711
Yong...

616
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:34,539
Yo...

617
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:36,959
Father! What is this?

618
00:50:36,959 --> 00:50:39,904
Why are you so stupid?

619
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:46,694
Yong is the winner!

620
00:50:46,694 --> 00:50:50,162
Yong is the winner!

621
00:50:50,162 --> 00:50:52,429
Yong is the winner!

622
00:50:52,429 --> 00:50:55,924
Yong, Hooray!

623
00:50:55,924 --> 00:50:57,657
G-go!

624
00:50:57,657 --> 00:50:59,396
Hooray!

625
00:50:59,396 --> 00:51:00,516
Hooray!

626
00:51:01,877 --> 00:51:05,082
Hooray! Hooray!

627
00:51:05,082 --> 00:51:09,064
Aigoo... what a useless show.

628
00:51:11,092 --> 00:51:16,925
Life is quite interesting...They even let a dog take the exam now.

629
00:51:20,888 --> 00:51:25,465
Where is it? Where? Where is this dog?

630
00:51:25,465 --> 00:51:27,782
This bastard.

631
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:34,423
Brother!

632
00:51:34,423 --> 00:51:36,852
Yong, I found your sister.

633
00:51:54,655 --> 00:51:57,869
Minister of Military, Lord Byun Sik

634
00:52:08,176 --> 00:52:12,005
47, 50, complete

635
00:52:12,005 --> 00:52:16,317
If your number is called, step this way. The rest, stand over there.

636
00:52:17,344 --> 00:52:19,649
What's that? Why are they standing there?

637
00:52:19,649 --> 00:52:22,342
They're sons of noblemen.

638
00:52:22,342 --> 00:52:23,343
This side?

639
00:52:23,343 --> 00:52:25,972
We're half-bloods and average people.

640
00:52:34,862 --> 00:52:36,988
This is too much.

641
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:40,636
Noblemen get to shoot riding cows, and we have to do it on horseback?

642
00:52:40,636 --> 00:52:43,444
That's not fair.

643
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:47,757
If you're unhappy then leave! Hurry!

644
00:52:50,578 --> 00:52:52,343
Let's start.

645
00:52:59,336 --> 00:53:02,173
Hit the bullseye!

646
00:53:10,893 --> 00:53:13,631
Hit the bullseye!

647
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:30,968
She must have been starving. Looked like a beggar.

648
00:53:30,968 --> 00:53:36,337
I found her stuffing her face in the kitchen.

649
00:53:38,451 --> 00:53:40,793
Are you her brother?

650
00:53:40,793 --> 00:53:44,002
You look like her.

651
00:53:44,002 --> 00:53:48,643
She said she came to Hanyang looking for her mother and her brother.

652
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:49,749
Mother?

653
00:53:49,749 --> 00:53:52,674
She said she was seperated from her mother too when she was young.

654
00:53:52,674 --> 00:53:54,700
She was taken as a slave,

655
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:59,207
and her mother became a gisaeng. She cried her eyes out telling me the story.

656
00:53:59,207 --> 00:54:00,397
Aigoo..

657
00:54:00,397 --> 00:54:04,845
You should have come just a little earlier.

658
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:08,927
Where did she go?

659
00:54:08,927 --> 00:54:10,329
I...

660
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:14,620
I gave her some stolen goods.

661
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,855
She must be going through gisaeng houses in Hanyang, looking for her mother.

662
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,671
Kibang?

663
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:30,605
Number 230!

664
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:32,050
Yes.

665
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:57,286
It's a hit!

666
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:48,439
They said you screwed up!

667
00:55:49,487 --> 00:55:51,526
What happened?

668
00:55:51,526 --> 00:55:55,035
Thought you'd pass for sure.

669
00:55:56,945 --> 00:55:58,987
Don't feel too bad.

670
00:55:58,987 --> 00:56:03,909
A bastard will never get a government position anyway.

671
00:56:05,312 --> 00:56:07,727
Didn't you know?

672
00:56:10,505 --> 00:56:13,036
Oh, you didn't know.

673
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:16,191
Don't feel too bad about that either.

674
00:56:16,191 --> 00:56:18,661
Those who perform a glorious feat

675
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:20,702
on the battlefield.

676
00:56:20,702 --> 00:56:26,175
Even if they're bastards, may enter the court.

677
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:30,396
But, what to do.

678
00:56:30,396 --> 00:56:33,503
To get you to a high position.

679
00:56:33,503 --> 00:56:37,485
You can't create war.

680
00:56:39,154 --> 00:56:41,829
What should you do?

681
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:44,760
What should you do, huh?

682
00:56:48,293 --> 00:56:49,787
I'll just be out for a while.

683
00:56:49,787 --> 00:56:53,176
Ok. Play as much as you want today.

684
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:56,593
Wait a second. I bought something tasty.

685
00:56:58,561 --> 00:57:01,551
What's wrong with him? Did he mess up his exam?

686
00:57:02,136 --> 00:57:07,782
It's not been posted yet so don't worry too much about it.

687
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:17,807
Why are you going in and out of here.

688
00:57:17,807 --> 00:57:21,198
Is it that wrong to go in and out of my brother's room?

689
00:57:21,198 --> 00:57:24,383
A brother?

690
00:57:24,383 --> 00:57:27,714
Go bring Shi Wan.

691
00:57:34,953 --> 00:57:36,619
Let me ask you something.

692
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:41,404
Is there a girl selling goods around?

693
00:57:43,336 --> 00:57:45,450
Young master!

694
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,743
Don't they do business here?

695
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:14,993
You're here, young master?

696
00:58:16,101 --> 00:58:20,649
Young master Shi Wan took everyone out to the lantern festival.

697
00:58:20,649 --> 00:58:23,801
You should go in and wait. The wind is pretty cold.

698
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:25,629
It's alright.

699
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:37,549
They are going to go crazy over this.

700
00:58:37,549 --> 00:58:42,093
Excuse me, by any chance...

701
00:58:42,093 --> 00:58:47,682
Is there a gisaeng who used to be a servant? She's about 40 years old.

702
00:58:47,682 --> 00:58:49,212
Who used to be a servant?

703
00:58:49,212 --> 00:58:52,912
Let's see, no I don't think so.

704
00:58:56,253 --> 00:58:59,939
Could you get me a cup of water?

705
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:13,072
What brings you here? 
 A Gwanbi slave caused some trouble and ran away.

706
00:59:18,242 --> 00:59:21,754
Where is the washroom again?

707
00:59:31,547 --> 00:59:35,143
Young master, did you see a strange girl?

708
00:59:35,143 --> 00:59:36,578
What's wrong?

709
00:59:36,578 --> 00:59:41,884
Some slave girl caused some trouble and ran away, and it's an emergency country wide.

710
00:59:41,884 --> 00:59:44,253
I didn't see her.

711
00:59:49,046 --> 00:59:51,383
I understand.

712
00:59:57,529 --> 00:59:59,552
Where did you go?

713
00:59:59,552 --> 01:00:02,081
I went to the washroom.

714
01:00:08,734 --> 01:00:11,588
Are you leaving? He will come soon.

715
01:00:11,588 --> 01:00:14,134
I'll come back later.

716
01:00:18,279 --> 01:00:20,760
Isn't he handsome?

717
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,248
He's the minister's bastard son.

718
01:00:31,242 --> 01:00:33,973
If Geom grew up nice.

719
01:00:33,973 --> 01:00:37,760
He would look noble too.

720
01:00:46,553 --> 01:00:48,471
Anyways, a bastard

721
01:00:48,471 --> 01:00:53,084
can't get a position at the government anyway even if he passes the exam.

722
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:07,949
Stop right there!

723
01:01:19,782 --> 01:01:33,865


724
01:01:33,865 --> 01:01:35,890
