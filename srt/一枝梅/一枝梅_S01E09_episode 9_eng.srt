1
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,000


2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,300
There is nothing better than this for safe money.

3
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:41,871
In 15 days

4
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,000
everything will go to Chung.

5
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,500
Of course peasants can take the civil service exam too. But have you actually seen one pass it?

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,900
Stop dreaming nonsense!

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,800
Will he know? The meaning of the bloody flower that I drew?

8
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,100
Who are you to be on someone else's property?

9
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,700
Didn't I ask who you are to be on someone else's property?

10
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,600
Huh? Oh that.... The birds were chirping...

11
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,200
Do you know those birds?

12
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,400
Miss, do you know those birds too?

13
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,300
When I was little, there was a child who taught me.

14
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,700
Do you want to come up?

15
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
He told me there was a sad story behind those birds

16
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,500
but in the end I couldn't hear the story.

17
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,100
Should I tell you?

18
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,800
A long time ago there was a beautiful girl engaged to be married to a potter,

19
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,000
but the girl died before their wedding day.

20
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,500
The potter went to her tomb everyday, missing her dead fiancee.

21
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,600
One day, a blosoom tree grew at the tomb.

22
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,600
The potter considered this was the spirit of his dead fiancee and took great care of it.

23
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,900
The tree grew tall and the potter grew old as well.

24
00:03:44,947 --> 00:03:47,589
The potter was worried.

25
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:51,991
He was wondering who would take care of the tree once he dies.

26
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,800
Then one day the old potter disappeared.

27
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,900
Where to?

28
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,200
I'm here again.

29
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,700
Eat this.

30
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,100
You never fully ate because you were always taking care of me.

31
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,800
The village people were worried and went to his house

32
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,600
but the potter wasn't there. There was just a beautiful vase in his room.

33
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,200
From the vase, a chipping bird flew out and to the blossom tree.

34
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,600
The old potter died and became the bird.

35
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,000
Not being able to leave the tree even after his death.

36
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,000
That's his destiny.

37
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,700
Destiny...

38
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,900
Do you believe in destiny?

39
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:29,284
You remember this right? From the other boy.

40
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,587
Is he alive?

41
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:35,389
I wish he were.

42
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:40,691
I would like to tell him thanks.

43
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:48,255
Miss! Miss!

44
00:05:50,522 --> 00:05:53,882
Miss! Miss!

45
00:05:54,777 --> 00:05:57,792
Miss, they are saying to hurry and come.

46
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:01,329
I'll be there soon so go ahead first

47
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:29,652
 I think it was three or four days ago. 

48
00:06:29,652 --> 00:06:34,161
 A young man came and took all the leftovers. 

49
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,698
Hurry up, push from behind.

50
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:51,698
Let's go!

51
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:07,830
The card disappeared!

52
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:13,912
You said that the farmer was here at that time?

53
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:15,986
Yes, we had to drag him away.

54
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:21,331
Why are you plowing the field? 
 What? Are you going to plant stuff here?

55
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:23,660
Look for clues, I'm telling you! Clues!

56
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:14,941
No, no. Go away!

57
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:17,566
Because of your horse and cart, you're ruining my crops!

58
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:19,774
I barely managed to get this to grow.

59
00:09:19,774 --> 00:09:21,691
Go away! Go away!

60
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:25,066
You're not going? Fine then step over me! Just step on me and go!

61
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,399
Do you know who this belongs to? 
 Guys! Drag him out of here!

62
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,066
What do I care whose cart it is?

63
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:31,024
Drag him away!

64
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:33,483
Let go! Let go!

65
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:52,983
Why aren't you listening to what I'm saying?

66
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:54,483
Go away!

67
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,066
Let me work and live my life!!

68
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:05,399
You really have to get a good beating to realize what you're doing.

69
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:09,316
Let's go.  
 Let's go

70
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:10,899
Keep pushing!

71
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:41,816


72
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:49,566
This is how he got the cart and got away.

73
00:11:19,524 --> 00:11:24,233
I'm not sure. But his eyes were quite slant.

74
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:26,858
No, not like that.

75
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:30,649
I don't know... like a crescent moon in the dark night?

76
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:39,316
His nose was so straight and lean, he could have stolen my heart just with his nose!

77
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:43,691
Where have you seen a nose like that?

78
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:52,608
And he also had this huge mole on his left cheek.

79
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:54,983
Il-ji-mae!!

80
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:59,316
He drew blossom flowers on the crime scene

81
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:01,733
That's why people call him Iljimae

82
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,733
One branch of blossom tree, Iljimae.

83
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,191
Wow, quite interesting.

84
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:11,316
He must have been busy stealing, yet he had the time to leave a drawing.

85
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:15,691
But... why Iljimae?

86
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,524
You stupid fool.

87
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:19,483
I just explained it to you!

88
00:12:19,483 --> 00:12:23,399
You're even dumber than I am!

89
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,816
One branch of the blossom tree!

90
00:12:24,816 --> 00:12:29,608
You with your ugly pumpkin face, how dare you call me fool?

91
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:31,566
That's what I'm asking, why is he called Iljimae?

92
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:38,733
Hey! This thief! Doesn't he look just like me?

93
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:40,649
Look alike? Yeah right. I don't think so.

94
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:45,608
Look at him, he was born to be a thief. Look at those slanty eyes.

95
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:49,983
Yeah, but I have those eyes too.

96
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:51,191
Don't say that!

97
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:55,983
Your eyes are your life, my son. 
 There are no eyes more beautiful than yours in Choson.

98
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:59,441
Your eyes are like a national treasure.

99
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:01,149
You know nothing.

100
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:10,691
Yeah right. National treasure? 
 That's my eyes you're talking about.

101
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:15,191
Well, no eyes can be as certain and right as Dae Shik's.

102
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:20,774
You said that was your father in that drawing? 
 Yeah, right, yours are the national treasure!

103
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:30,774
I decided to open a steel lock shop here.

104
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:34,024
A lock shop?

105
00:13:34,024 --> 00:13:36,024
Where did you get the money?

106
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,941
Well, you know, I got some from this place,

107
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:42,816
I used your mother's name for some other place.

108
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:47,941
What crazy person would buy a lock from a former thief?

109
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:51,191
How dare you look down on your father like that?

110
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:55,316
Hey, your father his the one who put that secret lock for the Hopan lord.

111
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:58,441
It was you?

112
00:13:58,441 --> 00:14:01,149
That lock without the hole?

113
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:03,733
Have the stories been going around already?

114
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:07,691
Words do travel fast.

115
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:10,566
Iljimae or whatever he's called, he'll have to answer to me. Let him come!

116
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:14,149
If he can unlock, well, I can sure lock things up!

117
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:22,774
I'm going to earn money so don't hang out with those lowlives. Come back home.

118
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:25,899
Do you know how worried your mother is because of you?

119
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:30,858
Really? She must be pretty happy I'm not at home anymore. Like a pain that's gone forever.

120
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:32,191
You little brat!

121
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,274
When are you ever going to grow up?

122
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,691
I'll be home later.

123
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:45,608
My lord, come in come in. I was just about to visit you anyways.

124
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:48,024
Don't be too disappointed.

125
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:52,649
That little thief, I'm going to catch him, I promise you.

126
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:56,108
Finding those treasures will create even more problems, so forget about them.

127
00:14:56,108 --> 00:15:00,524
If you could just find the black pearls...

128
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:05,191
Black pearls? So those black round things were black pearls?

129
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:07,071
Yes...

130
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:13,556
I was sending them to the Yong Gun general. 
 They are called 'tears of the sea'.

131
00:15:13,556 --> 00:15:20,041
Oh... tears... And how much are those?

132
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:31,412
So this is the black bead?

133
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:35,764
Why is this so precious that he is only looking for these?

134
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:46,964
How much is it?

135
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:51,935
I've never seen anything like this.

136
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:54,239
I think you'll be able to price it yourself.

137
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,097
I understand.

138
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,769
Look here!

139
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,908
Weren't you going to the construction site?

140
00:16:05,908 --> 00:16:07,849
Why are we here?

141
00:16:07,849 --> 00:16:10,601
I would like to be alone for a while.

142
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:11,775
I'm sorry?

143
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,780
Oh... all right.

144
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:26,217
What was I thinking... No way he would be here.

145
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:43,241
What? I can price it myself?

146
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,521
Pass.

147
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:55,444
Pass.

148
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:00,564
Pass.

149
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:04,745
Who is that? Go fetch him.

150
00:17:05,428 --> 00:17:08,329
Pass.

151
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:21,876
It's a good day today. Working will be nice.

152
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:30,729
What are you doing? Do you know who she is?

153
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:34,079
What about you? Do you know who he is?

154
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,900
He's the son of Jeong Myung Seo, the royal envoy from the Chung empire.

155
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:46,132
I was wondering where all the pretty girls in Hanyang were, and here they are.

156
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,969
I haven't been in my home country for a long time

157
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:56,137
Hanyang is so unfamiliar. So, why don't you give me a tour?

158
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:05,716
You want to play games? You know, no bad will come from being good to me.

159
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:08,169
What kind of rude manners is this?

160
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:24,575
Hmm... making a fuss only makes you look prettier.

161
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:30,143
You said you had left Choson a while ago, well, it seems that you have forgotten this country's manners.

162
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,084
Move away!

163
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,345
She said she didn't like you.

164
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:44,841
This doesn't look good, you know.

165
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:47,017
Why are you making so much fuss on the streets?

166
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:48,532
Who is this jerk?

167
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,956
You seem to have low standards, my man. 
 That girl is nothing.

168
00:18:55,956 --> 00:19:00,137
If you come with me to the Kibang I go to, there are beautiful and sexy women everywhere.

169
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:03,935
You give them my name, and you can have them at half the price too!

170
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,343
What?

171
00:19:12,212 --> 00:19:15,561
Please stop it! 
 Please stop it!!

172
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:18,036
No, Miss!

173
00:19:18,036 --> 00:19:19,871
Please no, Miss!

174
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:24,820
Let me go!

175
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,358
No, Miss.

176
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,233
Are you okay?

177
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:37,215
What is going on?

178
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:43,124
Please save him... He was trying to save me.

179
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:53,193
Sir, he is a suspect in a grand theft case of a nobleman's house.

180
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:56,566
We will question him, so please hand him over to us.

181
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:58,783
A suspect of theft?

182
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:01,556
Yes. He will also answer for his disrespect towards you.

183
00:20:01,556 --> 00:20:04,884
I will deal with those disrespectful towards me myself.

184
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:06,591
So move away.

185
00:20:06,591 --> 00:20:12,863
By the way, what happened with the daughter of Lord Byun Shik?

186
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:15,188
She's the daughter of Lord Byun?

187
00:20:15,188 --> 00:20:18,324
Yes sir.

188
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:21,801
Please hand over the suspect to our custody.

189
00:20:24,148 --> 00:20:29,609
All right then. Let's go.

190
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:42,431
Orabeoni, this man has done no wrong.

191
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:46,228
Stay put.

192
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:47,316
That's not him.

193
00:20:47,316 --> 00:20:51,135
Then, let's go.

194
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:58,431
Let's go. I'll take you home.

195
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:36,994

196
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:39,307
Father.

197
00:21:40,618 --> 00:21:42,480
Ja Dol!

198
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:44,861
Wow

199
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:50,610
that outfit on you looks like a king's robe!

200
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,320
It's hard, right?

201
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,366
No, it's all right.

202
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:59,211
I heard that with your position, you also take turns to the village.

203
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:02,262
Do you also look around the South Gate area?

204
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:06,031
Yes, that is my area.

205
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:10,432
The streets of South Gate are controlled by the Castor Oil gang.

206
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:15,775
They are not that bad, so even if you get into confrontation, don't be too hard on them.

207
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:16,680
I'm sorry?

208
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,846
Well, the thing is...

209
00:22:18,846 --> 00:22:21,323
our little Yong...

210
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:25,380
if you meet him, by any chance, everything is my fault,

211
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:29,007
if he's done something wrong, it's all my fault...

212
00:22:29,296 --> 00:22:32,029
so take me instead, not him, ok?

213
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:36,773
What are you talking about?

214
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:39,218
We...

215
00:22:39,218 --> 00:22:43,695
no, I... did some horrible things to him.

216
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:49,036
What horrible things?

217
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:53,761
By the way, I'm opening a lock shop.

218
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:55,193
Do you want to come?

219
00:22:55,193 --> 00:23:00,466
I'm opening it in two days. It's next to the steel shop in South Gate.

220
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:02,467
You're busy, right?

221
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,834
Your mother has too much work to do, so she won't be able to come.

222
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:09,572
Guard Byun.

223
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:14,190
What are you doing? I told you to clean up latrines today!

224
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,720
Take care.

225
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,094
Sure. Go ahead.

226
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,498
This little brat...

227
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,102
Go! Go!

228
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:26,974
That jerk...

229
00:23:26,974 --> 00:23:29,823
That bastard!

230
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,020
Is there something wrong?

231
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,846
No...

232
00:23:38,846 --> 00:23:40,370
I'm just... tired.

233
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:45,271
Mother! The runaway son has come home!

234
00:23:45,983 --> 00:23:49,206
What's wrong with father?

235
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,087
What did you do again?

236
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:54,749
I just bumped into something.

237
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:59,572
I got some barley. I'll put it int he kitchen.

238
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,473
Are you all right?

239
00:24:21,822 --> 00:24:26,573
He'll be all right, won't he? That man...

240
00:25:13,027 --> 00:25:16,291
Shi Hoo you!

241
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:21,315
You were there?! Then you should have brought that bastard here!

242
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:24,018
Why did you let him go? Why?

243
00:25:24,018 --> 00:25:25,410
Father!

244
00:25:26,185 --> 00:25:28,026
Eun Chae!

245
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,688
Why are you doing this, Father?

246
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:33,646
That man is the son of a royal envoy from Chung.

247
00:25:33,646 --> 00:25:36,228
Would it have been the right thing to do to bring him here?

248
00:25:36,624 --> 00:25:38,815
Well...

249
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:42,521
What? An envoy of Chung?

250
00:25:42,521 --> 00:25:46,176
Then... that's Jeong Myung Soo?

251
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:50,008
You rascal! Why did you leave that part out?

252
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:52,899
You ...!

253
00:25:58,011 --> 00:25:59,786
Did it hurt?

254
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:02,886
Good thing you didn't say anything.

255
00:26:05,936 --> 00:26:09,452
May I have a bowl of fish soup?

256
00:26:11,073 --> 00:26:15,517
You're having a late dinner. Hold on.

257
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:36,299
When I was little, my father used to drink a lot. 
 My mother used to make this fish soup for him.

258
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:37,856
It's exactly how it tasted like.

259
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:42,654
Your mother must have been a very kind person.

260
00:26:42,654 --> 00:26:49,258
Seeing how well you've grown, you must have been very much loved by her.

261
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:52,211
Do you have any children?

262
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,784
I have a son...

263
00:26:56,112 --> 00:26:59,168
who would be just about your age.

264
00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:03,813
I also have a daughter.

265
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,992
Do you live apart?

266
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:13,919
Stop by whenever you want to have fish soup.

267
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:28,404
Hey, call out the Miss who lives here.

268
00:27:28,404 --> 00:27:29,293
Who the heck are you?

269
00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:34,656
Tell her that the noble young man who saved her yesterday came by to see how she was doing.

270
00:27:34,656 --> 00:27:37,753
Miss? There's no miss here.

271
00:27:37,753 --> 00:27:40,384
You don't believe me, do you?

272
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:44,883
Here, this is the handkerchief the miss here gave to me herself.

273
00:27:44,883 --> 00:27:49,478
When she sees this, she will definitely run to meet me.

274
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:51,657
Wait here.

275
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,546
Are you looking for me?

276
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:00,560
What is it?

277
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,335
No, I'm here for your daughter...

278
00:28:03,335 --> 00:28:07,640
Daughter? I don't have any daughter.

279
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,888
How dare you?

280
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:14,394
What is this scheme? What do you want?

281
00:28:14,855 --> 00:28:17,611
No, I'm looking for the owner of this handkerchief.

282
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:20,394
I don't know anything about that.

283
00:28:20,736 --> 00:28:22,686
Chase him away!

284
00:28:22,686 --> 00:28:25,699
Madam! But she lives here, I am sure!

285
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:27,123
Go away!

286
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,413
No, it's not that!

287
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:46,958
What? Looking for Eun Chae?

288
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:52,889
Yes. I heard that Miss got into trouble yesterday, but he even has her handkerchief.

289
00:28:52,889 --> 00:28:55,878
I was wondering if it was the man who bothered her.

290
00:28:55,878 --> 00:28:58,144
Madam told me to come to you.

291
00:28:58,144 --> 00:29:00,269
Is that so?

292
00:29:00,604 --> 00:29:05,414
Jeong Chi Hong, how dare you? To my sister?

293
00:29:07,735 --> 00:29:10,616
She's that bastard's sister?

294
00:29:20,312 --> 00:29:21,891
What are you doing?

295
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:23,007
We have to catch him.

296
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:25,926
That thief? Iljimae or I don't know what?

297
00:29:25,926 --> 00:29:29,915
That would only be possible if he had left any clues of some sort!

298
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:35,825
A box with a coin, with the drawing of a blossom flower. There's nothing else!

299
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,502
What do you think this is?

300
00:29:39,502 --> 00:29:41,217
I don't know...

301
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:54,041
Your name is Yang Soon, right?

302
00:29:55,385 --> 00:29:59,503
We are here to investigate on something.

303
00:29:59,503 --> 00:30:01,252
How can I believe you?

304
00:30:01,252 --> 00:30:05,753
It's a scary world these days. Show me your badge.

305
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:14,543
What is it?

306
00:30:14,543 --> 00:30:15,908
Is your father here?

307
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:17,977
Yang Soon!

308
00:30:17,977 --> 00:30:19,961
What's the matter?

309
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:23,247
Do you recognize this box?

310
00:30:25,017 --> 00:30:30,180
It's a box for apples. If you want apples, you should go to the fruit market.

311
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,020
This is a box for vegetables, right?

312
00:30:36,004 --> 00:30:41,188
Am I the only vegetable merchant in the whole of Choson?

313
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:49,039
I found this underneath the box, and this box was in the cart that was stolen from the Hopan household.

314
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,356
What is your relationship with the thief?

315
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:57,899
Are you his accomplice?

316
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:02,095
Accomplice?

317
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:03,649
I know nothing about this!

318
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:08,691
Sir! Sir! Please save me!

319
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:10,799
Leave my father!

320
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,852
Damn! What if he tells them everything?

321
00:31:14,852 --> 00:31:19,232
I know! He has such a feeble heart too!

322
00:31:19,232 --> 00:31:23,620
What? An apple box to Lord Hopan?

323
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,668
How could I know?

324
00:31:25,668 --> 00:31:28,548
This is not new.

325
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:32,879
If there's anyone who hasn't sent a box to the Hopan household,

326
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:35,225
may that person come out!

327
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:42,671
Lord Hopan stole goods and was planning to ship them in secret overseas

328
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:44,982
he should be investigated and interrogated.

329
00:31:44,982 --> 00:31:49,348
However, your Majesty, Lord Hopan is a noble man with prestige.

330
00:31:49,348 --> 00:31:54,895
If you go after this hero, this will shake the foundations of this country

331
00:31:54,895 --> 00:31:58,415
and will be an excuse to our ennemies.

332
00:31:58,415 --> 00:32:03,024
It's not that I'm not aware of the good Hopan's done.

333
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:05,625
I never forget the good you all have done.

334
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:08,316
We are grateful, your Majesty.

335
00:32:08,316 --> 00:32:13,988
However, even if he may be a national hero, being the main cause of suffering of the people

336
00:32:13,988 --> 00:32:18,639
and stealing national goods away, how could I forget such grave sins?

337
00:32:20,047 --> 00:32:28,260
So even if you plead for his name, I am bound to apply the law.

338
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:34,468
Your Majesty, please reconsider your thought.

339
00:32:34,468 --> 00:32:36,964
Please go away now.

340
00:32:36,964 --> 00:32:40,377
Sir! Sir! Please listen to me!

341
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:44,601
Why do you keep imprisonning the wrong people, instead of catching the real thief?

342
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:49,785
Go catch that Iljimae! No wonder why this country is in such a mess.

343
00:32:49,785 --> 00:32:52,729
You ... you're going to become a regular here!

344
00:32:52,729 --> 00:32:56,335
I'm not telling you to free him.

345
00:32:56,335 --> 00:33:00,708
His family would just like to see him, just for a second.

346
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:05,572
I want to let them in too. But things have gotten bigger.

347
00:33:05,572 --> 00:33:07,385
Hey, Kang dosa!

348
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,537
Come here!

349
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,063
How did you let this go to the King?

350
00:33:14,063 --> 00:33:17,177
They came in suddenly during the interrogation...

351
00:33:17,177 --> 00:33:18,372
Shut up!

352
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:21,060
You should have stopped them no matter what!

353
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:25,433
Hey! Do you know how big things have gotten because of that one thief?

354
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:27,396
You useless thing!

355
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:29,721
Excuse me, by any chance...

356
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,428
are you the chief here?

357
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:32,815
What is this?

358
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:38,489
Yes, yes, these things should be discussed with the person in charge.

359
00:33:38,489 --> 00:33:43,119
You look so strong and trustworthy.

360
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:46,297
Wait.

361
00:33:47,343 --> 00:33:50,159
Where have I seen you?

362
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,681
Sir, the man who was wrongly detained,

363
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:58,308
please allow us to see him once, so that we can bring him some food.

364
00:33:58,308 --> 00:33:59,524
No!

365
00:33:59,524 --> 00:34:02,745
Sir! Please hear us out!

366
00:34:02,745 --> 00:34:07,993
Look at this! Who do you think I am?

367
00:34:07,993 --> 00:34:12,367
If you don't want to, then you leave me no choice.

368
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:14,991
I am going directly to the royal court then.

369
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:20,751
I already know how it's done, and the King has such a good opinion of me anyways.

370
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:23,887
As you wish.

371
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:29,711
Wait... you're the guy... that other day...

372
00:34:29,711 --> 00:34:33,828
At the game!

373
00:34:33,828 --> 00:34:35,577
You...such a pain in the ass!

374
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:39,417
Kang Dosa, go and give him what he wants.

375
00:34:41,232 --> 00:34:42,441
Make him go! Now!

376
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:46,732
Don't worry! I'll walk my way out!

377
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:51,732
Such a bothersome thing, that little brat.

378
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:55,316
What kind of person is he?

379
00:34:55,316 --> 00:34:57,191
Have you called?

380
00:34:57,191 --> 00:34:59,650
Yes.

381
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:03,191
Bring a mat and follow me.

382
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,525
Spray it.

383
00:35:20,441 --> 00:35:22,607
Your Majesty!

384
00:35:22,607 --> 00:35:27,232
Please reconsider your order!

385
00:35:27,232 --> 00:35:39,066
Your Majesty! Please reconsider your order!

386
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:42,900
Your Majesty!

387
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:48,357
The King is coming!

388
00:35:52,732 --> 00:36:00,275
Your Majesty! This is an abuse of power!

389
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:07,025
Lord Hopan has committed no sin.

390
00:36:07,025 --> 00:36:11,400
Your Majesty! Please hear us!

391
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:18,482
Your Majesty! Please hear us!

392
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:22,691
Your Majesty!

393
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:27,400
You must stop the order against Hopan.

394
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:33,482
Let me go! You must stop this!

395
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:38,441
Please hear us out!

396
00:36:40,525 --> 00:36:45,857
All right. You are so strong opiniated there's nothing I can do.

397
00:36:48,003 --> 00:36:49,775
Prepare the documents for Hopan.

398
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,441
Documents,your majesty?

399
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:54,857
If you let Hopan go, we will have to erase all evidence!

400
00:36:54,857 --> 00:36:57,357
Paneuigeum busa ( title in charge of the questioning of culprits) 

401
00:36:57,357 --> 00:37:09,400
Go catch the thief first. My people are already suffering. 
 How are they supposed to be safe with a thief running around now? Don't you agree?

402
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:16,566
Now is the time to focus our efforts into catching that thief, regardless of the departments.

403
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:22,857
Yes, your Majesty, that is exactly what I want to say.

404
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,150
Yang Soon's father!

405
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,107
My god! My god! What is this?

406
00:37:34,107 --> 00:37:35,607
Father!

407
00:37:35,607 --> 00:37:42,232
My god, my god, why is this happening to us?

408
00:37:42,232 --> 00:37:46,482
Aigo aigo.

409
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:52,025
How are we supposed to live now? No money, and we can't even sell!

410
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:55,732
How are we supposed to pay the Castor Oil gang?

411
00:37:59,232 --> 00:38:00,607
What's that?

412
00:38:02,732 --> 00:38:06,025
You know, this is how it's done. It's a bribe.

413
00:38:06,025 --> 00:38:07,025
A bribe?

414
00:38:07,025 --> 00:38:09,857
Go and find the men who did this to my dad. 
 Find them and punish them.

415
00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:12,150
You're a nice Castor Oil gang member, aren't you?

416
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,982
I know everything.

417
00:38:13,982 --> 00:38:17,857
All right? Let's make a deal.

418
00:38:19,107 --> 00:38:22,191
I'll get married to you later.

419
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:24,691
Deal? Deal!

420
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:43,908
Song Haeng Su from Jung Chon?

421
00:38:54,227 --> 00:38:57,966
 How are we going to live now? 

422
00:38:57,966 --> 00:39:05,451
 They take away our money and we can't sell... 
 How are we going to repay the Castor Oil Gang? 

423
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:27,619
Yours came back too?

424
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:29,529
Yes.

425
00:39:29,529 --> 00:39:32,141
We can live now!

426
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:37,851
All the people in the village, all their money came back too!

427
00:39:37,851 --> 00:39:39,367
What came back?

428
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:41,158
You brat!

429
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:43,538
Hey, did your wife came back? The one who ran away?

430
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:00,968
Aigoo...

431
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:04,273
You finally got some sense into that head of yours.

432
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:10,315
I thought you were starting something grand.

433
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,700
The pig's head is ashamed!

434
00:40:18,036 --> 00:40:19,222
What is this?

435
00:40:19,222 --> 00:40:21,385
It's a present.

436
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:26,683
Hold on.

437
00:40:26,683 --> 00:40:29,100
He didn't even sleep trying to make that thing.

438
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,182
By the way, where is Yong?

439
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:33,100
He's a bit busy.

440
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,476
Busy? He's hanging out with those lowlifes.

441
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,098
By the way, where is Bong Soon?

442
00:40:42,098 --> 00:40:47,524
Bong Soon is busy too. She's always out these days. It's getting suspicious.

443
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:57,267
Ajussi, did someone look for this?

444
00:40:57,267 --> 00:40:58,543
I don't know.

445
00:40:58,543 --> 00:41:00,784
Ajussi, was anyone looking for this?

446
00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:04,438
You're here again?

447
00:41:13,215 --> 00:41:16,759
Hyung, are we going to Byungpan's household soon?

448
00:41:16,759 --> 00:41:21,719
Of course we are. It's thanks to him that we can feed ourselves.

449
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:24,281
He's our most important client.

450
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:27,030
Then when do we go to his house?

451
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:31,036
He used to call us all the time. But he's been quite silent these days.

452
00:41:35,357 --> 00:41:36,755
Hey?

453
00:41:36,755 --> 00:41:38,192
What is that?

454
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,843
I'll do this myself! Leave it alone. Go rest.

455
00:41:48,843 --> 00:41:54,019
Hey you! What are you doing?

456
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:55,842
Is this some public display of affection?

457
00:41:55,842 --> 00:41:57,297
Who are you?

458
00:41:57,297 --> 00:41:59,339
What a smell!

459
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:02,204
Look at those hair!

460
00:42:02,204 --> 00:42:06,504
Go wash it from time to time! You stink!

461
00:42:06,504 --> 00:42:11,373
You tiny little thing!

462
00:42:11,373 --> 00:42:17,331
Hello? Haven't you heard? If you want to set up a shop here, you have to pay us the rent!

463
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,084
What are you doing?

464
00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:23,573
Geez, this woman! You've got some character, huh?

465
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:27,251
Would you like me to handle your husband, huh?

466
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:30,349
What are you saying?

467
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:36,614
Let me see... You have no front tooth! Haha.

468
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:41,330
You pathetic lot. You really have nothing to do?

469
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,695
Get away! Move!

470
00:42:42,695 --> 00:42:43,839
Leave this place at once!

471
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,273
Ah!

472
00:42:45,273 --> 00:42:47,674
Apparently words don't work with this woman.

473
00:42:47,674 --> 00:42:50,078
Guys! Let's trash this place!

474
00:42:53,729 --> 00:42:58,561
I hear there were some lawless people in the South Gate. It was you!

475
00:43:01,697 --> 00:43:04,667
Good work, sir!

476
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:09,687
It's not that, I was just looking for some steel locks. That's all.

477
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:13,128
All right then. Take care.

478
00:43:21,403 --> 00:43:23,826
That guy...

479
00:43:23,826 --> 00:43:27,743
Chadol... you came!

480
00:43:27,743 --> 00:43:29,992
I'm a guard from the Uigumbu.

481
00:43:29,992 --> 00:43:33,952
I was just doing my rounds in this part of town. 
 Did you have any other troubles?

482
00:43:33,952 --> 00:43:38,645
I see.

483
00:43:38,645 --> 00:43:41,929
All right then. Good day.

484
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:10,067
What?

485
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:12,921
Nothing, sir.

486
00:44:12,921 --> 00:44:14,633
Move away.

487
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:22,835
Hyung!

488
00:44:22,835 --> 00:44:25,982
What are you doing? Hurry up, let's go!

489
00:44:25,982 --> 00:44:27,873
I am sorry.

490
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,345
Let's go, hurry.

491
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,081
What? Do you have something to say?

492
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:36,813
No, what would he have to say to you?

493
00:44:36,813 --> 00:44:41,249
Sir, please go ahead. You must be so busy taking care of this country.

494
00:44:43,227 --> 00:44:48,710
Hey! The other day! You know me, right?

495
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:55,115
Ah, you're a shy one, aren't you?

496
00:44:55,115 --> 00:44:59,235
What is wrong with you? He's trying to do some good work.

497
00:44:59,235 --> 00:45:01,669
It's the guy.

498
00:45:01,669 --> 00:45:05,841
The guy? What guy?

499
00:45:05,841 --> 00:45:08,913
It's the guy who told about your sister to the authorities!

500
00:45:18,687 --> 00:45:20,441
What are you trying to do?

501
00:45:22,756 --> 00:45:24,666
Take it easy! Do you want to die?

502
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:26,962
Let me go!

503
00:45:38,116 --> 00:45:41,338
Well, strictly speaking, what wrong has he done?

504
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:45,983
He probably just told the authorities there was a runaway slave.

505
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:53,923
What? What is up with you?

506
00:45:53,923 --> 00:45:55,426
What is wrong with you?

507
00:45:55,426 --> 00:46:01,229
I don't care if you're some high placed official, I don't care if you're his grandfather! You still need the money.

508
00:46:01,229 --> 00:46:03,368
What?

509
00:46:03,368 --> 00:46:07,448
What? Hey! Let me go!

510
00:46:07,448 --> 00:46:09,137
What are you looking at?

511
00:46:09,137 --> 00:46:10,812
I'm going to kill you all!

512
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:15,373
Keep your eyes down! You low lives!

513
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:21,274
All right then. Another turn. But this time, let's bet something else other than money.

514
00:46:21,274 --> 00:46:25,778
All right then. Whatever you want!

515
00:46:32,035 --> 00:46:37,519
That guard, and that pathetic dude there, they're brothers.

516
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:39,064
What?

517
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:44,435
Then why is he just a guard? Isn't he a nobleman's son too?

518
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:48,887
His mother was not noble, she was some maid.

519
00:46:48,887 --> 00:46:53,249
I hear that guy over there with no manners is tormenting the guard.

520
00:46:55,332 --> 00:46:57,035
Is that so?

521
00:47:00,502 --> 00:47:02,400
A finger?

522
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,480
Why? Are you afraid, sir?

523
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,517
You...

524
00:47:08,517 --> 00:47:13,575
All right then, let's bet on it. Let's bet my finger.

525
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:27,040
Seven.

526
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,096
Eight.

527
00:47:31,521 --> 00:47:33,598
Done!

528
00:47:39,796 --> 00:47:40,906
I have a higher hand.

529
00:47:40,906 --> 00:47:43,464
Seize him!

530
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,025
You bastards! Do you think you'll be safe?

531
00:47:53,025 --> 00:47:56,090
No one is responsible for what happens during gambling.

532
00:47:57,555 --> 00:48:01,009
Isn't this the rule here, sir?

533
00:48:01,009 --> 00:48:07,328
Where are you going to tell about how you lost a finger while gambling?

534
00:48:07,328 --> 00:48:10,387
Let me go this once.

535
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:15,624
Don't be afraid sir. It will be over in a second. 
 You have to go by the rules!

536
00:48:15,624 --> 00:48:20,085
I'll bring you more money!

537
00:48:20,085 --> 00:48:23,998
Do you think money will cover for this?

538
00:48:26,328 --> 00:48:29,611
What are you doing?

539
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:36,894
It's just a game. There's no need to harm someone over a game.

540
00:48:36,894 --> 00:48:38,288
Who are you?

541
00:48:38,288 --> 00:48:46,207
Apparently you don't know me, but everyone knows Yong at the South Gate gambling tables!

542
00:48:48,684 --> 00:48:49,874
Oh, so you are Yong?

543
00:48:51,694 --> 00:48:53,179
I guess you have heard about me?

544
00:48:54,646 --> 00:48:57,520
Since you don't have time, why don't you deal with me?

545
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:06,355
If I win, you let this gentleman go. If I lose, take his finger, and my hand too.

546
00:49:06,355 --> 00:49:08,488
Yong!

547
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:09,420
Look at you.

548
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:15,366
Sure, I've heard you have some guts.

549
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:18,539
All right, let's see those guts of yours.

550
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,214
Let's go one round.

551
00:49:20,214 --> 00:49:23,147
I don't have much time, so let's make this quick, all right?

552
00:49:23,147 --> 00:49:25,492
All right, it's all in one game!

553
00:49:45,098 --> 00:49:49,981
Guess what number it is. It's only if you guess it you can be called the best in town.

554
00:50:13,216 --> 00:50:18,568
All right then, whose shall I take first?

555
00:50:18,568 --> 00:50:25,854
I guess that his precious finger will be worth more than your hand?

556
00:50:28,402 --> 00:50:29,484
No!

557
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:33,951
That's my knife! Who gave you the permission to use my knife?

558
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:36,168
There! Your knife looks much sharper.

559
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:37,569
You....

560
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:40,595
You rascal!

561
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:44,263
Sir, you're messing up with your style.

562
00:50:44,263 --> 00:50:48,582
You should keep calm in these situations especially. Don't be too upset. A deal is a deal.

563
00:50:50,118 --> 00:50:54,184
How dare you take your revenge now?

564
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:58,484
You broke my father's tooth.

565
00:51:00,885 --> 00:51:02,827
Wait.. wait...

566
00:51:02,827 --> 00:51:05,386
Fire, and the last number is seven.

567
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:18,385
Fire, and the last number is seven!

568
00:51:31,857 --> 00:51:36,416
How good are you to have guessed that?

569
00:51:37,356 --> 00:51:39,334
Should I tell you?

570
00:51:40,828 --> 00:51:42,926
 I'll put in my hand as well! 

571
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:56,378
This is delicious!

572
00:52:00,095 --> 00:52:05,209
But... you don't blame me at all?

573
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:07,537
I forgot about all that!

574
00:52:07,537 --> 00:52:10,571
A man shouldn't hold on to those things.

575
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:15,568
If you ever need anything or are in trouble, come to me.

576
00:52:15,568 --> 00:52:16,747
Yes.

577
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:21,122
May I then visit you to your house sometime?

578
00:52:21,122 --> 00:52:22,597
In my house?

579
00:52:22,749 --> 00:52:28,021
Hearing the rumors, you live in a palace, with 99 rooms!

580
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:30,906
My wish before dying is going to such a house!

581
00:52:30,906 --> 00:52:34,350
All right. Whatever. You are welcome any time.

582
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,760
Thank you.

583
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,030
Well, since we're on the subject, how about tomorrow?

584
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,149
Tomorow?

585
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:44,369
Tomorrow and the day after that I'm on emergency duty.

586
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:48,497
The old man of Jukbusa has been appointed as the new envoy to Chung

587
00:52:48,497 --> 00:52:52,550
so we're having a farewell party with the members of the Chunwoohwe at his place.

588
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:53,642
The Chunwoohwe?

589
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:57,184
It's a gathering between some noblemen.

590
00:52:57,184 --> 00:52:59,517
My father is a member you know.

591
00:52:59,517 --> 00:53:02,838
But why are you on emergency duty then?

592
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:08,267
It's that jerk of a burglar who's been going around these days, creating havoc.

593
00:53:08,267 --> 00:53:09,805
I have to be on guard.

594
00:53:09,805 --> 00:53:13,608
You're the one suffering because of that burglar.

595
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:15,118
That's what I mean!

596
00:53:15,722 --> 00:53:21,099
That old man already has three bodyguards. 
 Why does he want us on top of that?

597
00:53:21,099 --> 00:53:24,303
Is the Uigeumbu his personal guard or what?

598
00:53:24,642 --> 00:53:26,580
Three bodyguards?

599
00:53:28,378 --> 00:53:30,617
That old man,

600
00:53:30,617 --> 00:53:33,450
he knows how to handle a sword. Why doesn't he catch him himself if he's that worried?

601
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:34,720
The sword?

602
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:50,331
Still...Ja Dol... seeing his mother being pushed like that... he came to the rescue. You saw him, right?

603
00:53:50,331 --> 00:53:53,309
Those Castor Oil gang members were so put off by him.

604
00:53:53,309 --> 00:53:55,689
The Castor Oil gang?

605
00:53:57,787 --> 00:54:02,602
Yong hangs out with them apparently, doesn't he?

606
00:54:06,354 --> 00:54:08,236
The thing is...

607
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:12,747
Let me borrow your knife.

608
00:54:18,332 --> 00:54:21,048
Wow, this is really good.

609
00:54:21,048 --> 00:54:22,914
What is this Sir?

610
00:54:22,914 --> 00:54:25,313
This is sikhe made from the gray mullet.

611
00:54:25,313 --> 00:54:27,113
Ah, this must be your first time tasting this!

612
00:54:27,113 --> 00:54:31,767
And I thought that my mom's food was the best in the world!

613
00:54:31,767 --> 00:54:35,220
I don't know who made this, but this is amazing!

614
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,374
Okay. Should I order another one for you?

615
00:54:41,733 --> 00:54:42,921
Yes, Sir.

616
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,465
Another one of this.

617
00:54:54,568 --> 00:54:57,499
So many customers are looking for this dish.

618
00:54:57,499 --> 00:55:00,535
How come you're such a good cook?

619
00:55:01,405 --> 00:55:07,155
Not at all. This is just something my son used to like.

620
00:55:07,155 --> 00:55:09,285
Go and bring this to their room.

621
00:55:15,611 --> 00:55:17,358
Who is looking for me now?

622
00:55:20,068 --> 00:55:22,950
You brat! You're going to die today!

623
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:26,273
What the...?

624
00:55:27,311 --> 00:55:30,256
Hey, it's you, with the missing tooth!

625
00:55:34,124 --> 00:55:36,198
Go and cut my finger with that.

626
00:55:43,149 --> 00:55:46,794
I'll give you one of my fingers, so let my son go.

627
00:55:46,794 --> 00:55:47,946
Dani...

628
00:55:47,946 --> 00:55:50,305
What is this?

629
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:53,441
Here you are, the both of you, today.

630
00:55:53,441 --> 00:55:57,130
Hey, lady, what would I do with your finger?

631
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:00,392
So, should I give you my tooth? Will that be enough?

632
00:56:00,392 --> 00:56:02,921
I have many front teeth left, so you choose one, you jerk.

633
00:56:02,921 --> 00:56:07,883
I'll give you my hand if you want, so get rid of my son from your gang!

634
00:56:07,883 --> 00:56:09,615
Gosh, is that so?

635
00:56:09,615 --> 00:56:11,448
Then, try it for once.

636
00:56:11,448 --> 00:56:14,865
I don't know who your son is, I'll get rid of him once.

637
00:56:14,865 --> 00:56:16,816
Okay.

638
00:56:19,995 --> 00:56:23,858
No, no way! You can't!

639
00:56:23,858 --> 00:56:27,883
Take my hand instead.

640
00:56:27,883 --> 00:56:29,642
You dog!

641
00:56:29,642 --> 00:56:33,233
You pulled in an innocent young boy who only knew his home and school!

642
00:56:33,233 --> 00:56:34,963
You're going to make a lowlife out of him just like you!

643
00:56:34,963 --> 00:56:37,325
You rotten man!

644
00:56:37,774 --> 00:56:40,767
So who is that great son of yours?

645
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:44,088
Go, find your son!

646
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,166
If you just send away our Yong...

647
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:49,220
Yong?

648
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,678
I'll give you my heart if you want.

649
00:56:58,746 --> 00:57:04,571
Sir, I brought the sikhye. I'll come in.

650
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:13,374
Did they leave?

651
00:57:14,392 --> 00:57:16,936
No worries.

652
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:22,454
I think of him as my own little brother.

653
00:57:22,454 --> 00:57:27,579
He pleaded with me, so I let him in, but I won't let him become someone like me.

654
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:30,269
So, just wait and see.

655
00:57:30,269 --> 00:57:32,747
Can we believe you?

656
00:57:32,747 --> 00:57:34,318
Yes, sure.

657
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:37,885
Yong won't become bad.

658
00:57:42,517 --> 00:57:43,363
We trust you.

659
00:57:43,363 --> 00:57:45,488
Don't you worry.

660
00:57:45,673 --> 00:57:49,242
It must have hurt a little, before.

661
00:57:49,242 --> 00:57:53,660
Anyways, please take care of Yong.

662
00:57:58,461 --> 00:58:02,729
Did my stomach get upset because I had such good food all of a sudden?

663
00:58:11,812 --> 00:58:13,629
Yong.

664
00:58:14,521 --> 00:58:16,486
I'm going to take off now.

665
00:58:16,486 --> 00:58:17,785
The office is looking for me.

666
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:22,510
Of course. Without you there, nothing works!

667
00:58:23,238 --> 00:58:25,463
Shall we go then?

668
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,539
Take care.

669
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,089
This way.

670
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,972
This way, here.

671
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:51,816
Your majesty, why do you want to look away from Hopan's crime?

672
00:58:51,816 --> 00:58:54,878
This issue is not just about Hopan.

673
00:58:54,878 --> 00:58:59,106
This is an opportunity to know all of these corrupted bureaucrats and their crimes.

674
00:58:59,106 --> 00:59:02,209
But there was nothing I could do.

675
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:07,021
Your Majesty, why did we dethrone the last king?

676
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:11,099
While the nobility was spending away the country's money,

677
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:17,430
the last king, Kwanghae, was busy covering their crimes, leading the country to a state of destitute!

678
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:22,429
Your Majesty, why do you want to follow the mistakes of your predecessor?

679
00:59:23,385 --> 00:59:26,720
Do you also think that

680
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,053
Kwanghae was a better king than I am?

681
00:59:45,222 --> 00:59:48,916
Stay awake and guard this place!

682
01:00:04,648 --> 01:00:18,935


683
01:00:18,935 --> 01:00:20,652
