1
00:00:31,853 --> 00:00:32,973
Where is this?

2
00:00:34,843 --> 00:00:35,911
Where's my son?

3
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:38,146
Yong?

4
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:42,217
How dare you beat me!

5
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:44,920
That fella dared to beat my precious son

6
00:00:45,787 --> 00:00:47,455
What…is it?

7
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:51,393
Then I will forgive your father,if you'd hurry and bring the money here

8
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:53,662
It doesn't matter if he is beaten to death

9
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:55,964
If you cannot bring any money back

10
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,536
Your father will be cut...

11
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:34,202
Listen to me, those two dogs

12
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,539
Don't you feel that they may be brothers?

13
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:38,907
Brother?

14
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:45,380
Two dogs, because of a father in town,worried one another until one of them dieand blood runs into river

15
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,249
Wouldn't that be very funny?

16
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,986
Tonight I will show you that

17
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,990
Dog fighting is nothing comparing to that game

18
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,564
May I ask where are you taking me to?

19
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:22,717
Two of you should have a talk

20
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:26,755
The Captain hasn't known about this 
 I will take him away immediately

21
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:38,933
Dad

22
00:02:53,515 --> 00:03:03,091
That time, basically I dared not  acknowledge you

23
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,530
You have grown much older, Father

24
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,001
Was it painful when I hit you?

25
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:20,375
No, no problem. I'm used to that,

26
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:22,544
No problem at all

27
00:03:24,512 --> 00:03:27,215
That child, who is he?

28
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:29,353
Ah.. Yong

29
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:35,423
He is an adopted son I brought home quite by chance

30
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:40,328
After you left, It was that boy who filled the void of mental emptiness in our life.

31
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:49,104
Your mother…you must have missed her a lot?

32
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:55,477
As you have come here, please see her before leaving.

33
00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:58,146
No,

34
00:03:58,747 --> 00:03:59,914
I don't want to meet mother.

35
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:05,787
She told me that even if we meet, I'm not allowed to greet her

36
00:04:07,522 --> 00:04:10,158
I will comply with  that request

37
00:04:56,905 --> 00:05:00,041
  Mom...  Mom  

38
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,681
 I don't need quality food or clothes 

39
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,183
 I don't want to be a noble anymore 

40
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:10,952
 I just need to live together with you and father 

41
00:05:11,886 --> 00:05:12,787
 Who are you, Young Master? 

42
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:14,956
 Mom 

43
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:18,760
 I don't know who you are,Young Master 

44
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:22,330
 You have mistaken me for someone else. 

45
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,901
 Mom 

46
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:45,920
He just knows how to show off.

47
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,200
Hey, low-class fella!

48
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,500
Are you practicing now?

49
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,168
Everyone should mingle and get to know each other

50
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:03,071
Deokba, the champion of the last festival

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,500
He is your challenger in this festival

52
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:07,976
What's your name?

53
00:06:08,877 --> 00:06:11,012
Yong…Yong..

54
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,000
Hyung, are you kidding me?

55
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,100
Why should I fight against this low-class fella?

56
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,000
You stupid, haven't I said itmany times already?

57
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,500
Our fights are for money. It's not all about who wins or who loses! You have to put up a show for the crowd!

58
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:32,400
Give the people who bet a show! Make them 'earn' their bets!

59
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:36,237
Showing off your strength? Everyone knows how strong you are already.

60
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:38,773
If our customers stop coming, are you going to take responsibility?

61
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,242
Then pay me my share on time!

62
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,200
Wow! You grew up well...

63
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:45,980
I am gonna...

64
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,034
He is a monster, a monster. He is certainly not human.

65
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:08,536
It's alright

66
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,172
Dae Shik!

67
00:07:11,172 --> 00:07:15,343
Fighting doesn't only rely on strength, but also the brain

68
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:01,656
So you still want to leave another bruise on my neck, right?

69
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,296
Ok, I will give you a chance.

70
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:18,400
There is a fight gedou tonight, the winner will win 200 tales

71
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,300
If you bring me that money, I´ll beg our father so they wont hurt your adoptive dad.

72
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,700
But,

73
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,500
you must win.

74
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:42,397
I've already done what you ask me to do

75
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,165
Thank you

76
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,600
What is it?

77
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,800
My battle weapons.

78
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,900
Weapons?

79
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,600
You are all dead meat.

80
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:56,210
Eh ! What do you plan to do with that ?

81
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,100
Just watch. With this, I'm invincible!

82
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,400
Hey! Yong

83
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:15,763
Are you sure you can win with it?

84
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,998
Haiz, don't ruin my image

85
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:19,500
Don't worry, No matter who the challenger is, I'm not afraid

86
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:21,536
Heyyy

87
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,700
What?

88
00:09:29,077 --> 00:09:32,413
I kept thinking that you harmed me to the point that my bottom gets burnt

89
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:37,128
Look at the way she's talking

90
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,200
Ah, after taking that medicine, your feces were stained with blood, right ?

91
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,600
Thanks to you, my father got into the same predicament

92
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:48,896
Did you not say that the medicine were discard?

93
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:50,832
You should admit truthfully

94
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:53,701
Did you put dog and buffalo poop in it?

95
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:58,639
Why are you always talking about dog and buffalo poop?

96
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,812
If you are so curious, you should taste it yourself, here!

97
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:15,890
Father, please catch him!

98
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:20,728
Uncle!

99
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:22,430
Are you still safe and sound?

100
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,967
Are you gonna run away?

101
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:28,569
Coward!

102
00:10:29,437 --> 00:10:30,638
Uncle, what are you doing?

103
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:38,346
Hold him tight.

104
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:42,984
You can't! 
Don't do that! 
 Don't do that!

105
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:45,319
Dae Shik!

106
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:46,487
Wait, Dae Shik, what are you doing?

107
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:54,629
Left Parliament mandarin?

108
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,463
Yes

109
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:59,500
Opening the case from 13 years ago is a little too much...

110
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,635
Watch out for him!

111
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:01,803
Yes, my lord

112
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:09,610
I heard that, the boy you asked me to kill last time

113
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,114
He is still alive

114
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:14,329
What?

115
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:17,185
I'm certain that I killed him

116
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:22,623
Kill him

117
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:25,796
Yes, this time I won't miss again.

118
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:43,144
Na mo a mi da bu, Kuan Yin Bodhisattva

119
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:46,747
Please come and see.

120
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:48,249
A fake priest?

121
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:53,487
Those lifeless and ignorant people,do you want to enjoy the relief of being rescued to heavenly paradise?

122
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:54,655
Heavenly paradise?

123
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:56,857
Rescued?

124
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:17,978
Let's go inside and gamble!

125
00:12:19,313 --> 00:12:20,081
Alright.

126
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,552
Look!

127
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,100
What is happening inside?

128
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:33,461
We just need to place our money on only 1 person

129
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,966
Red seems to have the most chance to win, there's nothing inside

130
00:12:46,107 --> 00:12:52,546
Wait a minute, that guy in black looks really familiar

131
00:12:55,483 --> 00:13:00,254
That's right, he looks like that little white guy that doesn't know how to fight...

132
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,358
Very familiar..

133
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:20,174
Why did you pick that one?

134
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:24,478
You believe in me, right?

135
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,020
I have even more faith in this

136
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:50,404
Hey, is there any commotion at the Robbery-Catching Department?

137
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:53,941
Of course not, I have told my brothers to watch out for that place, please don't worry

138
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:57,511
The two leaders from that Department will even be here tonight

139
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:00,548
These guys, they are here to collect the money again

140
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:03,150
Wait until the match is over before handing them the envelopes

141
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,851
Yes

142
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:07,455
Young Master has finally arrived?

143
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,995
Where is that guy? 
 I have arranged to put him on the arena toward the end

144
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,299
Let's go inside!

145
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:20,034
Please come in

146
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,075
Hey, Young Master has arrived!

147
00:15:32,173 --> 00:15:41,482
Everyone, who braved the night to see our fighters. I sincerely thank you for that

148
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:52,492
Alright, it's my honor to introduce

149
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,362
the champion of last festival

150
00:15:55,963 --> 00:16:00,034
Hong…The Monster

151
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:19,253
Alright, from now on he will accept fighting challenges from 5 fighters.

152
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:24,458
Everyone, who do you place your money on?

153
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,764
Now, the fight officially starts!

154
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:52,953
Brother Shi Hoo has come out already?

155
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:56,691
This…is actually…

156
00:16:56,691 --> 00:16:57,258
Miss

157
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:17,611
Father, please chase after her

158
00:17:17,611 --> 00:17:21,515
It's late night now, the roads on the mountain are dangerous 
 If a tiger appears all of a sudden...

159
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,252
Miss!!

160
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,568
That guy is really a monster, a real monster!

161
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,783
Brother!

162
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:32,586
Let's go

163
00:18:34,955 --> 00:18:39,026
They are professional gambler, they will do any trick just to win

164
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:39,994
Unless...

165
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:42,496
Unless you win, you will lose your life

166
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:51,639
I understand your impatience to save that person, but doing this doesn't help either

167
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,778
I beg you, brother, please come home.

168
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:00,214
Miss!

169
00:19:01,282 --> 00:19:04,085
Young Master Shi Hoo is currently on Gedou arena

170
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:15,896
Insolence!

171
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:26,474
No, Miss, you cannot come into a fighter's room

172
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:29,944
It's not a place for you to visit

173
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:30,644
Move!

174
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:32,980
Both my two older brothers are inside

175
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,617
The Lord won't forgive you, Miss

176
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:39,754
So you should come home now, Miss.

177
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,023
You cannot go inside

178
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:50,765
Ok, the last match, let's come outside

179
00:20:05,546 --> 00:20:07,114
You have to overpower him beforehand

180
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:32,606
Yong! Don't be afraid!

181
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,408
You can win!

182
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:39,640
Bastard, you must die

183
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:19,413
Damn it, why is it not effective at all?

184
00:22:43,714 --> 00:22:49,053
Wait a minute, after drinking this medicine, did you and your father find blood in your feces?

185
00:22:49,053 --> 00:22:49,687
What?

186
00:22:49,687 --> 00:22:51,855
Please sell me this medicine, sell it to me

187
00:22:56,093 --> 00:22:59,463
I have bought food for you, do you want to have some?

188
00:23:47,578 --> 00:23:51,515
Aren't you going to stand up now?

189
00:23:51,949 --> 00:23:53,250
Damn it, Deokba!

190
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:34,158
You have worked hard

191
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,527
This is for the lost game

192
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:38,896
That bastard…

193
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:48,172
What is this? He needs to go to the restroom now?

194
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:52,242
Let's go inside!

195
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,112
The real match is starting now.

196
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:01,185
Such a bastard! His father's arm is going to cut off but he still comes here to gamble

197
00:25:01,185 --> 00:25:02,653
Father, it's not like that

198
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:03,020
If it's not like that, then what is it ?

199
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,755
Yong needs some money

200
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:06,790
Gamble..

201
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,526
He still can gamble at this moment?

202
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:12,496
Where's he?

203
00:25:13,697 --> 00:25:15,332
Brother Geon, show me the way now

204
00:25:20,471 --> 00:25:22,973
Today we have a surprising result

205
00:25:27,077 --> 00:25:30,881
And also today, we will have a new fighter

206
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:33,984
How could that be possible? That doesn't make sense at all!

207
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:35,486
Don't  be noisy!

208
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:40,157
The next match will not be just about fighting until the opponent gives up,

209
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:47,431
but until the last grain of sand drops.

210
00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:50,100
If not, both of you will be losers.

211
00:25:51,502 --> 00:25:53,137
How can you do such unreasonable thing?

212
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:55,038
Unreasonable thing can happen here.

213
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:01,812
Let's start the challenge! 
 Let's start the challenge!

214
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:08,285
Alright, with the cheers and encouragements from everyone. The new star today, this winner

215
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,100
whoever want to challenge this black badge guy, please come forward.

216
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,769
Isn't there any challenger?

217
00:26:26,603 --> 00:26:32,576
I will count to three, If no one challenges him, all the money gambled today will belong to

218
00:26:32,976 --> 00:26:34,378
this black-masked guy.

219
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:37,915
Alright!

220
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:39,883
One..

221
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:41,885
Two..

222
00:26:41,885 --> 00:26:42,653
Wait a minute!

223
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:15,152
Come forward!

224
00:27:15,852 --> 00:27:16,720
Looks like you are not much of a challenger

225
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:08,125
Surrender! Just surrender!

226
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:13,196
Surrender! Just surrender!

227
00:30:20,837 --> 00:30:24,641
How's it? Isn't it more interesting than dog fighting?

228
00:30:26,845 --> 00:30:30,547
But, if either one of them wins, do we have to release that old man?

229
00:30:32,816 --> 00:30:34,985
You think I would set him free that easily?

230
00:30:38,155 --> 00:30:42,826
Young Master! There is…outside...

231
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:50,267
Why are you here, sister?

232
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,543
You are not here because of Shi Hoo, are you?

233
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,100
And why is my sibling here?

234
00:31:03,146 --> 00:31:05,549
When will you stop torturing brother Shi Hoo?

235
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:07,684
Only related by half-blood but you can be this close to him?

236
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,055
You should not come inside

237
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:13,989
Looking at him will just hurt you more

238
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,392
Brother!

239
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:17,627
Brother!

240
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,865
I already told you that you cannot come inside

241
00:31:21,865 --> 00:31:24,201
We are related to the fighters

242
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:25,535
Please let us come inside

243
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:28,505
Are you deaf?

244
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:30,574
Once the game has started, no one will be allowed to come inside.

245
00:31:30,574 --> 00:31:32,576
Why aren't you leaving now?

246
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,946
Why can't family members come inside? 
 Why?

247
00:31:37,247 --> 00:31:38,815
Hey, old woman!

248
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:41,017
Hey!

249
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,595
My son

250
00:31:52,796 --> 00:31:53,597
Oh! my son

251
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:56,836
My son…why are you here?

252
00:31:58,011 --> 00:31:59,002
My son…why are you here?

253
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:30,066
Have you seen once and for all?

254
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:34,037
You hoped your son would become a noble person

255
00:32:35,105 --> 00:32:39,676
But now, he is living like this,have you seen for yourself?

256
00:32:41,411 --> 00:32:45,715
Stop hitting!

257
00:32:47,017 --> 00:32:47,984
Please stop hitting!

258
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:49,753
Please stop hitting!

259
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:51,755
Please stop!

260
00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:53,023
Mom...

261
00:32:56,326 --> 00:32:57,460
Yong!

262
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:11,107
It cannot be like this, stop hitting please. 
 I beg you to stop, please 
 Why are you… 
 Don't fight anymore!

263
00:33:11,107 --> 00:33:12,943
Go outside!

264
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:55,782
Let's talk about this.

265
00:33:58,555 --> 00:33:59,722
Let me go!

266
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:04,485
Save me please! Please!

267
00:34:04,485 --> 00:34:08,771
Please! Save me! Please!

268
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,629
- Give up 
  - Don't want to

269
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:24,520
- Admit your defeat 
  - Never

270
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:28,757
I will kill you then

271
00:34:28,757 --> 00:34:33,395
Then kill me!

272
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:37,164
Just surrender!

273
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,678
No! No I can't!

274
00:34:43,678 --> 00:34:48,340
My father's hand will be chopped off!

275
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,511
What?

276
00:35:01,681 --> 00:35:03,208
You...

277
00:35:04,527 --> 00:35:07,663
You are...Yong?

278
00:35:11,463 --> 00:35:14,103
Do you know me?

279
00:35:50,072 --> 00:35:53,242
Don't stay here! Go now!

280
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:06,789
Here. Now beat it.

281
00:36:17,422 --> 00:36:18,800
Excuse me.

282
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:31,514
Yong

283
00:36:31,514 --> 00:36:34,629
That young master left as soon as the match was over

284
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:37,486
-He left? Without the money? 
  -Yes!

285
00:36:39,555 --> 00:36:41,998
I think better go now.

286
00:37:02,378 --> 00:37:03,920
Big brother

287
00:37:09,152 --> 00:37:11,854
Are you ok?

288
00:37:48,357 --> 00:37:49,692
Young Master.

289
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:57,900
How could the son of a nobleman... 
 how could you..

290
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,611
Oh man! That was close!

291
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:52,688
What's this?

292
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,757
You are lucky

293
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,125
You...

294
00:39:09,872 --> 00:39:11,273
Wait!

295
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:17,814
It was my mistake. I will take care of it.

296
00:40:56,312 --> 00:40:58,047
Sh*t

297
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:27,426
Look at you now!

298
00:41:27,844 --> 00:41:30,212
You think you're great?

299
00:41:30,212 --> 00:41:31,884
You're dead meat now!

300
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:39,020
Tell me now why you wanted to kill me

301
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:43,559
Oh! You want me to cut this rope?

302
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:44,645
Wait!

303
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,630
Because you might be Lee Won Ho's son!

304
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,328
I... again...

305
00:41:50,328 --> 00:41:53,169
I'm not his son! I'm not his son!

306
00:41:53,169 --> 00:41:55,071
Are you really deaf?

307
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:58,407
You know, I just follow orders!

308
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:01,243
Stop your act now!

309
00:42:01,243 --> 00:42:05,308
I bet you just peed in your pants now! Right?

310
00:42:08,512 --> 00:42:09,819
Hold my hand!

311
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:13,155
I just tried to kill you! Why are you helping me?

312
00:42:14,223 --> 00:42:17,359
Quickly.. Just take my hand!

313
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,963
If you save me, I will still kill you!

314
00:42:22,031 --> 00:42:24,999
Fine! Then just die!

315
00:42:59,335 --> 00:43:00,903
I'm gonna die

316
00:43:09,945 --> 00:43:11,213
My money !

317
00:43:12,181 --> 00:43:16,752
Where's my money? Where it is?

318
00:43:21,824 --> 00:43:25,177
You're right

319
00:43:25,177 --> 00:43:28,998
If you're really Geom, you wouldn't have saved me.

320
00:43:28,998 --> 00:43:32,361
Well, you're making me to regret it now!

321
00:43:34,003 --> 00:43:35,940
Find my money!

322
00:43:41,177 --> 00:43:42,941
It's not because you saved me..

323
00:43:44,259 --> 00:43:47,116
It's only because you're not Geom

324
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:51,587
If you're going to let me live, then be nice about it!

325
00:43:53,277 --> 00:43:55,224
Cramping my style

326
00:43:57,056 --> 00:44:00,991
Anyway, where's my money?

327
00:44:10,483 --> 00:44:13,238
- He's dead! Let's go 
 - Yes

328
00:44:30,849 --> 00:44:35,431
Please! Let me go!

329
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:37,733
My lord!

330
00:44:41,347 --> 00:44:44,116
Yong!!

331
00:44:45,918 --> 00:44:49,822
Young master! Young master!

332
00:44:50,523 --> 00:44:53,159
Young master! Please let me go!

333
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:55,728
Please let me go!

334
00:44:56,395 --> 00:44:58,197
Young master!

335
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:10,810
Hands off! I won this money!

336
00:45:15,522 --> 00:45:16,615
Are you pouting?

337
00:45:17,383 --> 00:45:18,050
Alright!

338
00:45:18,484 --> 00:45:20,186
I will buy you a hair ribbon!

339
00:45:22,688 --> 00:45:23,656
She's a girl after all.

340
00:45:40,706 --> 00:45:41,207
Money!

341
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:48,280
Hey you! I saw it first!

342
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,515
Finder's keeper!

343
00:45:49,882 --> 00:45:50,883
Ok fine!

344
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:52,918
Let's split it then!

345
00:45:53,285 --> 00:45:54,353
Oh! no way!

346
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:09,768
You little brat!

347
00:46:30,856 --> 00:46:34,293
Another drunk man is lying there

348
00:46:42,483 --> 00:46:44,303
Hey you! Move over!

349
00:46:46,505 --> 00:46:48,941
He must have been robbed!

350
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:29,315
My money! Where's my money?

351
00:47:30,757 --> 00:47:31,617
Where is it?

352
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:35,154
Have you seen my money?

353
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:36,955
No we don't

354
00:47:38,457 --> 00:47:39,959
I can't lose that money

355
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:44,129
My money...

356
00:47:49,356 --> 00:47:50,235
You jerk!

357
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:52,871
We saved your life but you still don't say thanks?

358
00:47:53,472 --> 00:47:58,143
Ohh! Kids these days! 
 You're just like my daughter!

359
00:48:05,217 --> 00:48:08,354
I killed him. But he wasn't Lee Won Ho's son.

360
00:48:14,293 --> 00:48:15,527
Good job!

361
00:48:15,928 --> 00:48:17,229
But he was innocent..

362
00:48:23,802 --> 00:48:26,372
Have you forgotten what I told you?

363
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:29,608
Destruction. Be ready to kill.

364
00:48:33,212 --> 00:48:34,513
Do not let sympathy guide you..

365
00:48:35,881 --> 00:48:39,651
We gave up our heart to our lord long ago

366
00:48:41,253 --> 00:48:42,221
Yes I will always remember that

367
00:48:42,955 --> 00:48:45,157
293..

368
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:49,461
Man! That jerk is throwing me off!

369
00:48:49,461 --> 00:48:50,863
Go tell him to shut up!

370
00:48:53,532 --> 00:48:55,768
He might jump off a cliff

371
00:48:56,869 --> 00:48:58,637
You really think so?

372
00:49:04,977 --> 00:49:06,111
Dad

373
00:49:07,546 --> 00:49:10,816
Yes. I raised you to be righteous!

374
00:49:11,784 --> 00:49:13,185
People don't kill themselves just like that!

375
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:17,689
Of course!

376
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:20,092
I raised you to be strong!

377
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:39,244
Dad ~

378
00:49:39,244 --> 00:49:40,479
Yong

379
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:48,053
Dad! 
 Dad!

380
00:49:51,323 --> 00:49:54,593
By chance.. it is your feet?

381
00:49:55,027 --> 00:49:56,195
Is these real?

382
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:00,466
Dad

383
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:03,569
Waittt!

384
00:50:12,144 --> 00:50:13,312
Let's give him a break!

385
00:50:16,315 --> 00:50:17,082
Oh no!

386
00:50:17,082 --> 00:50:19,318
Do you know what he did to me, dad?

387
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:21,453
I do. It's ok!

388
00:50:23,355 --> 00:50:26,925
Shi Wan is upset so I can't just let it go

389
00:50:29,261 --> 00:50:34,933
And my position requires that I enlighten up the masses

390
00:50:42,508 --> 00:50:43,442
..ok!

391
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:46,111
No!

392
00:50:46,979 --> 00:50:48,714
I want to chop off his hands!

393
00:50:49,314 --> 00:50:50,349
Listen, Shi Wan!

394
00:50:51,683 --> 00:50:54,119
I will let you do it yourself

395
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:01,293
If you insist, father.

396
00:51:10,837 --> 00:51:12,671
What are you doing?

397
00:51:12,671 --> 00:51:14,706
Common! Open your mouth!

398
00:51:15,641 --> 00:51:17,342
Young master! No! Young master!

399
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:25,884
This child!

400
00:51:27,386 --> 00:51:29,388
My good looks have been ruined!

401
00:51:29,788 --> 00:51:32,357
I've depended on my good looks all my life too

402
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,793
Geez! This child!

403
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:37,362
Father!

404
00:51:37,362 --> 00:51:39,731
Wait! What happened to your face?

405
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:43,468
You fought again? Who did this to you?

406
00:51:43,468 --> 00:51:48,540
Who the heck is he this time? 
 Let's go! I'll beat the crap out of him!

407
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:51,510
Stop that!

408
00:51:51,944 --> 00:51:52,911
Let's go home

409
00:52:07,059 --> 00:52:08,527
Who the heck..

410
00:52:11,074 --> 00:52:11,897
Eun Chae!

411
00:52:12,364 --> 00:52:13,365
Eun Chae!

412
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:18,570
What are these delinquencies?

413
00:52:19,238 --> 00:52:21,940
Young mistress Eun Chae told us to hire them

414
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,308
She said that?

415
00:52:24,676 --> 00:52:27,613
We are building the fanciest inn in Joseon

416
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,082
but she hired these unsightly men?

417
00:52:31,183 --> 00:52:32,184
Get rid of them now

418
00:52:32,184 --> 00:52:34,386
Get them out of here!

419
00:52:34,386 --> 00:52:39,758
But they have been so grateful to her.. 
 They even work day and night!

420
00:52:39,758 --> 00:52:42,327
Oh really? But why are they lying around?

421
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:45,230
Young mistress told us to stop the construction for a while

422
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,099
You! Stop making excuses!

423
00:52:49,368 --> 00:52:53,438
You listen to her but you ignore my words? You punk!

424
00:52:54,439 --> 00:52:55,274
Wait! I can't let them stay!

425
00:52:55,574 --> 00:52:57,776
You! Get out of here!

426
00:52:57,776 --> 00:52:58,644
Father!

427
00:53:01,747 --> 00:53:03,815
Oh! Eun Chae came back already

428
00:53:06,752 --> 00:53:09,121
Where have you been?

429
00:53:09,121 --> 00:53:10,689
So.. what happened?

430
00:53:13,225 --> 00:53:14,459
Uhmm.. well..

431
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,295
His hands are saved

432
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:22,300
Thank you very much

433
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,170
I'm sure Shi Hoo will take you as well

434
00:53:26,738 --> 00:53:29,207
You have such love for this half-brother of yours

435
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:31,343
He is your son too, dad.

436
00:53:32,444 --> 00:53:36,948
Fine. Then, I will leave this project in your hands. 
 Make sure it will be finished on time.

437
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:43,388
Oh right! Your cousin was whining so much!

438
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:45,257
So I gave her one of my houses

439
00:53:45,257 --> 00:53:49,361
But it's already old so find a carpenter to fix the damages

440
00:53:49,795 --> 00:53:50,629
Yes

441
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:52,364
Be good to young master as well!

442
00:54:10,315 --> 00:54:11,049
No it's ok..

443
00:54:12,651 --> 00:54:14,052
Oh my!

444
00:54:14,052 --> 00:54:15,887
Would you like a massage?

445
00:54:15,887 --> 00:54:16,555
I said I'm fine

446
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:18,290
Geez..

447
00:54:18,824 --> 00:54:23,128
Then, I will just leave it here. 
 Be sure to put this on

448
00:54:24,396 --> 00:54:27,165
Swe Dol is doing fine. Don't worry.

449
00:54:27,903 --> 00:54:31,770
You really shouldn't have fought with Yong..
 Young mistress Eun Chae already took care of it

450
00:54:33,705 --> 00:54:38,677
She said, if Swe Dol's hands were chopped off..
 she wouldn't work in the inn or bookkeeping

451
00:54:39,411 --> 00:54:42,447
She is really something

452
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:43,515
Eun Chae did that?

453
00:54:52,357 --> 00:54:54,159
So the words have spread around?

454
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:57,362
That Lord Byun's son is fighting in a wagered matches

455
00:54:59,598 --> 00:55:02,934
Shi Wan certainly wouldn't do something so lowly

456
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:07,205
But some scoundrel is bent on disgracing the family!

457
00:55:50,336 --> 00:55:51,504
Geez!

458
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,072
This hurts!

459
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,841
What's going on?

460
00:55:56,876 --> 00:56:01,313
I want to tell you about your father's wrongful death

461
00:56:14,811 --> 00:56:17,897
My Lord, that young man is here to see you.

462
00:56:25,605 --> 00:56:27,106
Uhm..

463
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,490
Do you recognize it?

464
00:56:33,112 --> 00:56:34,947
Who am I?

465
00:56:36,196 --> 00:56:41,353
I don't remember my childhood.. 
 but I keep on seeing strange images.

466
00:56:41,353 --> 00:56:44,211
Who am I?

467
00:56:44,211 --> 00:56:47,059
Your name is Lee Geom

468
00:56:47,827 --> 00:56:51,473
Your father was murdered

469
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:55,534
I just recently found out this too

470
00:56:55,534 --> 00:56:58,504
Murdered? By whom?

471
00:56:58,504 --> 00:57:01,874
By someone who betrayed him..

472
00:57:03,243 --> 00:57:06,145
They were so close

473
00:57:07,351 --> 00:57:11,250
-All of us were actually close 
 -My Lord, someone got in!

474
00:57:14,053 --> 00:57:17,143
-Hey! What are you doing? 
 -Get out of my way!

475
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:20,693
Shim Gi Won, you are hereby declared a traitor by a royal decree.

476
00:57:27,467 --> 00:57:30,203
You are now officially declared as a traitor!

477
00:57:30,203 --> 00:57:38,678
You scoundrels! I have not plotted treason! 
 I will not leave this house! Show me the accuser!

478
00:57:40,513 --> 00:57:43,549
Hey stop! What's going on?

479
00:57:45,151 --> 00:57:47,420
How dare you defy the royal decree!

480
00:58:55,321 --> 00:58:58,625
I told myself that I will never forget..

481
00:59:02,162 --> 00:59:06,766
Yet it took me 13 years to come back here!

482
00:59:06,766 --> 00:59:08,735
Dad

483
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:53,780
Aunt, here it is.

484
01:00:11,331 --> 01:00:14,667
Your father is too much!

485
01:00:14,667 --> 01:00:21,040
I'll accept it then, since I have nowhere to go. 
 But to give a house where a traitor was killed..

486
01:00:22,409 --> 01:00:25,845
Let's take a look

487
01:01:25,571 --> 01:01:28,241
All ruined

488
01:01:28,909 --> 01:01:31,644
My good looks is ruined

489
01:01:36,315 --> 01:01:40,153
I will never get any love from my wife at this state

490
01:02:05,612 --> 01:02:10,316
You jerk! You never study! All you do is to fight!

491
01:02:10,316 --> 01:02:12,585
Your father is in that shape but you still come home now!

492
01:02:12,585 --> 01:02:15,122
Mother, I'm sorry

493
01:02:15,122 --> 01:02:20,560
Sorry for what? Do you know what have you done?

494
01:02:23,529 --> 01:02:25,798
That's enough! Stop now

495
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:30,536
Why are you still here? Go.

496
01:02:57,263 --> 01:02:59,774
Dad is asking where you are. Let's go home.

497
01:03:02,736 --> 01:03:07,240
That's so sweet! Trying to save your adoptive father's hand.

498
01:03:09,496 --> 01:03:10,798
How does it feel?

499
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:14,781
Beating your own brother to death?

500
01:03:14,781 --> 01:03:16,727
Why does it matter to you?

501
01:03:17,102 --> 01:03:19,485
Thanks to you! I enjoyed myself!

502
01:03:20,598 --> 01:03:24,303
Though I was a bit disappointed at the end

503
01:03:24,657 --> 01:03:28,628
You're a bigger disappointment, you know?

504
01:03:28,979 --> 01:03:29,884
What ?

505
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:35,034
That guy was taken in by my mother and adoptive father

506
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,756
What do you mean?

507
01:03:37,756 --> 01:03:40,206
He and I don't even share a drop of blood

508
01:03:42,709 --> 01:03:46,980
Let's go. I will wait for you.

509
01:04:05,498 --> 01:04:08,134
Get out! GET OUT!

510
01:04:16,976 --> 01:04:23,582
He's not yet well. Don't be harsh on him. 
 Don't you feel bad for him?

511
01:04:25,077 --> 01:04:29,288
You're so lucky to have two devoted sons.

512
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:32,134
What do you mean?

513
01:05:20,473 --> 01:05:22,208
Father

514
01:05:24,277 --> 01:05:25,945
Mother

515
01:05:26,554 --> 01:05:40,465


516
01:05:40,465 --> 01:05:42,100
