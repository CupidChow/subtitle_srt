1
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,750
Who dares to destroy my image?

2
00:00:32,794 --> 00:00:34,494
Is this place a school?

3
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:35,607
I want to buy this for you

4
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:39,010
But rumor has it Lord Shim Ki Yoon met that hunter

5
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,110
Just kill him now to and don't leave any traces behind

6
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,150
I really didn't want to come here

7
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,050
But you...

8
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,550
I have already warned you not to appear in front of me

9
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:13,647
But this boy dares to confront me

10
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,850
Pathetic!

11
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,350
He seems to be dead!

12
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:37,867
Episode 3

13
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:52,006
Master, please don't whip me too hard

14
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:54,740
I didn't commit a  serious crime

15
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,950
Plus, you have  whipped me several times already!

16
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,750
Please, don't use all your strength, Master, have mercy on me!

17
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,750
Lower your voice

18
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,250
This lowlife!

19
00:02:04,227 --> 00:02:06,542
You were wrong and still dare to raise your voice?

20
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:07,348
What crime did he commit?

21
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:09,094
That is...

22
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,750
After he got drunk, he harassed the ladies on the street

23
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,750
What a blockhead, whip him harshly for me, Quickly!

24
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,217
Master!

25
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:24,512
Master!

26
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:52,302
This guy is really...

27
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,882
You are such a bastard...

28
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,350
Why can't you whipped me gently?

29
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,750
I'm ok, I was bless with an iron plate for a butt!

30
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:12,758
So don't worry about me

31
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:15,349
I'm too embarrassed to see you

32
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:18,210
Whenever I drank a little...

33
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,759
I immediately become a dog

34
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,053
Dog... wang wang (dog barking)

35
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,350
From now on, you should quit drinking

36
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,550
You would lose your reputation if your students see you drink

37
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,750
Speaking of which, those students

38
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,750
perhaps knew Yong isn't of royal birth

39
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,950
If their parents knew the truth, my head would be rolling.

40
00:03:42,952 --> 00:03:44,307
Oh, my butt

41
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,552
My butt hurts

42
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:48,152
Is it really painful?

43
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:51,966
My butt was whipped instead of yours

44
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,911
Do you need me for anything else?

45
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,650
What is this?

46
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,150
When we went up to the mountain for hawk hunting, I discovered this.

47
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,150
I heard it was the trap the hunters use to catch the animals

48
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,950
But if some people are not careful, they can fall into the trap

49
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,950
What are you doing still?

50
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,050
Let him off quickly

51
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,150
What is he doing that he's not home at this time?

52
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,250
Really..

53
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,050
What is it?

54
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,450
Quickly take off your pants

55
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,450
My pants..

56
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,650
Quickly!

57
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:03,349
All right

58
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,474
Be gentle okay?

59
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:20,871
I've already lost a layer of my skin

60
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:26,350
You were whipped this hard, so what crime did you commit out there?

61
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,050
Where is he anyways?

62
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,850
What is he doing?

63
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,750
I'm sure he must be going to the brothel again

64
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:36,404
If not, he must be gambling

65
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:40,677
The sky is so gloomy, may be it's about to snow

66
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,650
I have to go out and look for him

67
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,550
No matter how diligent you are,

68
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,150
Don't hope that he will be a good person

69
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,750
Stop dreaming!

70
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,150
Don't be like that, can you treat him a little bit better?

71
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,550
Can't you see how miserable he is?

72
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,850
Later on, when your butt's whipped to shreds again, don't blame others

73
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,850
Hey, it has been a long time since we last visited a brothel

74
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,750
Let's go there to relax

75
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,850
Would that be okay though?

76
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,150
Young Masters

77
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,650
My Yong...

78
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,250
Oh, our Young Master Yong is still at school?

79
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,150
Isn't he out yet?

80
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,091
Yong?...

81
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,750
He left a long time ago

82
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,950
What?

83
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,950
This boy...

84
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,350
Our Young Master Yong is not perfect

85
00:06:43,378 --> 00:06:45,944
But I beg you young masters, please be nice to him

86
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,950
Why is there something dirty on your fine shirt?

87
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,550
Wow, the material is so soft

88
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,350
Step aside!

89
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,150
let's go

90
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,750
You are such an undisciplined bastard, I hope you stumble and fall while walking

91
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,750
Why doesn't he focus on studying, and instead fool around all day?

92
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,050
Really...

93
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,550
Is anyone there?

94
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:37,388
Is anyone up there?

95
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,450
Father!

96
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,750
It crimps my style.

97
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:55,905
Okay

98
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,450
This leather jacket is very expensive

99
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,950
We have to succeed this time

100
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,550
Success!

101
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,650
Heung Seng

102
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:39,039
Is Dae Shik here too?

103
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,550
Did Yong come here?

104
00:10:42,612 --> 00:10:45,223
He hasn't stopped by, what's wrong?

105
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,350
I looked for him all over the market, but he was no where to be found

106
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,450
Who are you?

107
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,350
Are you Geom,  Lee Won Ho's eldest son?

108
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,250
What?

109
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,550
No, you mistook me for someone else.

110
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:38,552
Hang on, don't move

111
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:40,289
The ice patch over there is extremely thin

112
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:43,894
You could easily fall through if you just slightly exerting your strength

113
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:46,677
Do not move

114
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:53,256
What are you doing? What the heck?

115
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,450
Answer me honestly

116
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:02,236
Are you Geom?

117
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,450
You're driving me crazy!

118
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,150
I'm Yong!

119
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,845
Please save me

120
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,450
If you are Geom, at least I won't kill you!

121
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,750
That's right, I'm really Geom.

122
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,150
Seriously?

123
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,550
Yes

124
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,050
But you said you won't kill Geom, right?

125
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:31,074
Or were you going to kill him?

126
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,750
Ah, I'm so confused

127
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,050
Regardless of whether you are Geom or not, I don't care

128
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,850
No! Please don't!

129
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,788
Please spare my life

130
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,750
I didn't see him all day at the casino

131
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,850
That means something has happened to him

132
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,650
Why? I didn't say anything wrong

133
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,050
Wait a minute!

134
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:34,710
Yong?

135
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,450
He went home a long time ago

136
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,050
What's this dirty smudge on your fine shirt?

137
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,894
You think you know where he is?

138
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,050
Geom!

139
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,950
You have to stay alive

140
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,150
Answer me, say you will live on

141
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,052
What? what?

142
00:15:46,052 --> 00:15:47,572
The palanquin has arrived

143
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,865
My fair lady, I have to go

144
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,021
This scoundrel

145
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:56,146
Go back home first.

146
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,168
My darling, please come back next time

147
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:04,583
All right, off I go

148
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,650
Have you arrived?

149
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,850
What is this place?

150
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,150
Who are you? Do you want money? Money

151
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,306
Money?

152
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,950
Where is Yongi?

153
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,950
What are you talking about?

154
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:14,338
Bastard, the servants at Sadian already confessed about it.

155
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:18,291
They said that after you bastards dragged my Yong outside, he was nowhere to be seen.

156
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,450
What have you done to him? What's happened to my son?

157
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,650
The house frame is now done, Miss

158
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,650
We plan to build the ceiling with Samnan wood, Miss

159
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,250
Isn't Samnan wood really weak in supporting?

160
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,850
Please change into Chun Yang wood.

161
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,850
But if we use the Chun Yang wood,  the expense would be too high so the Lord said...

162
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,850
There will be many people coming to visit and rest

163
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,650
Safety is the most important factor.

164
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,550
I will talk to my father

165
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,750
Yes, Miss

166
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:19,326
It seems like there will be a big snow storm today,  please tell everyone to take a break now

167
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,950
Yes, Miss

168
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,950
Hey everyone, let's stop and come down!

169
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,450
Yeah, we will, let's take a break!

170
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,650
She is such a noble Lady

171
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,450
Would she be nice and genteel in the bed like that?

172
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,950
The more lady-like she is, the more lovely she becomes.

173
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,550
Do you want me to cut off your dirty mouth?

174
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:47,031
Please spare my life!

175
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:48,902
You are such an ungrateful wretch

176
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:50,636
It was she who saved you, the dying beggars

177
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,450
and gave you a job.

178
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,250
Don't ever come back here!

179
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,450
If I see you again, it would not be just your mouth

180
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,850
but even "your precious" I would cut!

181
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:04,140
Let's go

182
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,750
Please stop!

183
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,050
What happened, Miss?

184
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,250
Please put me down

185
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,450
Yes

186
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,250
You can take the ride

187
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,850
What, Miss?

188
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,250
Just come inside for a while to warm up.

189
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,029
What? I'm actually not afraid of cold, Miss

190
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,550
This type of cold is nothing for me, Miss

191
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,950
You are frozen!

192
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:21,250
We are both women, how can I enjoy the warmth alone?

193
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,550
It's not like that, I'm just a maid and I can't..

194
00:20:26,497 --> 00:20:33,339
Frankly, I am fascinated by this white scene of snow

195
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:36,465
I want to walk alone on a road full of snow

196
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,750
Can you please give me a chance to?

197
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,350
Miss!

198
00:21:28,763 --> 00:21:29,894
Shoot her!

199
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,850
She had contemplated to steal Father's ink stab

200
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,150
A thief should be punished

201
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,950
I really don't know about this

202
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:45,503
What? Are you pitying her?

203
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:49,450
Is it because your blood is just as condemning as hers?

204
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,350
What are you brothers doing?

205
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,250
Let me go

206
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,750
I will tell Father about this

207
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,350
Let me go

208
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,250
What are you hesitant about? Hurry up and shoot her!

209
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,450
If you agree to shoot, I will accept you as my younger brother.

210
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,250
That hurts!

211
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,150
Please stop crying!

212
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,850
I heard that if you put a piece of beef on it

213
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,950
the swollen wound will disappear quickly

214
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,950
So I've stolen and brought it here

215
00:23:13,897 --> 00:23:16,485
Mother has been very unreasonable

216
00:23:16,485 --> 00:23:19,258
The one to be punished should have been Shi Wan brother

217
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:24,201
Do you think that this house is very unfamiliar and hard to live in?

218
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:26,402
Please don't be discouraged

219
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,250
I will always stand by your side, brother.

220
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,450
Even in this stormy weather, where have you been?

221
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,950
Why didn't you come out and pick me up?

222
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,350
I have to go home at night, aren't you worried at all?

223
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:06,150
Then you shouldn't hang out at midnight again

224
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,050
Why does a noble lady hang out this late?

225
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,650
I went to check on the inn's building progress

226
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,050
since Father entrusted the work to me...

227
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,750
A girl like you should obediently stay at home

228
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,850
It's very cold outside, please hurry up and come inside to rest.

229
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,850
Yes, Mother.

230
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,250
Is Shi Wan still not home yet?

231
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,750
Go and find him immediately!

232
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,650
I heard that you have registered to take the military exam

233
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,950
A stepson becomes a military mandarin

234
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,450
Passing the exam is nothing bad

235
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,950
But remember to use your own strength and ability

236
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:06,050
Don't ever dream of counting on the family's prestige to pass it

237
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,850
Young master had come home earlier

238
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,050
Or maybe...

239
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,850
Never mind...

240
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,050
Actually, at daytime

241
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:45,102
Yong!

242
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:47,443
If you play trick again, you won't be safe

243
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,250
Where is he?

244
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:51,260
Yong!

245
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,550
Uncle, this way

246
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,850
It's too dark for me to see what's what

247
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:02,593
What did you say, bastard?

248
00:27:02,593 --> 00:27:03,729
Uncle!

249
00:27:03,729 --> 00:27:05,282
Uncle, please don't do this!

250
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,650
Are you still human?

251
00:27:08,571 --> 00:27:12,776
If something bad happened to my son, I will bury you alive!

252
00:27:12,776 --> 00:27:15,398
Where did you leave my son?

253
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:17,197
Where? Where?!

254
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:18,562
Where's the burial site?

255
00:27:18,562 --> 00:27:20,212
Over there

256
00:27:20,212 --> 00:27:21,625
It is over there

257
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:22,720
Yong

258
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,414
Yong! Yong!

259
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,750
Bastard, you dare to fool around with me?

260
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:37,039
Clearly! He was clearly there..!

261
00:27:37,932 --> 00:27:39,606
What?

262
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:44,389
Yong!

263
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,850
You bastard!

264
00:28:03,134 --> 00:28:04,852
Where did you bury my precious son?

265
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:05,882
Uncle!

266
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:07,212
Please calm down, Uncle!

267
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:10,092
I will give you money

268
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:12,911
No matter how much you want, I will hand it over, please...

269
00:28:12,911 --> 00:28:13,684
Money?

270
00:28:13,684 --> 00:28:15,715
You damn bastard, listen to yourself!

271
00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:16,477
Money?

272
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:20,478
Stand up, come here quickly!

273
00:28:20,478 --> 00:28:22,195
You damn bastard dare to talk like this

274
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:24,446
Come here!

275
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:28,497
Bastard!

276
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:46,416
T..that brat!

277
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:07,198
You two are so dead!

278
00:29:09,237 --> 00:29:11,740
You brats, stop!

279
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,274
Stop, it cannot be like this!

280
00:29:29,053 --> 00:29:30,743
Uncle! What are you doing?

281
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:35,353
Is he your accquaintance?

282
00:29:35,353 --> 00:29:37,521
No, he's not.

283
00:29:38,724 --> 00:29:40,803
I don't know him

284
00:29:45,461 --> 00:29:46,669
Let go!

285
00:29:51,427 --> 00:29:54,324
You have to guard them until dawn, you hear me?

286
00:29:57,846 --> 00:30:00,116
These goddamn people!

287
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:05,484
How dare they beat me!

288
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,527
My Lord!

289
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:34,665
You bastard, why didn't you study diligently, how dare you...

290
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,450
What happened? What is wrong with your face?

291
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,950
Why are your under-eyes so black?

292
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,750
Because it's too dark outside and the road is slippery

293
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,450
What?

294
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,050
Come here now!

295
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:56,373
I knew it, did you drink wines again?

296
00:30:56,373 --> 00:30:58,869
You useless son!

297
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:03,758
Having a son like you makes me feel ashamed of myself

298
00:31:03,758 --> 00:31:05,969
It's ok if you couldn't pass the main exam

299
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:09,132
but you couldn't even pass the 
 Sung Gyun Gwan entrance exam!

300
00:31:09,132 --> 00:31:12,476
How dare you went to find girls and drink wines?

301
00:31:12,476 --> 00:31:15,354
Who did you take after to be so worthless?

302
00:31:15,354 --> 00:31:17,200
You!

303
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,027
Other than appearance, everything is similar to you father.

304
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:22,477
What did you say?

305
00:31:22,477 --> 00:31:25,720
Your physical appearance is certainly inherited from me

306
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,962
Your high-bridge nose

307
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:28,641
Wide mouth

308
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:31,381
Everyone says we look alike

309
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:33,592
Except for your brain...

310
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:34,669
Jez

311
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:36,930
Father is not different...

312
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:41,190
Thanks to our ancestor's prestige, you became a mandarin. I knew it all

313
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,571
What did you say?

314
00:31:42,571 --> 00:31:44,981
Who said it, who?

315
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:46,716
Many people know about it

316
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:50,564
The Red Card (used to certified passing the exam) that you usually takes out and brags

317
00:31:50,564 --> 00:31:52,228
is actually just a fake card you used money to buy

318
00:31:54,576 --> 00:31:56,970
Shi Wan, please don't say anything else

319
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:02,438
You bastard, is your mouth is only for arguing with your father?

320
00:32:02,438 --> 00:32:04,508
Damn you

321
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:05,690
My Lord!

322
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,261
You have to maintain our pride and face

323
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:09,845
Pride my ass!

324
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:13,761
Since when did we keep our pride, let me go!

325
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:16,011
Damn you!

326
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,950
But there is someone here that doesn't belong to our family

327
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:23,128
You are right, let us think carefully about this

328
00:32:23,128 --> 00:32:26,511
Shi Hoo is also my son, having my bloodline too.

329
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:31,004
But why is he so understanding?

330
00:32:31,004 --> 00:32:33,037
Therefore,

331
00:32:33,037 --> 00:32:38,232
Shi Won's mind is inherited from his mother's side.

332
00:32:38,232 --> 00:32:40,154
My Lord!

333
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:46,250
This fella, it would be  good enough if you were just half as good as Shi Hoo .

334
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,850
My feet are cold

335
00:32:48,907 --> 00:32:51,339
Why haven't you swept the snow around the courtyard?

336
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:36,320
Are you feeling better?

337
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,550
Who are you, my lord?

338
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,150
(Shim Ki Yoon - Left Main Parliament)

339
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,350
Are you really Geom?

340
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,350
What are you up to again? you want to kill me again?

341
00:34:51,606 --> 00:34:53,854
No

342
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:58,049
I just want to know the truth

343
00:34:58,049 --> 00:34:59,866
Whether you are Gyum or not

344
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:02,364
I will definitely not kill you

345
00:35:02,364 --> 00:35:06,104
Therefore, just relax and be comfortable

346
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,082
Yes, my lord.

347
00:35:09,082 --> 00:35:12,553
I am Yong from Nam Mun

348
00:35:12,553 --> 00:35:14,698
Really?

349
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:16,419
Yes.

350
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:19,679
I didn't come here to harm you

351
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,366
Your father and I are best friends

352
00:35:22,366 --> 00:35:25,111
So you don't need to be cautious around me

353
00:35:25,111 --> 00:35:25,840
What?

354
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,818
My father?

355
00:35:27,818 --> 00:35:31,134
I want to tell you how unjustly your father died

356
00:35:31,134 --> 00:35:33,043
Really

357
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:37,254
My father is still alive and well

358
00:35:41,615 --> 00:35:44,115
He doesn't seem to be lying

359
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:49,320
I also know where your mother and sister are

360
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,136
Don't you want to meet them?

361
00:35:52,756 --> 00:35:55,942
Really, I'm going crazy

362
00:35:55,942 --> 00:36:00,648
My mother is still at home, and I'm the only son

363
00:36:00,648 --> 00:36:05,116
Really? Then I must be mistaken you for someone else

364
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:08,381
You can go now.

365
00:36:11,067 --> 00:36:13,931
I am injured but they still mistreat me

366
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:21,261
You let him go just like that, my Lord?

367
00:36:21,261 --> 00:36:24,083
Bastard, how could you've given me false information?

368
00:36:25,036 --> 00:36:27,943
It's the truth, my Lord!

369
00:36:27,943 --> 00:36:31,376
He himself said that he is Geom

370
00:36:31,376 --> 00:36:36,789
If you dared to speak rashly again, I would cut off your tongue

371
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:39,685
What about the money that you promised...

372
00:36:39,685 --> 00:36:45,039
This fella! It's lucky that you haven't been punished, just go away!

373
00:36:46,817 --> 00:36:48,299
Yes, my Lord

374
00:36:53,695 --> 00:36:56,466
It's a waste of time that we believed in his words

375
00:36:58,804 --> 00:37:01,957
Remember to keep an eye on that boy's every move

376
00:37:01,957 --> 00:37:03,187
Yes, my Lord.

377
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:09,336
Why? Do you suspect that he is really Geom?

378
00:37:09,336 --> 00:37:11,850
I think it is a little bit odd

379
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:14,898
Let's observe for a while to see if there's anything new

380
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:18,161
The boy that died 13 years ago was definitely not Geom

381
00:37:19,259 --> 00:37:21,185
Geom is still alive

382
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:27,758
But why do you suddenly want to find him?

383
00:37:27,758 --> 00:37:32,289
Recently, I found out that Lee Won Ho's rebellious plan was made up by someone else

384
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:39,227
If Lee Won Ho's son is still alive and at the time, saw something?

385
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,607
Lee Geom!

386
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:48,272
Give me a break

387
00:37:50,038 --> 00:37:52,042
You are the hunter!

388
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:56,590
You can play trick on anyone but not me

389
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,040
Wait and see

390
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,663
I will expose your true identity

391
00:38:01,972 --> 00:38:05,917
The son of a rebel has a very high price, don't you know?

392
00:38:13,323 --> 00:38:15,282
I don't even understand what he's talking about

393
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:21,188
This leather shirt is so expensive, I can't let water get to it

394
00:38:21,188 --> 00:38:23,027
My image is totally ruined..

395
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,385
Please drink more

396
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:36,878
Please drink!

397
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,882
Drink up!

398
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:47,031
Where have you been?!

399
00:38:47,031 --> 00:38:49,243
Really, do you want to be fired?

400
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:53,818
There's line of people asking for the job at home

401
00:38:53,818 --> 00:38:55,231
Ma'am

402
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:59,173
Yong, maybe Yong is dead

403
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:00,504
Nonsense

404
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:04,504
Then the person lying in your room is a ghost?

405
00:39:04,504 --> 00:39:05,006
What?

406
00:39:09,244 --> 00:39:10,681
Oh, brother!

407
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:14,904
What?

408
00:39:14,904 --> 00:39:16,321
Are you dead?

409
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,950
How did you know?

410
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,150
That young master has confessed everything

411
00:39:22,644 --> 00:39:25,542
We went with your father to look for you almost the entire night, it was so tiring

412
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:26,682
So what actually happened?

413
00:39:26,682 --> 00:39:28,572
It's a long story

414
00:39:28,572 --> 00:39:32,513
Remember to tell my father that you found me at the casino, ok?

415
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:36,461
Are you afraid that he will be sad?

416
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:37,483
I should be the one that is sad

417
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:41,205
My father is a fool, I need to wake him up

418
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,466
Father!

419
00:39:52,466 --> 00:39:55,756
You bastard, why aren't you standing up!

420
00:39:55,756 --> 00:40:00,162
I had no idea that you were here, spending the whole night looking  elsewhere

421
00:40:00,162 --> 00:40:00,973
Damn you!

422
00:40:00,973 --> 00:40:03,020
I will bury you right here!

423
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,476
Father! What are you doing?

424
00:40:04,476 --> 00:40:05,598
Come here now!

425
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,650
Father!

426
00:40:14,756 --> 00:40:18,090
Catch him! Catch him!

427
00:40:22,832 --> 00:40:24,593
Stop right there!

428
00:40:40,473 --> 00:40:43,286
Did you cause trouble again?

429
00:40:43,286 --> 00:40:46,849
Can't you see that your father is so tormented by you that he looks old?

430
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:50,540
Heaven, his face is full of wrinkles

431
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,318
You are such a bastard!

432
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:55,447
Stop worrying about other's child, mind your own bottoms!

433
00:40:55,447 --> 00:40:56,907
Don't fool them around

434
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:05,469
Whether I use my bottom or thigh to serve rice has nothing to do with you!

435
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:13,098
I heard that your "noble" woman hasn't let you touch her bottom yet

436
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:17,959
Why don't you have me instead of her?

437
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:20,385
You stinking woman, really

438
00:41:22,384 --> 00:41:25,054
Are you still a man?

439
00:41:25,054 --> 00:41:28,908
Auntie! You are talking way too unreasonable.

440
00:41:28,908 --> 00:41:30,353
If my father is not a man

441
00:41:30,353 --> 00:41:33,195
then was I born by the moon's energy?

442
00:41:33,195 --> 00:41:35,042
The more you talked, the more ridiculous it sounds!

443
00:41:38,935 --> 00:41:43,461
Just live your whole life like that then, until there's nothing other than meat on your body

444
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:45,320
You, you! How dare you!

445
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:55,605
Is it true that those young masters want to kill you?

446
00:41:58,628 --> 00:42:00,448
They actually like me very much!

447
00:42:00,448 --> 00:42:01,543
You know, father

448
00:42:01,543 --> 00:42:04,262
I know how to dress and talk

449
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:07,930
If so,

450
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,314
was that young master drunk and saying nonsense stuff?

451
00:42:10,314 --> 00:42:14,221
Please eat more, seafoods are very good for your brain.

452
00:42:14,221 --> 00:42:16,479
You can finish eating it, don't even leave a bone

453
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:25,623
Father! Can I not go to school?

454
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,638
If you're done, let's go

455
00:42:31,122 --> 00:42:32,102
Hurry up!

456
00:42:41,134 --> 00:42:42,254
Why aren't you hurrying up?

457
00:42:46,914 --> 00:42:49,162
Na mo a mi da bu, Kuan Yin Bodhisattva

458
00:42:49,162 --> 00:42:51,634
Bodhisattva

459
00:42:55,350 --> 00:43:01,850
Is there really Buddha? Where did he go?

460
00:43:02,303 --> 00:43:08,379
Why did he say "come and see". Let's go now.

461
00:43:08,379 --> 00:43:11,272
Father! What did you do with that medicine?

462
00:43:11,272 --> 00:43:12,975
Medicine?

463
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:15,916
I'm talking about the magically enchanting medicine that makes people lose their wits

464
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,350
I threw it away

465
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,350
Threw it away? Why did you do that?

466
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:23,650
Who would need that stupid stuff!

467
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:25,365
I don't need to use it and I'm still as strong as an athlete!

468
00:43:25,365 --> 00:43:26,903
Look at my strength

469
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:32,250
But that medicine is very expensive, father, you should go home first

470
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:35,750
Hey, where are you going?

471
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:36,650
Yong!

472
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,850
This fella, did he sprout wings on his bottom or what?

473
00:43:46,844 --> 00:43:48,551
Enchanting medicine?

474
00:43:48,551 --> 00:43:51,054
Are you talking about the magically enchanting medicine?

475
00:44:00,345 --> 00:44:05,763
I heard that your "noble" woman hasn't let you touch her bottom yet

476
00:44:05,763 --> 00:44:07,949
This medicine is called magical enchanting

477
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:09,887
or charming medicine

478
00:44:09,887 --> 00:44:12,571
With only one piece, your whole body will be filled with energy and power

479
00:44:12,571 --> 00:44:17,501
Ladies will want you

480
00:44:21,296 --> 00:44:24,668
But, should I eat it?

481
00:44:24,668 --> 00:44:28,952
or give it to Dani?

482
00:44:28,952 --> 00:44:32,344
Whatever, the hastier person should eat it!

483
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:39,150
There are some cautions when using this medicine

484
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,650
Don't let a man who is going away from home take it.

485
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,150
Why?

486
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,950
You even need to ask why?

487
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:50,650
Your wives are not with you

488
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:56,150
but you are full of desires, how will you put up with that?

489
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,950
So, how will you put up then?  My money

490
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:05,175
When I'm being nice, just give me back my money

491
00:45:05,175 --> 00:45:07,248
You still dare to play trick on me?

492
00:45:07,248 --> 00:45:09,010
Didn't you take the medicine already?

493
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,050
Stand aside, let me see

494
00:45:13,984 --> 00:45:15,349
This stuff stinks!!

495
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:17,001
What is this? Isn't it?

496
00:45:17,001 --> 00:45:19,702
Mr, this stuff is made up of dog's poop and pig's dung!

497
00:45:19,702 --> 00:45:21,174
Don't buy it, please don't buy!

498
00:45:21,174 --> 00:45:22,846
It's fake

499
00:45:22,846 --> 00:45:26,453
No, it's real

500
00:45:26,453 --> 00:45:29,297
Then, why don't you eat it in front of us?

501
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:33,577
Alright

502
00:45:45,357 --> 00:45:46,548
Have you seen for yourself?

503
00:45:46,548 --> 00:45:49,735
If it's really a mixture of dog's poop and pig's dung, why am I eating it?

504
00:45:54,598 --> 00:46:01,984
But, suddenly why am I feeling so hot?

505
00:46:01,984 --> 00:46:05,048
It's cold but why am I feeling so hot?

506
00:46:06,893 --> 00:46:09,518
Please sell me one!

507
00:46:19,172 --> 00:46:21,143
You really know how to act

508
00:46:24,893 --> 00:46:26,133
Give me my money now!

509
00:46:27,206 --> 00:46:29,112
You!

510
00:46:32,518 --> 00:46:34,791
Please!

511
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,477
Let me go, it hurts!

512
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,043
Mr!

513
00:46:43,043 --> 00:46:44,634
If you dare to hinder our work again,

514
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:47,230
I will cut "yours," you hear me?

515
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:52,194
It's not that. But that money is...

516
00:46:52,194 --> 00:47:01,010
the money to buy medicine for my deathly ill mother

517
00:47:01,574 --> 00:47:02,568
This method is too old

518
00:47:02,568 --> 00:47:04,636
Don't you have anything better?

519
00:47:08,469 --> 00:47:10,481
Is it your first time in Nam Mun?

520
00:47:10,481 --> 00:47:12,855
I know of a lot of interesting places

521
00:47:12,855 --> 00:47:16,762
Or do you want me to introduce you to the hundred-year poison snake wine?

522
00:47:16,762 --> 00:47:19,188
This sounds better than last time

523
00:47:19,188 --> 00:47:21,322
but is still unconvincing.

524
00:47:21,322 --> 00:47:22,883
It's real

525
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:25,696
You just need to say my name to buy it at half the price

526
00:47:28,882 --> 00:47:31,058
My money, my money

527
00:47:31,058 --> 00:47:32,917
Mr, where's my money

528
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:35,070
How much?

529
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,544
5 bugs

530
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,384
Here you go

531
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,837
Search his body, open it

532
00:47:53,494 --> 00:47:57,193
What are you doing, bastard?

533
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,077
Is that guy crazy?

534
00:48:01,077 --> 00:48:03,276
He is dead for sure

535
00:48:03,276 --> 00:48:04,931
I'm really sorry..

536
00:48:07,744 --> 00:48:11,584
My brothers, don't be so emotional

537
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:15,039
I just accidentally touched his shoulder

538
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:15,558
Accidentally?

539
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:24,496
Then why does his shoulder hurt so bad?

540
00:48:24,496 --> 00:48:26,074
What are you talking about, young brother?

541
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:28,750
His arm is totally fine

542
00:48:29,642 --> 00:48:32,118
What should I do now?

543
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:35,208
Hey, are you his company?

544
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:36,230
No! I am not.

545
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:39,140
I have absolutely nothing to do with him

546
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,965
Just consider that I didn't exist at all

547
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:44,652
Please continue what you were doing, you must be tired

548
00:48:58,807 --> 00:49:01,149
Why is everyone lying around like that?

549
00:49:01,149 --> 00:49:03,044
Get up!

550
00:49:03,044 --> 00:49:05,621
Get up quickly!

551
00:49:07,026 --> 00:49:09,274
What happened to everybody?

552
00:49:09,274 --> 00:49:12,681
Na mo a mi da bu, Kuan Yin Bodhisattva

553
00:49:12,681 --> 00:49:17,379
Really thank you, I want to express my gratitude

554
00:49:17,379 --> 00:49:19,840
No need for gratitude, I didn't really do anything

555
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:21,850
But if you wish to do so, then buy one item from me

556
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:23,950
The merchandises are awesome!

557
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,050
Awesome?

558
00:49:32,343 --> 00:49:35,429
I told you that he would be in the gambling hall

559
00:49:35,429 --> 00:49:37,615
Seriously,

560
00:49:37,615 --> 00:49:40,281
It looks like I cannot come to Dae Shik's place again

561
00:49:45,717 --> 00:49:49,129
The owner is terrible

562
00:49:49,129 --> 00:49:52,596
Always embracing and bothering me

563
00:49:52,596 --> 00:49:57,534
Seriously, even blew air into my ear today

564
00:49:58,586 --> 00:50:01,993
She said that she's going to get me laid

565
00:50:04,206 --> 00:50:05,792
By the way...

566
00:50:07,025 --> 00:50:10,132
When she blew air into my ear,

567
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:13,720
it made me feel weird

568
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,690
My whole body was heated up

569
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,372
Then you go and find her

570
00:50:17,372 --> 00:50:19,494
Go? Now ?

571
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:21,500
For real?

572
00:50:23,443 --> 00:50:29,800
I just want only you

573
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,242
Just you

574
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,550
Oh Dani

575
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:39,746
We have lived together all these years

576
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:46,754
I...I believe that I will do fine...

577
00:50:48,095 --> 00:50:49,660
I'm going nuts

578
00:50:53,222 --> 00:50:54,298
Dani!

579
00:50:56,534 --> 00:50:57,908
Uncle, here you go, thank you

580
00:50:57,908 --> 00:50:59,021
Have an enjoyable night, Uncle

581
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,970
Father, what are you doing?

582
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:06,706
Father helped him so now he utterly wants to show his appreciation

583
00:51:06,706 --> 00:51:09,101
Father already said, "no need", but he...

584
00:51:09,101 --> 00:51:10,647
Father!

585
00:51:12,174 --> 00:51:16,510
I won't die after drinking all of this, right?

586
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,824
No way.

587
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,769
You drank  the whole bottle?

588
00:51:19,769 --> 00:51:22,378
Yes, why, father?

589
00:51:22,378 --> 00:51:23,772
Never mind

590
00:51:23,772 --> 00:51:27,043
You won't be dead, just...

591
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:28,515
Just what, father?

592
00:51:28,515 --> 00:51:31,100
Later, your bottoms will be on fire

593
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,468
Bodhisattva

594
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:34,820
On fire?

595
00:51:37,372 --> 00:51:38,582
Dani!

596
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:03,404
This bastard!

597
00:52:03,404 --> 00:52:05,360
I'll pay this back...

598
00:52:09,283 --> 00:52:11,419
That troublesome rascal

599
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,003
Hey, rascal!

600
00:52:16,814 --> 00:52:18,122
Come here, come here now

601
00:52:18,122 --> 00:52:19,386
What's wrong father?

602
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,023
It's all your fault

603
00:52:21,023 --> 00:52:22,566
Blood, blood

604
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:24,359
Blood?

605
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:25,191
Where, where is it?

606
00:52:25,191 --> 00:52:26,772
In feces

607
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:28,427
Feces, really?

608
00:52:28,427 --> 00:52:30,913
Father got feces that stained with blood

609
00:52:30,913 --> 00:52:32,894
Feces with blood? Why?

610
00:52:32,894 --> 00:52:33,826
Come here quick

611
00:52:33,826 --> 00:52:35,327
What did you say? Illusionist?

612
00:52:35,327 --> 00:52:36,919
Magical medicine?

613
00:52:36,919 --> 00:52:37,547
This son of a...

614
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:38,890
It's poison, rat poison

615
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,924
Son of a...come here quickly

616
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:42,162
What are you doing, father?

617
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:45,168
You are really an impossible rascal

618
00:52:45,168 --> 00:52:48,014
I already helped you find good medicine, what are you doing now?

619
00:52:49,889 --> 00:52:52,175
Why am I being arrested?

620
00:52:52,175 --> 00:52:56,350
Old man, do you know how bad's a crime your violence toward nobles is?

621
00:52:57,285 --> 00:52:59,267
Father!

622
00:52:59,267 --> 00:53:03,000
What? He's still alive and coming back?

623
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,318
Yes, sir

624
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:06,694
Because of this, the chief at the quarter came to the master

625
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:14,515
My Shi Wan did so?

626
00:53:14,515 --> 00:53:19,333
Yes, for me, everything he said is indeed the truth

627
00:53:21,978 --> 00:53:24,052
Close the case

628
00:53:24,052 --> 00:53:24,768
But...

629
00:53:26,178 --> 00:53:28,941
It's out of my authority

630
00:53:28,941 --> 00:53:31,953
Have you sprout wings on your arms already?

631
00:53:31,953 --> 00:53:34,378
Who promoted you to that position?

632
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:36,640
Just a word from me

633
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,506
Your spot as the quarter master would be no more than a smelly fart

634
00:53:39,506 --> 00:53:41,847
This rascal, want to make me mad, don't you

635
00:53:49,213 --> 00:53:51,147
Forgive me father

636
00:53:51,147 --> 00:53:52,607
Please forgive me this time, father

637
00:54:03,622 --> 00:54:06,600
How come there's a fly in mid winter like this?

638
00:54:10,277 --> 00:54:15,642
So, your eye bruise's caused by that troublemaker, right?

639
00:54:15,642 --> 00:54:18,416
What? Oh yes

640
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:22,278
He had the nerve to even hit my dear son

641
00:54:22,278 --> 00:54:25,363
Charge of intentional hitting noble members for no reason

642
00:54:25,363 --> 00:54:28,796
The master decided  hamstring slashing as punishment

643
00:54:28,796 --> 00:54:30,068
Hamstring slashing?

644
00:54:30,068 --> 00:54:33,238
So that he will no longer be able to attack nobles

645
00:54:33,238 --> 00:54:36,458
Your father! Will chop off your father's hands

646
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:38,277
Hand chopping?

647
00:54:38,277 --> 00:54:42,974
Master! Master! I am wrongfully accused, please

648
00:54:42,974 --> 00:54:49,745
Those young masters thought I was dead, even dumped me into bottomless trench

649
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:53,455
This lowlife, you still have the gut to tell lies here?

650
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:58,808
It's true, I just can't take out my heart to show you

651
00:54:58,808 --> 00:55:01,297
Your highness just has to investigate to find out

652
00:55:02,228 --> 00:55:05,798
Your highness, the nobles that killed innocent peasants are not guilty

653
00:55:05,798 --> 00:55:08,589
Why is my father the only one sentenced?

654
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:15,806
Do both of you know who you guys were messing around with?

655
00:55:15,806 --> 00:55:16,403
Yes?

656
00:55:17,531 --> 00:55:20,048
If you want to save your father's hand

657
00:55:20,048 --> 00:55:22,867
You should hurry along and beg for the young master's forgiveness

658
00:55:22,867 --> 00:55:25,827
Now, that's the only way

659
00:55:31,343 --> 00:55:32,593
You should eat something

660
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,783
Darling, I'm scared

661
00:55:41,704 --> 00:55:45,334
I knew that sooner or later that brat would cause a disaster

662
00:55:45,334 --> 00:55:48,268
From ancient times, those black-headed animals were not domesticate

663
00:55:48,268 --> 00:55:52,375
For God sake, why do you drag Yong into this

664
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:55,249
Don't you even know that it's all his fault

665
00:55:55,249 --> 00:55:58,382
Look what he does outside

666
00:55:58,752 --> 00:56:00,966
Bastard

667
00:56:00,966 --> 00:56:03,500
No, I already told you not to blame Yong

668
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,993
I trusted him, I thought he was at the casino all through the night

669
00:56:08,624 --> 00:56:11,766
He must have been scared to death

670
00:56:11,766 --> 00:56:14,256
He must be hurt

671
00:56:14,256 --> 00:56:16,834
My poor son

672
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:22,189
You're so softhearted, why are you always like that?

673
00:56:22,189 --> 00:56:27,921
Always sacrifice for other people's kids, are you an idiot?

674
00:56:27,921 --> 00:56:29,658
I...

675
00:56:29,658 --> 00:56:31,753
I have met Cha Dol

676
00:56:34,282 --> 00:56:36,961
Since it's too dark, couldn't make out his face

677
00:56:38,057 --> 00:56:40,487
But he's a real grown up now

678
00:57:18,584 --> 00:57:19,650
Mother!

679
00:57:29,536 --> 00:57:31,651
Mother, how's father?

680
00:57:31,651 --> 00:57:32,911
You're happy now, aren't you?

681
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:34,874
Turning your father into a handicap person

682
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,584
It's 38 Du yue for me

683
00:57:54,823 --> 00:57:56,957
Mine is 8 yue

684
00:57:58,738 --> 00:58:00,986
Mine is 10 yue

685
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,080
This batch of silver is all mine

686
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,394
Don't play the 5 cards game anymore

687
00:58:09,394 --> 00:58:11,040
Let's play 6 cards this time

688
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,861
Young master! Looks like you've ran out of money

689
00:58:14,861 --> 00:58:17,701
Please excuse us for now

690
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:21,089
Where are you  going?

691
00:58:24,081 --> 00:58:25,790
Young master!

692
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,537
Forgive me

693
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:29,024
Young master!

694
00:58:29,024 --> 00:58:32,429
Young master, please kill me but be merciful toward my father

695
00:58:32,429 --> 00:58:37,016
Yes, I heard about your father's hand

696
00:58:37,016 --> 00:58:41,053
Young master, please beat me until you are satisfied!

697
00:58:41,053 --> 00:58:44,046
Please young master, I beg you.

698
00:58:44,046 --> 00:58:46,128
Really?

699
00:58:46,128 --> 00:58:47,703
Okay then

700
00:58:47,703 --> 00:58:49,582
I will let your father off the hook

701
00:58:50,286 --> 00:58:52,378
But you, bring me the money

702
00:58:52,378 --> 00:58:54,027
Mone...money?

703
00:58:54,824 --> 00:58:56,592
I need some money, so bring me some right now

704
00:58:56,592 --> 00:58:58,614
Why are you still sitting there for?

705
00:58:58,614 --> 00:58:59,833
Turn the cards

706
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:01,233
Yes sir

707
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:06,642
I only have this much with me

708
00:59:08,764 --> 00:59:11,094
You want to mess with me?

709
00:59:11,094 --> 00:59:14,507
Please give me few more days, I will...

710
00:59:14,507 --> 00:59:19,272
Tomorrow, I will bring you to a place where you can take out loans

711
00:59:19,591 --> 00:59:21,104
Deal the cards!

712
00:59:34,877 --> 00:59:37,195
Is it okay over there?

713
00:59:37,195 --> 00:59:39,010
It's so hot, that damned bastard

714
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,197
I'll kill that...

715
00:59:41,197 --> 00:59:43,456
Bong Soon

716
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:43,845
Huh?

717
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:46,721
Have you any regret?

718
00:59:46,721 --> 00:59:47,549
Regret?

719
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:49,134
That you followed me

720
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,565
Why do you bring it up?

721
00:59:53,565 --> 00:59:55,414
If you hadn't come with me

722
00:59:55,414 --> 00:59:57,883
Then I wonder who would you have turned out to be

723
00:59:57,883 --> 01:00:00,106
Thank you for taking me along

724
01:00:00,106 --> 01:00:03,289
You have been raising me as well

725
01:00:04,323 --> 01:00:06,294
No need to thank me

726
01:00:06,294 --> 01:00:08,720
You don't even know who I really am

727
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,291
Who else could you be?

728
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:13,448
You're my life savior

729
01:00:13,448 --> 01:00:14,492
What?

730
01:00:14,492 --> 01:00:16,584
I know all about it!

731
01:00:16,584 --> 01:00:18,908
When I was near death, you saved me

732
01:00:18,908 --> 01:00:21,042
Go to sleep!

733
01:00:23,293 --> 01:00:28,907
Father! I will earn lots of money so you can take it easy

734
01:00:28,907 --> 01:00:31,295
I am certain that I will make it

735
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:45,650
I'm sorry, Bong Soon

736
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:49,150
I have too much sins

737
01:01:08,812 --> 01:01:10,089
This idiot, what are you doing?

738
01:01:10,089 --> 01:01:11,735
Quick, let me go!

739
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,962
You had plotted to kill his son

740
01:01:15,962 --> 01:01:17,674
It's you who were wrong first

741
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,493
Me? When?

742
01:01:19,493 --> 01:01:20,855
Are you dreaming now?

743
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:27,326
That person is...the one who used to nurture me

744
01:01:27,326 --> 01:01:34,949
Oh, that is really an interesting fate

745
01:01:37,011 --> 01:01:40,699
Go ahead! Hit me!

746
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:46,073
I will make Swe Dol lose not only his hand but his head as well

747
01:01:53,452 --> 01:01:57,011
He's not even your blood father and you still love him that deeply

748
01:01:59,084 --> 01:02:02,997
How about this? Your mother will have to take care of this handicap old man forever

749
01:02:02,997 --> 01:02:05,256
It's very pitiful, isn't it?

750
01:02:07,736 --> 01:02:12,392
Yes, that's your real face, right?

751
01:02:12,392 --> 01:02:15,392
How patient you have been eversince then!

752
01:02:15,392 --> 01:02:21,611
It's true, the more wicked you are, the more patient's your character

753
01:02:21,611 --> 01:02:25,041
Is it because of your malicious blood?

754
01:02:38,142 --> 01:02:40,174
Father!

755
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:41,809
Oh, my dear daughter

756
01:02:41,809 --> 01:02:43,370
You came at the right time, Eun Chae!

757
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:45,080
Take a look at this for me

758
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:48,338
Does this stamp look  fake to you?

759
01:02:48,338 --> 01:02:50,989
I have heard brother's story

760
01:02:50,989 --> 01:02:52,640
No need for your interference

761
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,902
It looks like the real deal to me

762
01:02:55,759 --> 01:02:57,999
I heard that brother intended to kill that man's son

763
01:02:57,999 --> 01:03:00,154
Who in the world as parents would ignore such a story?

764
01:03:00,154 --> 01:03:03,372
That's the parents' compassion

765
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:08,154
Like me, who wants to punish him

766
01:03:08,154 --> 01:03:09,999
That's also a parent's instinct

767
01:03:09,999 --> 01:03:12,717
He had the nerve to attack my beloved son

768
01:03:13,918 --> 01:03:15,500
Father, I beg you, please forgive him

769
01:03:18,676 --> 01:03:20,925
You don't have to get involved

770
01:03:21,311 --> 01:03:23,075
That person

771
01:03:23,075 --> 01:03:26,591
It's said that he used to raise brother Shi Hoo

772
01:03:26,591 --> 01:03:27,988
What?

773
01:03:27,988 --> 01:03:29,398
So he's the...

774
01:03:31,282 --> 01:03:34,991
Why are those people still meandering around us?

775
01:03:35,706 --> 01:03:36,375
Father!

776
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:39,312
Please understand Shi Hoo's intention

777
01:03:41,345 --> 01:03:43,497
It's bogus, really a trick

778
01:03:43,497 --> 01:03:48,937
Losing that much money, it should have been valuable

779
01:03:48,937 --> 01:03:51,157
Damn it!

780
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:10,242
So, how is he, Hee Bong?

781
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:17,341
Hey, rascal!

782
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,267
Yes

783
01:04:21,267 --> 01:04:24,194
Turn around

784
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:25,666
Turn to this side?

785
01:04:36,601 --> 01:04:38,039
Wait outside

786
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:47,007
Gosh...

787
01:04:47,007 --> 01:04:49,723
Such inferior merchandise, useless like this

788
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:54,723
Deokba only needs one blow to knock him off

789
01:04:54,723 --> 01:04:56,161
A deadly one is fine too

790
01:04:57,277 --> 01:05:01,729
If he's killed in the ring, then how could he blames anyone?

791
01:05:01,729 --> 01:05:02,967
Quick, hand me the money

792
01:05:04,913 --> 01:05:06,152
Really?

793
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,852
Even if he's dead, we will not be responsible

794
01:05:08,852 --> 01:05:13,650
That's right, hand me the money

795
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:14,477
I got it, boss

796
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:18,509
Everyone is afraid of Deokba that's why the  ring is empty!

797
01:05:18,509 --> 01:05:22,282
He would be a nice one to be beaten up

798
01:05:22,282 --> 01:05:27,291
Here's money for the referral and casualty compensation

799
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:29,290
It's more than you asked

800
01:05:45,913 --> 01:05:47,477
Like I said before

801
01:05:48,846 --> 01:05:51,946
If you win the reward will be 200 silver

802
01:05:51,946 --> 01:05:54,397
You need to bring that fund  to me,

803
01:05:55,353 --> 01:05:57,651
If you are unable to deliver that winning

804
01:05:57,651 --> 01:05:59,013
Then your father will be...

805
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:21,956


806
01:06:21,956 --> 01:06:23,702
