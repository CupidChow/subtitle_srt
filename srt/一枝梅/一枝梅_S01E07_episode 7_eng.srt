1
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:34,310
You find people too?

2
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,944
Sure.

3
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:36,879
Your brother Is looking for you..

4
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:38,681
He said you would know if I told you it's Gyum.

5
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,130
He wants you right away. He said he found the person.

6
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,358
Come out at night to Deok Cheon. Nobody must know.

7
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:53,771
My sister is over there!

8
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:55,785
Over there!

9
00:00:56,352 --> 00:00:58,325
Do they not provide service here?

10
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,715
Is there a gisaeng who used to be a slave?

11
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:07,877
Stop!

12
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:24,587
Look at that position!

13
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:26,378
Is this even possible?

14
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,461
Hey you, come over here.

15
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:30,706
Like this?

16
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:35,639
You guys.

17
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:38,944
Did a young tradesman come here by any chance?

18
00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:40,836
I heard she was looking for an old gisaeng

19
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:42,258
I don't really know.

20
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:43,758
Try to remember better.

21
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:45,377
She's a little bit over twenty.

22
00:01:45,377 --> 00:01:48,364
I heard she goes around Gibang selling stuff.

23
00:01:48,364 --> 00:01:51,405
You guys have your sources!

24
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,498
If you find her...

25
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:59,264
I will give this to you for free!

26
00:02:03,705 --> 00:02:05,927
Isn't this musk?

27
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:08,266
It's not just a normal musk.

28
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:11,414
It's the best product made from a civet cat.

29
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:12,489
That...

30
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:14,096
Have you not seen a suspicious person around here?

31
00:02:14,096 --> 00:02:15,506
No, I haven't.

32
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:18,447
Give that here!

33
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:21,676
What is this?

34
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,457
What are you guys doing! You're cramping my style.

35
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:31,124
You are being charged with illegal publishing.

36
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:36,997
This is not fair!

37
00:02:36,997 --> 00:02:41,550
Can you lock  up a citizen who pays the taxes every single time?

38
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,339
Should Joseon's law be like this?

39
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,553
Aish!

40
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:49,595
Who told on me?

41
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,743
Why here?

42
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:08,573
Aigoo, aigoo!

43
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:11,190
What do you have on your legs here?

44
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:14,011
Hold on...

45
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:16,357
That night policeman

46
00:03:16,357 --> 00:03:20,982
said that there was a woman caught for adultery. 
 That must be you!

47
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:24,642
Look at this face!

48
00:03:24,642 --> 00:03:26,279
It's so smooth!

49
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,804
Look at this!

50
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:30,857
You like fights, don't you?

51
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:32,294
How about it?

52
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:34,647
Wanna get together?

53
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:37,741
Stay still!

54
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:40,402
Just stay still!

55
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:44,411
Come on stay still.

56
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:49,358
Ahjussi! Oh, we meet again!

57
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:50,539
What are you?

58
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:55,191
Meeting you here is such a nice surprise.

59
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:58,837
I need a little favor.

60
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:00,010
What?

61
00:04:00,552 --> 00:04:02,558
I have this big problem going on.

62
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:05,271
I need to think about something so I need you to be quiet.

63
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:08,219
Go do this outside instead.

64
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,446
It's cramping your style.

65
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:11,111
Why, you little!

66
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:12,946
Who the heck are you to be saying that to me?

67
00:04:12,946 --> 00:04:14,113
Ahjussi!

68
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:17,503
Ahjussi, how many times did you buy those manuals from Bong Soon again?

69
00:04:17,503 --> 00:04:21,242
I got locked up here because of illegal publishing.

70
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:25,058
They are threatening me to tell them who I bought them from.

71
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:28,802
Don't you think that the person who bought it is more worse off than the one selling? Right?

72
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:29,751
What should I do?

73
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:32,097
Should I go tell them who?

74
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:34,220
Should I tell them or not?

75
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,290
Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

76
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:40,035
Thank you.

77
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:00,110
Dad, I am in a hurry.

78
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,741
Please take me out! Please!

79
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:07,142
What? What did you want me to do?

80
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:10,089
Oh, now you're selling those weird pictures?

81
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:11,573
You should

82
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:14,466
stay here eating more rotten rice! Bad little rascal.

83
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,866
Dad! I really need to get out of here!

84
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:19,115
I really need to do something!

85
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:20,047
Need to do something?

86
00:05:20,047 --> 00:05:21,246
What do you need to do?

87
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:23,648
What? You're going to sell more perverted things?

88
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:24,807
You, little!

89
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:28,488
Let's die. 
 Let's die together!

90
00:05:28,488 --> 00:05:29,959
Please be quiet!

91
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,771
Look at this brat!

92
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:34,067
So you're embarrassed? 
 You are aware this is embarrassing?

93
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,280
I oughta stuff you in poop.

94
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,486
You little jerk.

95
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:41,558
You need to be beaten.

96
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:44,016
You need to think straight!

97
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:45,538
I'm so sorry!

98
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:46,962
I'm going to kill you!

99
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:50,224
Are you really...

100
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,941
You won't kill her. Right?

101
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:55,725
How many times do I have to tell you?

102
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:58,674
If you insist so much,

103
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:00,076
she will just receive a few beatings

104
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:03,060
Then she will be let go as a slave.

105
00:06:04,894 --> 00:06:07,867
I will tell him what you've done.

106
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,550
His Excellency

107
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,870
will be proud of you.

108
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,464
Your mom packed this food for you.

109
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:19,459
Chew it all and eat.

110
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:24,620
Do you know how worried sick is your mom because of you?

111
00:06:26,295 --> 00:06:27,754
Really?

112
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,514
My mom?

113
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,208
Why you little.

114
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,891
Drink some water while you eat.

115
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:45,225
Hey, you over there. You should eat too.

116
00:06:46,715 --> 00:06:49,350
My goodness, my dad's heart is so big.

117
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,648
There is nothing for me to eat!

118
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:52,695
Why you little!

119
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:56,275
Hurry!

120
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:09,257
Thank you very much.

121
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:10,912
You have no manners!

122
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:13,224
Don't you even feel sorry for her?

123
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:16,276
Dad.

124
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:18,509
Do you know what her crime is?

125
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:21,338
It's adultery!

126
00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:22,949
Adultery?

127
00:07:24,623 --> 00:07:25,491
Adultery

128
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:27,279
or selling those perverted pictures. 
 What is the difference?

129
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,039
Aish! Even dogs don't get disturbed when they eat!

130
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:34,041
And also, they are different! It's totally different!

131
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,570
What are you talking about?

132
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,806
She doesn't look like she would do that.

133
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:41,074
They wouldn't write on their heads that!

134
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:46,356
How disgusting!

135
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:48,191
It's disgusting!

136
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:53,724
Sir!

137
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:56,840
My lord!

138
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,227
We caught a maidservant who escaped from Sancheong.

139
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:01,652
Hey you!

140
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:03,630
Do I have to...

141
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:05,975
...care and know about a maidservant?

142
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:07,514
It's cramping my style!

143
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:08,330
But! But!

144
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,189
She's the daughter of Lee Won Ho, the traitor, 13 years ago.

145
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:15,804
She said her little brother came to see her.

146
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:17,955
Little brother?

147
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,840
Didn't you say he died?

148
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,746
Yes.

149
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,565
We even checked his body.

150
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:29,155
Does that mean Kwon Doo Hyun was trying to tell him the truth?

151
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:34,941
This means they already knew that Gyum was alive.

152
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:37,554
That is what I am trying to say.

153
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:42,867
Do you think the piece of cloth was given to him?

154
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:46,294
I don't think so.

155
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,502
Even if it's true, what would he do?

156
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:52,500
We can just catch and then kill them.

157
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,600
Find them.

158
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:15,980
Do you not want to go to sleep?

159
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:18,807
You look like you might pass out any second.

160
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:21,422
You should close your eyes for a while.

161
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:30,681
You must have some family. Why didn't any of them come?

162
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:33,365
Yes.

163
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:35,603
Get some strength.

164
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:38,869
I'm telling you from years of experience,

165
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,492
they may be a little bit harsh on you,

166
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:43,212
but you get used to it quickly.

167
00:09:43,714 --> 00:09:45,066
Yes.

168
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:50,915
You must love your kid a lot.

169
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:53,086
No not really.

170
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:57,045
There is not a lot of things I did for my kid.

171
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:01,463
Really...

172
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,867
Why is he sleeping like a shrimp?

173
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:05,806
Yong!

174
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,087
Stretch your legs out and sleep!

175
00:10:08,548 --> 00:10:10,133
Yong!

176
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,233
This little brat.

177
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:15,636
Yong is looking for you.

178
00:10:15,636 --> 00:10:17,796
Yong is looking for you.

179
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:36,398
Hey!

180
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:49,480
Please move aside.

181
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:09,184
Stop. I'll ask you again. Where is your little brother?

182
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,115
I don't have a little brother.

183
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:17,934
Do you really need to taste blood to open that mouth of yours?

184
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:26,869
Do you know what that is?

185
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:30,199
It's pieces of led put within cow skin.

186
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:39,952
A few beatings of those and the pieces of led will go into your skin and tear it apart bit by bit.

187
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:51,173
I will ask you again. Where is your brother, Lee Geom?

188
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,118
That night, 13 years ago when my father died.

189
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:59,222
My little brother was murdered too.

190
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:03,701
Find that murderer for me.

191
00:12:14,052 --> 00:12:16,299
Atrocious little brat!

192
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:24,645
Crazy girl!

193
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:31,226
Then we'll just have to make him come to us.

194
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,234
How?

195
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:38,508
To get the meat, one has to throw the bait.

196
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:36,578
 You were alive. 

197
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:39,700
 For you being alive. 

198
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,950
 For you living. 

199
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,320
 I am so thankful. 

200
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:49,485
 Geom... 

201
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,752
My little brother Geom...

202
00:13:54,805 --> 00:14:00,251
 I can't call your name out although you are right in front of me. 

203
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:14,648
Aish! What's wrong with this woman!

204
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:21,728
Is it an illness to hit on people? That was why my dream was really weird!

205
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,201
Just go sleep over there!

206
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,194
Sister.

207
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:10,817
Where are you?

208
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,093
Hey!

209
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,386
The sun is high up!

210
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:39,078
-What!
-You're discharged.

211
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:43,906
Are you sure?

212
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,313
Work hard then!

213
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:57,923
You'll soon be released too so don't worry.

214
00:15:59,073 --> 00:16:02,456
You shouldn't have hit on guys.

215
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:19,417


216
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:59,000
You went through a lot, right? Your face has shrunk.

217
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,868
Dae Shik.

218
00:17:01,258 --> 00:17:03,501
Is adultery that big a crime?

219
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:06,066
What? Why adultery all of a sudden?

220
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:08,021
I think it's a serious crime.

221
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:11,233
It's love between a man and a woman. 
 Where's the crime in that?

222
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:14,163
Hey. Just go clean up the horse's poop.

223
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,615
You little!

224
00:17:20,263 --> 00:17:22,303
But why do you ask about adultery?

225
00:17:22,861 --> 00:17:23,820
It's nothing.

226
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:32,346
Hey you! Your master has come out of jail! Just bring some tofu.

227
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:35,123
Tofu? Do you know how expensive that is?

228
00:17:35,123 --> 00:17:39,711
You little! Just do as your Master says.

229
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:44,537
Ahjumma isn't even here.

230
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,408
Hey you little brat.

231
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:50,509
You have gotten yourself a good position. A high position!

232
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:52,484
Aigoo.

233
00:17:52,484 --> 00:17:54,777
Eat a lot!

234
00:17:54,777 --> 00:17:57,123
I'll pour some for you.

235
00:17:57,123 --> 00:18:01,470
Dae Shik! There's not enough alcohol here! Get some more!

236
00:18:01,793 --> 00:18:03,594
Eat a lot!

237
00:18:03,594 --> 00:18:05,914
Aigoo! Welcome! Welcome!

238
00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:07,402
Did you come?

239
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:09,835
Have a drink of this.

240
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:12,308
Wait, is this the rope?

241
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:17,040
Yes. He told me to bring the strongest rope.

242
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,137
But why death by hanging suddenly?

243
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,239
I don't know.

244
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:25,330
They were pressuring her to tell where her brother was hiding.

245
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,252
They kept torturing her.

246
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:32,542
She was very atrocious! She didn't say a word at the end.

247
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:37,509
So it was just ordered for her to be killed.

248
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:41,635
Who?

249
00:18:41,635 --> 00:18:43,567
Who do you think?

250
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,386
Don't you know that girl?

251
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:49,185
That girl who was with you in the same cell.

252
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:01,299
What's wrong with this woman?

253
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:04,038
Is it an illness to hit on people?

254
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:07,754
You shouldn't have hit on guys.

255
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:22,752
You should drink more!

256
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:30,767
 She was really pretty. You guys look alike. 

257
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:33,043
 You'll notice her when you meet her. 

258
00:19:33,043 --> 00:19:35,314
That's what coming from the same blood does to you.

259
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:40,056
 I'm sorry, sister. 

260
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:41,960
 I'm sorry. 

261
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,246
 For not being able to recognize you. I'm sorry. 

262
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:45,972
Sister.

263
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,855


264
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:02,029
What are you doing??

265
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:03,084
Where is the  honey?!

266
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:03,752
Huh?

267
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:06,119
I said where is the honey?!

268
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,648
Oh.

269
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:31,028
Talk while eating some Tofu!

270
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:33,379
Tofu? This is so precious.

271
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:35,893
This is a really expensive one.

272
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:38,721
When is the execution day?

273
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:40,750
Why, are you going to go watch?

274
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,288
Of course! It's a fun thing!!

275
00:20:45,906 --> 00:20:50,132
Hey!  What's so fun about a person dying?

276
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:51,835
Anyways, it's tomorrow,  right?

277
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,398
No.

278
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:57,755
Tomorrow is the leader's birthday. So it was pushed back to the day after tomorrow.

279
00:20:57,755 --> 00:21:00,296
If it's the leader's birthday, they'll kill a cow for the feast, right?

280
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:05,795
That's right! That means I'll get myself all oiled up.

281
00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:09,325
You must be  really happy.

282
00:21:09,325 --> 00:21:12,291
Should I go there  too?

283
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:16,157
You should come eat  too.

284
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:31,757
Where do you think you  are peeing!

285
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,370
My ear is going to fall  off!

286
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,313
Aish! I wet  my pants!

287
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:41,896
Come here!  Come here you rascal!

288
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,428
Tomorrow you'll get hit  5 times.

289
00:21:48,428 --> 00:21:51,330
Wait a second.  How can I stop it from coming out, huh?

290
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,840
Then should I pee in my pants?

291
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,164
My god,  it's wet!

292
00:21:57,164 --> 00:21:59,851
That bastard!

293
00:22:06,144 --> 00:22:10,200
My goodness,  those wretched people!

294
00:22:11,308 --> 00:22:13,844
Look at you!

295
00:22:13,844 --> 00:22:18,379
They've  made you half crippled!

296
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:30,071
Gyum said that he will save you so you should keep calm.

297
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:32,123
Gyum said  that?

298
00:22:33,094 --> 00:22:37,286
Then did you come here on purpose?

299
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:42,306
Aigoo, but  who in the world made you like this?

300
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:44,505
Because of me

301
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:48,343
Thank you.  Thank you.

302
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:50,370
Why are you thanking me?

303
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:52,393
Between us

304
00:22:52,393 --> 00:22:54,550
I have to meet that  brat.

305
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,110
I said, you can't meet him!

306
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,025
That trickster !

307
00:22:59,025 --> 00:23:02,806
This oil right here was supposed to make 
my look shiny.

308
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:04,717
That's why I bought it with lots of money!

309
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,521
It wasn't a special oil but, a normal one!

310
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:10,049
If you can't believe me,  just smell it!

311
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:14,764
Whatever !

312
00:23:14,764 --> 00:23:16,364
You little  rascal!

313
00:23:57,656 --> 00:23:58,970
Hey!

314
00:24:02,678 --> 00:24:04,832
You came this early to take  it?

315
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:06,197
I was just going to do away with it

316
00:24:06,197 --> 00:24:10,807
No it's not that.  The leader said he will personally do it himself.

317
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:14,694
I think he heard from somewhere that meat 
 that's been caught early is better tasting.

318
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:17,952
Who said such a  thing?

319
00:24:17,952 --> 00:24:21,269
Enough!

320
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:24,622
The best butcher in Joseon has  already come.

321
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:27,170
Just give me the cow.

322
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:40,760
When I am working do not let anyone in.

323
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,682
I have to kill it  at once!

324
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:00,981
Let's go!.

325
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,702
Hey!.

326
00:25:16,702 --> 00:25:18,305
Yong!

327
00:25:21,871 --> 00:25:24,150
God forbid!  She's already been taken away!

328
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,318
They said it's today..

329
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:31,186
They said they will carry it out today even though 
it's the leader's birthday.

330
00:25:31,735 --> 00:25:33,244
What?.

331
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:49,971
It's time..

332
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:51,492
Let's go..

333
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:04,392
 Father.. 

334
00:26:04,392 --> 00:26:07,769
 Now I'm going to follow you. 

335
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:11,133
 It was really difficult.... 

336
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,805
 Now I'm going to rest beside you, Father. 

337
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:20,318
 But it's a relief that I got to see Gyum. 

338
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,201
 Mother... 

339
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:25,504
 Geom said... 

340
00:26:25,504 --> 00:26:30,333
 Geom will definitely find you. 

341
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,234
This servant girl's little brother is to step  out immediately!

342
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:14,602
If you don't come out.!

343
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:18,197
This rope is going to kill her.

344
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:20,890
Are you really not going to come out?

345
00:27:26,756 --> 00:27:28,205
Now.

346
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:32,445
I will give you a last chance to save your sister.

347
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,476
I will count to three.

348
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,384
One.

349
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:46,650
Two.

350
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,857
Three.

351
00:27:56,226 --> 00:27:57,646
Wait!

352
00:27:58,658 --> 00:28:00,246
Wait!

353
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:13,121
How did this happen?

354
00:28:14,017 --> 00:28:15,189
What is this?

355
00:28:15,189 --> 00:28:16,230
I...

356
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,189
You promised you wouldn't kill her.

357
00:28:18,189 --> 00:28:21,119
About that...

358
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:23,332
I can't do anything about it.

359
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:25,292
There has been an order from the authorities.

360
00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:27,017
No!

361
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:28,671
You promised you wouldn't kill her!

362
00:28:28,671 --> 00:28:30,610
Step back!

363
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:45,697
Your litle brother has turned you away.

364
00:28:46,314 --> 00:28:48,427
I will give you a last chance.

365
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:51,958
Where is your little brother?

366
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,390
My little brother...

367
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,205
...is already dead.

368
00:29:23,449 --> 00:29:26,887
 Wait. I'll save you. 

369
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,467
It's done!

370
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:48,347
When I run holding on to sister's hand, you come with the horse.

371
00:29:48,347 --> 00:29:49,724
Now...

372
00:29:49,724 --> 00:29:51,470
I'm going.

373
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:35,209
Is everything prepared?

374
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,161
Yes.

375
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,193
What's wrong with this?

376
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,590
My goodness!

377
00:30:55,874 --> 00:30:57,589
You pungent little brat.

378
00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:03,486
Your sister is dying right in front of you, and you're only watching?

379
00:31:04,845 --> 00:31:07,166
I guess, when you were young...

380
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:10,288
...you also threw a stone at your mom.

381
00:31:15,993 --> 00:31:20,763
Look at this man! Did you still not get cured from getting bitten by the crazy dog?

382
00:31:20,763 --> 00:31:26,297
Alright then. Just keep sniffing around my end.

383
00:31:26,883 --> 00:31:29,091
You seriously have no life.

384
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:32,177
What a waste of time.

385
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,938
What in the world.

386
00:31:43,621 --> 00:31:46,350
This is so sad.

387
00:31:47,544 --> 00:31:51,613
I had no idea that woman would be his sister.

388
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:56,140
I think I should go and bring her body at least.

389
00:31:56,978 --> 00:31:58,512
Have you gone crazy?

390
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:00,874
Do you want to kill him?

391
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:03,793
I don't know.

392
00:32:04,444 --> 00:32:07,677
If he finds out what happened to his sister.

393
00:32:08,111 --> 00:32:10,352
Dad, do you have anything to eat?

394
00:32:10,352 --> 00:32:11,986
I'm so hungry!

395
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:14,187
I seem to have some ghost on me or something to keep eating like this.

396
00:32:14,187 --> 00:32:17,053
You little brat, where were you?

397
00:32:17,707 --> 00:32:21,307
Mom, dad, you know in the village...

398
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:28,841
I saw something I shouldn't have seen. It's only going to disturb my sleep.

399
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:31,591
It's teok!

400
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:32,407
I can eat this right?

401
00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:34,501
You should at least clean your hands.

402
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:38,068
You're going to upset your stomach!
 Drink some water at least.

403
00:32:40,818 --> 00:32:43,265
Water, water, water.

404
00:32:57,156 --> 00:33:44,757


405
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,204
Father.

406
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:40,150
 I will never forget it. 

407
00:34:41,085 --> 00:34:42,920
 I will never forget it! 

408
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:22,047
Without a single error.

409
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:25,556
Tattoo it here.

410
00:35:50,553 --> 00:35:52,092
Father.

411
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:54,976
I tried to live forgetting everything.

412
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:57,997
If I just found my sister and my mother.

413
00:35:57,997 --> 00:36:00,028
I was just going to live like that.

414
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:05,341
Today.

415
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,257
Sister died.

416
00:36:08,662 --> 00:36:10,337
Now.

417
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:12,581
Pretending that I haven't seen or heard anything.

418
00:36:12,581 --> 00:36:14,817
I can't live like that.

419
00:36:18,091 --> 00:36:20,473
I need to know.

420
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:22,064
Who...

421
00:36:22,064 --> 00:36:25,134
...killed you and my sister.

422
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:32,506
The pain that I'm suffering now.

423
00:36:32,506 --> 00:36:35,106
I will make them feel that pain.

424
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:37,552
By all means.

425
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,789
I will definitely do that.

426
00:37:12,593 --> 00:37:15,210
I heard about it.

427
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,640
Go

428
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:19,701
and console the dead's soul at least.

429
00:37:27,301 --> 00:37:29,033
Comfort?

430
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:30,575
Why should I?

431
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:33,993
That woman was a criminal.

432
00:37:33,993 --> 00:37:36,768
Wasn't she someone worth dying?

433
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:39,253
Brother.

434
00:37:39,785 --> 00:37:41,010
I...

435
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:43,360
...only did what I had to do.

436
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,100
I only did what was natural.

437
00:37:48,348 --> 00:37:50,696
He didn't show up?

438
00:37:51,008 --> 00:37:52,249
That's right.

439
00:37:54,713 --> 00:37:55,960
Then...

440
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,976
Could he have not heard about his sister's execution?

441
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:04,482
Or could he have just ignored her to save his life?

442
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:10,940
He was looking for his sister, he could not have not heard about it.

443
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,635
That's right. That's what I'm trying to say.

444
00:38:14,635 --> 00:38:15,794
Then.

445
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:19,755
Where can we find him now?

446
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:24,749
Where is Lee Geom's mother now?

447
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,244
If he went to find his sister.

448
00:38:27,244 --> 00:38:30,030
He will also try to find his mother.

449
00:38:30,504 --> 00:38:32,657
That's a good thought.

450
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:34,258
But.

451
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:36,068
She died.

452
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:37,003
Pardon?

453
00:38:37,003 --> 00:38:40,430
You know that accident a long time ago, a fire in Naju?

454
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:45,493
A lot of slaves died and with them his mother died as well.

455
00:38:56,325 --> 00:38:57,963
You scared me.

456
00:38:57,963 --> 00:38:59,921
What are you doing here?

457
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,394
I came here because I was worried.

458
00:39:02,394 --> 00:39:04,089
Are you alright?

459
00:39:04,899 --> 00:39:08,173
Thank you. I won't forget your kindness.

460
00:39:09,202 --> 00:39:12,480
I will definitely find your mother for you!

461
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,712
No, don't look for her.

462
00:39:14,712 --> 00:39:15,973
What?

463
00:39:15,973 --> 00:39:17,472
Why?

464
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,606
Sister...

465
00:39:19,942 --> 00:39:22,549
If I hadn't looked for her, she would not have been killed.

466
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:24,448
Yong!

467
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:26,733
I can't let my mother die as well.

468
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:29,006
I am not going to look for her.

469
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:33,521
Somewhere.

470
00:39:33,826 --> 00:39:36,256
She must be living well.

471
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,568
I'm just going to believe it like that.

472
00:39:56,225 --> 00:39:57,556
Look here!

473
00:39:57,556 --> 00:39:59,005
Who could this be?

474
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:02,696
Aren't you the puppy of the Minister?

475
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:08,511
Hey, Shi Wan.

476
00:40:08,511 --> 00:40:12,855
I heard your dog did something really nice.

477
00:40:15,923 --> 00:40:19,695
I didn't see you like that, but you were very scary.

478
00:40:19,695 --> 00:40:25,020
Everyone, if you act wrong in front of this brat, you're going to die!

479
00:40:44,904 --> 00:40:47,477
You low life!

480
00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:51,641
You're trying to succeed with all your might!

481
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:55,193
Young master!

482
00:40:56,336 --> 00:41:00,471
Young master, are you all right?

483
00:41:01,072 --> 00:41:02,548
Young master.

484
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:06,071
Young master, are you all right?

485
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,933
Mother.

486
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:30,330
Mother.

487
00:41:32,496 --> 00:41:34,999
I killed a person.

488
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:39,251
I didn't know I was killing her.

489
00:41:39,251 --> 00:41:41,339
I really didn't know.

490
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,143
Why.

491
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:47,995
Did you take me to that house?

492
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:55,745
I will never forgive them.

493
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:00,948
Even though I don't know what kind of situation he is in.

494
00:42:04,182 --> 00:42:08,057
My Geom should have grown this much.

495
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:23,237


496
00:42:25,106 --> 00:42:27,428
You woke up?.

497
00:42:30,018 --> 00:42:31,816
You should eat  it.

498
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:37,183
Our chief madam told us to tell young master 
to eat when you wake up..

499
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:48,647
It doesn't look  like a normal sword.

500
00:42:48,647 --> 00:42:51,968
Looking at the handle, it looks like it belonged 
to the best of the noblemen.

501
00:42:51,968 --> 00:42:55,053
Or only royalty would have  this.

502
00:42:55,053 --> 00:42:57,863
Do I have any way of finding out who has it?

503
00:42:57,863 --> 00:43:01,335
There is no way of knowing just  by a picture.

504
00:43:01,335 --> 00:43:05,133
Then does the person who makes the swords 
 personally inscribe the black pattern?

505
00:43:05,133 --> 00:43:07,337
That's true, but,

506
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:10,316
This is the first time I have seen this kind of  pattern.

507
00:43:10,316 --> 00:43:14,512
I looks like the pattern was inscribed on it 
after the sword was made.

508
00:43:15,374 --> 00:43:17,591
I will go  now.

509
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:21,351
Give up on  it.

510
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:26,063
You won't be able to find out unless you go around looking at all the noblemens' houses.

511
00:43:26,063 --> 00:43:29,864
If it is a precious treasure like that

512
00:43:29,864 --> 00:43:33,902
they would hide it deep in their house.

513
00:43:42,876 --> 00:43:44,641
Yong, yong.

514
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:53,851
Don't feel too  bad about it.

515
00:43:53,851 --> 00:43:57,405
I didn't really  hope for anything from the beginning.

516
00:43:58,223 --> 00:44:00,205
And you call yourself my  friend?

517
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:03,041
You rotten little!  How could you say such a thing?

518
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:05,935
Geez, why say such harsh words?

519
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,422
Did I fail  him?

520
00:44:23,276 --> 00:44:25,702
I heard young master Shi Wan  passed the examination.

521
00:44:25,702 --> 00:44:28,213
He was even the first in the examination.

522
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,320
Young master also thinks it doesn't make any sense,, right?

523
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,479
I heard the bear does all the work, but another man gets the money.

524
00:44:37,479 --> 00:44:44,530
Don't you think so too? Using all the money he's got and taking your money as well to be in first place...

525
00:44:48,538 --> 00:44:50,728
This is the Red Paper, isn't it?

526
00:44:51,178 --> 00:44:53,195
You passed?!

527
00:44:53,195 --> 00:44:56,820
My goodness! Splendid!

528
00:44:57,984 --> 00:44:59,730
I barely passed.

529
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,397
It's way better than somebody who got first place with money!

530
00:45:03,397 --> 00:45:06,017
Wait a second! My lord! My lord!

531
00:45:06,017 --> 00:45:08,154
My lord! My lord!

532
00:45:08,154 --> 00:45:09,957
Hey!

533
00:45:11,267 --> 00:45:13,738
I heard the news.

534
00:45:13,738 --> 00:45:16,527
I heard you passed.

535
00:45:16,527 --> 00:45:19,397
I also heard you hurt your shoulder.

536
00:45:19,397 --> 00:45:22,436
You are very admirable.

537
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:23,632
Oh right!

538
00:45:23,632 --> 00:45:26,492
Just congratulating isn't enough.

539
00:45:26,492 --> 00:45:30,350
I will have a party immediately.

540
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,814
But.

541
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:36,592
I think before that, you have to go on an errand.

542
00:45:36,592 --> 00:45:40,515
This man has delivered liver.

543
00:45:40,515 --> 00:45:42,933
It smells so bad.

544
00:45:42,933 --> 00:45:47,034
Take it to the warehouse and bring another one.

545
00:45:49,355 --> 00:45:51,246
What are you doing?

546
00:45:51,246 --> 00:45:53,909
You should give it to him.

547
00:46:13,314 --> 00:46:15,230
Now that you've passed the stupid exam,

548
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,849
it feels like you have everything in the world, right?

549
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:19,797
Wait another hundred days.

550
00:46:19,797 --> 00:46:22,610
See if you are appointed.

551
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:25,572
You go get it changed!

552
00:46:25,572 --> 00:46:27,763
You wait and see!

553
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,728
I will definitely...

554
00:46:31,153 --> 00:46:34,112
...I will get above you.

555
00:46:34,112 --> 00:46:35,529
What?

556
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:38,581
You little!

557
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,608
It's all dirty.

558
00:46:57,386 --> 00:46:59,595
Is it a special day today?

559
00:46:59,595 --> 00:47:01,643
Where is everyone?

560
00:47:01,643 --> 00:47:05,784
Are you not going to listen to me? You're embarassing me!

561
00:47:07,985 --> 00:47:12,996
You guys really don't know fear, do you?

562
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,092
You didn't know?

563
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:16,429
Didn't you know that this area belongs to

564
00:47:16,429 --> 00:47:18,251
the Castor Oil gang?

565
00:47:18,251 --> 00:47:21,293
I've never heard of this Castor Oil gang.

566
00:47:21,293 --> 00:47:23,528
But I have heard of the messed up hair group.

567
00:47:23,528 --> 00:47:26,578
Just like the rumors, your hair is really messed up!

568
00:47:26,578 --> 00:47:29,181
You dirty little brats.

569
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:36,396
You guys took our Lord from us.

570
00:47:36,868 --> 00:47:38,997
Oh!

571
00:47:38,997 --> 00:47:41,048
That Yepan Elder?

572
00:47:41,048 --> 00:47:44,830
We didn't take him from you. He personally came to us.

573
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:47,088
I think it was because the way you worked was so bad.

574
00:47:47,088 --> 00:47:50,116
You should have served him well.

575
00:47:51,082 --> 00:47:54,115
Byeongpan, Hopan, Hyeongpan, Leepan.

576
00:47:54,115 --> 00:47:56,251
You guys took all of them.

577
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:59,147
You stole Yepan Elder from us too?

578
00:47:59,147 --> 00:48:01,584
Now, that won't do. Even between people like us...

579
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:02,836
There is still a business ethic!

580
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:05,537
You're talking nonsense.

581
00:48:05,537 --> 00:48:07,826
Good then, let's have a fight!

582
00:48:07,826 --> 00:48:10,544
If you guys win, we'll clear off business with that old man.

583
00:48:10,544 --> 00:48:12,518
All right then.

584
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:14,558
Come at us!

585
00:48:16,722 --> 00:48:18,712
Instead!

586
00:48:20,324 --> 00:48:22,667
Only with our body!

587
00:48:37,842 --> 00:48:41,209
Kill them!

588
00:49:25,285 --> 00:49:27,152
What should I do?

589
00:49:54,872 --> 00:49:59,354
Now, let's have a look at it.

590
00:50:01,283 --> 00:50:04,953
You're such a crybaby!

591
00:50:08,752 --> 00:50:10,279
I'm sorry.

592
00:50:10,279 --> 00:50:12,382
The fight became so big because of me.

593
00:50:12,382 --> 00:50:14,034
No, it's alright.

594
00:50:14,034 --> 00:50:16,955
We're not even that badly hurt.

595
00:50:23,055 --> 00:50:26,684
But what's with all this Yepan Lord or what not?

596
00:50:26,684 --> 00:50:28,763
What was that about?

597
00:50:30,729 --> 00:50:35,013
You know our job is to feed influential people.

598
00:50:35,013 --> 00:50:36,599
Give back rent.

599
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,283
And do away with those that don't listen.

600
00:50:39,283 --> 00:50:42,477
Then you would know all the noblemen right?

601
00:50:42,477 --> 00:50:48,572
Of course! There is no nobleman who doesn't get along with the Castor Oil gang while they are governing!

602
00:50:48,572 --> 00:50:51,042
Then you go in and out of their houses often?

603
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:55,095
Of course! We go in and out so often!

604
00:50:55,095 --> 00:50:57,718
We know how many golden spoons there are in the house.

605
00:50:57,718 --> 00:51:01,330
You know those spoons, we're the ones who gave them anyways.

606
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:03,204
Is that so?

607
00:51:13,985 --> 00:51:16,329
I came here to apply.

608
00:51:18,244 --> 00:51:22,510
I shouldn't have let a beast come in to our house.

609
00:51:23,652 --> 00:51:26,189
The worst job

610
00:51:26,189 --> 00:51:28,568
among all of them?

611
00:51:28,568 --> 00:51:30,901
That's why I applied.

612
00:51:30,901 --> 00:51:32,934
Because I am nothing.

613
00:51:32,934 --> 00:51:34,599
I only applied for something that meant nothing.

614
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:37,473
What, what did you say?

615
00:51:37,473 --> 00:51:38,892
You little!

616
00:51:38,892 --> 00:51:41,344
I am not going to treat you like my son anymore.

617
00:51:41,344 --> 00:51:43,623
Am I...

618
00:51:44,514 --> 00:51:46,179
...your son at all?

619
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:49,832
You... little!

620
00:51:50,376 --> 00:51:52,440
Whatever you choose to do then!

621
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,781
Do it your way!

622
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:58,605
But don't you dare recognize me at the court!

623
00:51:58,605 --> 00:52:00,487
I don't want to see you! Get out!

624
00:52:00,487 --> 00:52:02,695
Get out!

625
00:52:07,621 --> 00:52:09,463
What?

626
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:10,605
Have you gone crazy?

627
00:52:10,605 --> 00:52:13,340
You still say stuff like this after what you've done on that day?

628
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,030
I have to do something.

629
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,832
I didn't even pass the examination.

630
00:52:17,832 --> 00:52:20,441
It's not like I don't know your feelings.

631
00:52:20,441 --> 00:52:23,307
But are you really going to live like crap?

632
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,779
You should go home. Now!

633
00:52:26,397 --> 00:52:27,264
Brother!

634
00:52:27,264 --> 00:52:29,473
You little brat!

635
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:40,308
Hyung! Hyung!

636
00:52:40,308 --> 00:52:41,865
Please take me in.

637
00:52:41,865 --> 00:52:44,222
You! Aren't you going to go?

638
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:47,521
I will pledge alligiance to you.

639
00:52:47,521 --> 00:52:50,188
Until my bones shred to pieces.

640
00:52:50,589 --> 00:52:51,756
Please?

641
00:52:51,756 --> 00:52:53,223
Wait a second.

642
00:52:53,223 --> 00:52:56,454
Isn't this the fellow who won the battling contest last time?

643
00:52:56,454 --> 00:52:59,098
He just won with tricks.

644
00:52:59,098 --> 00:53:01,851
He is bad quality.

645
00:53:02,636 --> 00:53:04,983
Playing tricks are skills as well!

646
00:53:04,983 --> 00:53:08,109
Well, you know how to talk you way into something.

647
00:53:08,109 --> 00:53:09,353
All right, we'll see then.

648
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,030
Come in.

649
00:53:11,825 --> 00:53:14,374
Thank you! Thank you so much!

650
00:53:14,374 --> 00:53:17,356
You're going to be blessed, Hyung-nim!

651
00:53:17,356 --> 00:53:20,854
To shreds! To shreds!

652
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:27,354
Hyung-nim!

653
00:53:27,354 --> 00:53:29,549
How do I look?

654
00:53:30,509 --> 00:53:30,880
I took some care into this.

655
00:53:41,227 --> 00:53:43,406
The Minister is here.

656
00:53:49,508 --> 00:53:54,489
Here is the new minister, who's been appointed here from today.

657
00:54:08,338 --> 00:54:09,970
Hello!

658
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,863
Swe Dol is not here?

659
00:54:12,863 --> 00:54:14,195
He just went out.

660
00:54:14,195 --> 00:54:15,839
This.

661
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:16,825
What is this?

662
00:54:16,825 --> 00:54:20,323
Please hold on to them. They are young master Shi Hoo's books.

663
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:24,467
He told me to throw them out, but I thought he might regret later.

664
00:54:24,467 --> 00:54:28,223
But, why would he throw away these books?

665
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:32,640
You don't know he's become a foot soldier, do you?

666
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,613
Seeing him like that makes me feel all sad and bitter.

667
00:54:34,613 --> 00:54:39,782
What's the point of passing? Because he is the son of another woman, he has no chance of being appointed.

668
00:54:39,782 --> 00:54:43,629
He even told on the traitor's sister.

669
00:54:43,629 --> 00:54:47,546
But even that is all returned to young master Shi Wan's credit.

670
00:54:48,279 --> 00:54:52,372
What... what is that supposed to mean?

671
00:55:03,471 --> 00:55:06,398
Dan! I heard the news!

672
00:55:06,398 --> 00:55:11,680
Our Ja Dol... he has passed the examination!

673
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,984
Dan!

674
00:55:19,855 --> 00:55:21,599
What... what's wrong?

675
00:55:27,946 --> 00:55:30,424
What happened?

676
00:55:30,424 --> 00:55:34,659
Everything is my fault.

677
00:55:34,659 --> 00:55:36,835
I should have just kept him by my side.

678
00:55:38,236 --> 00:55:40,322
I told him not to live like his mother.

679
00:55:41,615 --> 00:55:44,432
I told him to live well.

680
00:55:44,432 --> 00:55:48,613
I sent him with my heart breaking.

681
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:55,542
My baby... my baby...

682
00:55:56,013 --> 00:55:58,778
What are you saying?

683
00:55:58,778 --> 00:56:04,023
What should I do? What should I do?

684
00:56:04,023 --> 00:56:08,371
She was his sister! She was his sister!

685
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,749
I said, what are you saying?

686
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:20,505
He said our Ja Dol informend the authorities.

687
00:56:21,517 --> 00:56:24,330
That's why she died.

688
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:26,488
What?

689
00:56:38,784 --> 00:56:42,762
What am I going to do?!

690
00:56:42,762 --> 00:56:44,575
What are you people doing?!

691
00:56:44,575 --> 00:56:46,694
Why are you not listening to me?

692
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,988
I told you to fill up the whole thing!

693
00:56:49,988 --> 00:56:51,051
You bastard!

694
00:56:51,051 --> 00:56:53,048
Do I look like I'm selling apples? 
 No! I trade vegetables.

695
00:56:53,048 --> 00:56:56,270
Apples? I have nothing!

696
00:56:56,270 --> 00:57:00,450
Get off me! If you don't have money to pay off,

697
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:03,460
then just die! Hey! Go and search the place!

698
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:07,408
Someone save me!

699
00:57:17,536 --> 00:57:21,740
What are you guys looking at! Go away!

700
00:57:24,128 --> 00:57:27,589
I oughta!

701
00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:31,220
Whose land is this? It's the country's!

702
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:34,865
If you sold things on the nation's land, you should pay the authorities!

703
00:57:34,865 --> 00:57:37,136
A person should have a conscience!

704
00:57:37,136 --> 00:57:39,826
I payed the government taxes without missing even one!

705
00:57:39,826 --> 00:57:45,621
I don't want to hear no more. If you don't send in apples, you won't be able to trade here, ever.

706
00:57:45,621 --> 00:57:47,128
Do you understand?!

707
00:57:47,128 --> 00:57:48,907
- Guys! 
 - Yes.

708
00:57:48,907 --> 00:57:50,688
Let's go.

709
00:57:52,396 --> 00:57:57,366
What am I going to do now!

710
00:58:00,331 --> 00:58:03,811
Don't worry about it!

711
00:58:03,811 --> 00:58:06,183
What is this!

712
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:08,883
What am I going to do?

713
00:58:08,883 --> 00:58:13,302
Hey, get a hold of yourself. This is nothing!

714
00:58:13,302 --> 00:58:17,864
You still have to do business! Do it like I do it!

715
00:58:18,421 --> 00:58:21,742
-This is nothing!
-How am I going to live?

716
00:58:21,742 --> 00:58:27,434
Get a hold of yourself. Think of your children!

717
00:58:27,434 --> 00:58:29,213
Hey!

718
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:31,013
-Yes?
-What are you doing you little brat!

719
00:58:31,013 --> 00:58:36,039
I'm going! Do it properly!

720
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:40,175
That bad little brat!

721
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,359
That brat!

722
00:58:48,683 --> 00:58:50,237
Are you all right?

723
00:58:52,577 --> 00:58:56,238
-I oughta do away with that!
-Don't swear.

724
00:59:05,438 --> 00:59:06,644
Are you all right?

725
00:59:06,644 --> 00:59:09,137
That guy is not a bad guy.

726
00:59:09,137 --> 00:59:11,841
So don't swear about him.

727
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:15,547
You little young thing. You are looking at guys looks?

728
00:59:16,881 --> 00:59:20,576
I admit that brat before was good looking.

729
00:59:20,576 --> 00:59:26,688
But even then, that brat was very rude breaking everything in your store.

730
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,950
You don't know anything.

731
00:59:44,144 --> 00:59:47,586
But where is this?

732
00:59:47,586 --> 00:59:50,386
Lord Hopan Lee Myung's house.

733
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:52,317
Lee Myung?

734
01:00:04,231 --> 01:00:08,041
It's so heavy!

735
01:00:09,832 --> 01:00:14,716
Hyung. There is nobody. I'm thirsty so let's drink from one of them.

736
01:00:16,603 --> 01:00:21,200
It should taste good. Wait a second, what is this?

737
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:26,012
So wait a second. Does that mean all of these crops and other goods are all money?

738
01:00:27,626 --> 01:00:33,270
This is nothing. If you go out the back there are more private outhouses.

739
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:35,621
They say in there, there are lots of treasures.

740
01:00:35,621 --> 01:00:37,846
Including rare swords.

741
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:38,870
Swords?

742
01:00:41,106 --> 01:00:42,992
You saw it too?

743
01:00:42,992 --> 01:00:48,783
There is another place for swords, but because I was letting in goods, I went in there once or twice.

744
01:00:49,768 --> 01:00:53,076
I'm just wondering, are there patterns inscribed in the swords?

745
01:00:53,076 --> 01:00:54,105
Pattern?

746
01:00:54,981 --> 01:00:56,927
Hey, only patterns?

747
01:00:56,927 --> 01:00:59,856
There are so many jewels on it.

748
01:01:00,212 --> 01:01:03,790
Anyways, 20 soldiers are always on the look out.

749
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:08,219
I heard Lord Hopan clings on to the keys for that lock.

750
01:01:26,888 --> 01:01:29,442
Mom, dad! I'm home!

751
01:01:29,442 --> 01:01:33,410
Woa! Is it a special day today?

752
01:01:35,685 --> 01:01:38,926
But what's wrong with the atmosphere?

753
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:43,994
What's wrong with you, mom?

754
01:01:45,904 --> 01:01:47,869
Did you eat something wrong?

755
01:01:47,869 --> 01:01:50,251
Listen to you, talking to your mother like that.

756
01:01:51,532 --> 01:01:54,044
I'm just happy.

757
01:01:57,828 --> 01:01:59,418
Ta-da!

758
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:03,419
What is that?

759
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,298
It's a notice for the recruitment of guards.

760
01:02:05,298 --> 01:02:07,772
I'm just not going to do the examination and do the test to become a guard.

761
01:02:07,772 --> 01:02:10,835
What did you say? A guard?

762
01:02:10,835 --> 01:02:16,037
Yes, father. To tell you the truth, I've been thinking about it for a long time.

763
01:02:16,037 --> 01:02:23,078
When I become a guard I'm going to kill all those thieves that suck all they want from people's backs.

764
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,382
I'm going to defend peace in Joseon.

765
01:02:29,434 --> 01:02:32,850
Hey! I'm still going to do the test to become a guard.

766
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,827
You go apply now and go read some books.

767
01:02:39,347 --> 01:02:42,972
The next exam is in 3 years! I'm going to die aging!

768
01:02:42,972 --> 01:02:48,865
Even if it is in 30 years, you still have to take the exam!

769
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,811
It's a thief!

770
01:02:50,811 --> 01:02:53,997
That! That! Catch that thief!

771
01:02:53,997 --> 01:02:57,829
Thief! Thief! Thief!

772
01:03:00,556 --> 01:03:03,608
Yong! Yong!

773
01:03:06,268 --> 01:03:07,488
Hey!

774
01:03:10,157 --> 01:03:12,308
Stop right there!

775
01:03:34,209 --> 01:03:35,739
Where is it!

776
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:51,503
I fount it!

777
01:03:58,899 --> 01:04:02,928
Hurray! Hurray!

778
01:04:06,304 --> 01:04:10,021
Everyone! Hurray to our hero!

779
01:04:10,021 --> 01:04:11,437
Hurray!

780
01:04:11,437 --> 01:04:16,147
This here is my child! My chlld!

781
01:04:16,147 --> 01:04:19,698
Don't we look alike?

782
01:04:19,698 --> 01:04:23,405
Everyone how about a handshake with our hero?

783
01:04:24,387 --> 01:04:28,395
Now a handshake with the hero's father!

784
01:04:30,843 --> 01:04:35,436
Again, hurray to the hero!

785
01:04:35,436 --> 01:04:39,430
Yong! He's so awesome!

786
01:04:50,693 --> 01:04:57,441
Dad. When I get enough money after I become a guard, I'll take the exam then.

787
01:05:01,751 --> 01:05:03,166
All right.

788
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:09,051
I saw you differently today.

789
01:05:09,051 --> 01:05:14,059
With that much spirit, you'll be able to get all those thieves in Joseon.

790
01:05:14,059 --> 01:05:20,303
You can go try it then. But you must take the exam, all right?

791
01:05:20,303 --> 01:05:25,868
Ok! Then could you tell me some ways that thieves use?

792
01:05:25,868 --> 01:05:29,680
What? Why does someone who wants to become a guard learn about stealing?

793
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,373
In the test, there is a part where you have to catch the thief.

794
01:05:33,373 --> 01:05:36,956
In order to get the thief, you need to know the ways of the thief well.

795
01:05:36,956 --> 01:05:43,159
Is that so? Well, as a father I could do that for his son, but...

796
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:49,632
Don't tell Dan about any of this.

797
01:05:51,601 --> 01:05:53,800
-Promise?
-Promise!

798
01:05:59,884 --> 01:06:05,699
But why did you become a thief?

799
01:06:05,699 --> 01:06:07,791
Are you curious about that?

800
01:06:10,497 --> 01:06:13,911
At a time like this, you need alcohol.

801
01:06:15,837 --> 01:06:19,851
Having all your land taken away by a nobleman.

802
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:25,427
With Mother and Father passing away from it.

803
01:06:25,427 --> 01:06:28,447
There was no way for a little kid to earn money and live.

804
01:06:29,826 --> 01:06:32,868
What could I do when my throat was crying out loud?

805
01:06:35,414 --> 01:06:45,656
Yong, when you become a guard, don't only catch small thieves, but...

806
01:06:45,656 --> 01:06:50,391
You need to catch the big thieves, alright?

807
01:07:31,332 --> 01:07:45,279


808
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:47,341
