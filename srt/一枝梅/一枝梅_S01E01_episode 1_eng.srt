1
00:00:38,194 --> 00:00:38,950
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,960
What are you doing here?!

3
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:43,268
Punk, it's an iron castle. 
 It's impenetrable.

4
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:46,938
You're right! It's impossible. 
 Now, just give it up.

5
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,150
Guys, on this earth... 
 there's no place that can't be stolen.

6
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,050
I'm... Iljimae.

7
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,140
Step aside, step aside!

8
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,810
Hey, step aside, step aside!

9
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,850
Who it is?

10
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,321
I'm the ice merchant here!

11
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:06,424
If I don't go quickly, it will melt. 
    

12
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:08,693
Move away. 
 Move away!

13
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,827
Hey, what's that?!

14
00:01:09,827 --> 00:01:12,130
Easy! Take it easy!

15
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:19,738
I've brought the ice for the feast!

16
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:24,375
I've received the order to fill up the ice cave!

17
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:28,780
We were ordered to restrict anyone from 
 coming in or out tonight.

18
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,315
You must wait until dawn.

19
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:31,649
Until dawn?!

20
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:33,584
No, no, there's no way!

21
00:01:33,584 --> 00:01:37,088
I'm not an expert, 
 but the ice will all melt for sure.

22
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:39,290
Really...

23
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,793
What a waste... I ran all the way from Seobinggo 
 without even stopping for a minute.

24
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:44,662
Wait!

25
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:45,730
Yes, Sir.

26
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:52,135
By the way, is there anything important?

27
00:01:52,135 --> 00:01:53,305
It's an emergency...

28
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:56,140
We heard Iljimae will be robbing this place tonight.

29
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,812
Why is this ice block so red?

30
00:02:00,812 --> 00:02:04,382
That's Raspberry (Korean Mountain Berries) wine that's been frozen the entire winter on the bank of Daedong river.

31
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:09,150
It is a specially frozen wine to welcome the Ching's ambassadors during the feast for tomorrow.

32
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:15,226
It's true. it's Raspberry wine.

33
00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:16,927
There's nothing else here, sir!

34
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,833
Let him in!

35
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,234
Yes sir!

36
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:25,203
Thank you. Take care.

37
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:08,293
Is everything okay?

38
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:12,129
Yes sir! We are on guard. 
 Even a mouse cannot pass by unnoticed.

39
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,250
What is going on?

40
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:46,984
Close the door! Light a fire! Light!

41
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:14,412
Everyone!  Light the fire!

42
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:23,855
Go after him!  He couldn't have gone too far yet!

43
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:24,789
Yes, sir!

44
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,894
Over here!

45
00:09:57,589 --> 00:09:58,423
Good job, soldier.

46
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:06,231
Iljimae, you're a dead man.

47
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:10,169
You're the notorious Iljimae. 
 Let's take a look at your face.

48
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,650
Soldier!

49
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,350
Yes, sir!

50
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:27,352
That bastard.....That bastard was Iljimae!

51
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,950
No!

52
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:04,322
See? Like I said, there's nothing on this earth 
 that I can't steal.... I AM Iljimae!

53
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:06,190
Since I'm Iljimae.

54
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:11,232
It's Iljimae!

55
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:13,268
Capture him!

56
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:24,205
Gyeom.

57
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:29,177
There are many types of pretty flowers, 
 but why do you only like plum blossoms?

58
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:32,180
Though it resembles cherry blossom, it's not as pretencious,

59
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:39,751
Though it resembles pear blossoms, it's not as pitiful. 
 That's why I'm fond of the plum.

60
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:45,126
The plum holds the fragrance of a noble scholar. 
 There's no other flower beautiful than plum blossom in my eyes.

61
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:24,098
Do you truly see it?

62
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:30,338
Yes, I see a bright red color with very gallant energy.

63
00:13:30,338 --> 00:13:32,807
How can you see that?

64
00:13:32,807 --> 00:13:38,012
Shortly after I was born, I have lost my vision due to a fever.

65
00:13:38,012 --> 00:13:40,848
But afterwards, I gained another pair of eyes.

66
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:44,651
I can see those things that  other people can't see.

67
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:52,393
In my eyes, I can see the strong energy of the sun 
 who will receive all the respect of the people.

68
00:13:57,565 --> 00:14:00,802
He saw the things that shouldn't have been seen.

69
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:04,272
Likewise, I heard things that shouldn't have been heard.

70
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:12,614
Who else knows about this?

71
00:14:12,614 --> 00:14:17,885
I... won't tell anyone else about...

72
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:09,304
If you feel stuffy, why don't you go out for a stroll?

73
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:13,340
Now that you mention it, within the next few days 
 I plan to go to Hanyang.

74
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,076
Sir Shim Ji Won wishes to see me.

75
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:19,981
Father! Please look at this drawing!

76
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:22,883
Gyeom, is this your drawing?

77
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:23,985
Yes.

78
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:26,854
I feel ashamed now.....

79
00:15:26,854 --> 00:15:32,058
Dear, isn't his skills better than me?

80
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:35,463
My dear Gyeom, you deserve a reward.

81
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:36,965
What shall I give you?

82
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:41,500
How about your favorite beef jerky?

83
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,871
Then what would you like?

84
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:48,276
Mother, please allow me to accompany Father to Hanyang.

85
00:15:48,276 --> 00:15:54,146
That is not an impossible wish, okay.

86
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:59,717
Huh? It's the Whistling bird!

87
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:05,693
Seeing that the whistling bird is here, 
 it is definitely spring now.

88
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,441
Shoot!

89
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:16,464
We couldn't find that blind man's wife.

90
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:20,801
I think she found out and ran off already.

91
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:21,569
Let's go!

92
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,086
Stop crying!

93
00:17:42,256 --> 00:17:44,025
Soo Mak, go ahead and run in that direction!

94
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:45,627
Remember never to look back....Just run!!!

95
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:46,761
Mother!

96
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:51,565
You must never tell anyone that your father 
 was a blind fortune teller, understand?

97
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:53,734
Mother!

98
00:17:53,734 --> 00:18:01,438
Soo Mak, you are a brother.

99
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:03,377
You must take good care of Soon (sister name).

100
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,025
Quick!

101
00:18:35,877 --> 00:18:36,978
Have you heard?

102
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:38,646
I have heard loud and clear, 
 you damned worthless bastards.

103
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:42,383
To silence us, you have done the un-imaginable...

104
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:08,809
I am hungry, give me money.

105
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:12,245
Ah....Stinks!!!

106
00:19:12,245 --> 00:19:15,816
I don't have any money, go away!

107
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:28,392
Are you okay, Bong Soon?

108
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:32,199
Hey, you think you can do anything if you are a son of noble family?

109
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,934
I'm sorry.

110
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:35,704
I didn't mean to ...

111
00:19:35,704 --> 00:19:44,245
You little bastards! Go away!!! How dare you act like this to my young master!!! Bastards!!!

112
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:47,315
Young master, are you okay?

113
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:49,382
Yes.

114
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:53,488
Let's go Gyeom.

115
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:56,856
Yes, father.

116
00:19:56,856 --> 00:20:01,595
Wow! What a meticulous work as if you measured with ruler..!!!

117
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,862
Ah, Prosecutor General's wife is asking for you to drop by.

118
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:11,873
It seems that she is very happy with your sewing skills from last time....

119
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:14,575
Really?

120
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:21,015
Cha Dol, stay here and play for a while.

121
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:23,384
I have to visit the ProsecutorÂ´s Office.

122
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:25,219
Yes, mother.

123
00:20:43,205 --> 00:20:45,639
Who is that rascal?

124
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:47,942
Insolent!

125
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:49,811
Him?

126
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:51,178
You know him?

127
00:20:51,178 --> 00:20:54,682
His father is a notorious petty thief 
 who has been in and out of jail.

128
00:20:54,682 --> 00:20:57,919
They say that his mother's a runaway slave...

129
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,089
I see that he gets his lowly bloodline from both sides.

130
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:06,193
So that low class kid bumped into me 
 and dared to just run off like that?

131
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:11,198
He doesn't know his place and is very arrogant. 
 Many people would like to teach him a lesson.

132
00:21:11,198 --> 00:21:16,904
Then we should remind him 
 what dirty blood runs through his veins.

133
00:22:40,344 --> 00:22:53,239
Thief, thief! There's a thief! There's a thief over there! There is a thief!

134
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,355
Young master, what's the matter?

135
00:22:55,355 --> 00:22:58,464
A thief has stolen that man's belongings.

136
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:11,386
My lord, are you missing anything, sir?

137
00:23:11,386 --> 00:23:13,484
Oh, actually, yes.

138
00:23:13,484 --> 00:23:16,567
Has young master by any chance seen the face of the thief?

139
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:19,698
I saw it.

140
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:24,717
Young master saw his face? Who is it?

141
00:23:32,893 --> 00:23:36,733
I am not a thief. I really don't know what's going on.

142
00:23:42,532 --> 00:23:44,518
Oh my god....That was fast....!

143
00:23:44,518 --> 00:23:48,802
I......no.....

144
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:53,922
What in the world...

145
00:23:53,922 --> 00:23:55,150
Well....My lord...

146
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:05,050
I heard that his father is a thief, too.

147
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,680
You can't expect anything better from such lowly blood.

148
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,420
No, no! My dad is not a thief!

149
00:24:13,697 --> 00:24:17,426
Hey you guys are working hard here.

150
00:24:21,437 --> 00:24:28,665
Whoa! Isn't this Woohwang Chungshimhwan 
 made in Ming (heart calming medicine) that I always hear about?

151
00:24:28,665 --> 00:24:29,858
What's the matter?

152
00:24:29,858 --> 00:24:38,609
There's a tip off that the fake Woohwang Chungshimhwan are being smuggled into our country.

153
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:41,726
We don't do such things. 
 Go ahead and search all you want.

154
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:48,244
Really? I heard that all smuggling items are hidden in the bottom of the boat.

155
00:24:48,244 --> 00:24:49,910
Then lift it up...

156
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,752
Lift it up?

157
00:24:51,752 --> 00:24:55,395
Open those boxes for me, quickly!

158
00:24:55,395 --> 00:24:57,321
Come on....What the...

159
00:25:01,762 --> 00:25:05,713
What is this white stuff?

160
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,300
It is white powder sugar.

161
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,625
Sugar?

162
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:14,039
Wow, it's sweet and melts in my mouth.

163
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:18,088
Damm....Those Aristocrats' mouth must feel good.....

164
00:25:18,088 --> 00:25:21,301
They shove this in their mouths all day and night.

165
00:25:21,301 --> 00:25:25,283
You are pretty chatty?

166
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:30,091
I need to open that box, so hurry 
 and bring me something to open it with.

167
00:25:30,091 --> 00:25:31,715
Sure, go ahead and look all you want!

168
00:25:31,715 --> 00:25:33,740
They are all government authorized merchandises.

169
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,902
Quickly!

170
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:46,957
I am really lucky today.

171
00:25:46,957 --> 00:25:49,864
How much money would each of these fetch?

172
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:54,033
Let me see, I gotta take this for my Cha Dol to eat.

173
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:04,797
Shit!!! Where are all these soldiers coming from?

174
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:05,940
Here it is.

175
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:11,173
Go ahead and open it.

176
00:26:11,173 --> 00:26:15,654
My lord, there was someone else 
 to inspect us earlier. Why do you come again?

177
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:16,315
What are you talking about?

178
00:26:16,315 --> 00:26:18,666
The other person...

179
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:23,920
That person

180
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,370
Oh, no....that thief!! That thief!!!

181
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,587
Where has he gone off

182
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:43,185
Has he gone to heaven?

183
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:47,793
Oh! What the?!

184
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:06,444
Please believe me.....My father is really not a thief!!!

185
00:27:06,444 --> 00:27:08,639
Don't waste my time, hurry up and follow me!

186
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,794
Oh my god, here you are!

187
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:30,176
I heard that Cha Dol has got into trouble at the market.

188
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,339
What do you mean trouble?

189
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:33,246
I am telling you....It is not me!!!

190
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:43,930
Wait!

191
00:27:48,572 --> 00:27:49,799
What's the matter, young master?

192
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,277
Let me see his hands.

193
00:27:52,277 --> 00:27:53,987
Pardon?

194
00:27:53,987 --> 00:27:56,991
Young master, why would you want to see his hand?

195
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,034
Just look at this.

196
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:11,704
See? There are trace of white powder here....

197
00:28:11,704 --> 00:28:13,452
What could it be?

198
00:28:13,452 --> 00:28:15,408
I'm not sure.

199
00:28:15,408 --> 00:28:17,001
Here, taste it.

200
00:28:19,613 --> 00:28:22,800
It tastes kind of sweet.

201
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,334
This is the white powder that's on dried persimmons.

202
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:30,297
When you sun-dry a persimmon, the sugar seeps out 
 and dries into a white powder coating.

203
00:28:30,297 --> 00:28:34,085
Oh, so that is why it tastes sweet.

204
00:28:34,085 --> 00:28:39,726
Father, may I see your hands, please?

205
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:41,008
Here, look.

206
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:43,515
On my father's hands, too, there's no such white powder.

207
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:49,426
On his hand too, no white powder. My father's hands as well!

208
00:28:49,426 --> 00:28:51,057
Then how could there be 
 this white powder on the ornament?

209
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:54,591
I can't be sure.

210
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:57,452
Tell that Young Master to show his hands.

211
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:59,215
Pardon?

212
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:14,062
Seize him!

213
00:29:14,062 --> 00:29:16,077
Gyeom, how did you...

214
00:29:16,077 --> 00:29:17,762
It's nothing.

215
00:29:17,762 --> 00:29:21,314
Earlier I just saw the young master eating a dried persimmon.

216
00:29:21,314 --> 00:29:26,382
You guys should let go of this innocent kid right away.

217
00:29:26,382 --> 00:29:28,211
Yes, my lord.

218
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,316
Young master, thank you so much.

219
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,805
Could I ask what is young master's name...

220
00:29:36,805 --> 00:29:38,921
My name is Gyeom. Lee Gyeom.

221
00:29:38,921 --> 00:29:40,763
And your name, my lord?

222
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:44,121
Mine?

223
00:29:44,121 --> 00:29:46,717
My name is Lee Won Ho.

224
00:29:46,717 --> 00:29:49,379
I definitely will repay your kindness.

225
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:51,120
Don't mention it.

226
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,457
Just grow into a righteous and precious man. 
 That is all I ask.

227
00:29:55,457 --> 00:29:57,284
Isn't that right, Gyeom?

228
00:29:57,284 --> 00:29:58,082
Yes, Father.

229
00:29:58,082 --> 00:30:02,374
No, it's not enough. I will definitely repay you.

230
00:30:02,374 --> 00:30:04,093
Cha Dol!

231
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,331
Mother!

232
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:08,656
What has happened?

233
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:09,885
Are you okay?

234
00:30:09,885 --> 00:30:12,201
It is that lord and the young master who rescued me.

235
00:30:19,202 --> 00:30:23,192
Is he your son?

236
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,352
Let's go, Cha Dol.

237
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:04,490
Mother, what's wrong?

238
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:10,480
It's nothing. I just got dizzy, that's all.

239
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:26,928
Is the food alright?

240
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,964
Yes sir, it is really tasty.

241
00:31:28,964 --> 00:31:30,565
You are a good boy.

242
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:35,269
I thought you would be a picky eater 
 but you eat this kind of food well...

243
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:39,039
My lord!

244
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,311
Why would you protect the child of such a lowly thief?

245
00:31:43,311 --> 00:31:45,714
Did you follow us here because you are still mad about that?

246
00:31:45,714 --> 00:31:50,618
It is because of people like you, my lord, 
 that the order of nobles and commoners is shaken.

247
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,450
The order of nobles and commoners?

248
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:59,950
Young master, When the noble acts nobly, 
 then he can truly be a noble.

249
00:31:59,994 --> 00:32:04,297
That is how you truly maintain public discipline.

250
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:09,838
My lord, you young son has made me lose my face in front of the thief.

251
00:32:09,838 --> 00:32:12,628
You little Rascal! How disappointing you are!

252
00:32:12,628 --> 00:32:14,577
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself what you have done?

253
00:32:14,577 --> 00:32:16,545
How could you say, little villain?

254
00:32:16,545 --> 00:32:20,148
Do you think all aristocrats are equal?

255
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,150
Do you know who I am?

256
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,621
I am Lord Byun Shik's son, the judge of Han Sung.

257
00:32:25,621 --> 00:32:28,489
What? Byun Shik?

258
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:33,195
Okay, then you should return home and tell your father that you have met Lee Won Ho.

259
00:32:33,195 --> 00:32:37,164
Okay, I will relay your message,

260
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:39,668
You'd better prepare for the consequences of your action.

261
00:32:45,707 --> 00:32:46,720
Gyeom!

262
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:46,870
Gyeom!

263
00:32:58,087 --> 00:33:00,722
Gyeom has grown this much already?

264
00:33:00,722 --> 00:33:02,157
I met him when he was only a newborn.

265
00:33:02,157 --> 00:33:06,027
So it has been 8 years since the last time we met.

266
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:08,529
Yes, you indifferent person.

267
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:10,632
You've been keeping a low profile. Are you happy?

268
00:33:10,632 --> 00:33:15,769
Being a free agent has it's own enjoyments.

269
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:21,810
That's right, in the current political climate I really envy you.

270
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:25,513
The way of politics is tough.

271
00:33:25,513 --> 00:33:30,151
On the way here, I have seen that the people are restless.

272
00:33:30,151 --> 00:33:33,922
The war in the year Jung Myeo has long past.

273
00:33:33,922 --> 00:33:37,892
But I didn't anticipate that the wound would be this deep.

274
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:41,963
We only focused on gaining the Ming's favor, 
 and look at what the country has become!

275
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:49,270
Gwanghae(King), indeed, has been very successful 
 in being the ambassador with Ming.

276
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:58,077
You should be careful in expressing your opinion.

277
00:33:58,763 --> 00:34:05,687
Anyhow, I am very worried about his Majesty. 
 That is why I asked to see you to discuss this.

278
00:34:05,687 --> 00:34:08,688
What is wrong?

279
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:16,998
Ever since Lee Shik became a traitor, every year since then there has been traitors uprising against his Majesty.

280
00:34:16,998 --> 00:34:18,499
That's right.

281
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:22,537
Everything is boiled down to greed and power.

282
00:34:22,537 --> 00:34:24,872
Precisely!

283
00:34:24,872 --> 00:34:29,143
So, to fill his empty heart,

284
00:34:29,143 --> 00:34:34,348
His Majesty keeps those people like 
 Byun Shik and Lee Kyung Jun close to him.

285
00:34:34,348 --> 00:34:43,224
I'm worried our gracious king would lose his leadership under those treacherous retainers' control.

286
00:34:43,224 --> 00:34:45,127
Byun Shik!

287
00:35:32,474 --> 00:35:36,144
Mak Se! I have always telling you,

288
00:35:36,144 --> 00:35:39,146
that you must be able to read your master's mind.

289
00:35:39,146 --> 00:35:41,783
If your master's mind turns right, then right,

290
00:35:41,783 --> 00:35:44,252
if his mind turns left, then left,

291
00:35:44,252 --> 00:35:47,954
you should dig the hole.

292
00:35:48,723 --> 00:35:51,857
Father!

293
00:35:52,022 --> 00:35:55,264
Oh, My son!

294
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:01,635
Hold on! What's wrong with your face?

295
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:03,672
Why are you injured?

296
00:36:03,672 --> 00:36:07,142
Who punched my precious son's face?

297
00:36:07,142 --> 00:36:09,111
It's the son of a man named Lee Won Ho.

298
00:36:09,111 --> 00:36:12,847
You must teach him a lesson.

299
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:14,816
Lee Won Ho?

300
00:36:14,816 --> 00:36:19,452
This is from Song, Jang-Lyong...

301
00:36:19,452 --> 00:36:22,091
This is from Hwang, Jorang...

302
00:36:22,091 --> 00:36:24,892
Oh, my! Amber?

303
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:30,998
Darling! There's an insect in here! This is very precious.

304
00:36:30,998 --> 00:36:34,969
Right... Should I make my trinket with this?

305
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:41,143
Oh! Can you please sit down, master? 
 The roof is not going to collapse! (Don't worry)

306
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:44,913
Do you think I can just sit? I can lose my head!

307
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:49,217
Who is that Lee Won Ho guy 
 that can make you feel so agitated?

308
00:36:49,217 --> 00:36:51,220
From what I hear, he's not even a part of the gentry.

309
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:56,725
You're a dummy. 
 If you don't know then just shut your mouth.

310
00:36:56,725 --> 00:36:58,493
That man is His Majesty's....

311
00:36:58,493 --> 00:36:59,294
His Majesty what?

312
00:36:59,294 --> 00:37:00,163
His Majesty's.....

313
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:01,863
Okay. His Majesty what?

314
00:37:01,863 --> 00:37:06,367
Oh gosh, he's the guy His Majesty would just adore to death.

315
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:09,404
How embarassing.

316
00:37:09,404 --> 00:37:15,877
You are really dense! He saved His life!

317
00:37:15,877 --> 00:37:21,215
When his Majesty drove out Gwang Hae and became King, he was the main supporter.

318
00:37:21,215 --> 00:37:25,487
Then you mean our Shi Wan has annoyed such a man?

319
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:26,822
Whew...

320
00:37:26,822 --> 00:37:31,992
Oh...what is going to happen to us?

321
00:37:31,992 --> 00:37:33,862
We can't sit here and wait to die.

322
00:37:33,862 --> 00:37:37,098
Who am I? I'm Byun Shik.

323
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:41,301
Wrap that amber.

324
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:45,271
I don't want to!

325
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:46,397
Shi Hwan...

326
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,676
I'm not going.

327
00:37:48,676 --> 00:37:52,913
Shi Hwan, if you don't go we will be in trouble.

328
00:37:52,913 --> 00:37:59,121
My son! In order to save your father's life, you must go and apologize.

329
00:37:59,121 --> 00:38:03,792
No!! I'm not going. Is toying a thief a crime?

330
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:07,962
Of course you're not guilty. Who says you're guilty?!

331
00:38:07,962 --> 00:38:15,169
But... from all the people, you have touched Lee Won Ho. 
 That's the root of the problem.

332
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:20,607
No! I don't want to! I'm not going!

333
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:26,915
My lord, Why don't you go alone?

334
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:31,289
Oh my...

335
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:42,197
Eun Chae! Can you go with father?

336
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:44,900
If you go and apologize on behalf of your brother,

337
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,905
his heart will melt like snow in spring.

338
00:38:49,905 --> 00:38:52,073
My lord!

339
00:38:52,073 --> 00:38:56,878
It's okay, mother. If I could, I will go and apologize to them.

340
00:38:56,878 --> 00:39:04,019
Oh my beautiful daughter....Who gave birth to this wonderful, obedient daughter?

341
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:08,590
Ok, then let's get going..

342
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:27,039
Mother.

343
00:39:29,908 --> 00:39:33,145
Is it true that father is a thief?

344
00:39:33,145 --> 00:39:35,414
Who told you that?

345
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:39,284
Your father is a admirable man.

346
00:39:39,284 --> 00:39:40,586
Is he?

347
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,989
The noble man whom I just met seems to be really admirable as well.

348
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:46,892
And that young master as well.

349
00:39:46,892 --> 00:39:53,198
That young master seems very precious.

350
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:16,322
Young master, why do you wash a lowly person such as myself's feet?

351
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:20,292
Don't ever consider yourself underprivileged in front of me.

352
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:23,061
To me you're precious...

353
00:40:23,061 --> 00:40:26,632
A precious treasure that is second to none.

354
00:41:06,171 --> 00:41:13,245
Ja Dol, you are precious.

355
00:41:13,245 --> 00:41:16,715
A precious  treasure that is second to none.

356
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:37,636
10 years has passed in a blink of the eyes.

357
00:41:37,636 --> 00:41:42,374
You had born a child that looks exactly like you.

358
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:48,278
You've been doing well.

359
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:54,387
Sure! That's right. You should be happy.

360
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:59,556
What are you thinking about so pensively, sir?

361
00:41:59,556 --> 00:42:02,594
There are visitors.

362
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:20,113
Sir, please forgive my uncivil brother.

363
00:42:20,113 --> 00:42:22,948
Why is it you who come here to apologize?

364
00:42:26,718 --> 00:42:32,191
After knowing what my brother had done, my father punished him with a switch.

365
00:42:32,191 --> 00:42:38,263
My brother's legs are still swollen, thus he can't here to apologize.

366
00:42:38,263 --> 00:42:42,568
He's asked me to come here apologize to you on his behalf.

367
00:42:42,568 --> 00:42:48,538
Therefore, I come here to pay an apology to you sir.

368
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:52,177
She speaks really smoothly for one being so young.

369
00:42:52,177 --> 00:42:57,616
You have a smart daughter.

370
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,352
My son was at fault as well.

371
00:43:00,352 --> 00:43:04,256
But the way, causing your son's face to be injured...

372
00:43:04,256 --> 00:43:06,558
It's not a big deal.

373
00:43:06,558 --> 00:43:11,296
Actually...well, that's how kids grow as they fight, beat and get beaten..... it's not a big deal.

374
00:43:13,278 --> 00:43:15,735
Eun Chae, go outside for a while.

375
00:43:15,735 --> 00:43:17,870
Yes, father.

376
00:43:29,748 --> 00:43:37,357
This is... A token of my sincerity. Please accept it, sir.

377
00:43:37,357 --> 00:43:42,295
I currently serve his Majesty in a very close position.

378
00:43:42,295 --> 00:43:48,697
To his Majesty...

379
00:43:48,697 --> 00:43:54,540
If we look carefully, we could see a bug inside.

380
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:01,580
The amber is evaluated by whether if it has bugs inside or not. Its prices are also differentiated by this method.

381
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,882
What are you doing sir?

382
00:44:51,763 --> 00:44:53,699
Who are you, miss?

383
00:45:06,612 --> 00:45:10,349
I'm sorry. The bird's singing is so melodic.

384
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:14,219
I just wanted to come closer to listen

385
00:45:44,183 --> 00:45:45,785
How is it? Can you hear it clearly now?

386
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:48,887
Yes. What is that bird's name?

387
00:45:48,887 --> 00:45:50,456
It's called whistle bird.

388
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:55,695
Whistle bird? Wow, its singing sounds just like a whistle!

389
00:45:55,695 --> 00:45:58,998
But that bird is very pitiful.

390
00:45:58,998 --> 00:46:01,300
Pitiful? Why?

391
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:10,042
Whistle birds only appear when the titis are blooming and they always hovering around the titis blossoms.

392
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:11,510
Why?

393
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:16,281
Because it consisted of a tragically sentimental story...

394
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,495
Let's go, Eun Chae.

395
00:47:04,999 --> 00:47:08,233
Do you still remember?

396
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:14,407
Everyone gathered to celebrate a successful rebellion and cleanse our swords in this water.

397
00:47:14,407 --> 00:47:20,245
Yes, Already 10 years has passed.

398
00:47:20,245 --> 00:47:26,151
If we hadn't rebelled at that moment...

399
00:47:26,151 --> 00:47:32,692
If Gwang Hae has continued to sit on his throne, this country would not have been like this.

400
00:47:32,692 --> 00:47:40,065
Come to think of it, Gwang Hae was a better choice. Don't you think so?

401
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:45,739
Actually, Gwang Hae's policy to keep peace with the Myung and Post Kim Dynasty were correct.

402
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:49,241
By doing so, it could have prevented war from happening.

403
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:53,045
The civilians' lives won't be harmed as well.

404
00:47:53,045 --> 00:47:57,216
You're right.

405
00:47:57,216 --> 00:48:04,156
It's not too late now. You can't forget our oath, that is, we must build a powerful Chosun for people.

406
00:48:04,156 --> 00:48:06,925
Sir, please keep our oath.

407
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:11,897
There is only my brother who dare to say it out loud now.

408
00:48:11,897 --> 00:48:16,969
That's why the bloodline is very important.

409
00:48:42,161 --> 00:48:48,735
3 days later, at 10 a.m, we will sweep rebels who are plotting to return Gwang Hae to power.

410
00:48:48,735 --> 00:48:50,770
Yes.

411
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:56,541
Put Lee Won Ho among those rebels.

412
00:48:56,541 --> 00:48:59,980
Lee, Lee, Lee Won Ho ?

413
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:05,953
I'm saying...turn Lee Won Ho into the leader of those rebels.

414
00:49:05,953 --> 00:49:09,154
How can I...

415
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:23,707
âª The father is a thief and the son is a thief too ~~âª

416
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:26,576
Step aside! My father is not a thief.

417
00:49:26,576 --> 00:49:30,880
These kids! Those uneducated kids, scram along!

418
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:40,551
I'm gonna smash your skull! You all are nasty children! Scram!

419
00:49:40,551 --> 00:49:45,962
Father... You are not a thief, are you?

420
00:49:45,962 --> 00:49:49,700
Of course I'm not.

421
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,370
Who was the awful person spreading that dreadful rumor?

422
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:57,506
I'm not. I'm not.

423
00:49:57,506 --> 00:49:58,541
Ja Dol.

424
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:00,777
Yes?

425
00:50:00,777 --> 00:50:05,148
I'm sorry.

426
00:50:05,148 --> 00:50:07,150
What?

427
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:10,354
Everything.

428
00:50:10,354 --> 00:50:14,024
I'm sorry for everything.

429
00:50:14,024 --> 00:50:17,394
I'm sorry that I'm not educated,

430
00:50:17,394 --> 00:50:20,464
I'm sorry that I have no money.

431
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:25,636
I'm sorry that I couldn't buy you deliecious foods...

432
00:50:25,636 --> 00:50:27,905
I'm sorry for everything.

433
00:50:27,905 --> 00:50:33,777
No, you are my father whom I love the most.

434
00:50:33,777 --> 00:50:35,379
Truely?

435
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:36,746
Yeah.

436
00:50:36,746 --> 00:50:40,517
Okay, my dear son.

437
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:47,724
Father, I will become a righteous man to make your life better.

438
00:50:47,724 --> 00:50:49,526
A righteous man?

439
00:50:49,526 --> 00:50:54,665
Yes, father. Yesterday, there was a gentleman who told me to become a righteous man.

440
00:50:54,665 --> 00:51:00,003
But father, what must I do to become a righteous man?

441
00:51:00,003 --> 00:51:04,241
First of all, you must study well.

442
00:51:04,241 --> 00:51:06,510
Can I become a righteous man as long as I study well?

443
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:12,115
Of course! If you study hard and pass the court examination, you can become righteous.

444
00:51:12,115 --> 00:51:16,119
That is also a way to make you a noble.

445
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:22,993
Hold on, my Ja Dol. Do you want to go to school?

446
00:51:22,993 --> 00:51:25,028
A school?

447
00:51:25,028 --> 00:51:27,831
Really, father?

448
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:32,669
Yes, yes. We've decided on this. I'll take you to school. We must find a better one.

449
00:51:32,669 --> 00:51:37,474
My precious son.

450
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:42,479
I will never raise you like this foolish father.

451
00:51:42,479 --> 00:51:50,352
I'll do whatever it takes to make my son a righteous man.

452
00:51:54,658 --> 00:52:01,127
Enough! I told you no! I told you not do it anymore.

453
00:52:01,127 --> 00:52:04,334
Oh, I am dying.

454
00:52:04,334 --> 00:52:05,369
I can do it.

455
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:09,306
I'll do it well and hard.

456
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:11,346
Do you need to look at it?

457
00:52:20,117 --> 00:52:23,385
Kye Bok!

458
00:52:23,385 --> 00:52:25,288
Yes, old master!

459
00:52:25,288 --> 00:52:31,228
Go and find a person who are expert in climbing over a wall.

460
00:52:31,228 --> 00:52:33,664
Yes, my master.

461
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,839
Hyung! I swear not to burglarize again.

462
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:48,779
If I burglarize again, I'll chop off my hand.

463
00:52:48,779 --> 00:52:56,153
Well thinking my friend!

464
00:52:56,153 --> 00:53:00,390
However, after I sheathe my sword to its scabbard, I realize I can do nothing.

465
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,359
Nobody wants to hire me.

466
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:07,264
I promised Ja Dol that I'll send him to school.

467
00:53:07,264 --> 00:53:12,202
With this damnable situation, where can I get money for my son's school fee?

468
00:53:12,202 --> 00:53:15,272
He is not your biological son. Why do you need to waste so much of your effort?

469
00:53:15,272 --> 00:53:17,341
Take it easy!

470
00:53:17,341 --> 00:53:20,844
Take what easy man?!

471
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:25,248
Although he is not my biological son, I delivered my Ja Dol with these two hands, uh?

472
00:53:25,248 --> 00:53:28,185
He is no different to my biological son.

473
00:53:31,455 --> 00:53:34,758
This lad. You're really free and liberated.

474
00:53:45,929 --> 00:53:51,008
You only need to bury it beneath the stone of the house which I'll show you.

475
00:53:51,008 --> 00:53:55,079
After you're done, I'll pay you double.

476
00:53:55,079 --> 00:54:00,350
Is it t-t-true I only need to b-b-bury it?

477
00:54:48,366 --> 00:54:51,301
I heard his father is also a thief.

478
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:55,672
Father is a thief,  son must be a thief as well.

479
00:55:44,054 --> 00:55:47,791
Isn't it a trace of blood?

480
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:50,694
I wonder what it is...

481
00:55:50,694 --> 00:55:53,463
It's very suspicious.

482
00:55:53,463 --> 00:55:56,233
This is not normal at all.

483
00:56:16,453 --> 00:56:20,757
So, have you buried it?

484
00:56:28,632 --> 00:56:30,500
Have you been spotted?

485
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:36,306
I don't know how to read so I have no idea what was written inside.

486
00:56:36,306 --> 00:56:42,279
But I can distinguish if it was written by red blood or black ink.

487
00:56:42,279 --> 00:56:45,816
I don't want to do it anymore. Can please find other person, my lord?

488
00:56:49,586 --> 00:56:51,788
What's happening? What are you guys doing?

489
00:56:51,788 --> 00:56:53,023
Move aside!

490
00:56:53,023 --> 00:56:54,591
This fella,

491
00:56:54,591 --> 00:56:59,129
do you really want to die?

492
00:56:59,129 --> 00:57:02,467
Do you think I'll let you go as you please?

493
00:57:02,467 --> 00:57:06,837
Everyone! Do something to help wake him up!

494
00:57:06,837 --> 00:57:08,705
Yes, my lord.

495
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:14,177
Let me go. What are you doing? Let go off my hand.

496
00:57:37,935 --> 00:57:43,175
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

497
00:57:43,175 --> 00:57:44,842
Father!

498
00:57:44,842 --> 00:57:46,810
Ja Dol!

499
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:47,012
Father!

500
00:57:47,012 --> 00:57:49,080
Ja Dol!

501
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:52,781
Let me go!

502
00:57:52,781 --> 00:57:56,653
He was peaking from outside of the door, thus I captured him here.

503
00:57:56,653 --> 00:57:58,856
Why are you here?

504
00:57:58,856 --> 00:58:05,427
My lord, I beg you, my lord. Please forgive my son.

505
00:58:05,427 --> 00:58:11,800
Throw that peeping Tom into the storage house.

506
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:29,653
My lord! My lord! Help me! I'll do it. I'll bury it.

507
00:58:29,653 --> 00:58:34,126
Will you?

508
00:58:34,126 --> 00:58:37,164
Let him go!

509
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:48,372
Oh, oh...

510
00:58:48,372 --> 00:58:53,943
My arm, I can't move it at all.

511
00:58:53,943 --> 00:58:57,014
His arm seems to be out of joint.

512
00:58:57,014 --> 00:59:00,417
If so, he won't be able to climb up the wall anymore.

513
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:03,120
Then... could you let me go...

514
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,288
and my son as well....

515
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:10,929
Though, I can't let you go.

516
00:59:10,929 --> 00:59:17,601
You have already seen the content of the letter. I'll be in trouble if you tell everyone.

517
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:19,870
No, I won't tell anybody.

518
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:22,205
I'll keep my mouth shut like a clam.

519
00:59:25,743 --> 00:59:29,012
Don't kill him, I'll do it for him.

520
00:59:29,012 --> 00:59:33,849
I'll do it for him. I beg you please spare my father's life. I'll do it for him.

521
00:59:42,397 --> 00:59:47,521
If you are spotted, your father will be dead immediately.

522
00:59:47,521 --> 00:59:54,961
Remember it, your father's life is in your hands.

523
01:00:32,932 --> 01:00:34,567
Hey!

524
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:36,602
Uh...

525
01:00:36,602 --> 01:00:38,404
Hey, who are you?

526
01:00:38,404 --> 01:00:40,172
What are you doing here?

527
01:00:52,952 --> 01:00:54,220
My lord

528
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,254
How was it?

529
01:00:55,254 --> 01:00:57,256
He made it.

530
01:01:01,227 --> 01:01:02,762
Where's the boy?

531
01:01:02,762 --> 01:01:05,965
He was prisoned together with his father.

532
01:01:07,733 --> 01:01:12,572
Finish both of them while everyone is sleeping.

533
01:01:12,572 --> 01:01:14,340
What?

534
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,877
He is a little boy. Do you think that his mouth is trustworthy?

535
01:01:17,877 --> 01:01:21,347
If he spreads it around, everything will be over.

536
01:01:23,082 --> 01:01:26,786
Sister!  Sister!

537
01:01:28,621 --> 01:01:30,757
Why are you here this late?

538
01:01:30,757 --> 01:01:32,158
A major problem

539
01:01:32,158 --> 01:01:36,162
Swe Dol and Ja Dol are about to lose their lives.

540
01:01:40,632 --> 01:01:42,068
Swe Dol....!

541
01:01:58,718 --> 01:02:04,257
Please spare their lives, my lord.

542
01:02:04,257 --> 01:02:08,127
Why is it so noisy outside?

543
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:13,831
My lord, please spare their lives, please.

544
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:15,468
Who is she?

545
01:02:15,468 --> 01:02:21,071
Is she that thief's wife?

546
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:25,111
How miserable you guys are!

547
01:02:32,986 --> 01:02:39,993
You.....You are.......Hold on, is that little boy your son?

548
01:02:39,993 --> 01:02:46,832
I beg you, my lord. Please spare my son and my husband.

549
01:02:46,832 --> 01:02:51,437
You're so unfortunate.

550
01:02:51,437 --> 01:02:55,207
How could you be a thief's wife?

551
01:02:57,594 --> 01:03:01,514
Your husband was caught climbing the walls of my house.

552
01:03:01,514 --> 01:03:05,517
Don't be so troublesome and return home now.

553
01:03:05,517 --> 01:03:07,286
That little boy...

554
01:03:13,192 --> 01:03:16,662
Do you really not know who the boy is, my lord?

555
01:03:28,174 --> 01:03:30,343
What?

556
01:03:30,343 --> 01:03:32,778
What are you saying?

557
01:03:32,778 --> 01:03:34,413
Say it again.

558
01:03:34,413 --> 01:03:37,115
Have you forgotten it, my lord?

559
01:03:37,115 --> 01:03:43,823
10 years ago, at that night...

560
01:03:43,823 --> 01:03:47,058
Of course I haven't.

561
01:03:47,058 --> 01:03:51,230
So?....then...?

562
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:56,818
Do you really want to kill your son, my lord?

563
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:07,022
Wh..wh... what are you doing now?

564
01:04:07,022 --> 01:04:15,454
Didn't you like me, when you came to my master's house, my lord?

565
01:04:15,454 --> 01:04:16,307
What?

566
01:04:16,307 --> 01:04:23,881
Didn't you tell my young master that you want to make me your concubine?

567
01:04:23,881 --> 01:04:28,893
That, that, that was... that's because...

568
01:04:28,893 --> 01:04:31,431
Please make me your concubine, my lord.

569
01:04:34,432 --> 01:04:38,014
I'll serve you.

570
01:05:13,775 --> 01:05:19,574
  Young Master, do you see? 

571
01:05:19,574 --> 01:05:27,307
  What I'm doing when I'm pregnant with your child? 

572
01:05:31,195 --> 01:05:33,184
I'm not going.

573
01:05:33,184 --> 01:05:35,901
I don't want to go.

574
01:05:35,901 --> 01:05:41,256
I want to live with father and mother.

575
01:05:46,068 --> 01:05:48,114
Remember!

576
01:05:48,114 --> 01:05:51,313
There is a royal blood running throughout your body

577
01:05:51,313 --> 01:05:55,071
Is it true that I'm a son of that lord?

578
01:05:55,071 --> 01:05:59,478
Yes, you are. You are the son of Lord Byun Shik.

579
01:05:59,478 --> 01:06:02,781
Therefore, you must stop playing with those underprivileged kids.

580
01:06:02,781 --> 01:06:07,074
If you run into me on the street one day, don't call me your mother either.

581
01:06:07,074 --> 01:06:09,859
Mother!

582
01:06:09,859 --> 01:06:13,647
You must grow up to be a noble man.

583
01:06:13,647 --> 01:06:16,863
You must be a righteous man.

584
01:06:16,863 --> 01:06:19,473
You got it?

585
01:06:39,065 --> 01:06:44,081
After he knew that you are not his biological son, he said he didn't want to see you again.

586
01:06:52,988 --> 01:06:56,646
This is a good enough.

587
01:06:56,646 --> 01:07:02,784
It would better for you to be a young master over there than to grow up with a father who is a thief.

588
01:07:02,784 --> 01:07:08,662
Ja Dol

589
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:16,237
I can see you!

590
01:07:16,237 --> 01:07:18,811
I can see you from here!

591
01:07:18,811 --> 01:07:22,324
Ja Dol!

592
01:07:22,324 --> 01:07:29,220
I'm sorry, Ja Dol!

593
01:07:31,856 --> 01:07:39,800
Ja Dol...

594
01:07:44,023 --> 01:07:46,345
You must have been really scared, right Yeon?

595
01:07:46,345 --> 01:07:49,161
I'm ok, mother.

596
01:07:49,161 --> 01:07:54,156
We lost nothing in our house. I don't know what he came here for?

597
01:07:54,156 --> 01:07:58,988
Recently, I heard that many kids have become beggars in the street.

598
01:07:58,988 --> 01:08:02,293
I guess he came here to fill his tummy.

599
01:08:02,293 --> 01:08:05,528
I already ordered the servants to block his escaping path.

600
01:08:05,528 --> 01:08:07,509
You did a good job, my lady.

601
01:08:07,509 --> 01:08:11,266
If he dares to come here again, I won't let him go easily.

602
01:08:12,687 --> 01:08:16,164
Father, please teach me swordplay.

603
01:08:16,164 --> 01:08:17,118
Swordplay?

604
01:08:17,118 --> 01:08:22,185
Yes, father. So I can protect my family from thieves.

605
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:35,125
Look at you now! How will you be able to catch thieves?

606
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:37,624
How will you be able to protect your family?

607
01:08:56,698 --> 01:09:00,732
Losing alertness in front of a sword means death.

608
01:09:00,732 --> 01:09:03,537
Mother!

609
01:09:07,795 --> 01:09:11,322
If it was a real sword, father was already stabbed to death.

610
01:09:11,322 --> 01:09:14,195
Haha, what a despicable boy!

611
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:19,080
I just learned that losing alertness in front of a sword means death.

612
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:22,763
Ok, I admit it. I have lost to you.

613
01:09:26,622 --> 01:09:31,122
Geom, what do you think a sword means?

614
01:09:31,122 --> 01:09:32,664
Yes, father?

615
01:09:32,664 --> 01:09:35,119
There are two types of swords

616
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:38,332
The one is for killing people

617
01:09:38,332 --> 01:09:43,045
On the contrary, the other one is for saving people.

618
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:48,180
I hope you won't have to draw a sword for your entire life

619
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,263
But if all else failed and you have to draw a sword,

620
01:09:51,263 --> 01:09:56,566
It should be a sword for the world and for the people.

621
01:09:56,566 --> 01:09:58,133
You got it?

622
01:09:58,133 --> 01:09:59,753
Yes, I do.

623
01:10:04,272 --> 01:10:07,159
My son is an adult now.

624
01:10:07,159 --> 01:10:12,213
We'll be counting on our Gyum. I can sleep in peace now.

625
01:10:17,551 --> 01:10:24,579
My lady! I suddenly feel like this year the titis are uniquely beautiful.

626
01:10:24,579 --> 01:10:29,976
I feel as if this is scenery that I won't be able to see ever again.

627
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:01,624
Father!

628
01:12:01,624 --> 01:12:05,219
Geom, stay quiet in there and don't move!

629
01:12:05,219 --> 01:12:07,361
And don't even breathe heavily.

630
01:12:07,361 --> 01:12:11,859
Father!

631
01:12:11,859 --> 01:12:15,694
This thing is used to chase devils away.

632
01:12:15,694 --> 01:12:20,975
It'll protect you.

633
01:12:20,975 --> 01:12:25,873
Geom, no matter of whatever happens to me,

634
01:12:25,873 --> 01:12:27,877
You must survive.

635
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:28,704
Father!

636
01:12:28,704 --> 01:12:30,145
Promise me!

637
01:12:30,145 --> 01:12:32,056
that you will be sure to survive.

638
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:34,371
Yes, I will father!

639
01:12:48,069 --> 01:12:50,802
Father! Father! Father!

640
01:13:21,037 --> 01:13:38,328


641
01:13:38,328 --> 01:13:42,037
