1
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:34,706
What was it that you shouldn't have heard?

2
00:00:34,706 --> 00:00:37,729
It's the scam of the century! Lying to all these people!

3
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:40,115
You are... Lee Won Ho's...

4
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,048
Don't do this!

5
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:48,428
He's the most renowned thief in Joseon.

6
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:49,737
He's your brother.

7
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:50,676
I'm the son of a traitor?

8
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,072
This is my palace.

9
00:00:52,072 --> 00:00:53,405
That we killed her brother?

10
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:55,933
You killed my brother, and tried to kill me?

11
00:00:57,272 --> 00:00:58,300
It was you, wasn't it?

12
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:01,594
Byun Shik.

13
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,657
How dare you? In my own house?

14
00:01:03,657 --> 00:01:05,617
I just needed the daughter of the chief of the Royal Guards.

15
00:01:05,617 --> 00:01:07,212
I was just enjoying it for a while.

16
00:01:07,212 --> 00:01:08,384
Who are you?

17
00:01:08,384 --> 00:01:10,392
You killed Lee Won Ho too, didn't you?

18
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:14,335
I did send men to kill them.

19
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:16,343
Who gave you the orders?

20
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:26,294
      Episode 18 

21
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,456
I won't forgive you.

22
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,457
I'm going to kill you.

23
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:33,727
Eun Chae, what are you doing?

24
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,675
Give me the sword.

25
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:46,525
Please let my daughter go. Please.

26
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:51,009
If you don't want to see my sword on your daughter's throat, tell me. Who gave you the orders?

27
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:55,769
Erm... erm...

28
00:01:58,006 --> 00:01:59,806
No! No!

29
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:04,677
Yi Jeong Seob! Yi Jeong Seob! He's the one who did all this.

30
00:02:04,677 --> 00:02:07,580
Yi Jeong Seob? The one who died?

31
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,857
Yes.

32
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:12,757
Lee Won Ho was the main man of the Cheon-woo club.

33
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,894
Lee Won Ho, Shim Gi Won, Gwon Doo Hyun, Kim Ik Hee.

34
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:19,517
Yi Jeong Seob, Seo Young Soo, they were all the main people of the club.

35
00:02:19,517 --> 00:02:22,431
But why did Yi Jeong Seob make Lee Won Ho the traitor?

36
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:24,760
They all played a part in the coup.

37
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,907
But Lee Won Ho was the most beloved by the king, so Yi Jeong Seob got jealous and betrayed him.

38
00:02:31,907 --> 00:02:34,437
And then the others found out about him.

39
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:39,002
So did Yi Jeong Seob kill all the others?

40
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:44,739
Then why did you kill the thief who broke into Seo Young Soo's house?

41
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:49,493
I guess he heard the conversation between Yi Jeong Seob and Seo Young Soo.

42
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:54,040
Yi Jeong Seob personally came here, to the Royal Guards,

43
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,130
and when I came here, the thief was already dying.

44
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,393
Then why did you kill Yi Jeong Seob?

45
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:03,001
No! No! It wasn't me!

46
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:05,861
Why would I kill him?

47
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:08,340
Please believe me.

48
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:14,263
I have told you the truth.

49
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:20,468
Please kill me. Don't kill my daughter.

50
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,914
Please.

51
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:42,330
Who else?

52
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,059
Who else is there in the Cheon-woo club?

53
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:51,802
I don't know anyone else aside from those 6.

54
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:54,300
I really don't know.

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,234
Then... are you Lee Won Ho's son? Lee Geom?

56
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:16,039
How dare you make him a traitor when you made a blood pact?

57
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:20,160
Calm down. I couldn't do anything.

58
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,947
If I didn't do what I was told, they were going to kill me and my family. What could I have done?

59
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:29,323
Please.

60
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:31,964
Please spare my life.

61
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:36,220
Please, let us go. Let us live.

62
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,861
Please let my father go.

63
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,105
No! No! My Eun Chae!

64
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:55,643
If you say anything, I'll make sure you see your daughter again in the heavens.

65
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:57,957
Don't worry. Don't worry.

66
00:04:57,957 --> 00:05:01,742
I didn't see anything, I don't know anything.

67
00:05:18,862 --> 00:05:23,209
Eun Chae! Are you all right?

68
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:26,843
Why did you come here?

69
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:46,649


70
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:52,791
I wanted to bring him to you and make him kneel.

71
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:56,838
But I can't do it anymore.

72
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:00,607
Father.

73
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:04,343
Father.

74
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:01,564
This tree is for Yong. Don't come nearby.

75
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:19,134
How did you know about this place?

76
00:09:19,134 --> 00:09:25,058
I was just passing by and I came here by chance.

77
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:26,673
By chance?

78
00:09:26,673 --> 00:09:29,496
Hey, what is this?

79
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,156
I bought this tree for you.

80
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:46,555
Actually, I wanted to buy this house

81
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:49,245
but there was no chance, with the money I had.

82
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:51,569
Damn it.

83
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:55,577
How come houses are so expensive?

84
00:09:55,577 --> 00:09:59,337
I'll buy the house later, when I make lots of money.

85
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:07,503
Seriously, how did you know about the house?

86
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:09,712
I followed you in secret, some time ago.

87
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:13,425
When you went with my father to that island.

88
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:16,418
But why did you buy the tree?

89
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:21,328
It's a special tree for you.

90
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:26,390
I saw it that day, you were standing here and hugging the tree.

91
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,672
What?

92
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:30,933
When did I do that?

93
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:34,096
You didn't? Shall I sell it back?

94
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:39,864
Why are you like this to me?

95
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:42,084
Why are you being so nice to me?

96
00:10:51,502 --> 00:10:55,334
I will never let this hand go.

97
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:57,822
I will protect you.

98
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:03,499
You don't remember?

99
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:08,029
I recognized you, right when I saw that ornament.

100
00:11:12,347 --> 00:11:14,059
You...

101
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:46,585
What is this place?

102
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:50,964
This is where my father learned about locks.

103
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:54,112
I came with him a couple of times.

104
00:11:54,112 --> 00:11:57,361
You want me to sleep here?

105
00:11:57,361 --> 00:11:59,254
You said you had a hard life.

106
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:03,154
You should go through some more hardship to be mature and get on well with your father again.

107
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:09,752
Just hold on for a day. I'll bring some food and blanket when my mother's not there.

108
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:15,372
Great!

109
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:27,334
But... what happened to you?

110
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:29,296
What do you mean?

111
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:32,328
I heard you had someone to revenge.

112
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:34,576
Did you get your revenge?

113
00:12:34,576 --> 00:12:38,608
Not yet. I will now.

114
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:44,978
Bong Soon!

115
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:50,117
Bong Soon!

116
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:52,804
Bong Soon!

117
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,679
That rat was Lee Geom?

118
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,627
He was alive this whole time?

119
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:21,566
All right. I have to tell His Majesty right away.

120
00:13:22,341 --> 00:13:25,794
No, no. Then my Eun Chae...

121
00:13:28,978 --> 00:13:30,779
Hold on.

122
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:35,245
He thinks it's all Yi Jeong Seob's fault.

123
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:38,907
Sir, there's someone from the palace.

124
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:40,772
Let him in.

125
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:49,787
A message from the offices of the palace.

126
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,491
I brought the message from the King.

127
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:54,537
A message from the King?

128
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:05,638
What? Shi Won! Shi Hoo!

129
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,641
We will start the meeting, Your Majesty.

130
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:16,959
Come up front and pay your respects to the king.

131
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:24,419
You're Lord Byun's son?

132
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:26,197
Yes, Your Majesty!

133
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:30,871
I will be loyal to you until my bones turn to ashes.

134
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,292
You look a lot like your father.

135
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:51,181
Are you the one that Cheon recommended?

136
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:57,377
I  have high expectations from you.

137
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:05,446
You have become part of my personal guards, you will be the ones guarding me from up close.

138
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,485
I hope you will do your best for me.

139
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:10,336
Yes, Your Majesty!

140
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:13,596
I will always be loyal to you, Your Majesty.

141
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:19,828
Your Majesty, they have just arrived.

142
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:21,169
Is that so?

143
00:15:36,137 --> 00:15:38,424
Welcome.

144
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:41,101
You must be tired, from the long trip.

145
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:46,435
Your Majesty, I hope everything has been well.

146
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:53,419
I hear you have already conquered Namkyung from your war in the continent.

147
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,257
It's as it should be, the Emperor deserves all the good fortune.

148
00:15:56,257 --> 00:16:02,455
The Emperor, upon hearing of the crown prince's passing, was very shocked and sad

149
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:06,724
and he has had us come here and pay our respects.

150
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:11,173
He is also very worried that you might not be well

151
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:14,099
because of this incident.

152
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:18,376
I am very flattered of his grace and mercy.

153
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:20,541
Some time ago,

154
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:26,579
I have heard some strange rumors about the crown prince's death, Your Majesty.

155
00:16:29,014 --> 00:16:34,874
He was so healthy in Chung

156
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:40,934
and just two months in Joseon, he suddenly...

157
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:58,503
Well well.

158
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,558
You're here.

159
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:09,270
You're making a household here.

160
00:17:09,756 --> 00:17:13,880
Did the envoy come here simply to pay respects to the crown prince?

161
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:21,285
Your Majesty, you know how much the Emperor trusted and loves the crown prince.

162
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:29,440
Your Majesty, I think Jung Myung Soo might have something else in mind.

163
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:37,684
Chung is raging a great war on the continent. Maybe they want military support?

164
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:39,414
That's my guess.

165
00:17:39,414 --> 00:17:45,865
Then how about we act ahead

166
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,879
and send them soldiers and some military support?

167
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,926
But Your Majesty.

168
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:54,201
We don't have that much strength or resources in our country at the moment.

169
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:58,352
You are so narrow-minded.

170
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:03,048
I understand your point of view.

171
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:07,946
Right now, we have a famine in the country and the people are not well.

172
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:10,266
I am quite worried.

173
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:16,440
So I will do as my people want.

174
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:19,921
What is this?

175
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:24,474
People who would like to share the glory of unification in the continent?

176
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:28,840
We're going to die anyways, take all the arrows for them. Where is the glory in that?

177
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,427
Bastards!

178
00:18:31,427 --> 00:18:34,293
They're just burglars!

179
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:38,145
Have their own children have

180
00:18:38,145 --> 00:18:39,406
all the glory first!

181
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:43,449
10 sacks of rice and 10 rows of cloth?

182
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:45,571
That's what our lives are worth? 10 sacks of rice?

183
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:49,379
Even so, there are going to be quite a few volunteers.

184
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,232
Die of hunger, or die in battle. What's the difference?

185
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:57,538
I guess... if you want the rest of your family to live...

186
00:18:57,538 --> 00:18:59,729
10 sacks of rice?

187
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:04,971
Let's go, Dae Shik.

188
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,841
Yeah... I'm coming.

189
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:21,790
Look here... Here's the man who had an argument with his daughter.

190
00:19:25,161 --> 00:19:27,718
Why did you argue in the first place?

191
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:31,104
Did you run a scam on your own daughter?

192
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:35,290
Where is she? Where's my daughter Bong Soon?

193
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:39,219
She's fine. She's eating well. She's actually eating too much!

194
00:19:40,361 --> 00:19:41,959
Would you like me to tell you where she is?

195
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,340
Are you going to make peace?

196
00:19:46,763 --> 00:19:48,952
No.

197
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:51,160
It's enough, knowing she's fine.

198
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:58,409
Dae Shik, what happened between these two?

199
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:03,202
Where did he go?

200
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:10,009
Your Majesty, the number of volunteers is far behind what we expected.

201
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:14,719
They don't want to be in the front rows of an unjust war

202
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,477
Is that so?

203
00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:25,697
Yes... and due to the famine, we don't have enough rice to send.

204
00:20:27,245 --> 00:20:29,477
What to do?

205
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:37,319
I already promised Jung Myung Soo I would give everything.

206
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,898
Well, I have no other option.

207
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:54,696
Who is there?

208
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,466
If you say anything...

209
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:04,039
Darling!

210
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,494
If you say anything, I will kill this child.

211
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:15,917
I heare there are lots of volunteers.

212
00:21:17,465 --> 00:21:21,961
I went to the training site, and it was full of people!

213
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:26,129
Apparently a bunch of them applied from the surroundings of Hanyang.

214
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:28,955
This is totally unexpected.

215
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,909
Did Dae Shik go somewhere? I haven't seen him since yesterday.

216
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:38,322
Yong! Oh dear oh dear.

217
00:21:38,322 --> 00:21:39,654
What's wrong?

218
00:21:39,654 --> 00:21:42,756
Dae Shik... he volunteered!

219
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:44,362
Volunteer?

220
00:21:44,362 --> 00:21:48,950
He said he was going to sell the rice to look for his father in Chung.

221
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,505
What are you saying?

222
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:51,400
Is that true?

223
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,412
Are you for real?

224
00:21:57,954 --> 00:22:02,784
Indeed, shoes made by the shoemaker at the palace do have a difference.

225
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,664
I will be going now then.

226
00:22:19,744 --> 00:22:21,450
Hey Dae Shik!

227
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:26,817
Hey hey hey.

228
00:22:26,817 --> 00:22:28,275
Do you know how I pleaded with the authorities here?

229
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:29,624
They told you you can go!

230
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:32,691
Let me go! Do you know how much the ship fare costs to Chung?

231
00:22:32,691 --> 00:22:34,242
I couldn't go even if I sold myself.

232
00:22:34,242 --> 00:22:36,648
It's my chance to go there for free!

233
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:40,262
With 10 sacks of rice, I could bring back my father!

234
00:22:40,262 --> 00:22:41,143
Dae Shik!

235
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:45,582
Don't worry. I'm not going to die until I find my father.

236
00:22:45,582 --> 00:22:47,114
Go!

237
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:52,731
Did your son volunteer too?

238
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:54,900
You should have stopped him!

239
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:10,033
My friend is in here. I'll go and see him just a little bit.

240
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:13,349
Where do you think this is? Go away!

241
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:17,198
He shouldn't be here. He will just eat all your reserves!

242
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:20,395
He'll go out in the field and only cause trouble!

243
00:23:20,395 --> 00:23:23,693
He'll probably make rice cakes out of the rice you have for your soldiers.

244
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,523
Yong.

245
00:23:25,523 --> 00:23:27,686
Hey! What are you doing here?

246
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:30,361
Are you here to see Dae Shik?

247
00:23:30,361 --> 00:23:32,028
Yes. Have you seen him?

248
00:23:32,028 --> 00:23:33,131
Yeah.

249
00:23:33,131 --> 00:23:34,979
Why didn't you take him with you?

250
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:39,584
He is dead sure of himself. He says he will go and find his father in Chung.

251
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,056
There's no use stopping him. It's not the  Dae Shik we know.

252
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:48,052
Young man, couldn't you let me see my son for just a bit?

253
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,782
My god.

254
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:55,690
These crazy bastards!

255
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,615
Calm down.

256
00:23:56,615 --> 00:24:04,041
Please! If something happens to my son, I'm going to die!

257
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:09,451
You can't do this!

258
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:13,200
Look here! If you take our children to die in the front

259
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,068
and you want us to starve here?

260
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:19,338
With this drought and famine going on, we barely managed to get this food!

261
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:21,618
Kill me instead!

262
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:23,404
Kill me!

263
00:24:23,404 --> 00:24:25,067
Move away!

264
00:24:29,098 --> 00:24:30,472
When are they going to send it to Chung?

265
00:24:30,472 --> 00:24:34,355
They're having a banquet in 15 days at the palace

266
00:24:34,355 --> 00:24:36,245
and the day right after that.

267
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:52,657
I'll have lettuce and spinach,

268
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,305
and then I will make delicious dishes for Yong.

269
00:25:10,981 --> 00:25:12,171
What is this?

270
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:40,533
Bong Soon.

271
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:49,230
Let me go.

272
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:53,562
I dropped something while I was carrying this box.

273
00:25:53,562 --> 00:25:56,091
I have to go find it.

274
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:57,411
Bong Soon.

275
00:26:05,842 --> 00:26:09,340
What is this?

276
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:14,561
It's all clean and shiny.

277
00:26:14,561 --> 00:26:16,713
How did you make this by the way?

278
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:20,292
My father was also a blacksmith in his days.

279
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:23,363
There's nothing he hasn't done to send me to school.

280
00:26:23,363 --> 00:26:25,215
He taught me some skills then.

281
00:26:25,215 --> 00:26:29,717
My father always said, a man needs to have skills.

282
00:26:37,835 --> 00:26:40,079
Bong Soon, you should leave now.

283
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,135
Why? I'm not going to tell anyone. Never.

284
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:46,131
Your father is very worried about you. Go.

285
00:26:47,247 --> 00:26:49,150
I want to be alone.

286
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,563
All right, I'll leave.

287
00:27:17,437 --> 00:27:20,500
Father.

288
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,824
I still have work to do , right?

289
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:44,932
Palace

290
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:55,634
I will be at the palace in 15 days.

291
00:27:57,023 --> 00:28:04,345
Your Majesty, I believe that thief chose the banquet day on purpose.

292
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:08,776
How about postponing the banquet, Your Majesty?

293
00:28:10,184 --> 00:28:13,959
How could we postpone the royal banquet just because of this thief?

294
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:16,974
Prepare everything as planned.

295
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:29,620
As you can see, at first, he only robbed from the noblemen who belonged to the Cheon-woo club,

296
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,046
like Shim I Yeol, Yi Myung Il, Park Jeong, Kim Yeon, Gu In Woo.

297
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:37,082
But after this, Iljimae suddenly disappeared.

298
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:42,275
That is why there were some rumors about his death, but with the Chung envoy incident,

299
00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:49,210
Iljimae made his appearance again and became the hero of the people.

300
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:54,294
He almost died, but the daughter of the chief of the Royal Guards saved him...

301
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:04,754
After the incident, he became one with the people

302
00:29:04,754 --> 00:29:11,481
the houses of Kim Woo Jin, Oh Gap Soo, and Jung Hyung Geun, the so-called trio, got robbed

303
00:29:11,481 --> 00:29:14,164
and strangely enough, these three were not members of the Cheon-woo club.

304
00:29:14,164 --> 00:29:18,129
However, meanwhile, houses of the members of the Cheon-woo club were still being robbed.

305
00:29:19,918 --> 00:29:26,014
This is as far as Guard Byun, I mean Royal Guard Byun investigated

306
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,018
and I simply drafted the report.

307
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:30,748
Did you call for me?

308
00:29:30,748 --> 00:29:32,246
I will show myself out.

309
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,803
He usually stole properties

310
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:47,135
but there were signs of him looking for something in the homes of the Cheon-woo club members?

311
00:29:50,263 --> 00:29:52,714
Is there something he was looking for?

312
00:29:52,714 --> 00:29:54,711
I am not sure.

313
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:01,925
All right. You may go.

314
00:30:14,594 --> 00:30:18,111
Find out about the daughter of Lord Byun Shik. Right now.

315
00:30:18,111 --> 00:30:20,566
Everything, including her relationship with Iljimae.

316
00:30:22,227 --> 00:30:25,383
Come and choose!

317
00:30:25,383 --> 00:30:28,775
We're not here everyday.

318
00:30:28,775 --> 00:30:34,414
If you think that Iljimae will succeed, pick this red cherry blossom

319
00:30:34,414 --> 00:30:38,157
If you think he won't succeed, then pick this white cherry blossom

320
00:30:38,157 --> 00:30:41,624
You only have one chance. Make your pick.

321
00:30:41,624 --> 00:30:44,726
Choose and pick!

322
00:30:44,726 --> 00:30:47,859
He is born to be a tradesman.

323
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:50,193
Come on, choose, my dear fellows.

324
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:53,480
Even the kids know.

325
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,626
Use your head to think!

326
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:12,571
Where do you think the palace is? Just because he said he would go in, do you think they'll welcome him with open arms?

327
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,900
He is underestimating the palace.

328
00:31:15,936 --> 00:31:19,368
You brat. You should be the one to use your head to think.

329
00:31:19,368 --> 00:31:22,086
You don't know what kind of man is our Iljimae?

330
00:31:22,086 --> 00:31:24,767
There is nothing he can't do once he sets his mind to it.

331
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:25,629
Of course.

332
00:31:25,629 --> 00:31:27,390
He is Iljimae!

333
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:34,380
He is awesome! He is awesome!

334
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,279
He is awesome!

335
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:39,671
Iljimae! Iljimae!

336
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,480
She's conspiring with Iljimae?

337
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,506
Yes, your Majesty.

338
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:54,779
Ever since she saved him with the arrow during the Chung envoy incident,

339
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,824
rumors are going wild in the palace and in the village.

340
00:31:57,824 --> 00:32:00,663
I sent someone to find out more

341
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:03,525
and it seems that it's a solid piece of information.

342
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:05,391
Then grab her.

343
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:11,078
But, the thing is, it's the daughter of Lord Byun Shik.

344
00:32:13,116 --> 00:32:15,398
What?

345
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:17,914
Byun Shik?

346
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:21,863
My my...

347
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,566
If it's in our way, we should get rid of it.

348
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:33,778
Jeju? What?

349
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:38,297
How could he do this to me?

350
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:42,836
Didn't I tell you His Majesty is not feeling well today?

351
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:47,675
He can't do this to me. I have done so much for him!

352
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:51,295
The drafting, and the secret with the crown prince as well!

353
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:58,684
What? What! Jeju?

354
00:32:58,684 --> 00:33:02,218
Tell him he might as well send me on exile!

355
00:33:05,626 --> 00:33:08,644
Don't be too upset.

356
00:33:08,644 --> 00:33:11,905
He must have his ideas.

357
00:33:11,905 --> 00:33:14,154
Ideas? What ideas?

358
00:33:14,154 --> 00:33:20,066
He used me as much as he could, and now he wants to get rid of me!

359
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:29,108
That's why... you should have taken care of your daughter.

360
00:33:30,826 --> 00:33:35,655
Don't forget your sons are in the palace.

361
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:58,421
Do you blame him for getting rid of your father?

362
00:33:58,421 --> 00:34:01,753
He's not my father.

363
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:02,821
What do you mean?

364
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:06,097
My real father is dead.

365
00:34:07,801 --> 00:34:10,394
He doesn't know.

366
00:34:10,394 --> 00:34:15,352
My mother was a maid, and she lied to him.

367
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:21,050
Still, he raised you.

368
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:30,809
A warrior has no need for warm blood.

369
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:34,461
Don't forget that.

370
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:42,436
Yong.

371
00:34:44,848 --> 00:34:45,925
Yong.

372
00:34:58,748 --> 00:35:00,787
You have some orders from nice households.

373
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:03,251
Oh Gap Soo, Jung Hyung Geun, Kim Woo Jin?

374
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:04,126
Yes, Lord Kim Woo Jin.

375
00:35:04,126 --> 00:35:04,807
All right.

376
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:11,177
Hey! Ouch!

377
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:13,601
Hey, they got robbed!

378
00:35:13,601 --> 00:35:18,338
The houses of Oh Gap Soo, Jung Hyung Geun, and Kim Woo Jin got robbed  yesterday.

379
00:35:18,338 --> 00:35:18,905
What?

380
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:26,362
Hey, what are you doing here?

381
00:35:26,362 --> 00:35:29,394
I had some materials to buy for the shoes.

382
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:30,768
Hey, but it's so weird.

383
00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:31,288
What is?

384
00:35:31,288 --> 00:35:34,878
You remember how I told you the date of the banquet the other day?

385
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:36,220
Yeah.

386
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,426
But that date is only known to people within the palace.

387
00:35:40,426 --> 00:35:44,120
But how did Iljimae know about it and said he would come that day?

388
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:49,015
And Iljimae can't be someone from the palace, right? It's weird, isn't it?

389
00:35:49,976 --> 00:35:53,883
Indeed. It's very weird. Maybe there's a spy.

390
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:56,501
I'm so hungry!

391
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:58,502
Pretty Dan! I'm hungry!

392
00:35:58,502 --> 00:36:00,016
Are you really going to rob the palace?

393
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:05,252
Hyung.

394
00:36:05,252 --> 00:36:11,475
Hey! Is it really you? Are you really Iljimae?

395
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,452
What the? You're not gone yet?

396
00:36:22,378 --> 00:36:26,670
Ta-da! So? How is it? It's look real, doesn't it?

397
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:29,441
This is...

398
00:36:29,441 --> 00:36:33,918
It's the entry pass for the palace. A palace is not like some nobleman's house, you know.

399
00:36:33,918 --> 00:36:39,345
You can't possibly climb over the walls. Use this to go in there proudly.

400
00:36:39,345 --> 00:36:40,811
You...

401
00:36:40,811 --> 00:36:43,250
The word has spread all over town.

402
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,450
I bet on your success,

403
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,415
so if you fail, you're dead meat.

404
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,860
How can you make such a thing?

405
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:58,713
Why do you think I ran a perfect scam with my father? I can do other things besides this.

406
00:36:58,713 --> 00:37:01,126
There's nothing I can't counterfeit.

407
00:37:01,126 --> 00:37:02,663
You're amazing.

408
00:37:02,663 --> 00:37:05,188
If it's to make money, I can do anything.

409
00:37:05,188 --> 00:37:07,750
I'll make more, just in case.

410
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:57,167
I'm sorry, Bong Soon. Because of me, your brother

411
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:00,719
I'll protect you.

412
00:38:10,004 --> 00:38:13,523
I won't let this hand go.

413
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:29,993
Bong Soon.

414
00:38:30,589 --> 00:38:31,946
Bong Soon.

415
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,986
What?

416
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,814
You like it?

417
00:39:52,814 --> 00:39:54,206
Yes.

418
00:39:56,562 --> 00:40:03,205
After I've robbed the palace and freed Dae Shik and all the others that have been unfairly taken,

419
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:08,183
I'll find my real mother and with my mother now, we're all going to leave Hanyang.

420
00:40:08,183 --> 00:40:12,270
Really?

421
00:40:15,822 --> 00:40:19,731
You want to come with us?

422
00:40:24,738 --> 00:40:27,454
I...

423
00:40:27,454 --> 00:40:31,693
haven't really gotten over the one I had in my heart.

424
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,542
It may take a while.

425
00:40:37,555 --> 00:40:43,021
She may always be in my heart.

426
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:53,006
Still... do you want to come with me?

427
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:57,862
Yes.

428
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:15,645
Wow... this is the map of the palace? How did you get hold of this?

429
00:41:15,645 --> 00:41:18,103
Maybe I have the blood of Iljimae flowing in my veins too.

430
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:21,164
I stole it from the royal architecture room.

431
00:41:21,164 --> 00:41:23,380
Now we're accomplices, ok?

432
00:41:24,258 --> 00:41:30,130
This was made in honor of the present king after the coup, so it is the most precise one.

433
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,284
You have to have at least this to properly rob the place, don't you?

434
00:41:33,284 --> 00:41:34,170
Yeah.

435
00:41:34,722 --> 00:41:38,467
Yong! Taste this! I washed it in the mountain water.

436
00:41:38,467 --> 00:41:41,265
Later!

437
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:44,031
Taste this! Come on!

438
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:46,647
Come on! Eat!

439
00:41:47,974 --> 00:41:49,920
Eat while I'm still being nice!

440
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,528
Hey hey hey!

441
00:41:52,528 --> 00:41:55,366
Bong Soon! Do you know what it took me to get this map?

442
00:41:56,785 --> 00:41:58,306
Hey!

443
00:41:58,306 --> 00:42:01,097
Don't rub it! You're spreading the ink!

444
00:42:01,097 --> 00:42:03,602
Why do you want me to eat that all of a sudden?

445
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,927
Did you call for me?

446
00:42:13,927 --> 00:42:19,588
Did you know that your sister was in conspiracy with Iljimae?

447
00:42:19,588 --> 00:42:21,359
They are just false rumors.

448
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,654
She is not.

449
00:42:22,654 --> 00:42:24,648
If

450
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:27,779
that was true

451
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:32,934
You said that a warrior is in no need for warm blood.

452
00:42:32,934 --> 00:42:35,119
I keep those words close to my heart.

453
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:50,991
The high council, the Okcheon bridge.

454
00:43:03,011 --> 00:43:05,587
I suddenly saw something that wasn't there in the first place.

455
00:43:05,587 --> 00:43:08,466
Oh, it got wet, didn't it?

456
00:43:08,466 --> 00:43:11,500
What? Oh, yeah.

457
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:18,554
It was on a red paper, right? They hid the writings on purpose. Do you have it with you?

458
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,334
What?

459
00:43:19,334 --> 00:43:24,362
If you write with a special ink and put glue upon it, the writings disappear.

460
00:43:24,362 --> 00:43:29,941
People sometimes play those tricks.

461
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,104
Then how can I see the hidden writings again?

462
00:43:33,472 --> 00:43:34,960
Put mountain water on it.

463
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,352
If you put it, you'll see the writings again on the red paper.

464
00:44:19,512 --> 00:44:22,443
Kim Ik Kee, Gwon Doo Hyung,

465
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:25,487
my father Lee Won Ho, Yi Jeong Seob,

466
00:44:25,487 --> 00:44:29,299
Shim Gi Won, Seo Young Soo.

467
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:33,895
This pattern!

468
00:44:36,244 --> 00:44:38,692
What is this?

469
00:44:38,692 --> 00:44:42,581
Is the sword in the palace?

470
00:44:45,363 --> 00:44:47,499
Who else is there?

471
00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:50,455
Who else is there among the main people of the Cheon-woo club?

472
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:55,387
I only know those 6.

473
00:44:55,387 --> 00:44:57,947
I really don't know.

474
00:44:57,947 --> 00:45:02,693
The sword that killed my father had the pattern of all these 6 assembled together.

475
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:08,761
Then... there's someone else.

476
00:45:11,528 --> 00:45:14,992
Let me do it.

477
00:45:16,264 --> 00:45:18,095
I

478
00:45:18,095 --> 00:45:20,114
She has nothing to do with me.

479
00:45:20,114 --> 00:45:23,241
Are you sure you can do this?

480
00:45:23,241 --> 00:45:25,081
Trust me.

481
00:45:44,955 --> 00:45:47,319
Brother.

482
00:45:54,648 --> 00:45:56,671
Leave.

483
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:08,713
I'll ask you one last time

484
00:46:08,713 --> 00:46:10,496
Where is Iljimae?

485
00:46:10,496 --> 00:46:16,509
I told you I don't know.

486
00:46:16,509 --> 00:46:19,105
How could I possibly know a thief like him?

487
00:46:39,169 --> 00:46:40,781
Good.

488
00:46:48,395 --> 00:46:49,852
Bong Soon.

489
00:46:51,001 --> 00:46:53,034
Bong Soon.

490
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,344
What?

491
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:56,524
Miss Eun Chae?

492
00:46:56,524 --> 00:47:03,115
Yes, apparently she had some kind of relationship with Iljimae.

493
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:09,744
Then...then... Miss Eun Chae must have seen Iljimae's face too!

494
00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:16,253
Wait wait... then...

495
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:19,119
what happens to your Miss?

496
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,550
I don't know... They said they will kill her.

497
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:27,275
Miss! Miss Eun Chae!

498
00:47:50,084 --> 00:47:53,517
Yong, I'm sorry.

499
00:47:53,517 --> 00:48:01,065
I can't forgive the man who killed my parents and my brother.

500
00:48:02,042 --> 00:48:05,387
And I don't think I can leave with you.

501
00:48:13,302 --> 00:48:14,653
My dear husband!

502
00:48:14,653 --> 00:48:16,971
My dear husband!

503
00:48:16,971 --> 00:48:18,974
Did you hear?

504
00:48:18,974 --> 00:48:25,027
They took away the daughter of Lord Byun because they want to catch Iljimae!

505
00:48:46,064 --> 00:48:51,858
Do you like the present? Next time, I will give you her head.

506
00:48:51,858 --> 00:48:59,183
If you want to save her, come to the abandoned warehouse behind the Mokmyun hill.

507
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,143
Don't go. They will kill you.

508
00:49:19,143 --> 00:49:21,030
If I don't go, she will die.

509
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:24,189
She won't die. It's only a bait to catch you.

510
00:49:24,189 --> 00:49:28,051
They cut off her finger.

511
00:49:30,417 --> 00:49:33,363
I'm sorry Bong Soon.

512
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:39,055
You said you were going to leave. You were going to leave with your mother.

513
00:49:39,055 --> 00:49:41,779
You were going to take me too.

514
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:46,090
Let's go. Let's go now. I'll go fetch your mother.

515
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:50,537
I can't let her die.

516
00:49:50,537 --> 00:49:53,557
If you go there now you will die.

517
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:56,596
They will kill you.

518
00:49:56,596 --> 00:50:00,978
Then I'm going too.

519
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:04,129
I'll protect you.

520
00:50:04,129 --> 00:50:09,148
I am ready to die for you.

521
00:50:09,148 --> 00:50:17,115
Bong Soon, please stay alive. For me.

522
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:22,929
What is she to you?

523
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:36,606
All right. Go.

524
00:50:36,606 --> 00:50:39,215
Go and find back your heart.

525
00:50:46,638 --> 00:50:49,963
Then

526
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:54,336
at least

527
00:50:54,336 --> 00:50:57,721
leave my heart behind.

528
00:52:18,822 --> 00:52:20,362
Hang him.

529
00:52:32,667 --> 00:52:34,304
I don't want her to see me.

530
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:26,392
Why do you want to rob the palace?

531
00:53:26,392 --> 00:53:28,650
Why?

532
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:33,788
The people that have been unfairly captured, the food that has been taken away from them!

533
00:53:33,788 --> 00:53:39,589
No, nothing like that. The real reason you want to rob the palace.

534
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:43,982
What is it that you want to take away?

535
00:53:43,982 --> 00:53:48,625
I simply want to know the truth.

536
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,666
The truth? What truth?

537
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:54,628
There is a truth behind the object you are so curious about

538
00:53:54,628 --> 00:53:59,604
and that I am so desperate to find.

539
00:54:07,964 --> 00:54:15,306
Apparently the finger was not enough. You want her head, don't you?

540
00:54:15,306 --> 00:54:17,276
Tie him.

541
00:54:26,212 --> 00:54:31,101
Yong... please save my Yong.

542
00:54:32,575 --> 00:54:35,295
Please.

543
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:49,813
Right. Now her life lies entirely in your hands.

544
00:54:51,099 --> 00:54:54,860
Once the sand bags tied to your body fall off

545
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:58,502
do you see what is going to happen to her?

546
00:55:06,082 --> 00:55:08,780
Are you really not going to tell me?

547
00:55:15,584 --> 00:55:20,363
I'll count up to three. One.

548
00:55:24,351 --> 00:55:27,084
Why don't you just kill me?

549
00:55:28,322 --> 00:55:30,004
Two.

550
00:55:34,088 --> 00:55:35,635
Where did Sa Cheon go?

551
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:44,784
Let her go! Then I will answer you.

552
00:55:47,766 --> 00:55:52,991
Did you forget? I'm already up to two.

553
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,557
I found out. I'll go and save him

554
00:56:01,557 --> 00:56:03,780
you stay put at the inn. Don't go anywhere.

555
00:56:08,105 --> 00:56:10,033
Three.

556
00:56:11,831 --> 00:56:13,567
No!

557
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,089
No!

558
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,483
I'll ask you one last time.

559
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:29,461
What is the object you want to steal?

560
00:56:35,154 --> 00:56:42,540
Apparently she is not that precious to you. 
 Fine.

561
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:47,455
I'll kill her for you. Let him go.

562
00:56:47,455 --> 00:56:50,616
Fine!

563
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:53,112
The object I want to find is

564
00:56:56,485 --> 00:57:02,441
is right here. In my heart.

565
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:05,226
I'm not lying to you.

566
00:57:05,226 --> 00:57:07,820
I promise you on her life.

567
00:57:32,586 --> 00:57:35,954
Don't move! If you move he's dead.

568
00:57:37,345 --> 00:57:39,575
Take out your knife.

569
00:57:44,664 --> 00:57:46,874
Cut it off.

570
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:11,932
Get up!

571
00:58:13,608 --> 00:58:15,528
Don't kill him.

572
00:58:15,528 --> 00:58:17,335
We must catch him alive.

573
00:58:20,389 --> 00:58:22,094
What was that?

574
01:01:10,537 --> 01:01:11,759
Why did you help me?

575
01:01:11,759 --> 01:01:15,297
Don't get yourself ideas. It's not you that I was helping.

576
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:23,117
I wanted to get you. Insanely.

577
01:01:23,117 --> 01:01:28,336
I have something I need to find. I won't get caught before that. There is no way!

578
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:45,233
Kill me.

579
01:01:45,233 --> 01:01:47,301
No!

580
01:01:49,298 --> 01:01:54,258
Please let my brother go.

581
01:01:54,258 --> 01:01:54,971
Please.

582
01:01:54,971 --> 01:01:57,714
Why the hesitation? Kill me!

583
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,595
I don't kill.

584
01:02:00,595 --> 01:02:06,256
I will use my sword to save people. 
 That's what my father taught me.

585
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:17,629
Don't you ever turn your back on me again!

586
01:02:17,629 --> 01:02:21,866
I will kill you from behind.

587
01:02:23,258 --> 01:02:27,074
Whoever stands in my way. Be it friend or foe!

588
01:02:31,022 --> 01:02:36,954
I will kill. No matter when.

589
01:02:48,361 --> 01:02:51,805
You will have a scar.

590
01:02:51,805 --> 01:02:57,686
And I will remain as a scar to you.

591
01:02:59,469 --> 01:03:04,872
A scar so ugly you won't want to see again.

592
01:03:06,395 --> 01:03:12,226
I will cherish my scar.

593
01:03:38,462 --> 01:03:46,911
My brother's hand has always been as lovely as a woman's hand.

594
01:03:59,094 --> 01:04:03,490
How dare you?

595
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:05,898
Do you love that girl?

596
01:04:32,885 --> 01:04:34,222
Over there!

597
01:04:58,212 --> 01:05:03,487
You are safe here, so stay here. I will call for someone.

598
01:05:04,925 --> 01:05:09,018
Please don't go. It's dangerous outside.

599
01:05:09,018 --> 01:05:14,534
I have to go. There's something I need to find.

600
01:05:14,534 --> 01:05:19,677
I'm almost there.

601
01:05:30,447 --> 01:05:34,603
You were my first love

602
01:05:34,603 --> 01:05:42,076
and you will be my last.

603
01:05:42,076 --> 01:05:51,764
So please, just once, just this once,

604
01:05:51,764 --> 01:05:54,760
show me your face.

605
01:05:56,762 --> 01:06:03,685
So that I may forever live with your memory.

606
01:06:32,933 --> 01:06:51,929


607
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,700
