1
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,130
What is this?

2
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,819
It's all clean and shiny.

3
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,099
Palace.

4
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:40,331
Are you really Iljimae?

5
00:00:40,778 --> 00:00:44,910
If you put mountain water on it, you will see the hidden message again.

6
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:48,796
Next time it will be her head.

7
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:50,446
Go and find your heart back.

8
00:00:50,446 --> 00:00:52,841
Why do you want to rob the palace?

9
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:54,726
I simply want to know the truth.

10
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:02,790
I use my sword to save people.

11
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,523
Don't you ever turn your back on me.

12
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:09,489
You were my first love.

13
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:11,222
And you will be my last.

14
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:14,124
Please, just this once, show me your face.

15
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,928
How dare you?

16
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:54,581
 Episode 19 

17
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,812
We are in pursuit of Iljimae.

18
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,196
Bong Soon.

19
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:12,176
Bong Soon.

20
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:14,710
Yong, you're here.

21
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,009
My husband came running, telling me to give you this.

22
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:19,707
Is something wrong?

23
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:29,378
Yong.

24
00:02:29,378 --> 00:02:35,119
Bong Soon has lived her whole life

25
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:37,008
thinking of a way to revenge her dead parents and brother.

26
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,392
But now, she is not thinking of revenge,

27
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:50,265
she is willing to die for you.

28
00:03:04,012 --> 00:03:09,319
I can't just let her go,

29
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,878
my Bong Soon, my poor daughter.

30
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:16,967
Yong, if I die,

31
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:19,261
please take care of Bong Soon.

32
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:20,407
No!

33
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:22,620
No, Bong Soon, please.

34
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,641
She has had her hardship.

35
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:36,153
Kill  him.

36
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:54,508
Let me kill him.

37
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:55,306
You...

38
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,807
Because of that Iljimae,

39
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,302
my daughter died.

40
00:04:02,302 --> 00:04:04,577
Cheon.

41
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,489
Let me kill him with my hands.

42
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:10,470
He did have a daughter.

43
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:19,187
All right.

44
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:21,532
Yong Jae.

45
00:04:21,532 --> 00:04:24,423
I haven't seen that look on your face in a long time.

46
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:24,818
Yes,

47
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:27,626
that is the true you, Yong Jae.

48
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:29,585
Give him a sword.

49
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:43,389
My brother.

50
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:44,313
Go away!

51
00:05:44,313 --> 00:05:46,389
I don't want to be sold away.

52
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,301
Bong Soon.

53
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:56,205
Don't be scared.

54
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:59,443
Your father will be with you.

55
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:09,253
Bong Soon.

56
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,662
Find the bodies.

57
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:33,139
Reconstructing the royal Myung Empire?

58
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,701
Yes, Your Majesty.

59
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:40,080
The soldiers of the Myung empire want to recreate the brilliance of the old empire

60
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,690
and are in alliance with all the forces on the continent that are against Chung.

61
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,840
They sincerely want you

62
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,769
to help them in their efforts to recreate the Myung empire.

63
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:56,038
How could  I?

64
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,352
Your Majesty, the Myung soldiers

65
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:02,218
are in desperate need of soldiers and resources.

66
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:05,717
But I do not have the power or the resources.

67
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:10,726
Don't you have soldiers and resources ready to be sent to Chung?

68
00:07:10,726 --> 00:07:12,583
You want to have those?

69
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,779
Furthermore, Your Majesty,

70
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:22,068
the Myung soldiers sincerely want you to allow Joseon to be the core territory of the reconstruction.

71
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:25,177
What?

72
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:28,434
Are you saying you want a full war against Chung on this land?

73
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:35,662
Your Majesty, without the Myung empire, you wouldn't be here either.

74
00:07:35,662 --> 00:07:38,760
Didn't you get rid of Gwanghae and succeed the coup

75
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,875
thanks to the full support of the Myung empire?

76
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,709
However, the Myung empire has already declined

77
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:52,408
and with two wars, I have lost all faith from the people.

78
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,237
And you want me to have yet another war?

79
00:07:58,302 --> 00:07:59,670
You may leave.

80
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:07,949
I have come across an object some time ago, out of pure coincidence.

81
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:21,235
Why is Gwon Doo Hyung's note in his hands?

82
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:26,912
If I don't abide by his request, he says he will send that note to Chung.

83
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:34,369
I can't just go like this. It took me so much to take and maintain this position.

84
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:37,409
Cheon. 
 Yes, Your Majesty.

85
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:42,384
If the Myung soldiers could indeed destroy Chung

86
00:08:42,384 --> 00:08:46,884
it wouldn't necessarily bad for us, would it?

87
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:48,148
However.

88
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:51,384
The sword is in Kim Min Young's hands.

89
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:54,216
Do everything he asks.

90
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:58,459
But nobody must notice. Proceed in secret.

91
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:01,318
If they find out earlier

92
00:09:01,318 --> 00:09:03,477
everything will be over.

93
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:08,184
I will follow true to your words, Your Majesty.

94
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,707
Heung Kyun is here.

95
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:28,499
Come in.

96
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,628
Until when are you going to stay like this?

97
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:54,425
The banquet is in two days. Aren't you going to rob the palace?

98
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:57,946
Bong Soon's older brother,

99
00:09:57,946 --> 00:10:01,353
he died because of me.

100
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:05,819
And this time, it's Bong Soon

101
00:10:08,054 --> 00:10:09,197
Bong Soon.

102
00:10:09,197 --> 00:10:13,685
Do you think ahjussi and Bong Soon will be happy to see you like this?

103
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:17,477
What about Dae Shik? Are you just going to send him to Chung?

104
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:20,006
Are you going to let him die in the front?

105
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:27,599
That's not all. All of Joseon is mourning because they think you're dead. My father is lying down, unable to eat.

106
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:34,474
The palace is full of rumors that there will be another war.

107
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:39,149
It would seem that the king promised Myung that Joseon could be their battle field.

108
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,040
I shouldn't have had my memory back.

109
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:10,128
Then, Bong Soon,

110
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:14,094
ahjussi, my sister, my father,

111
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:17,069
none of them would have died.

112
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:23,940
Father

113
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,905
I will find him.

114
00:11:26,905 --> 00:11:31,315
I will find him and get my revenge.

115
00:12:00,562 --> 00:12:04,136
Wow, this is so precious! You didn't have to.

116
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:12,739
But, I hear you are being sent to Jeju?

117
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:15,914
Where does he expect to find another loyal man like you?

118
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:20,494
That is exactly what I mean!

119
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:24,579
I have been so loyal to the king during all this time!

120
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:31,582
I noticed, the king doesn't know how to distinguish great people.

121
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:34,124
Do you think that is all?

122
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:38,306
In front of all the council, he bites his nails

123
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,848
like this.

124
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:45,083
He throws ink to catch a fly.

125
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:52,693
Just wait and stay low for a while.

126
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:55,678
I will put in a good word to the emperor.

127
00:12:55,678 --> 00:13:00,330
My dear sir,

128
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:06,017
I will put my faith in you and stay calm.

129
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:12,742
You?

130
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:14,476
Why are you so late?

131
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:16,156
Is this going to become a habit?

132
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:17,415
The banquet is in two days.

133
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:18,819
Yong.

134
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:21,137
This represents the sky, this means friendship

135
00:13:21,137 --> 00:13:24,935
the core members of the Cheon-woo club divided the characters and had them engraved on their body.

136
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:28,504
Kim Ik Hee

137
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:29,967
Gwon Doo Hyung

138
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:31,054
Yi Jeong Seob

139
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:33,015
Seo Young Soo

140
00:13:33,015 --> 00:13:34,302
and this was probably

141
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:36,616
Shim Gi Won.

142
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:39,370
And this

143
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,035
was on my father

144
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:43,117
That's the pattern.

145
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:44,554
Did you see it?

146
00:13:44,554 --> 00:13:46,959
Yes, when I was a kid.

147
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,083
But the sword that killed my father

148
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:53,032
has all these 6 patterns assembled together

149
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,656
like this pattern.

150
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:57,966
Then... that means there's another one?

151
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:01,828
I think so. The one who killed Yi Jeong Seob,

152
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:04,256
is the real murderer who killed my father.

153
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:08,199
Do you think you will find the murderer by going into those houses?

154
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:12,278
I will either find the sword or some clues

155
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:13,516
to find the real murderer.

156
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:18,971
But you will have to search through the houses, how will you free Dae Shik and the others?

157
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:21,322
There will be over a hundred soldiers in the palace.

158
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:23,896
- It's impossible. 
 - I can do it.

159
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,095
Then, let's get some help.

160
00:14:27,095 --> 00:14:30,461
No. I will do it alone.

161
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:34,335
I don't want anyone to take risks anymore because of me.

162
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:39,164
Hey, why is this because of you? This is about freeing Dae Shik and all the other ones.

163
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:42,816
If you go in alone, thinking you're so great, do you think you'll be the only one to die?

164
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,953
Everyone in there will die too!

165
00:14:44,953 --> 00:14:46,800
And if you get caught, do you think I will be safe?

166
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,011
And what about your mother?

167
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,495
Why this rain all of a sudden?

168
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:57,261
Hey! Gather all the tools before they get wet!

169
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:57,776
Yes sir.

170
00:14:57,776 --> 00:15:00,586
Hyung! Hyung!

171
00:15:00,586 --> 00:15:02,037
Hyung.

172
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:02,841
What is it?

173
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:06,726
Yong about to fight with the Bull's Head gang

174
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:09,054
there is word everywhere.

175
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:11,131
You fool. Who is saying such a stupid thing?

176
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:13,879
Yong has been staying put at his home for days,

177
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,948
because Bong Soon left him.

178
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:21,781
Anyway, when were they ever in a relationship?

179
00:15:21,781 --> 00:15:22,792
No!

180
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:26,299
It's true! Yong told me himself!

181
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:28,089
What?

182
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:34,266
Then... does that mean that Bong Soon had eyes for the Bull's Head gang?

183
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,816
Damn it.

184
00:15:35,816 --> 00:15:37,748
Hey!

185
00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:40,759
Gather your tools.

186
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,925
Yes sir.

187
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:46,445
Poison?

188
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:52,759
Yes, he definitely brought aconite. And aconite is often used as a poison.

189
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,071
I think the crown prince...

190
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:58,217
Oh come on, that's nonsense. How could he have killed his own son?

191
00:15:58,217 --> 00:16:01,750
You're always so negative.

192
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,193
You must be right.

193
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:05,569
How is it? It's much more comfortable than before, right?

194
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:08,496
Yes, so much more. Thanks.

195
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:11,586
Don't mention it.

196
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:13,601
Here. Put this on too.

197
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:20,756
What is this?

198
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:23,517
Where are they all?

199
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:25,326
Are you sure it's here?

200
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:27,701
If I get caught, you may die.

201
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:30,947
That would devastate your father.

202
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:32,965
Good thinking.

203
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:48,294
What is this?

204
00:16:48,294 --> 00:16:50,073
Where is our Yong?

205
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:59,739
Are you the head of the Bull's Head gang? You're dead man.

206
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:01,978
Isn't it Iljimae?

207
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:04,466
Iljimae died...

208
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:05,262
It's Iljimae!

209
00:17:05,262 --> 00:17:06,963
Iljimae!

210
00:17:06,963 --> 00:17:12,021
Then... you... you... you... are you Iljimae?

211
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:17,070
Have you seen Yong?

212
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:21,731
Oh come on.

213
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:22,878
It's me Yong.

214
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:25,341
Yong!

215
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:28,020
Hello, my brothers.

216
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:32,165
It's an honor, Iljimae.

217
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:33,460
It's an honor.

218
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,518
Oh come on.

219
00:17:37,277 --> 00:17:38,530
Help me out.

220
00:17:46,144 --> 00:17:49,497
Right, I hear your father is leaving today.

221
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:51,347
Yes sir.

222
00:17:51,347 --> 00:17:52,707
You may go.

223
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:58,790
No way I'm out of this. Don't you worry.

224
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:04,109
I will have all the gangs ready.

225
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:04,992
Thank you, hyung.

226
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:08,574
Hey, no problem, I'm the one who's honored.

227
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:13,708
But... the one we thought was Iljimae and died, who was that?

228
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:19,121
All right, listen to me carefully.

229
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:21,798
I will divided in two teams: inside the palace and outside.

230
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:24,366
Heung Kyun and I will go into the palace

231
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:27,078
Good. I'll be inside anyways.

232
00:18:27,078 --> 00:18:28,635
Good!

233
00:18:28,635 --> 00:18:32,617
And for the outside team, have the Castor Oil gang and the others take care of it.

234
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:34,311
All right!

235
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:37,680
Yong! Geom!

236
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,707
Hey, Geom!

237
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,714
Hunter Jang!

238
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:49,562
What are you doing here?

239
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:53,950
Can't you let me in this one?

240
00:18:56,317 --> 00:19:00,731
Go. You're too old. You can't be part of this. Go!

241
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:02,293
Go!

242
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:08,469
I expected this much. So I brought in a young one.

243
00:19:08,469 --> 00:19:10,393
Come in. Come in!

244
00:19:12,348 --> 00:19:13,654
Hello.

245
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,333
Hello hyung.

246
00:19:16,184 --> 00:19:18,123
What is this?

247
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,171
Father...

248
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,934
Yong. That Dosa bastard is looking for you.

249
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:29,216
What? The Dosa? I heard he was in the palace.

250
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:33,661
Why is he looking for him when we're in the middle of this important thing?

251
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:37,364
Hey, go and tell him he can wait in the palace.

252
00:19:37,364 --> 00:19:38,600
He will be there shortly.

253
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,308
No, it's fine. I'll go. I have to find out something.

254
00:19:42,956 --> 00:19:45,181
Mr. Royal Guard!

255
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:48,540
My brother!

256
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,860
I sincerely congratulate you on your dream coming true!

257
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:57,164
But how come you personally came down to this humble place?

258
00:19:57,164 --> 00:20:00,317
My parents are going to Jeju today

259
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:02,320
and I got permission to leave the palace for a while.

260
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,999
Jeju? Your whole family?

261
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:06,233
Yes.

262
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,128
My dad... he got demoted.

263
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:15,165
You know in life, you gain some, you lose some.

264
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:18,123
They say a war is coming anyways, maybe it's better they are in Jeju.

265
00:20:18,123 --> 00:20:20,556
You know about that too?

266
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:22,415
Where did you hear that from?

267
00:20:22,415 --> 00:20:25,522
The word is all over town.

268
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:27,762
It's just rumors, right?

269
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:34,562
The word is all over in the palace too. I don't think it's just false rumors.

270
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:40,689
I saw it with my own two eyes how Kim Min Young was talking with the king alone.

271
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:43,969
Ssh! It's a secret.

272
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:45,715
Yes.

273
00:20:45,715 --> 00:20:49,029
How is the palace anyways? It's a whole different world from the guards, isn't it?

274
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:50,878
Hey hey hey.

275
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:54,033
Forget all about the guard office.

276
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:57,682
Guard? Dosa?

277
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:03,350
Yong, you know, the palace,

278
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,908
there are 30 guards just to guard a door.

279
00:21:06,908 --> 00:21:09,738
Oh my god! 30 guards for just one door?

280
00:21:09,738 --> 00:21:11,511
Wow, that's amazing.

281
00:21:11,511 --> 00:21:13,097
I knew you would be surprised.

282
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:15,620
This is why men should live among those at the top.

283
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:21,011
That's not all. 100 guards are on patrol in the palace.

284
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:23,130
50 guards on feet

285
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:27,996
and 50 royal guards for the personal safety of the king.

286
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,771
How many is that, already?

287
00:21:31,171 --> 00:21:32,072
Wow.

288
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:37,510
Where is Shi Won?

289
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,690
He said he was stopping by somewhere else.

290
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,322
I heard about it all from Eun Chae.

291
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:56,000
Shi Hoo, you hate me, don't you?

292
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:02,449
You've made to the top all on your own

293
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,673
so make sure you stay on top.

294
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:07,775
Yes.

295
00:22:09,318 --> 00:22:11,489
I...

296
00:22:13,177 --> 00:22:17,778
am proud to have you as my son.

297
00:22:21,204 --> 00:22:24,242
Take care of Shi Won.

298
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:27,818
He knows he's not as good as you are

299
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:32,011
that's why he's being especially mean to you.

300
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:36,113
So don't hate him too much.

301
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:37,333
Yes .

302
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:41,115
I will go now.

303
00:22:41,115 --> 00:22:44,643
Why? Since you're here, you should see your sister at least.

304
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:46,884
She went to organize some things, so she'll be back soon.

305
00:22:46,884 --> 00:22:49,688
I must go.

306
00:22:49,688 --> 00:22:52,483
Stay healthy and safe.

307
00:22:56,688 --> 00:23:00,064
Still, Eun Chae will be sad to have missed you.

308
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:09,368
What kind of person was my mother?

309
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:10,616
Why do you ask that?

310
00:23:10,616 --> 00:23:13,491
I was just... curious.

311
00:23:13,491 --> 00:23:17,374
Well, the thing is...

312
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:22,410
You asked me once, about the Cheon-woo club.

313
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:27,205
There was a man named Lee Won Ho in the club

314
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:30,949
and she was the maid at his household.

315
00:23:30,949 --> 00:23:37,245
But I saw your mother by chance and I had my eyes on her.

316
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:41,152
Lee Won Ho?

317
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:45,128
Well, you know, the man who died out of treason.

318
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:52,479
The house your aunt is living in...that's the house

319
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:56,947
I have somewhere else to go.

320
00:23:56,947 --> 00:23:58,638
I really have somewhere to go.

321
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:03,251
You... you like Eun Chae, don't you?

322
00:24:03,251 --> 00:24:06,178
I heard you blabbered to her about destiny and that stuff.

323
00:24:08,352 --> 00:24:14,678
I'm being nice to you. It's her last day so I'll let you have one last glance.

324
00:24:14,678 --> 00:24:17,635
Why?

325
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:20,149
Because you're my guy.

326
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:21,405
You're thankful, aren't you?

327
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:23,786
Well, I have something to do.

328
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,538
Hey over there!

329
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:29,464
Yes, Father.

330
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:54,193
This is where my father used to live?

331
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:12,737
But this house looks familiar.

332
00:25:12,737 --> 00:25:15,687
I've been here before.

333
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:23,564
My Shi Won, you look so much better, now that you're in the palace.

334
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:28,642
Shi Won, don't get yourself into trouble.

335
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:31,745
Pretend  you're not even there.

336
00:25:31,745 --> 00:25:37,057
Do not even talk about me in front of the king, for some time.

337
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:38,960
Don't you worry.

338
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,340
The king

339
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,251
is already deep into

340
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:48,186
my charm.

341
00:25:56,581 --> 00:25:58,574
But...

342
00:25:58,574 --> 00:26:00,545
what about Shi Hoo?

343
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:03,400
Geez, you're always about him, aren't you?

344
00:26:04,516 --> 00:26:05,377
He didn't come by?

345
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:09,606
I told you. It doesn't matter if you raise him, he doesn't know how to be grateful.

346
00:26:09,606 --> 00:26:11,709
Ingrate!

347
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:14,205
Let's go let's go.

348
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:19,339
You be good, all right? Your father is coming back soon!

349
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:21,852
Let's go.

350
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:27,408
Here, say your goodbyes.

351
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:36,134
Stay well.

352
00:26:57,187 --> 00:27:02,100
Just once, just this once.

353
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:06,369
Show me your face.

354
00:27:07,788 --> 00:27:11,454
So that I may at least

355
00:27:11,454 --> 00:27:14,108
keep this memory forever.

356
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:35,642
Ja Dol.

357
00:28:35,642 --> 00:28:37,625
That boy...

358
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:39,855
did he really die?

359
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,885
Yes.

360
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:51,279
Ja Dol.

361
00:28:51,718 --> 00:28:53,781
Ja Dol.

362
00:28:53,781 --> 00:28:55,215
The thing is...

363
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:58,224
I heard your dear son, that you loved so much, had died.

364
00:28:58,224 --> 00:29:00,479
And I was worried, that's why I came.

365
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:03,173
But I see there was no need.

366
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:08,172
I'm right, aren't I? I knew he couldn't have died so easily.

367
00:29:08,172 --> 00:29:11,962
Ja Dol. Please.

368
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:13,542
If...

369
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:16,456
he is alive and comes to the palace....

370
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:18,308
I...

371
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:20,042
swear I will catch him.

372
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:22,917
How can you do this?

373
00:29:22,917 --> 00:29:27,286
Just because we share the same blood, do you think I'll suddenly have special feelings for him?

374
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:28,549
Ja Dol.

375
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:31,178
He took you for a plain maid

376
00:29:31,178 --> 00:29:34,534
and abandoned you and your son.

377
00:29:34,534 --> 00:29:37,271
Yet you still loved him?

378
00:29:37,271 --> 00:29:39,594
How much love did you have for him

379
00:29:39,594 --> 00:29:42,642
that you even took his son

380
00:29:42,642 --> 00:29:44,526
and raised him in secret?

381
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:46,984
That's not how it was.

382
00:29:46,984 --> 00:29:49,573
He has nothing to do with me.

383
00:29:49,573 --> 00:29:53,765
To me, he's just a thief.

384
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:05,345


385
00:30:07,948 --> 00:30:10,887
He says he has something to tell you.

386
00:30:10,887 --> 00:30:14,646
That thief... he will definitely come back to the palace.

387
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,216
What are you talking about?

388
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:17,582
That bastard is dead...

389
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:29,855
Haven't you found the bodies yet?

390
00:30:29,855 --> 00:30:31,439
No, we haven't.

391
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:36,382
But sir, didn't you see Yong Jae kill him?

392
00:30:36,382 --> 00:30:38,311
Even so... that bastard will not have died that easily.

393
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:40,890
How many guards are there in the palace now?

394
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:47,394
Since he died, those who were in training have been put outside of the palace.

395
00:30:49,546 --> 00:30:50,973
You may leave.

396
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:05,727
The men you've sent outside the palace, have them all back inside.

397
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:06,822
Yes.

398
00:31:11,342 --> 00:31:12,516
What?

399
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:14,001
Do you have something to say?

400
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:16,983
Why did you allow that boy to live?

401
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:24,639
He betrayed us and put a knife to your throat.

402
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:27,010
He's gone through a lot of pain.

403
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,229
It's like seeing myself when I was young.

404
00:31:32,229 --> 00:31:36,214
Didn't you say not to have a warm heart?

405
00:31:43,494 --> 00:31:46,080
That bastard is alive?

406
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,212
Then who is the jerk that died?

407
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:07,621
Yong Jae

408
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:09,225
You bastard!

409
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:12,510
Wow, so this is what the palace looks like?

410
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,421
Where do the royal concubines sleep?

411
00:32:15,421 --> 00:32:17,798
The weird things you want to know...

412
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:19,509
They must sleep with the king.

413
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:21,113
Yeah, you're right.

414
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:23,153
So, where does the king sleep?

415
00:32:24,923 --> 00:32:26,564
Right here

416
00:32:26,564 --> 00:32:29,350
This here is the king's personal space.

417
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,905
And this is where he sleeps.

418
00:32:31,905 --> 00:32:36,151
And this here is where the government offices and the storage rooms are gathered.

419
00:32:37,412 --> 00:32:41,909
But... where are we supposed to rob?

420
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:44,398
Two places, which are the core of the palace.

421
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:46,221
The treasure house

422
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:48,524
and the food warehouse.

423
00:32:48,524 --> 00:32:50,914
While the people are starving

424
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:52,975
food is rotting in the palace

425
00:32:52,975 --> 00:32:54,469
and the treasure house is so full

426
00:32:54,469 --> 00:32:57,116
it's about to burst.

427
00:32:57,116 --> 00:33:01,267
And Dae Shik and the soldiers.

428
00:33:09,228 --> 00:33:11,733
Yong?

429
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:14,270
These bastards.

430
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:21,264
I'll let Dae Shik know, so the team outside the palace, make everything work without any problem.

431
00:33:21,264 --> 00:33:23,483
We'll be waiting for your orders.

432
00:33:23,483 --> 00:33:27,249
While I'll be looking for the sword around here, Hee Bong hyung and Eun Bok,

433
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:28,615
you stay at the food warehouse.

434
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:35,984
Everyone will meet at the middle point, and while I'm robbing the royal quarters, you leave the palace.

435
00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:39,646
But... how do we get into the palace?

436
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:42,071
Here.

437
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,423
Isn't this the pass to the royal palace?

438
00:33:47,423 --> 00:33:48,832
It's fake, isn't it?

439
00:33:48,832 --> 00:33:51,049
This looks so real!

440
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:52,868
You could fool anyone.

441
00:33:52,868 --> 00:33:55,701
Yong, you had this kind of skill set too?

442
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,197
Bong Soon made them for me.

443
00:33:57,197 --> 00:34:00,246
Bong Soon? Ah, that mean brat.

444
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:05,055
I hear she and her father completely disappeared! How could they do that?

445
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:07,926
Poor Shim Duk ajumma.

446
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:12,426
All right.

447
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,513
This is perfect preparation, right?

448
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,154
Yeah, it's perfect.

449
00:34:18,154 --> 00:34:23,533
Come on. Let's pretend we're in. How do we rob the place without unlocking the places?

450
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,503
The key?

451
00:34:38,503 --> 00:34:40,362
Oh, this?

452
00:34:40,362 --> 00:34:42,730
I'm sorry. Good day.

453
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,838
Wow, this shoe is quite impressive.

454
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,424
How did you do it?

455
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:57,961
I stuck clay at the sole of the shoe, and then wrapped it with pig skin.

456
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,282
Here, each of you take one.

457
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:13,568
How did it go?

458
00:35:14,588 --> 00:35:16,878
Sit down. Be quiet.

459
00:35:16,878 --> 00:35:21,424
Well, first of all, the concubines sleep with the king.

460
00:35:21,424 --> 00:35:22,710
What?

461
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,748
Oh geez.

462
00:35:25,853 --> 00:35:30,288
We sent you to spy on them and that's all you got?

463
00:35:30,288 --> 00:35:32,330
If you want out of this, just get out!

464
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,653
Get this man out of here. Seriously!

465
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:37,426
Let me be!

466
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,219
Leave me alone!

467
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:42,066
They're going to rob the heart of the palace.

468
00:35:42,066 --> 00:35:44,682
Rob the heart?

469
00:35:44,682 --> 00:35:47,260
You're driving me crazy man!

470
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,568
Oh!

471
00:35:48,568 --> 00:35:50,938
No, not the heart! Not the heart!

472
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:54,743
They're going to rob the shoe!

473
00:35:59,752 --> 00:36:02,417
Stop it! It hurts! It  hurts!

474
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:05,313
You useless bastard.

475
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:07,384
Let's not stay this way.

476
00:36:07,384 --> 00:36:08,770
Let's plan a strategy.

477
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:13,576
100 soldiers are on patrol duty 7 times.

478
00:36:13,576 --> 00:36:15,594
There are 100 soldiers in front of the royal court

479
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:17,946
and 100 more in front of each royal office.

480
00:36:17,946 --> 00:36:21,402
The total number of guards only amounts ot 2,000 men.

481
00:36:21,402 --> 00:36:22,874
There are that many?

482
00:36:22,874 --> 00:36:25,697
How can we rob such a place?

483
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:28,436
On the day they will hold the banquet

484
00:36:48,337 --> 00:36:52,153
they will only leave a minimum of guards and everyone else will be at the banquet.

485
00:36:58,301 --> 00:37:00,518
Good day to you sir.

486
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,673
Here.

487
00:37:04,942 --> 00:37:06,267
What do you have there?

488
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,723
Oh, it's the tent for the banquet.

489
00:37:08,723 --> 00:37:09,864
Open it.

490
00:37:09,864 --> 00:37:10,524
What?

491
00:37:10,524 --> 00:37:12,888
Open it!

492
00:37:12,888 --> 00:37:15,604
Hey! How dare you cut in the line?

493
00:37:15,604 --> 00:37:16,954
Do you want to die?

494
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:18,851
Die? Come and get me!

495
00:37:18,851 --> 00:37:20,714
I'm going to kill you!

496
00:37:20,714 --> 00:37:22,923
You bastard.

497
00:37:22,923 --> 00:37:24,720
Just get in.

498
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,737
Good day.

499
00:37:25,737 --> 00:37:31,350
You jerk!

500
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,149
Well, come to think of it,

501
00:37:34,149 --> 00:37:36,543
I may have been on the wrong side.

502
00:37:36,543 --> 00:37:39,278
No, not at all. I'm not that busy anyways

503
00:37:39,278 --> 00:37:40,287
so please go ahead.

504
00:37:47,757 --> 00:37:50,303
Father.

505
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:54,097
I will get him.

506
00:38:08,858 --> 00:38:11,408
Father.

507
00:38:11,408 --> 00:38:13,831
You will be with me, won't you?

508
00:38:33,592 --> 00:38:34,582
Mother.

509
00:38:34,582 --> 00:38:36,502
Don't go.

510
00:38:36,502 --> 00:38:37,736
Mom.

511
00:38:37,736 --> 00:38:40,475
What if something happens to you too?

512
00:38:41,524 --> 00:38:42,972
I...

513
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:45,151
Nothing will go wrong.

514
00:38:45,151 --> 00:38:46,928
I will make it, for sure.

515
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:48,933
I will save Dae Shik

516
00:38:50,113 --> 00:38:52,490
and I will find out

517
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:57,026
who killed my father.

518
00:38:57,026 --> 00:39:00,790
Then promise me one thing.

519
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:06,390
Promise me you'll return alive.

520
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,563
Yes Mother, I'm not going to die.

521
00:39:27,981 --> 00:39:29,170
Mom.

522
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:33,921
Were you going to rob the palace with some old shabby clothes? You are Iljimae after all.

523
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:35,767
You won't look cool.

524
00:39:39,692 --> 00:39:43,278
You made a promise with me.

525
00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:48,955
You must return safe and sound, all right?

526
00:39:51,031 --> 00:39:56,409
Yes, faithful Dan. Don't worry.

527
00:39:56,409 --> 00:40:00,171
My father is here with me.

528
00:40:06,594 --> 00:40:08,713
Hey.

529
00:40:08,713 --> 00:40:10,788
Wash this for me please.

530
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:23,998
This... where did you get this?

531
00:40:23,998 --> 00:40:26,816
This? You know that jerk of a Dosa

532
00:40:27,215 --> 00:40:29,560
Oh, no, now it's Royal Guard Byun

533
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,503
What am I saying.

534
00:40:30,503 --> 00:40:33,304
Anyways, that jerk gave it to me instead of paying for the drinks.

535
00:40:38,298 --> 00:40:40,032
Hey stop right there!

536
00:40:40,032 --> 00:40:41,544
Give me back my ornament!

537
00:40:41,802 --> 00:40:47,173


538
00:40:48,464 --> 00:40:50,140
It's fine.

539
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,669
Welcome, Sir.

540
00:40:52,669 --> 00:40:54,179
Please go in.

541
00:41:06,105 --> 00:41:10,443
The ambassador from the imperial palace is here, we are only waiting for the imperial messenger.

542
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:11,942
He will be here soon too.

543
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,435
What?

544
00:41:23,435 --> 00:41:24,486
Geez.

545
00:41:24,486 --> 00:41:27,056
Young master, this.

546
00:41:28,206 --> 00:41:29,220
Come here.

547
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:34,707
Did you come all the way here just to get the money for the drinks? You think I'm going to cheat you?

548
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:37,188
Seriously, this is offending me.

549
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:41,143
It's not that.

550
00:41:41,143 --> 00:41:43,082
Who does this belong to, sir?

551
00:41:44,531 --> 00:41:46,166
It's for my man, Yong.

552
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:47,673
Yong?

553
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:49,884
You know the guy I carried out the other day.

554
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,267
Yong.

555
00:42:06,472 --> 00:42:08,253
I have to go now.

556
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:11,680
I'm telling you, I'll pay you back.

557
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,112
You're embarrassing me.

558
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:23,085
Move away! The imperial messenger is arriving.

559
00:42:50,065 --> 00:42:51,313
Do it again!

560
00:42:59,267 --> 00:43:01,329
I'm sorry.

561
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:15,145
Don't make any mistake.

562
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:57,360
Geom.

563
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:04,903
Geom.

564
00:44:08,553 --> 00:44:10,266
 Mother. 

565
00:44:10,955 --> 00:44:12,312
 Mother. 

566
00:44:13,707 --> 00:44:15,831
Geom.

567
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:17,903
You were alive, my Geom.

568
00:44:19,968 --> 00:44:22,901
How did you recognize me, Mother.

569
00:44:24,017 --> 00:44:26,551
It's been 14 years.

570
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:29,221
My dear Geom.

571
00:44:30,315 --> 00:44:32,441
You haven't changed a bit.

572
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:35,804
Not a bit.

573
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:41,388
I finally saw you, yet I had to ignore you.

574
00:44:42,289 --> 00:44:44,523
Just like that time.

575
00:44:46,221 --> 00:44:48,924
It will all be over soon Mother.

576
00:44:48,924 --> 00:44:52,554
Just a wait a little bit. Just a little.

577
00:44:59,953 --> 00:45:03,297
Today, Iljimae said he will definitely come,

578
00:45:03,297 --> 00:45:04,742
so make sure to guard this door!

579
00:45:04,742 --> 00:45:06,130
Yes sir!

580
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:32,848
Hey, you, it's a bit tilted. Make it straight.

581
00:46:27,062 --> 00:46:28,192
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

582
00:46:37,459 --> 00:46:39,389
Your Majesty

583
00:46:39,389 --> 00:46:44,673
The ambassador from the imperial palace, Jung Myung Soo and the imperial messenger have arrived.

584
00:46:44,673 --> 00:46:46,749
All right.

585
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:03,848
These are presents for his lordship.

586
00:47:03,848 --> 00:47:08,899
His lordship has also brought presents for His Majesty.

587
00:47:12,189 --> 00:47:15,784
I'm sorry, with all due respect, may I have a look?

588
00:47:15,784 --> 00:47:17,538
Sure.

589
00:47:38,745 --> 00:47:44,979
He says that he will leave them here and will personally give it to His Majesty at the banquet.

590
00:47:44,979 --> 00:47:47,057
Yes.

591
00:47:47,057 --> 00:47:51,628
Where is the royal ambassador and the envoy Jung Myung Soo?

592
00:47:51,628 --> 00:47:54,529
They're in the west home quarters.

593
00:47:54,529 --> 00:47:57,449
Should I tell them you have arrived?

594
00:48:04,198 --> 00:48:08,653
His lordship is tired, he would like to take some rest without being disturbed.

595
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:10,352
Yes, please do.

596
00:48:10,352 --> 00:48:14,730
Please take a rest and when the banquet starts, we will come for you.

597
00:48:51,856 --> 00:48:53,547
Your Majesty.

598
00:48:53,547 --> 00:48:55,753
Where is the imperial messenger?

599
00:48:55,753 --> 00:48:57,189
This way please.

600
00:49:24,592 --> 00:49:27,032
His Royal Highness is here.

601
00:49:57,409 --> 00:49:59,029
What is this?

602
00:49:59,764 --> 00:50:02,727
This is the bowl for the dog at Kukdo ahjussi.

603
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:08,107
This is the alcohol jar from Shim Duk ajumma.

604
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:12,504
And this.

605
00:50:15,917 --> 00:50:17,175
It looks like ginseng, right?

606
00:50:17,175 --> 00:50:17,805
Yeah.

607
00:50:17,805 --> 00:50:19,435
It's just bellflower root.

608
00:50:30,409 --> 00:50:34,046
I hear Your Majesty is here.

609
00:50:39,212 --> 00:50:42,517
I prepared a grand banquet today

610
00:50:42,517 --> 00:50:45,894
so please enjoy at your fullest in just a bit.

611
00:50:58,162 --> 00:51:00,788
Get that jerk now! Right now!

612
00:51:00,788 --> 00:51:05,431
Drag him  in front of me before the imperial ambassador or Jung Myung Soo notice anything.

613
00:51:09,262 --> 00:51:12,280
Find out about the whereabouts of the imperial messenger right now.

614
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,977
Yes sir.

615
00:51:24,537 --> 00:51:26,684
You can't come this way.

616
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:28,194
You have to go the other gate.

617
00:51:29,942 --> 00:51:34,516
Why is it taking so long? And why have we come to this gate?

618
00:51:34,516 --> 00:51:37,435
His lordship is busy.

619
00:51:37,435 --> 00:51:39,598
I think he may have to go.

620
00:51:39,598 --> 00:51:42,483
Just wait a little bit.

621
00:51:49,765 --> 00:51:52,784
How dare you treat the imperial messenger this way?

622
00:51:52,784 --> 00:51:55,649
He has to go right now!

623
00:51:55,649 --> 00:51:58,530
I know the pain he's going through, but...

624
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:01,233
His face looks different.

625
00:52:13,286 --> 00:52:16,048
Iljimae is in the palace. Follow me.

626
00:52:33,563 --> 00:52:38,616
Listen to me carefully. You are not going to Chung.

627
00:52:38,616 --> 00:52:43,080
You will fight here, in this land, with the Myung, against the Chung.

628
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:48,437
Be quiet and listen!

629
00:52:48,437 --> 00:52:54,078
Anyone who disobeys His Majesty's orders will not survive.

630
00:52:55,693 --> 00:52:58,838
Excuse me, I thought we were going to Chung.

631
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:01,901
Then are we not going to Chung at all?

632
00:53:01,901 --> 00:53:04,873
Then I want to go home! I'm hungry.

633
00:53:05,894 --> 00:53:07,087
Be careful.

634
00:53:13,392 --> 00:53:15,442
Office managing the palace guards

635
00:53:28,445 --> 00:53:35,727


636
00:53:50,991 --> 00:53:53,581
Will the sword you're looking for really be there?

637
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:58,253
But why did they engrave those symbols on the offices?

638
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,639
It must mean the person is related to the palace.

639
00:54:03,686 --> 00:54:09,305
For instance, it could be someone from the royal family, or the chief of these offices.

640
00:54:16,514 --> 00:54:18,999
Office managing the royal guards

641
00:55:08,288 --> 00:55:09,764
You little rat!

642
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,548
This way!

643
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:14,029
You bastard, we got you!

644
00:55:51,698 --> 00:55:54,796
Where did he go? Iljimae! Where did he go?

645
00:55:57,393 --> 00:55:59,052
I don't kill people.

646
00:56:17,482 --> 00:56:21,161
Father, I have to go to Chung.

647
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:26,011
The Myung are already in ruins! Father.

648
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:46,279
Who are you?

649
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:47,796
Hold up your hands.

650
00:56:47,796 --> 00:56:49,848
Who are you?

651
00:56:53,046 --> 00:56:54,341
I'm sorry.

652
00:56:56,902 --> 00:56:58,184
I'm sorry.

653
00:57:04,149 --> 00:57:05,785
Good job, Eun Bok.

654
00:57:09,604 --> 00:57:12,293
The royal food warehouse

655
00:57:16,005 --> 00:57:20,266
They have loads of these food warehouses in the palace?

656
00:57:20,266 --> 00:57:22,839
People out there are starving to death

657
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:25,218
but here they are going to die because they eat too much.

658
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:28,855
Do you even have the right to say that?

659
00:57:28,855 --> 00:57:31,340
You also played a part in feeding the rich!

660
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:38,601
You little brat, I treat you nicely and you're trying to get on top of my head?

661
00:57:40,289 --> 00:57:43,898
Top of your head? Dream on! You're not even married.

662
00:57:43,898 --> 00:57:46,558
What? I'm going to...!

663
00:57:46,558 --> 00:57:48,245
Hey hey, hurry up.

664
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:02,396
No problem?

665
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:05,311
No sir!

666
00:58:22,877 --> 00:58:25,046
What's up with your shoes?

667
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:52,792
You brat.

668
00:59:07,027 --> 00:59:10,196
Over there! Iljimae!

669
00:59:10,845 --> 00:59:14,598
Quick! Iljimae is there!

670
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:24,837
Bring the cart.

671
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:39,013
You go ahead and look for the sword.

672
00:59:39,013 --> 00:59:41,155
We'll take care of this.

673
00:59:41,155 --> 00:59:43,672
It's too heavy for just you two. I'll go with you.

674
01:00:11,768 --> 01:00:13,753
Hey!

675
01:00:23,097 --> 01:00:26,759
Yes, it's definitely him.

676
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,260
Who are you?

677
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,978
Are you Geom, the son of Lee Won Ho?

678
01:01:10,825 --> 01:01:13,237
Hey! What just happened?

679
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:16,316
I saw this man who tried to kill me some time ago, asking me if I was Geom.

680
01:01:16,316 --> 01:01:17,322
Really?

681
01:01:17,322 --> 01:01:19,095
That man is in the palace? For real?

682
01:01:19,095 --> 01:01:22,287
I also the ones who tried to kill me in the warehouse the other day too.

683
01:01:24,355 --> 01:01:29,752
I'm certain now. The people who killed my fathers are also in the palace.

684
01:01:32,326 --> 01:01:33,215
Well, let's go anyways.

685
01:01:33,215 --> 01:01:35,116
Yeah.

686
01:01:35,116 --> 01:01:37,136
Move away!

687
01:02:02,994 --> 01:02:06,202
Are these the fruits to be used at the banquet?

688
01:02:06,202 --> 01:02:09,090
Yes, your Majesty.

689
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:12,286
Take good care of them.

690
01:02:37,265 --> 01:02:39,847
You...

691
01:02:47,599 --> 01:03:06,746


692
01:03:06,746 --> 01:03:08,840
