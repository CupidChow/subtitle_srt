1
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:37,948
You cannot find it unless you check the houses of the whole noble families.

2
00:00:37,948 --> 00:00:39,660
If it is such a precious sword, they will have hidden it somewhere secret in the house.

3
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:47,033
You must you probably know most of noble houses, right?

4
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:49,959
There is no man who does politics without our Castor Oil gang.

5
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:53,457
I will give my allegiance to you.

6
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:55,408
There are so many types of precious swords...

7
00:00:55,408 --> 00:00:58,556
Are there any special patterns on the swords?

8
00:00:58,556 --> 00:01:01,325
One of the exercises in the examination is to catch a thief.

9
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:16,417
Episode 8

10
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,908
You don't overpass the wall with strength, you need technique.

11
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:23,708
Technique?

12
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,436
Just watch.

13
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:39,618
Don't start too close to the wall. You need some distance.

14
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:44,278
Now now, run! Go, go!

15
00:01:47,246 --> 00:01:52,856
While you're running, prepare yourself. Think, "I am no longer a human. I'm a grasshopper!"

16
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:55,033
Jump!

17
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,366
Jump!

18
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:01,828
-Jump! Grasshopper! Jump! 
 -Jump!

19
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:04,222
With the front leg, you jump off, and with your back leg, you kick off the face of the wall.

20
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:12,304
Catch onto the ledge with your hands, then you get one leg over!

21
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:24,510
Yes, yes! That's how you do it! Wasn't that easy?

22
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:27,861
Well, what are you doing? Come back down now.

23
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:32,160
Geez look at you.

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,674
When you land, you have to land on your firm feet. 
 That way you don't get hurt on your knees.

25
00:02:36,674 --> 00:02:39,596
You land like you're sitting on the toilet

26
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:40,169
-Sitting on the toilet? 
 -Yes.

27
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:42,398
Now try.

28
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:48,943
My goodness! The position when you want you want to go to the bathroom!

29
00:02:48,943 --> 00:02:54,410
Not the "oh my goodness I have to go now" position , but the position where you are actually pooping.

30
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,400
This position.

31
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,888
Bring this leg a little bit forward, like this.

32
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:01,541
Yes, yes! You're doing well.

33
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:07,170
You're totally awesome!

34
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:31,169
 A thief's feet are like a ghost's feet. 

35
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,092
 A bad thief makes noises. 

36
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:37,082
 A real thief does not make noise. That is why... 

37
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:40,969
 ...the guard who catches thieves must have iron ears. 

38
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:44,522
Okay, try to catch your father.

39
00:03:55,675 --> 00:04:00,068
Aish. Could you hear me?

40
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:02,498
I must have lost my skills.

41
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:08,739
It's not that. It's your smell! You should wash! I think I know why mom doesn't use the same room with you.

42
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,485
You little brat. How could you say such a thing.

43
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:12,689
I don't smell anything.

44
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:20,398
No, no it's not that. If you keep moving like that, how are you going to steal the item and run away?

45
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:23,495
A thief never raises his toes.

46
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,673
Then how do you not make any sound?

47
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:28,392
There's a way of walking that does not make any sound.

48
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:29,388
A way of walking?

49
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,823
The essence of the method is secret here.

50
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:57,744
If you first step on your toes or your sole, you're bound to make noise, even if you're careful.

51
00:04:57,744 --> 00:05:02,443
You need to practice so that your toes or the back of your foot don't touch the ground.

52
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:39,226
 When unlocking the door, do it within about 30 seconds. 

53
00:05:45,573 --> 00:05:46,867
 It doesn't open, right? 

54
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:54,679
You shouldn't be able to open it so easily. 
 You know who made that lock?

55
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:59,378
-Be careful. 
 -Alright.

56
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,336
Look at all this dust!

57
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:11,917
But what is this place?

58
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,724
It used to be a blacksmith's shop before,

59
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,919
but because it is deep in the mountains, nobody comes here.

60
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:25,876
When your father was younger, I practiced unlocking the locks here.

61
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:36,480
My clothes! It's still here.

62
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,078
Is this yours?

63
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:42,666
This is so short!

64
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,209
You little brat.

65
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:48,148
Unlock all of these tonight.

66
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:55,675
 Pretend you're a bug and heighten the senses on your fingers. 

67
00:06:56,869 --> 00:06:59,658
 In the lock, there is a small hole that supports the casket. 

68
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:02,309
 That stick will sort of cut the hole in half. 

69
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:04,871
 The stick will then whisper. 

70
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:08,541
 Honey, you came so late... 

71
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,134
 Right at that moment. 

72
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:11,722
 Carefully... 

73
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,841
 Very carefully. 

74
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:31,997
How could this have happened?

75
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:36,312
That means the Left Minister and Kwon Doo Hyun knew everything.

76
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:38,866
They became framed for the crime?

77
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:40,347
It looks like it.

78
00:07:40,347 --> 00:07:42,402
This should not have happened!

79
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:44,006
We need to report this!

80
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:48,093
If we move too quickly, we'll be the ones in danger.

81
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:51,242
We first need to wait quietly for the right timing.

82
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,629
Did I not lock it?

83
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,382
How is it?

84
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:05,307
There is nothing like this for safekeeping money.

85
00:09:05,307 --> 00:09:08,620
I had no idea this way was possible.

86
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,736
I've learned something from you, Hopan.

87
00:09:14,924 --> 00:09:20,935
But the people in the Justice department are getting restless these days.

88
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,632
They say they want to conduct investigations and

89
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:27,442
they keep making official requests to the King.

90
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:30,866
Tell them to try all they want.

91
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:36,660
When the full moon rises, all my money will go to China.

92
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,356
There's not a place in the world like China where you can put everything safely.

93
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:45,201
You're really worthy of your reputation.

94
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:50,092
Now, let's go outside.

95
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:52,053
Let's go.

96
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:38,193


97
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,550
It's a thief! A thief!

98
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,432
It's a thief! A thief!

99
00:11:05,574 --> 00:11:08,047
The lock is open.

100
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:10,509
There was nobody in the inside?

101
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:15,260
This is really a ghost's doing.

102
00:11:59,957 --> 00:12:01,314
The bastard.

103
00:12:01,314 --> 00:12:03,886
Why did he leave with the whole bottle of wine?

104
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:07,465
Where did he find such a con man?

105
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:25,449
My goodness.

106
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:28,232
Just because that one piece of paper disappeared.

107
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:31,202
And you're making such a racket at night?

108
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:33,207
That piece of paper?

109
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:34,069
You.

110
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:38,029
Do you know how much that is?

111
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:42,623
How much is it? How much does it cost?

112
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,699
500,000 coins.

113
00:12:47,511 --> 00:12:50,071
500,000 coins?

114
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:52,077
How can a piece of paper...

115
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:53,795
That.

116
00:12:54,785 --> 00:12:57,496
is a masterpiece by Dohyun.

117
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:01,965
Dohyun Masterpiece.

118
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,453
Is there such a thing?

119
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,528
So.

120
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:10,547
You're saying that guy is your dad?

121
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:14,910
I thought my dad came back from heaven.

122
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,344
Somebody there.

123
00:13:16,344 --> 00:13:19,382
Somebody must have drawn my dad.

124
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:22,667
Father!

125
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,206
You really don't know the painter Jin Heung Soo from Noryun?

126
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:30,447
No wonder why you're from a low class.

127
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:33,191
Jin Heung Soo

128
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:35,215
is the best painter and artist of Myung.

129
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,532
Especially

130
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:40,266
when it comes to portraits, there's no one as good as him.

131
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:42,425
Its a dimensionless painting from 300 years ago.

132
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:44,464
I know! I know!

133
00:13:44,464 --> 00:13:47,571
300 years ... yes...

134
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:52,979
I just made a joke.

135
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:55,136
Why are you being so serious?

136
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:57,263
The painting is one of the many paintings

137
00:13:57,263 --> 00:14:01,385
from the painter Jin Heung Soo.

138
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,440
If that's so.

139
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,182
It's a job done by a professional.

140
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:08,120
A professional?

141
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,513
Isn't it correct?

142
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:12,107
Without knowing the drawing's cost.

143
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:16,551
How could he have left everything else.

144
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:21,214
And only steal that particular piece?

145
00:14:21,214 --> 00:14:23,226
This would be...

146
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:27,471
...done by somebody who knows art well.

147
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:31,938
Wouldn't it?

148
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:40,121
From now on.

149
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:44,433
You will search every house owned by any prior criminal.

150
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:47,150
You must find that painting, understood?

151
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,854
Yes.

152
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,481
Let's go.

153
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,677
Guard Myun.

154
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:03,005
Stay behind and clean out the cell.

155
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:07,037
We need to prepare to take in the thief.

156
00:15:07,555 --> 00:15:09,156
Let's go.

157
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,811
But why does the brat say nothing?

158
00:15:21,811 --> 00:15:24,529
Has there been no notice so far?

159
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:27,767
What will he be when he fails the guard test as well?

160
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:30,147
He'll be quite devastated.

161
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,000
This is frustrating.

162
00:15:35,498 --> 00:15:37,648
What is this?

163
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:39,336
What could it be

164
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,315
He passed, you rotten brat!

165
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:58,196
He passed! This rotten brat!

166
00:15:58,196 --> 00:16:00,912
This brat hid this here!

167
00:16:00,912 --> 00:16:04,524
You hide this here to surprise your father, you little brat?

168
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:09,011
You're great, my son!

169
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:24,966
I'm sorry.

170
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:27,955
When are we going to the next nobleman's house?

171
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:30,270
Oh, soon.

172
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:34,985
By the way, the people from the Nam In household are being difficult these days.

173
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:36,806
They asked us to take care of it.

174
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:38,177
Nam In?

175
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:41,049
Oh, right, you don't know.

176
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:42,524
Yong.

177
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:44,280
If you're going to live in the bottom world.

178
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,174
You need to know how evertyhing works.

179
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:52,611
In Politics, men from Seo In are the ones in charge.

180
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,957
If they perceive you as all right,

181
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:59,926
our life can get so much easier and more comfortable, like any nobleman!

182
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:01,329
Seo In?

183
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:02,128
All right.

184
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:04,469
Shall we stretch out a little?

185
00:17:04,469 --> 00:17:06,277
Shall we?

186
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:11,485
Choo Suk Bong, known thief for art masterpieces!

187
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:12,891
What did you do with Jing Heung Soo's painting?

188
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:14,443
What are you saying?

189
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:17,431
I'm done with stealing!

190
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:24,456
Kang Dal Shik, known con man!

191
00:17:24,823 --> 00:17:26,270
What did you do with Jin Heung Soo's painting?

192
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,989
I don't know.

193
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:46,160
Sir...

194
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:49,351
I'm made for this stuff.

195
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:52,560
I'm really bad at catching thieves.

196
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,312
For me to be in this position for 13 years,

197
00:17:55,312 --> 00:17:58,198
there must be a reason, right?

198
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:00,186
By the way,

199
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:02,859
someone came by a bit earlier.

200
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:06,918
Who was it? He was about this tall and his front tooth was missing.

201
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:08,679
What? Fa...

202
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:10,663
It was your father?

203
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:14,351
You don't look like each other at all! Not the same height either.

204
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:21,753
Run!

205
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:56,264
Hey, how is business?

206
00:18:56,666 --> 00:19:00,628
It's soon time to pay your rents and taxes!

207
00:19:02,996 --> 00:19:06,224
Those bastards.

208
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:10,087
My Yong would crush them all.

209
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:12,385
Little brats!

210
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:15,391
Hey.

211
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:18,640
if these guys

212
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,649
bother you, don't hesitate

213
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:23,532
and just tell me, Soe Dol.

214
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:26,598
My Yong, a guard, will take care of it all instantly.

215
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,495
All right then.

216
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,522
Are you Swe Dol?

217
00:19:31,522 --> 00:19:33,204
Yes, why?

218
00:19:34,037 --> 00:19:34,986
What? Why?

219
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:36,862
Why are you doing this to me?

220
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:42,976
Where is Na Soe Dol?

221
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:44,787
What is this about?

222
00:19:44,787 --> 00:19:48,276
Where is Na Swe Dol, known thief of storehouses?

223
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:49,622
I'm sorry?

224
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,458
Search the place!

225
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,579
But...

226
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:55,586
What are you doing?

227
00:19:55,586 --> 00:19:59,425
How dare you touch me?

228
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:03,033
How dare you stare at me?

229
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,886
Who do you think you're staring at?

230
00:20:05,886 --> 00:20:08,821
He's not here.

231
00:20:10,264 --> 00:20:12,308
Why? Why are you doing this to me?

232
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:16,438
So, you're the best thief of storehouses in this town?

233
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:18,144
What?

234
00:20:18,144 --> 00:20:20,904
I haven't done anything.

235
00:20:20,904 --> 00:20:23,230
I haven't done any stealing in a very long time.

236
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,340
It's been a long time I've become a new man.

237
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,217
Take him away.

238
00:20:26,217 --> 00:20:29,133
I really haven't done anything!

239
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:33,885
Sir! Sir! It's not me!

240
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:37,407
This is the last house.

241
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:41,479
We've searched all the houses of all known thieves.

242
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:48,018
You do your job right! Do you understand?

243
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:50,611
Damn it!

244
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:53,972
What are you ...?

245
00:20:53,972 --> 00:20:56,403
You...

246
00:20:56,403 --> 00:20:58,620
I told you to take care of the prison cells!

247
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,223
What, you don't think I'm giving you orders?

248
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:08,969
I found it in the bush in that road down over there.

249
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:11,863
He must be around. Search around this place carefully!

250
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:13,444
Yes!

251
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,204
You brat!

252
00:21:18,907 --> 00:21:21,147
Go! Go! Go!

253
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:33,823
No, my lady.

254
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:35,267
I can carry this at least.

255
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:36,824
No, I'll be the one to get into trouble.

256
00:21:36,824 --> 00:21:38,202
I'll do it, I'm telling you.

257
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:40,556
My lady, I will...

258
00:21:41,022 --> 00:21:42,796
Father, you're home.

259
00:21:43,023 --> 00:21:45,620
What are you doing standing here? Go help!

260
00:21:46,544 --> 00:21:48,070
Yes!

261
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:51,000
It's already finished.

262
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:56,850
Using all that money for what they said was good wood,

263
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,785
but the exterior design is so poorly done...

264
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:01,161
It's not about being fancy on the outside.

265
00:22:01,161 --> 00:22:02,905
It must first have a sturdy foundation.

266
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:04,579
But

267
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:07,658
you still keep those useless poor people?

268
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:09,198
Father.

269
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:13,134
Didn't you give this land to me?

270
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:16,538
'I will not interfere with your business'.

271
00:22:16,538 --> 00:22:18,826
Isn't that what you promised me?

272
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,834
Okay, I understand.

273
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:26,647
Be safe at night on the streets. Tell your mother I won't be home for some days, so lock the doors.

274
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:29,753
Is there something wrong?

275
00:22:29,753 --> 00:22:33,222
Hopan's household got robbed last night.

276
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:34,508
Lord Lee Myung?

277
00:22:34,508 --> 00:22:38,327
Shhh! It's an ongoing secret investigation.

278
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:43,647
He told me it was some drawing by Jin Heung Soo or someone from Myung.

279
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:47,709
Do... something... like a flower.

280
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:50,738
Is it the Dohyung masterpiece by any chance?

281
00:22:51,031 --> 00:22:53,292
Yes, that's right. That's the one.

282
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:55,590
What a name.

283
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,799
That must have cost at least 100,000 coins.

284
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:02,867
Really? He told me that one piece cost 500,000 coins.

285
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:04,136
My my.

286
00:23:04,136 --> 00:23:07,431
But is that flower so precious?

287
00:23:08,044 --> 00:23:10,541
How did the thief pass the security at the house?

288
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:13,083
That I don't know.

289
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:19,413
But since your brother will soon catch the thief, we'll find out then.

290
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:23,360
I can't believe that the great Hopan got robbed.

291
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:27,098
I personally hope the thief won't get caught.

292
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,793
What?

293
00:23:29,084 --> 00:23:30,206
Eun Chae!

294
00:23:31,216 --> 00:23:35,051
I guess the noblemen must be on their edge.

295
00:23:39,175 --> 00:23:40,633
This way!

296
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:44,093
Search this place!

297
00:23:48,232 --> 00:23:50,754
But...

298
00:23:50,754 --> 00:23:53,087
Sir, what is wrong?

299
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:54,705
What?

300
00:23:54,705 --> 00:23:56,552
What do you want?

301
00:23:56,994 --> 00:23:58,541
I found it, Sir!

302
00:24:00,476 --> 00:24:05,677

303
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:17,415
Hey you!

304
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:22,066
Why are you doing this to me?

305
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,335
Come out!

306
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:29,222
You stole this, didn't you?

307
00:24:29,222 --> 00:24:31,594
Stole? What do you mean? I found it.

308
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:32,920
You found it?

309
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,017
This? You little rascal!

310
00:24:37,908 --> 00:24:39,969
What is all this?

311
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:43,796
These are for my father who is in Chung...

312
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:45,563
Chung?

313
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,878
Get him out of there!

314
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:54,827
Sir! Sir! Please! He didn't do this!

315
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:58,461
Dae Shik!

316
00:24:58,461 --> 00:25:00,270
Dae Shik!

317
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:03,480
Please have pity!

318
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:08,778
I don't even know where Sir Hopan lives.

319
00:25:08,778 --> 00:25:10,181
I didn't even know what that was.

320
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:12,372
Hey!

321
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:14,854
You don't know what drawing it is?

322
00:25:14,854 --> 00:25:19,043
Then how did you know it was from Chung?

323
00:25:19,043 --> 00:25:20,227
It's not like that.

324
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,037
My father went to Chung.

325
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:24,918
What? Who's your father and why did he go to Chung?

326
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:28,787
He was taken there during the war as a hostage.

327
00:25:29,183 --> 00:25:31,505
Father!

328
00:25:31,505 --> 00:25:33,105
Are you alive? Are you all right?

329
00:25:33,105 --> 00:25:35,801
Father!

330
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:40,023
Hey, then what is this... this weird thing?

331
00:25:40,023 --> 00:25:41,980
It's a mask.

332
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,119
My father used to be a performer.
 So when he comes back

333
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:49,295
I can perform with him, standing on ropes and all.

334
00:25:49,295 --> 00:25:53,627
That's why I spent many sleepless nights to make each one of them.

335
00:25:53,627 --> 00:25:55,643
Seriously?

336
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,934
Shi Wan.

337
00:25:57,934 --> 00:26:00,033
What the heck is he muttering like that?

338
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:03,479
Are you even sure you have the right thief?

339
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,416
Well...

340
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:10,186
Sir...

341
00:26:10,186 --> 00:26:12,129
I'm hungry.

342
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:16,339
What? Rice?!

343
00:26:17,338 --> 00:26:19,393
You're hungry, huh?

344
00:26:19,393 --> 00:26:20,836
Right?

345
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,371
Right, you're hungry.

346
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:33,275
Tell me. Tell me the truth and I will feed you myself.

347
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:34,589
I won't eat!

348
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:37,488
I won't eat!

349
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,435
Come here!

350
00:26:38,435 --> 00:26:41,609
Please save me! I won't eat!

351
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:44,385
I think we have the wrong guy.

352
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:47,411
What do you mean? 
You said the drawing was in his room

353
00:26:47,411 --> 00:26:51,500
The footprint at the wall was definitely from someone who is swift.

354
00:26:54,202 --> 00:26:58,500
Someone as big and clumsy as he is could not have passed over the wall.

355
00:27:03,784 --> 00:27:06,723
 Yong! Dae Shik has been arrested. 

356
00:27:06,723 --> 00:27:10,220
 They say he found some drawing or something. 

357
00:27:12,513 --> 00:27:14,243
Here.

358
00:27:19,543 --> 00:27:20,860
Dae Shik.

359
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,401
Yong!

360
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:27,934
I didn't steal it.

361
00:27:27,934 --> 00:27:30,111
You believe me, right?

362
00:27:30,644 --> 00:27:36,032
Yong, what if I die without seeing my father?

363
00:27:36,952 --> 00:27:42,433
When my father comes back, please tell him.

364
00:27:43,064 --> 00:27:49,882
He told me to find him, when I make enough money. I made a promise!

365
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:54,714
Hey!

366
00:27:55,274 --> 00:28:00,262
You're a man! Act like one! Who's going to die?

367
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:04,317
Don't you worry. I will save you, I promise.

368
00:28:04,706 --> 00:28:07,472
Rea... really?

369
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:09,052
Of course!

370
00:28:38,987 --> 00:28:40,989
Dan!

371
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:45,580
Where did you get it?

372
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,293
I spent the whole night for this one.

373
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:52,749
A corbina caught in March is precious!

374
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:57,379
Since Yong passed his exam to become a guard, this is the very least we can do.

375
00:29:01,193 --> 00:29:03,450
What happened here?

376
00:29:04,623 --> 00:29:05,535
What was it?

377
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,090
The authorities came by.

378
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,920
They were looking for a drawing or something.

379
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,253
Oh, a drawing? That's it?

380
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,921
Geez.

381
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,711
Here.

382
00:29:28,873 --> 00:29:32,785
Get yourself some new clothes with this.

383
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,623
Where did you get this?

384
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:39,258
Why are you looking at me like that?

385
00:29:39,258 --> 00:29:42,779
Are you doubting me, Soe Dol?

386
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:44,755
Where did you get this kind of money?

387
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:48,700
To tell you honestly...

388
00:29:50,968 --> 00:29:54,200
You mustn't tell anyone.

389
00:29:55,152 --> 00:29:57,111
Sir!

390
00:29:58,251 --> 00:29:59,642
Sir!

391
00:29:59,642 --> 00:30:03,636
If you were the thief, would you put the drawing you stole in your room?

392
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,326
And what crazy person

393
00:30:05,326 --> 00:30:08,718
would call everyone in the village to show off the drawing he stole?

394
00:30:08,718 --> 00:30:11,249
Yes, you do have a point,

395
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:13,668
but what can I do?

396
00:30:14,642 --> 00:30:17,528
Sir! Please do something for Dae Shik!

397
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:19,432
Leave me alone!

398
00:30:19,432 --> 00:30:20,454
Sir!

399
00:30:20,454 --> 00:30:23,080
You leech!

400
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,344
If you really want to have even a chance...

401
00:30:25,344 --> 00:30:26,722
Yes?

402
00:30:27,223 --> 00:30:28,390
What is it?

403
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,726
What?

404
00:30:29,726 --> 00:30:31,316
Let's just try it, all right?

405
00:30:31,316 --> 00:30:32,397
Will it work?

406
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,575
We have to do something! We can't just stay here doing nothing.

407
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,417
Let's go. I'm ready

408
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:52,323


409
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,693
Who are all these people?

410
00:30:55,693 --> 00:30:58,476
I think they're all here to plead their cases.

411
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,025
All of these people?

412
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,088
Why are there so many people who want to plead their cases?

413
00:31:07,088 --> 00:31:10,073
Hey, is there anyone in Joseon who doesn't want to be heard?

414
00:31:10,073 --> 00:31:12,001
Pay attention to how this country is being run.

415
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:15,794
I don't care about anything except my own business.

416
00:31:20,818 --> 00:31:23,754
This is so unfair!

417
00:31:23,754 --> 00:31:28,896
My poor brother, he's being treated so unfairly!

418
00:31:28,896 --> 00:31:30,240
Go away!

419
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,772
What are you doing to a poor and weak woman?

420
00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:34,700
Weak?

421
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,144
Don't be like that. Let us see the king.

422
00:31:37,144 --> 00:31:38,473
The king?

423
00:31:38,473 --> 00:31:40,176
Is he your buddy or what?

424
00:31:40,176 --> 00:31:41,684
Do you think he has that much free time?

425
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:44,787
I have to see him to tell  him about my case!

426
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:47,061
If you don't want to be beaten up, go away!

427
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:48,997
Where do you think this is?

428
00:31:48,997 --> 00:31:50,326
Hey!

429
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,138
Pleading my case is something the law of this country allows!

430
00:31:52,138 --> 00:31:54,013
The law of this country?

431
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:57,927
Since when has this country followed the law?

432
00:31:57,927 --> 00:31:59,540
Words don't work with you, do they?

433
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,055
Move away!

434
00:32:03,064 --> 00:32:05,342
I have to see the king!

435
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:07,793
Leave me! Let me go!

436
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:10,662
Why won't you listen to what I have to say?

437
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,014
Let me go!

438
00:32:21,157 --> 00:32:23,556
Where are they all?

439
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:27,987
So I want you all to push for my case.

440
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,046
For you?

441
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:30,447
Yes, that's right.

442
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:32,900
I will stand for all of you, sacrifice myself

443
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,232
and meet the king to tell him of all of your stories.

444
00:32:37,232 --> 00:32:40,762
If you sit there all day long, your butt will be sore, and that's it.

445
00:32:40,762 --> 00:32:42,946
You won't be able to see the king

446
00:32:42,946 --> 00:32:46,688
or even his back.

447
00:32:48,453 --> 00:32:51,584
All right, gather up.

448
00:32:51,584 --> 00:32:55,285
Come here! Yes, over there too.

449
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:09,745
Attack!

450
00:33:45,053 --> 00:33:47,169
Go! Stop him!

451
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:57,943
Go!

452
00:34:03,151 --> 00:34:06,972
All right, let's go!

453
00:34:11,277 --> 00:34:13,352
It's a game called 'Chuk guk'

454
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:16,108
that the Tang dynasty enjoyed.

455
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:22,488
This is foul play!

456
00:34:22,488 --> 00:34:23,633
Move!

457
00:34:24,537 --> 00:34:26,596
You little brat!

458
00:34:26,596 --> 00:34:28,810
Hey!

459
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:30,599
Give it to me!

460
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:53,173
Sir! I scored a goal!

461
00:34:55,242 --> 00:34:58,031
Great!

462
00:35:00,343 --> 00:35:02,046
What is that?

463
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:06,995
His Excellency!

464
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:10,822
Your people are being treated unfairly!

465
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:13,100
His highness!

466
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,236
Please hear my voice!

467
00:35:16,236 --> 00:35:19,301
His royal highness!

468
00:35:24,348 --> 00:35:27,001
His Excellency!

469
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:28,809
Go away!

470
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:31,478
Why aren't you leaving? Go!

471
00:35:31,478 --> 00:35:33,378
What's happening?

472
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,385
Kneel and pay your respects.

473
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:55,262
He says he's here to plead his case.

474
00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:57,524
Let him speak.

475
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:14,468
So, what is your case that has been treated so unfairly?

476
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:16,941
Yes, His Excellency.

477
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:20,496
My friend

478
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:26,718
My friend just found a drawing on the street

479
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:30,807
but he was arrested as the thief and being tortured.

480
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:34,289
Please order another investigation

481
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:37,239
for my friend who has been wrongly framed.

482
00:36:39,308 --> 00:36:41,410
Hyung Pan.

483
00:36:42,091 --> 00:36:43,462
Yes His Highness.

484
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:47,528
Your office is in charge of these pleads, right?

485
00:36:48,117 --> 00:36:49,681
Yes sir.

486
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:51,801
You take reponsibility

487
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:54,000
and you shall open a new investigation.

488
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,203
How can it be that my people are treated unfairly?

489
00:37:00,729 --> 00:37:02,035
Your Highness!

490
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:04,891
I am very grateful to you.

491
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:06,695
Well well.

492
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,304
Young man.

493
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:14,867
Your eyes are full of life.

494
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,049
I am very impressed

495
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:20,470
by your devoted friendship.

496
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:24,214
I promise you myself the truth will be found.

497
00:37:25,131 --> 00:37:26,716
His Excellency!

498
00:37:26,716 --> 00:37:30,152
Thank you!

499
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:36,604
His Excellency!

500
00:37:37,513 --> 00:37:41,851
While the noblemen here are playing at some game,

501
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:43,456
out there, at the door,

502
00:37:43,456 --> 00:37:46,808
people are spending their nights out there waiting to be heard.

503
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:48,123
Please

504
00:37:48,123 --> 00:37:51,003
bare an ear to their stories as well!

505
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:53,502
What an ingrate!

506
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,999
Is that so?

507
00:37:59,673 --> 00:38:02,599
Why didn't you tell me?

508
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:22,565
All of you, come in.

509
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:26,415
His Excellency will stop everything today

510
00:38:26,415 --> 00:38:31,290
and will hear to your stories himself.

511
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:00,482
This...

512
00:39:00,482 --> 00:39:03,124
who does this belong to?

513
00:39:03,972 --> 00:39:10,388
His Royal Highness! Please hear our pleadings.

514
00:39:10,388 --> 00:39:17,283
His Royal Highness! Please hear our pleadings.

515
00:39:18,061 --> 00:39:22,410
His Excellency! Please listen to my story.

516
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:27,935
His Excellency! Please listen to my story.

517
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:31,903
My son would never do that.

518
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:40,124
His Excellency! Please listen to my story.

519
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:57,666
Don't worry.

520
00:39:57,666 --> 00:40:01,380
Your Excellency!

521
00:40:05,162 --> 00:40:10,550
We are grateful to you!

522
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:13,359
We are grateful to you!

523
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,881
How did it go?

524
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,635
The king has promised a full new investigation.

525
00:40:23,635 --> 00:40:26,355
He's a great man!

526
00:40:26,694 --> 00:40:30,374
He gave up on the people and ran away when there was trouble.

527
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:33,179
I'm sure he had his reasons.

528
00:40:34,311 --> 00:40:36,352
Hey, Bambi!

529
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,060
Let's go.

530
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,969
Let's go.

531
00:40:42,185 --> 00:40:43,970
Come on!

532
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,632
All right!

533
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:57,587
Hyung Pan.

534
00:40:58,053 --> 00:41:01,741
Take care of everything that I've heard today.

535
00:41:01,741 --> 00:41:03,574
But sir.

536
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:05,643
If you listen to all of their unfair stories

537
00:41:05,643 --> 00:41:08,144
the people will look down on the court.

538
00:41:08,144 --> 00:41:10,054
You give them one thing

539
00:41:10,054 --> 00:41:13,559
and they will ask for 10, or 100 more. 
That's in their nature.

540
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:16,331
The Royal Empire has collapsed.

541
00:41:16,331 --> 00:41:19,198
Chung will soon reunite the continent.

542
00:41:19,198 --> 00:41:22,504
Yet I am here.

543
00:41:22,504 --> 00:41:25,798
Who am I to trust now?

544
00:41:25,798 --> 00:41:30,328
The only people who can support me and give me strength are the people out there.

545
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:31,982
Because of two incidents,

546
00:41:31,982 --> 00:41:35,525
their trust in me has fallen deep down.

547
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:37,067
From now on

548
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:40,383
I will be a King worthy of my people's trust.

549
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:44,325
That's what I've been saying

550
00:41:44,325 --> 00:41:47,491
and what I've always meant to say.

551
00:41:47,491 --> 00:41:50,464
Make sure to solve that kid's pleading as well.

552
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:54,575
But the thing is, it has to do with Hopan.

553
00:41:54,575 --> 00:41:59,975
Hopan?

554
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,126
Deal with it according to the rules.

555
00:42:02,126 --> 00:42:04,503
But sir...

556
00:42:04,503 --> 00:42:06,726
Yes sir.

557
00:42:06,726 --> 00:42:11,293
I will deal with it according to the rules.

558
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,854
Did he die?

559
00:42:28,854 --> 00:42:32,031
It's not even his funeral, so why do you use these good pots?

560
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:36,926
Even if Dae Shik is alive, he's not really living.

561
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:41,347
Here. people don't die that easily.

562
00:42:41,347 --> 00:42:42,516
Eat.

563
00:42:42,516 --> 00:42:45,352
Eat, you have to gain strenght and that's how we're going to save Dae Shik.

564
00:42:45,352 --> 00:42:47,569
Otherwise I...

565
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:49,910
Otherwise what?

566
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:54,400
Well, otherwise, I'll eat it myself.

567
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,543
We're from the ministry.

568
00:43:04,781 --> 00:43:06,986
Come in gentlemen!

569
00:43:06,986 --> 00:43:10,448
Sit here.

570
00:43:31,015 --> 00:43:33,079
Hey madam!

571
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:34,866
You should drink too.

572
00:43:37,038 --> 00:43:39,396
Here, take one glass.

573
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:49,695
What are you doing?

574
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:51,392
If you're here to investigate, that's what you should do.

575
00:43:51,392 --> 00:43:53,832
What? Who are you?

576
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,118
Let's go.

577
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,069
All your complaints have been solved.

578
00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:10,223
Hear!

579
00:44:10,223 --> 00:44:12,738
The theft of the drawing at Hopan's household

580
00:44:12,738 --> 00:44:15,245
has gone through a new investigation

581
00:44:15,245 --> 00:44:20,320
but it has been revealed that Jang Dae Shik was clearly the culprit.

582
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,756
In relation to this, the king

583
00:44:22,756 --> 00:44:25,359
has expressed his deepest condolences.

584
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,288
Jang Dae Shik's friend, who brought in the complaint

585
00:44:28,288 --> 00:44:32,446
should receive 100 beatings in usual circumstances

586
00:44:32,446 --> 00:44:37,284
but under the King's special orders, he will be spared.

587
00:44:46,424 --> 00:44:48,689
Dae Shik!

588
00:44:51,546 --> 00:44:55,187
What are you going to do now?

589
00:44:55,187 --> 00:44:59,273
You messed the whole thing up by interfering!

590
00:44:59,273 --> 00:45:04,996
Dae Shik is going to die now!

591
00:45:04,996 --> 00:45:11,638
Hopan said he was going to kill him! 
What are you going to do now? Huh?

592
00:45:11,638 --> 00:45:13,742
Kill him?

593
00:45:15,138 --> 00:45:16,552
 In 15 days, 

594
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:20,871
 all of my hidden money will go to Chung 

595
00:45:20,871 --> 00:45:22,780
 When it comes to safekeeping money 

596
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:27,397
 there is nowhere like Chung. 

597
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:32,555
Hopan you bastard!

598
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:38,101
Anyway, what are we going to do about Dae Shik?

599
00:45:38,101 --> 00:45:40,196
Is there any other way?

600
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:51,114
What are you guys doing?

601
00:45:51,114 --> 00:45:53,688
What is up with your long faces? 
Is there a funeral somewhere?

602
00:45:53,688 --> 00:45:54,486
Geez

603
00:45:54,486 --> 00:45:55,618
Hey!

604
00:45:55,618 --> 00:45:58,010
Aren't you even worried about Dae Shik?

605
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:01,200
He didn't commit any crime. He will be released soon.

606
00:46:02,906 --> 00:46:06,216
It's a rotten world.

607
00:46:06,216 --> 00:46:08,549
Do you think they'll release him because he has done no wrong?

608
00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:11,359
Don't worry, don't worry.

609
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,478
Why is there no key hole?

610
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,007
Where did you get the money?

611
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:30,445
Well, actually...

612
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,661
You mustn't tell anyone, ok?

613
00:47:36,334 --> 00:47:39,902
There was a thief in the warehouse in the Hopan household

614
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:42,620
I think the thief made it in by unlocking the lock.

615
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,157
He's no ordinary thief.

616
00:47:44,157 --> 00:47:45,777
And so what?

617
00:47:46,143 --> 00:47:50,747
I made them a special new lock.

618
00:47:50,747 --> 00:47:53,079
No thief could ever break in now.

619
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:55,517
A special lock?

620
00:48:00,929 --> 00:48:06,067
So that is the grand masterpiece.

621
00:48:06,397 --> 00:48:10,757
It's the drawing of flowers and trees drawn on silk material.

622
00:48:12,546 --> 00:48:14,196
The portrait,

623
00:48:14,196 --> 00:48:15,884
the wrinkles of the clothes,

624
00:48:16,329 --> 00:48:19,161
they all look alive, don't they?

625
00:48:19,161 --> 00:48:24,600
Well, I can see the clothe is wrinkled, but well, it's so so.

626
00:48:26,246 --> 00:48:31,722
That lowlife stuck it on the wall with sticky rice, so the corner is a bit damaged,

627
00:48:31,722 --> 00:48:34,086
but anyways, I found it back thanks to you.

628
00:48:34,086 --> 00:48:36,611
I will never forget this one. I owe you one.

629
00:48:36,611 --> 00:48:39,583
This is nothing, you shouldn't.

630
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:45,116
You do have lots of things.

631
00:48:45,116 --> 00:48:46,690
Sir,

632
00:48:47,893 --> 00:48:50,245
what is that?

633
00:48:52,986 --> 00:48:55,649
Ah, that is a special mask called  Moksimchilmyun. 

634
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,878
I see...  Moksimchilmyun... 

635
00:49:00,878 --> 00:49:03,063
It's a mask made during the Silla era.

636
00:49:03,063 --> 00:49:05,411
It's made out of pellion tree

637
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:09,673
but this one has gold engraved in it.

638
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:13,690
Golden eyes, you say?

639
00:49:15,171 --> 00:49:19,477
May I try it on?

640
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,401
Sure, go ahead.

641
00:49:22,401 --> 00:49:25,212
All right then.

642
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:39,089
This is a warning to all you people for stealing something from a nobleman's family.

643
00:49:39,089 --> 00:49:42,116
It has been ordered that death will be his sentence!

644
00:49:42,384 --> 00:49:43,182
No!

645
00:49:43,182 --> 00:49:44,020
Dae Shik!

646
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,694
Ajussi!

647
00:49:46,694 --> 00:49:48,627
Dae Shik!

648
00:49:48,627 --> 00:49:49,618
Dae Shik!

649
00:49:52,725 --> 00:49:55,959
Ahjussi!

650
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,595
Father!

651
00:49:59,595 --> 00:50:01,378
Dae Shik!

652
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:05,561
Hurry up! We have a long way to go!

653
00:50:07,314 --> 00:50:10,107
Keep an eye on him.

654
00:50:15,172 --> 00:50:17,886
Always be aware!

655
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,186
Hurry up!

656
00:50:24,911 --> 00:50:28,183
What the... Let's go around!

657
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,064
Sir! Sir! Something terrible has happened!

658
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:11,479
The carriage! The carriage!

659
00:51:12,295 --> 00:51:14,083
The carriage!

660
00:51:16,492 --> 00:51:19,065
The carriage has gone! Find the carriage!

661
00:51:19,065 --> 00:51:23,066
Find the carriage! Quick!

662
00:51:33,273 --> 00:51:34,901
Father...

663
00:51:36,501 --> 00:51:39,359
I really wanted... for one last time...

664
00:51:40,951 --> 00:51:45,118
perform with you one last time.

665
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:55,883
Wait!

666
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:13,954
You're alive. The thief came by once again.

667
00:52:14,675 --> 00:52:16,879
Dae Shik!

668
00:52:16,879 --> 00:52:18,092
Dae Shik!

669
00:52:46,965 --> 00:52:49,662
I didn't make any mistake this time!

670
00:53:11,242 --> 00:53:14,846
I did go in by opening the lock

671
00:53:14,846 --> 00:53:18,508
and at that time the lock was perfectly normal.

672
00:53:23,897 --> 00:53:27,788
When you opened the lock, this had already been broken.

673
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:31,947
The culprit was inside here.

674
00:53:31,947 --> 00:53:33,518
What do you mean?

675
00:53:33,518 --> 00:53:35,032
Look.

676
00:53:35,032 --> 00:53:38,925
Before you came, the culprit already broke the chain

677
00:53:38,925 --> 00:53:42,246
and restrained it with this string so that you wouldn't notice it

678
00:53:42,246 --> 00:53:46,065
and after you left, he pulled on this string from the inside.

679
00:53:49,274 --> 00:53:53,573
But if he were here, I would have definitely seen him.

680
00:53:53,573 --> 00:53:55,097
Furthermore...

681
00:53:55,097 --> 00:53:58,781
True, there is nowhere to hide in here.

682
00:53:59,734 --> 00:54:01,257
So

683
00:54:01,257 --> 00:54:03,408
he was over there.

684
00:54:05,735 --> 00:54:07,989
 It's a mask made during the Silla era. 

685
00:54:07,989 --> 00:54:10,409
 It was made from a pellion tree 

686
00:54:10,409 --> 00:54:14,361
 but this has gold engraved in it. 

687
00:54:15,058 --> 00:54:18,704
 Golden eyes, you say? 

688
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:25,584
 May I try it on? 

689
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:29,793
 Sure. Go ahead. 

690
00:54:29,793 --> 00:54:32,415
  All right, thank you. 

691
00:54:38,131 --> 00:54:39,980
Sir!

692
00:54:40,422 --> 00:54:43,292
We have the dinner table ready for you.

693
00:54:44,077 --> 00:54:45,793
You're hungry, right?

694
00:54:45,793 --> 00:54:49,177
I told them to prepare a full table. Let's go.

695
00:54:49,177 --> 00:54:51,196
Yes sir.

696
00:55:06,835 --> 00:55:10,908
What? He was right there, in front of my eyes?

697
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:12,137
Yes.

698
00:55:12,569 --> 00:55:15,955
The thief was probably wearing black.

699
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:21,789
By hiding behind this mask, he would have been invisible.

700
00:55:27,229 --> 00:55:31,132
This is the sand that must have come from his shoes.

701
00:55:32,523 --> 00:55:34,087
Young man.

702
00:55:34,592 --> 00:55:38,933
Please find my money back.

703
00:55:38,933 --> 00:55:43,335
All my fortune has disappeared!

704
00:55:45,428 --> 00:55:49,125
Go ahead. I'll stay here.

705
00:55:55,483 --> 00:55:58,808
He can't have gone far. Search this place!

706
00:55:58,808 --> 00:56:00,053
Yes sir!

707
00:56:06,289 --> 00:56:09,282
Hey! What are you doing here?

708
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:12,109
Hopan told me to come here.

709
00:56:42,779 --> 00:56:47,744
Here here! Let's drink!

710
00:56:47,744 --> 00:56:50,299
Dae Shik, eat this.

711
00:56:50,299 --> 00:56:55,670
I don't know if you know this, but all this is thanks to Guard Yong.

712
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:59,448
He's the one who made this possible.

713
00:57:00,436 --> 00:57:01,652
Guard? Yeah right.

714
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:06,602
What kind of guard wears those baggy pants and oils his hair?

715
00:57:06,602 --> 00:57:07,726
What?

716
00:57:07,726 --> 00:57:11,282
What do you say things like that?

717
00:57:14,422 --> 00:57:16,040
Where are you going?

718
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:20,219
Are you sad that Yong didn't even bother show up his face?

719
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:24,812
Hey, what did you say earlier? Baggy pants and oil in his hair? What do you mean?

720
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:29,132
Your son is the errand boy of the Castor Oil gang.

721
00:57:29,132 --> 00:57:30,488
Guard yeah right.

722
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:35,570
Come on, why do you make lies like that?

723
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:38,395
Stupid girl, you must have seen it wrong.

724
00:57:38,395 --> 00:57:40,047
Right?

725
00:57:40,783 --> 00:57:45,872
Come to think of it, we've never seen Yong in his guard robe.

726
00:57:45,872 --> 00:57:48,972
I'm telling you the truth. he's hanging with that Castor Oil gang or whatever

727
00:57:48,972 --> 00:57:53,526
I've seen him with my own two eyes.

728
00:57:56,155 --> 00:57:57,989
I'm going to kill him!

729
00:57:57,989 --> 00:58:00,710
That brat! He's going to die!

730
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:03,847
Don't stop me.

731
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:08,547
That little rascal! Humiliate me like this!

732
00:58:09,339 --> 00:58:13,039
Look at him go.

733
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:17,025
Go find that Yong!

734
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:27,969
Congratulations on getting out!

735
00:58:27,969 --> 00:58:29,648
Yong!

736
00:58:30,454 --> 00:58:33,460
Here. Come here!

737
00:58:34,156 --> 00:58:37,949
Look at this! I cleaned up everything!

738
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:42,355
I'm sorry.

739
00:58:42,355 --> 00:58:43,765
What are you sorry for?

740
00:58:43,765 --> 00:58:45,326
Just...

741
00:58:47,379 --> 00:58:51,549
I heard everything.

742
00:58:51,549 --> 00:58:54,521
I heard you went to the King and kneeled just to save me.

743
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:56,721
Thank you, Yong.

744
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:08,425
When did I tell you I had made it as a guard? 
 You're the one who got yourself ideas.

745
00:59:08,425 --> 00:59:10,076
Then

746
00:59:10,076 --> 00:59:11,837
what is this?

747
00:59:13,615 --> 00:59:14,895
That's not mine.

748
00:59:14,895 --> 00:59:16,431
Is that so?

749
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:20,079
Good thing you didn't make it as a guard.

750
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:24,129
Now you can finally start studying for the civil examination. I will fully support you.

751
00:59:24,129 --> 00:59:27,768
I'm not taking the examination. I'll just work with the Castor Oil gang.

752
00:59:27,768 --> 00:59:30,495
You little bastard! What did you say?

753
00:59:30,495 --> 00:59:32,461
Look at me! Am I even fit for the exam?

754
00:59:32,461 --> 00:59:35,105
I only tried it because you were so nagging me about it.

755
00:59:35,552 --> 00:59:40,180
Of course, by law, peasants can take the exam. 
 But have you ever seen anyone actually pass it?

756
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:43,234
They are all errand boys for the noblemen's sons.

757
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:48,214
This is reality. Please stop dreaming!

758
00:59:48,214 --> 00:59:49,732
So...

759
00:59:49,732 --> 00:59:52,272
that is why you're with these lawless people?

760
00:59:52,272 --> 00:59:53,423
Even so,

761
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,666
if I do it right, I could live better than any regular nobleman.

762
00:59:56,666 --> 01:00:00,339
I'll earn money that way and succeed!

763
01:00:03,655 --> 01:00:05,987
You brat!

764
01:00:05,987 --> 01:00:09,630
How dare you talk like that to your father!

765
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:13,860
Dan! Stop!

766
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,891
Stop it. It's enough.

767
01:00:47,876 --> 01:00:50,607
Are you going to spend the whole night like this?

768
01:00:50,607 --> 01:00:53,350
I don't think he'll come back tonight.

769
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:57,233
There's nothing wrong with what Yong said.

770
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:04,524
I told you

771
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,755
not to give too much affection for someone else's child.

772
01:01:08,755 --> 01:01:10,289
Little brat.

773
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:15,143
He's such a precious little boy

774
01:01:15,929 --> 01:01:19,850
why did someone like me, a low life and idiot, take him in?

775
01:01:20,945 --> 01:01:23,017
What are you saying?

776
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:28,062
If it hadn't been for you, he would have died a long time ago.

777
01:01:28,062 --> 01:01:32,458
What to do? Why go with that lawless gang?

778
01:01:37,909 --> 01:01:39,962
it's all my fault.

779
01:01:40,585 --> 01:01:42,582
Yong...

780
01:01:43,529 --> 01:01:46,088
and even our Ja Dol.

781
01:02:11,614 --> 01:02:13,937
Why did he rob this place again?

782
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:16,960
Just to doodle on this painting?

783
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,881
I guess he wanted to stop

784
01:02:19,881 --> 01:02:22,166
someone else from dying for his crime.

785
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:25,969
If you're right, then he's a pretty decent fellow.

786
01:02:25,969 --> 01:02:27,334
But

787
01:02:27,334 --> 01:02:31,734
why draw a red flower?

788
01:02:42,604 --> 01:02:44,246
Father

789
01:02:45,075 --> 01:02:47,106
Does he know?

790
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:52,636
Do you think he knows the meaning of the red blossom I drew?

791
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:10,959
The house is very clean and neat, and looks pleasant to live in.

792
01:03:10,959 --> 01:03:13,270
It's all thanks to you, Eun Chae.

793
01:03:13,729 --> 01:03:17,587
I was a little dubious because it belonged to a traitor,

794
01:03:17,587 --> 01:03:20,687
I didn't know it could be changed into this fabulous house.

795
01:03:21,843 --> 01:03:23,527
May I

796
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:27,426
look around for a while?

797
01:04:35,383 --> 01:04:49,523


798
01:04:49,523 --> 01:04:51,324
