1
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:34,270
If he wants to know the truth about his father's death, tomorrow...

2
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,200
Don't you have something to hunt?

3
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,708
Lord Kim Ik Hee wants to see you.

4
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:38,930
Kim Ik Hee?

5
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,132
I wanted to say thank you for saving my life.

6
00:00:41,132 --> 00:00:43,321
Do you know how much I looked for you?

7
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:48,089
What happened?

8
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,337
He passed away.

9
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:02,144
You're such a baby. Try not to use your left shoulder too much.

10
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:05,827
I can't stop him, but I can't tell him to go ahead either.

11
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:20,997
Episode 16

12
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,863
What kind of wall falls down so easily?

13
00:01:45,548 --> 00:01:46,742
Dirt wall and water...

14
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:54,356
Our Iljimae did?That's right.

15
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:57,429
Iljimae saved Eun Bok

16
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:00,429
and all the other boys.

17
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:02,862
Yah

18
00:02:02,862 --> 00:02:05,323
I feel full, just hearing the story.

19
00:02:05,323 --> 00:02:08,059
Like you ever get full?

20
00:02:11,852 --> 00:02:13,436
Did you hear the news?

21
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:16,521
Our Iljimae took Jeong Myong Soo and his son,

22
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:20,235
and loaded them on a ship to China.

23
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,705
You're here.

24
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:40,621
How strange...

25
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:43,612
His wound was healing nicely,

26
00:02:43,612 --> 00:02:47,159
but it got worse overnight.

27
00:02:51,508 --> 00:02:53,087
You're crying?

28
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:56,583
No

29
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,673
Your baby isn't going to die.

30
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,215
You'll flood my house with your tears if he ever gets hurt again.

31
00:03:12,073 --> 00:03:14,700
The news of that rat putting

32
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,697
Jeong Myong Soo and his son

33
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,019
on a ship to China has spread throughout the country,

34
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:23,911
and the situation has gotten out of hand.

35
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:25,359
And petitions criticizing the court for turning

36
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:29,647
a blind eye to Jeong Myong Soo and his son's atrocities

37
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:33,020
and asking about the court's responsibility in the affair

38
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,750
are pouring in from all over the country.

39
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,022
Moreover, the students at the Sung Kun Inn

40
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:41,351
are speaking their minds.

41
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:46,006
That's not all. 
 The people are once again gathering in front of

42
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:51,193
the envoy's quarters for not keeping 
 the promise we made to them.

43
00:03:51,193 --> 00:03:56,225
Your Majesty, we can no longer protect Jeong Myong Soo.

44
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:58,729
Thus, i guess it's time to

45
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:01,846
deport Jeong Myong Soo.

46
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:04,491
But

47
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:08,301
Jeong Myong Soo has caused many incidents

48
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:12,547
he doesn't have the nerve to report it to the Chung Empire

49
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:16,914
Your Majesty, Please agree to it

50
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:20,733
Capturing and torturing the people

51
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:24,205
and accusing them of being Iljimae's helpers

52
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:25,719
is a serious crime

53
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:31,312
Therefore!

54
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,547
Accused for hurting and disrespecting the Josoen citizens

55
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:36,472
Jeong Myong Soo. and Jeong Chi Hong will be

56
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:39,124
deported from this country right away

57
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:42,479
Your majesty 
 Moreover

58
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,935
there will be some changes to the imperial system.

59
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:49,058
Those who are taking advantage of their authority to make this country's wealth theirs,

60
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:51,965
such as Lee Myung,

61
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:54,622
Vice principle Hong Moon, Jung Hyuk Kyu

62
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:56,599
Lord Kim Woo Jin

63
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:59,698
Lord Oh Gak Soo

64
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:02,511
All will be dismissed, and seized of their wealth

65
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,457
in order to reflect the sins tthat hey've done to the people

66
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:09,420
Iljimae you bastard!

67
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,066
You dare!

68
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,548
You dare treat me like this! I Jeong Myong Soo!

69
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:20,916
Look at that disgusting bastard

70
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,309
He dared mess with us?

71
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:25,286
This is what you get!

72
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:28,799
In this world, dogs wins, horses loses

73
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:32,439
Don't bark like dogs!

74
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:37,075
If you do, you will end up like them

75
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:41,494
The only one who dared kick them is Iljimae, not the king

76
00:05:41,494 --> 00:05:43,594
If it wasn't for iljimae

77
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,998
these bastards wouldn't blink an eye.

78
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:53,551
Me too from now on, I'm going to treat Iljimae as my big brother

79
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:54,782
What are you saying brat?

80
00:05:54,782 --> 00:05:56,668
The big brother of your Castor Oil gang?

81
00:05:56,668 --> 00:06:00,832
You brat! Iljimae is our king!

82
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:03,355
He is our sun!

83
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,595
King...?

84
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:11,639
But then...

85
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,409
2 kings under the same sky, how is it possible?

86
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:18,417
In my eyes, I see him, he is accepted by the people

87
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:22,479
and full of warmth, like the sun.

88
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:29,017
King.. 
 ..a king..?

89
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:56,335
 Crown Prince   
 Father

90
00:06:56,335 --> 00:07:00,410
I'm back here after 9 years.

91
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:06,626
My son 
 All this time you have suffered because of me

92
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,909
Father

93
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:13,656
You've also gone through a lot, haven't you?

94
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:15,921
No, your majesty

95
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:21,722
Don't feel sad anymore

96
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:24,475
I should've thrown a welcome party for you

97
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:27,760
but now, this country is in a difficult situation

98
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,876
and the citizens haven't eased their anger yet, so I asked to make it simple

99
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:34,170
You did the right thing, Father

100
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:39,147
All right, go back to your room and rest, you must be tired from the long journey.

101
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:43,621
Since I'm not feeling well today either, I'll go back to my room to rest as well.

102
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:52,878
Your Majesty,

103
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:55,779
I think we should throw a big party

104
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,971
to let the mandarin

105
00:07:57,971 --> 00:08:00,588
celebrate his return

106
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:07,273
Jeong Myong Soo. got deported, and the crown prince is back

107
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:11,407
Don't you know what that means?

108
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:13,999
This is obviously

109
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:18,160
the Chung Empire compromised with the crown prince to overthrow me

110
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,387
There is no time to waste. I must act now

111
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:25,957
I've worked so hard to be here

112
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:28,675
and keep this position.

113
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:32,138
Now I won't give it up to anyone

114
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:46,006
Congrats bro! 
 I knew it! My bro is so cool!

115
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:48,488
Very cool 
 Very cool

116
00:08:50,484 --> 00:08:52,530
Woah, now you can make shoes for nobles

117
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,300
Then when are you going to enter the palace? 
 What are you saying?

118
00:08:55,614 --> 00:08:57,867
I'm going to miss him so much. What should I do ?

119
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:00,141
Hey, I will come out  to buy the materials frequently, so I will visit.

120
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:04,165
Congrats. Ahjussi  
 -Yong you're here  
 - Yes i am!

121
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,825
How can someone like you have

122
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:10,881
a great child like him? I can't understand

123
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:12,394
Damn brat

124
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,025
Because he takes after his mom.

125
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:20,736
Oh also, there is another happy news.

126
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:21,738
What?

127
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,137
Those two will officially

128
00:09:25,137 --> 00:09:27,899
get married.

129
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:31,870
Marriage? 
 Oh my...

130
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,807
At their age? Why don't they just live as they are?

131
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:37,007
So embarrassing 
 I know!

132
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,129
Your father is going to be a bit jealous now. 
 Why?

133
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:44,754
What do you mean why?

134
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:47,115
You good for nothing!

135
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:50,303
Your father and your mother...

136
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:53,412
Do something about it!

137
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:55,253
What do you want to do?

138
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,681
Oh wait

139
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,340
Are you saying my parents just lived together

140
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,996
without a wedding ceremony? 
 - It's not what I meant ..this punk..

141
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:09,178
They're just....

142
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:14,201
think of a way to make them have a hot night together

143
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:17,788
That's what a real son would do

144
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:29,628
Your wound hasn't healed yet, why do you keep running around!

145
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:36,340
Mother! 
 I heard that you and dad didn't have a wedding ceremony.

146
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,907
Why, all of a sudden?

147
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:43,149
Why didn't you tell me?

148
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:47,192
Don't worry mom 
 I will right now!...

149
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:50,158
No 
 Wait until I'm completely recovered

150
00:10:50,158 --> 00:10:54,783
I will ask the gang for my wages, and I will make a huge wedding for you both

151
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:56,810
What do you want to do with that dirty money?

152
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,172
A wedding?

153
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:01,263
You're still not out of the gang?

154
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:06,433
No, i just... 
 I want to do my duty as a real son to you both.

155
00:11:06,982 --> 00:11:08,586
If you don't want, then never mind!

156
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,321
Oh! What is all this?

157
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:23,515
Oh Mother, you can be so sly

158
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:25,948
I mean when did you get all that?

159
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:28,669
Mom, later on I will pay all this back to you

160
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:32,172
The soon to be bride doesn't have to do anything for the time being. Just take care of yourself.

161
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,771
I will take care of everything.

162
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:37,190
Don't make it a big fuss.

163
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,768
All right. 
 Faithful Dan!

164
00:11:41,152 --> 00:11:44,039
By the way, where is father?

165
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,519
It's karma.

166
00:11:58,877 --> 00:12:00,570
It's all my fault

167
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,216
My poor Yong.

168
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,191
What to do...

169
00:12:09,873 --> 00:12:11,281
Those jerks, it's because of them

170
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:15,177
they had such a bad portrait of Yong, I failed to recognize him.

171
00:12:15,177 --> 00:12:16,990
I should've recognized him a long time ago

172
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:20,487
What are you doing here?

173
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:24,912
Nothing

174
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,394
What are you up to?

175
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:30,455
Dad you heard too?

176
00:12:30,455 --> 00:12:32,876
That Kongal ahjussi and Shim Deok ahjumma are getting married?

177
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,690
Yes... I heard.

178
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,740
You're jealous

179
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,554
Don't worry! 
 You still have this good son here

180
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:45,726
I will take this opportunity to have a wedding for you too.

181
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:49,083
What wedding? We are too old for it

182
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,820
If you're that bored go to sleep

183
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,888
Just because you have nothing to do you're so bored

184
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:55,305
you come up with such nonsense.

185
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:59,162
No it's not like that,  you and... 
 -  Stop with your nonsense!

186
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:04,315
We don't even know what will happen tomorrow.

187
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:10,353
Oh my, you still acting like a shy kid at this age?

188
00:13:10,353 --> 00:13:13,602
You're shy? 
 Don't come and say other things later.

189
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:22,898
Yeah...

190
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:25,713
i don't know what'll happen tomorrow

191
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:28,792
I don't even know what'll become of me

192
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:33,490
I should at least hold a wedding ceremony for mom and dad, I'll feel better.

193
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:39,663
So you're saying that my wedding will be postponed and Swe Dol's wedding will take place before mine?

194
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:43,817
My Deok, we've already had our chance once.

195
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:49,125
Heung Kyun and I will prepare the flowers.

196
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,610
I will do the drinks and food 
 Oh yes! Everything is set then! Make some delicious food!

197
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,401
Hey, what about you two?

198
00:13:57,595 --> 00:14:00,091
We are experts in another field.

199
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:04,769
Their hot night 
 We'll be responsible for it

200
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:07,010
Then 
 I will sing for them!

201
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:14,283
Whats going on? 
 Having some fun?

202
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:18,101
Ohhhhh my stomachhhh

203
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,644
Where r you going? We haven't finished talking 
 I brought some rice cakes for you!

204
00:14:25,644 --> 00:14:27,793
Why is everyone leaving?

205
00:14:28,715 --> 00:14:30,813
What the? What's going on with everyone?

206
00:14:35,864 --> 00:14:37,411
Your Majesty

207
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:39,172
Yes

208
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:42,121
I have something important for you to do.

209
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:50,392
What are these beggars doing here?

210
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:53,019
Isn't this Minister Byun's inn?

211
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:54,319
I'm sure it is.

212
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:58,819
I thought it was the most luxurious inn in town...

213
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:02,179
Those filthy beggars...

214
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:05,399
We wasted our time, we came a long way for nothing.

215
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:07,708
Let's go somewhere else.

216
00:15:09,012 --> 00:15:10,591
My lady,

217
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,357
that lady and man are getting married.

218
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:15,154
How embarrassing.

219
00:15:15,154 --> 00:15:16,375
Who?

220
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,914
That lady who lent you her dress and Swe Dol.

221
00:15:19,914 --> 00:15:23,241
That man who's missing his front tooth. He's a friend of my father's.

222
00:15:25,774 --> 00:15:28,029
Where will they hold their wedding?

223
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:34,961
Is something wrong?

224
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:37,247
Those punks, they all left me alone

225
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:40,681
My pretty Dan

226
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:44,204
Do I smell?

227
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:53,792
What is this? 
 Is it for Kongal's wedding?

228
00:15:58,869 --> 00:15:59,888
What?

229
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:05,792
This is too much 
 Why are you doing this to me too?

230
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,654
What did I do?

231
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,154
I don't even smell

232
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,878
Father

233
00:16:16,878 --> 00:16:19,933
Cow poop, horse poop , dog poop. None of this.

234
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:21,633
Please get a good one today. All right?

235
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:24,905
I got it brat! I'm more of an expert than you

236
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,693
Don't be late, come back before the wedding, okay?

237
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:31,060
If you go to have fun elsewhere, I will tell mother about you!

238
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,118
Mother?

239
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,638
You're so good at this.

240
00:16:35,638 --> 00:16:37,215
Alright, you brat!

241
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:55,288
What is this?

242
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,683
Isn't this a wild boar?

243
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:02,679
You must have meat at the feast!

244
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:07,414
Here for you! 
 I caught it myself

245
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,793
What are you doing?

246
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,437
Isn't this for a wedding?

247
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:18,961
Is someone getting married?

248
00:17:18,961 --> 00:17:23,908
Young master 
 You wouldn't know, but Yong can be a good son.

249
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:26,818
He wants to hold a wedding ceremony for his parents

250
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:33,837
Their wedding will be in Miss Eun Chae's inn.

251
00:17:33,837 --> 00:17:35,359
You'll be coming too, right?

252
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:37,580
Of course, you have to come!

253
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,796
I don't think I'll be very welcome.

254
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:49,235
What did I do? Why are they all leaving me out of things?

255
00:17:49,783 --> 00:17:52,711
Father 
 What took you so long to come back this late?

256
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:55,788
Come here 
 You're kidding! Didnt you ignore me today? 
 Go away!

257
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:58,959
Just a second 
 Leave me. Why aren't you listening? Let me go

258
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:01,075
It hurts

259
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:04,578
Just get in! 
 Hurry 
 What??

260
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:07,919
What is this? 
 Dad

261
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,826
You said everyone avoided you right?

262
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:12,880
I know the reason why

263
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:16,176
Hurry, get in 
 What?

264
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:18,632
You're saying that people have been avoiding me because I smell?

265
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:22,786
You useless punk!, 
 Where is the smell? 
 Where?

266
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:25,717
I'm like a 100 times cleaner than you!

267
00:18:27,428 --> 00:18:31,289
Hmm... maybe I do smell a little. 
 Of course! 
 Hurry and get in

268
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:34,455
Oh careful you punk!

269
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,833
Get in! I will make sure to clean you well 
 Stay still

270
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:49,260
I wonder if the preparations for the wedding ceremony are going well.

271
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:54,933
Ah it's the doctor 
 They did say the crown prince was sick.

272
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:57,877
But why was he being so cautious?

273
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,649
But this is aconite!

274
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:10,689
Ah this is refreshing.

275
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:12,711
Feeling refreshed? 
 Yeah

276
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,542
But why is the water so muddy?

277
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:21,034
Did you put something in it?

278
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:25,462
No, all I did was put some ginseng, leaves,  rice water, some apricots,

279
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:27,698
to make your skin lighter and smoother

280
00:20:27,698 --> 00:20:30,281
I put them all in

281
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:33,498
Really? 
 So this will make my skin smoother and lighter?

282
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,750
Of course you'll be all white and smooth.

283
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,248
You're a great son.

284
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:48,334
You brat! Do it gently!

285
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:53,129
Father 
 - What?

286
00:20:55,373 --> 00:20:58,365
Why are you so skinny? 
 What? Skinny?

287
00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:00,623
Don't you see my wide back?

288
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:02,415
Do you want me to show you?

289
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:04,860
Now you see it?

290
00:21:08,753 --> 00:21:10,477
Father 
 What?

291
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:15,828
You must've had a hard time raising me up, right?

292
00:21:15,828 --> 00:21:18,325
What's up with you? Saying these things all of a sudden?

293
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:22,100
Look here. I even started to have goosebumps

294
00:21:23,962 --> 00:21:25,750
Father 
 What?

295
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:28,490
If by any chance

296
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:31,954
I'm not here

297
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:36,477
you must live happily ever after with Pretty Dan, okay?

298
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:38,538
Alright?

299
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:43,092
What, are you going to die or what?

300
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:45,857
You should be the one to take care, if ever I'm not around anymore.

301
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,055
You must live with your mom and take care of her

302
00:21:51,951 --> 00:21:55,109
You know me, 
 I can't live without you.

303
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:56,367
You know it well.

304
00:21:56,367 --> 00:22:00,298
Me too, I can't live without my Yong 
 Ouch!

305
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:02,203
Why do you keep hitting me?

306
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,973
Scrub harder!

307
00:22:13,973 --> 00:22:16,401
You have no strength at all.

308
00:22:19,284 --> 00:22:21,813
I'm sorry father.

309
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:27,414
How hard it must be for you 
 My poor son

310
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:32,661
Yong 
 I'm  fine

311
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:35,658
So,

312
00:22:35,658 --> 00:22:38,098
Don't forgive me, okay?

313
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:53,932
Oh Dad look at this! 
 So dirty!

314
00:22:53,932 --> 00:22:56,158
Everyone's a bit dirty.

315
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:58,746
Clean carefully.

316
00:22:58,746 --> 00:23:01,336
Don't splash me!

317
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,604
Move to the left, you bastard!

318
00:23:06,825 --> 00:23:09,498
Can't you understand ? I said to the left! left! 
 This is left to me!

319
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:12,169
Oh is it? Then to the right!

320
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:24,788
What?

321
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:30,068
Ahjussi! Don't forget anything!

322
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:34,407
Hey, don't you have any experience, with all your years?

323
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:37,986
The female is on this side, and the male on the other side. 
  Do I have to teach you all the little things?

324
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:39,516
Yeah, you know everything!

325
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:47,789
Miss.

326
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,685
You lent me your inn, all this for me?

327
00:23:51,685 --> 00:23:53,510
You didn't have to do that

328
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,193
Ok, once my parents come,

329
00:23:56,193 --> 00:23:57,768
we will greet them officially.

330
00:23:57,768 --> 00:24:01,832
Go away! 
 You have no manners. How dare you? To our Miss!

331
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:06,094
What again??

332
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:10,012
It's almost time! 
 Go and get them now.

333
00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:13,682
Miss, don't forget the whistle!

334
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,669
My faithful Dan!

335
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:20,034
Yong.

336
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:22,077
Yong.

337
00:24:30,156 --> 00:24:31,123
Father

338
00:24:31,123 --> 00:24:34,293
Where did you go so early in the morning?

339
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:35,818
Ah just here and there

340
00:24:35,818 --> 00:24:38,311
Father 
 Try this on

341
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:41,583
Why should I try other people's wedding clothes?

342
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,531
Dan will get mad at me, no I won't do it

343
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:45,720
Pretty Dan was worried

344
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,138
that she might have made it too small for Kongal ahjussi.

345
00:24:48,138 --> 00:24:49,109
Really?

346
00:24:49,825 --> 00:24:52,807
My pretty Dan wouldn't make that kind of mistake

347
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:56,548
Oh it fits so right

348
00:24:56,548 --> 00:25:00,299
But then... it would be too small for Kongal.

349
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,330
What should we do?

350
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,344
What is this?? What's going on?

351
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:20,246
This is from Getong's mother.

352
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:04,026
Father Father!! 
 Take a look over there!

353
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:24,364
The groom is Na Swe Dol!

354
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:28,205
The bride is Pretty Dan

355
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,269
Next!

356
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:01,609
The bride's bow

357
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:21,862
Next!

358
00:27:26,106 --> 00:27:27,639
Get up! Why are you in such a hurry?

359
00:27:33,513 --> 00:27:35,323
Next is...

360
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:38,715
The groom's bow

361
00:27:50,554 --> 00:27:52,436
Why are you crying??

362
00:27:52,436 --> 00:27:55,429
You still haven't let go of Swe Dol?

363
00:28:16,525 --> 00:28:18,533
Here? 
 Is it here?

364
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:20,248
Then here?

365
00:28:23,364 --> 00:28:27,732
We don't know who will drink it! How are we supposed to put it?

366
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:31,623
That's right.

367
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,554
Just put it all in!

368
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:41,684
Yes yes!

369
00:28:41,684 --> 00:28:42,572
Just put it all in.

370
00:29:07,447 --> 00:29:08,945
Why is there hair on the floor?

371
00:29:22,034 --> 00:29:23,489
Thank you

372
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:29,162
For living with someone like me.

373
00:29:29,162 --> 00:29:31,549
What are you saying?

374
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:34,480
I didnt even do anything for you.

375
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,638
I should be the one thankful.

376
00:29:37,086 --> 00:29:40,943
Thanks for living with a useless guy like me.

377
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:10,129
They said it was just a flu.

378
00:30:10,129 --> 00:30:14,456
I think he's gotten worse ever since he drank his medicine.

379
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:16,726
It must be because he's gotten too sensitive.

380
00:30:16,726 --> 00:30:18,617
Yes, Your Majesty

381
00:30:22,435 --> 00:30:24,759
Pretty Dan.

382
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:27,340
From now on, until the day we die,

383
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,563
we'll live happily ever after

384
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:32,232
the two of us, with Yong,

385
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:34,298
let's eat well,

386
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:36,263
and let's live well okay?

387
00:30:40,695 --> 00:30:42,231
Thank you

388
00:30:45,275 --> 00:30:48,120
Shall we...

389
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:52,424
I'm sleepy...

390
00:30:53,988 --> 00:30:56,466
You're tired too right?

391
00:30:56,466 --> 00:31:00,109
Should we shut the light?

392
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:03,535
Shall we?

393
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,546
Do you see anything? 
 What about over there? Do you see?

394
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,154
I see I see!!!

395
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,394
What? What? What?

396
00:31:35,248 --> 00:31:36,720
What is that?

397
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,040
You brats! Go away!

398
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,299
Go to sleep!

399
00:32:24,955 --> 00:32:27,715
You must unlock the door within half an hour.

400
00:32:34,457 --> 00:32:35,211
Who is there?

401
00:33:11,543 --> 00:33:13,988
He must have had time to run away, right?

402
00:33:13,988 --> 00:33:15,824
Woah, this is such an honor

403
00:33:15,824 --> 00:33:18,525
I saw Iljimae with my own two eyes! Right in front of me!

404
00:33:21,104 --> 00:33:22,438
Everyone eat well

405
00:33:28,181 --> 00:33:31,781
Look at this jerk's face, 
 you look worn out after a night

406
00:33:36,986 --> 00:33:39,330
Sister-in-law!

407
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,373
What did this guy do last night? Didn't you guys sleep?

408
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:48,086
Did you hear?

409
00:33:48,086 --> 00:33:50,805
Last night Iljimae got almost caught

410
00:33:50,805 --> 00:33:52,052
For real?

411
00:33:52,052 --> 00:33:54,957
Yeah, I heard from Jong Guk who is working at Lord Mun Chang's house.

412
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:58,878
His master was so worried about Iljimae

413
00:33:58,878 --> 00:34:01,947
that he bought the latest Western lock from the Chung empire.

414
00:34:01,947 --> 00:34:04,636
Iljimae took a long time to open it

415
00:34:04,636 --> 00:34:06,059
that's why he was almost caught

416
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:07,885
but during his escape

417
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:10,387
it was the servants who helped him, that's why they kept on bragging about it everywhere.

418
00:34:10,387 --> 00:34:12,483
It's all a lie 
 A lie!

419
00:34:13,907 --> 00:34:15,826
You punk, our Iljimae,

420
00:34:15,826 --> 00:34:18,990
there is no lock that can stop him, he can even fly in the sky

421
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,784
So whoever those guys are, they're liars!

422
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,354
So what, if they're liars?

423
00:34:25,384 --> 00:34:28,790
They're probably saying the truth

424
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:31,762
No matter how great this Iljimae is

425
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:34,616
he'll have a hard time dealing with a western lock

426
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:37,183
Beside that, how can a human fly?

427
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:41,037
Go.

428
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,935
If you're done eating, leave.

429
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:47,434
They say they saw him, why are you so angry at us?

430
00:34:47,434 --> 00:34:49,028
Eat eat

431
00:34:51,762 --> 00:34:53,624
This is so strange

432
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:56,484
What kind of thief would only steal the lock?

433
00:34:56,484 --> 00:34:58,199
For real? 
 You mean nothing else was stolen?

434
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:01,773
Yes! Only the lock was taken, and he didn't even try to open the door!

435
00:35:01,773 --> 00:35:04,488
Wow, there's always someone above a great man.

436
00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:07,175
But still! Even Iljimae couldn't unlock it!

437
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:23,200
Our faithful Dan, you've become so beautiful over a night it's hard to recognize you!

438
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,882
Did the moon bestow its power upon you?

439
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:29,433
Where have you been all night? And why are you only coming home now?

440
00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:32,992
I was lonely in this house without you two, so

441
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,329
I was gambling all night.

442
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:37,569
Your father wants to meet you in the iron house

443
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:38,892
he has something to say to you.

444
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,190
That house?

445
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:44,323
He said you would know where it is.

446
00:35:51,948 --> 00:35:53,806
Wasn't that Yong?

447
00:35:53,806 --> 00:35:56,487
Where is he running madly like this?

448
00:35:57,165 --> 00:35:58,841
Yong you punk!

449
00:35:58,841 --> 00:36:00,493
Leave him

450
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:47,801
You were looking for me?

451
00:36:50,056 --> 00:36:52,741
This house sure is huge

452
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:53,840
Who are you?

453
00:36:54,274 --> 00:36:56,413
You're the second young master here right?

454
00:36:57,852 --> 00:37:00,075
Since you're the son of Lord Byun,

455
00:37:00,075 --> 00:37:01,869
you must have a lot of money.

456
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:03,633
Didn't you hear me asking who you were?

457
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,748
I have something to tell you.

458
00:37:07,748 --> 00:37:10,483
About your background

459
00:37:10,483 --> 00:37:11,525
What?

460
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:15,300
Father

461
00:37:16,404 --> 00:37:18,791
It's been such a long time since we came here.

462
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:22,239
We practiced here picking out locks, for my exam.

463
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:31,537
Your father has something to say to you today.

464
00:37:32,677 --> 00:37:35,824
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

465
00:37:39,029 --> 00:37:40,037
Yong

466
00:37:40,037 --> 00:37:42,794
I could go and tell Lord Byun all about it.

467
00:37:47,051 --> 00:37:48,409
How dare you?

468
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,542
Wait a second..

469
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:54,111
So you didn't know about this either?

470
00:37:56,166 --> 00:38:00,240
That woman lied to her own son and sent you to Lord Byun!

471
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,830
Your mother was a heartless servant from the beginning.

472
00:38:06,195 --> 00:38:08,923
A man should have a skill.

473
00:38:08,923 --> 00:38:11,370
I guess you won't have a chance at the civil servant exam anymore.

474
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,576
You can't be in a gang for the rest of your life

475
00:38:15,576 --> 00:38:19,065
and it's not like I have something to pass to you.

476
00:38:20,886 --> 00:38:23,570
I'd really like it if you took over my lock shop.

477
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:26,298
Oh dad what's wrong?

478
00:38:26,298 --> 00:38:28,839
I'll take the exam 
 I will!

479
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,124
You know what will  happen if I go and tell Lord Byun?

480
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:34,302
You will have a hard time, of course,

481
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:36,725
but it will also be hard to keep your mother alive.

482
00:38:36,725 --> 00:38:38,076
I won't wait long

483
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:42,311
Bring the money to the inn before midnight tonight.

484
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:50,929
Come and lift this.

485
00:38:52,742 --> 00:38:55,413
Where did you get this from?

486
00:38:55,413 --> 00:38:56,999
Do you know what this is?

487
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,632
This is the latest Western lock

488
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:03,158
that even Iljimae couldn't unlock last night.

489
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:07,852
But Father, how did you ...?

490
00:39:07,852 --> 00:39:10,231
I borrowed it for a while.

491
00:39:12,174 --> 00:39:14,072
If you want to keep developing our lock shop

492
00:39:14,072 --> 00:39:16,916
we have to invent a lock that even Iljimae can't open

493
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:20,536
and that is why we have to know how to unlock this one.

494
00:39:20,536 --> 00:39:21,976
There's always someone better.

495
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:25,461
This is our fate

496
00:39:44,845 --> 00:39:46,658
How did you do that?

497
00:39:50,814 --> 00:39:53,663
This was my secret weapon when I was young

498
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:56,293
Now it's yours.

499
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:57,514
Your secret weapon?

500
00:39:59,185 --> 00:40:00,323
What is this?

501
00:40:00,323 --> 00:40:02,035
It's my invention.

502
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:04,010
It's called the all powerful lock.

503
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,870
With this, there is no lock in this world that can't be unlocked.

504
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,900
You know why?

505
00:40:08,624 --> 00:40:10,173
Because it's me, Swe Dol.

506
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:12,331
It doesn't matter, if it's some Western lock,

507
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:14,929
or some lock at the palace, it opens everything.

508
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:18,065
It just looks like a pair of normal picks to me.

509
00:40:18,065 --> 00:40:19,301
Look here

510
00:40:19,975 --> 00:40:22,922
It's not because it's some Western lock that it's special or anything.

511
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:24,194
But it's different from ours

512
00:40:24,194 --> 00:40:25,441
because of this.

513
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:28,673
The characteristic of this lock is that it has many different holes.

514
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:31,874
So it means that Western things are useless and faulty.

515
00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:37,038
First, use the first pick to push down one lock and make a way inside

516
00:40:37,038 --> 00:40:40,727
and with the second pick, go into that way

517
00:40:40,727 --> 00:40:43,716
and turn away the hole at the very back.

518
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:48,530
It's a piece of cake.

519
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,383
Really? Piece of cake? Ok you give it a try then.

520
00:40:55,223 --> 00:40:56,946
Lock it.

521
00:40:56,946 --> 00:40:58,523
What? Why?

522
00:40:59,316 --> 00:41:00,908
Whatever you learn

523
00:41:00,908 --> 00:41:04,268
you will learn it faster if you're in an urgent situation.

524
00:41:04,268 --> 00:41:05,359
Lock it

525
00:41:06,826 --> 00:41:07,831
ok

526
00:41:17,669 --> 00:41:18,997
Now unlock it

527
00:41:19,617 --> 00:41:21,452
I can get out only if you unlock it.

528
00:41:21,452 --> 00:41:22,829
If you can't

529
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:25,043
I will die here, out of breath.

530
00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:27,211
Alright.

531
00:41:34,146 --> 00:41:36,325
What? It's not working?

532
00:41:36,325 --> 00:41:37,730
You said it was easy.

533
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,889
The two picks have to work fast and in sync.

534
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:42,574
Do you think that is so easy?

535
00:41:42,574 --> 00:41:44,404
That's a special skill.

536
00:41:45,187 --> 00:41:46,454
Come on, unlock it.

537
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:49,475
I will be lying here

538
00:41:50,065 --> 00:41:52,132
sleeping for a while.

539
00:42:11,244 --> 00:42:12,443
Ja Dol.

540
00:42:12,443 --> 00:42:13,713
Whose

541
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:16,158
son am I?

542
00:42:17,705 --> 00:42:19,079
What are you saying?

543
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,256
I'm asking you, whose son am I?

544
00:42:22,052 --> 00:42:23,094
Well...

545
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:25,533
Am I ...

546
00:42:26,615 --> 00:42:28,794
not Lord Byun's own son?

547
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,935
What have you heard?

548
00:42:33,935 --> 00:42:35,485
I know everything now

549
00:42:36,385 --> 00:42:37,962
Don't think of hiding anything.

550
00:42:46,026 --> 00:42:46,928
Then

551
00:42:48,956 --> 00:42:50,398
who is my father?

552
00:42:54,954 --> 00:42:56,616
You're not done yet?

553
00:42:58,261 --> 00:42:59,759
I'm...

554
00:43:00,313 --> 00:43:02,171
suffocating.

555
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:05,017
Yong.

556
00:43:05,017 --> 00:43:06,998
It's so dark here

557
00:43:08,187 --> 00:43:11,235
It's like a coffin

558
00:43:11,235 --> 00:43:14,399
Aren't you done yet? 
 Just a bit more Dad

559
00:43:14,399 --> 00:43:16,142
I will get you out of there soon.

560
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:18,769
Who is...

561
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:20,499
my father? 
 I'm asking you.

562
00:43:22,711 --> 00:43:23,864
Is it

563
00:43:24,846 --> 00:43:26,073
my father here?

564
00:43:28,871 --> 00:43:29,711
Yes

565
00:43:31,095 --> 00:43:32,777
we wanted you to have a good life.

566
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,407
We didn't want to raise you as a thief's son

567
00:43:37,168 --> 00:43:39,390
so we lied.

568
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,793
How ..

569
00:43:42,151 --> 00:43:44,116
how could you do this?

570
00:43:44,116 --> 00:43:46,707
If we hadn't lied to Lord Byun back then,

571
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,602
if we hadn't sent you away

572
00:43:48,602 --> 00:43:51,715
you and your father would've been dead.

573
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:52,559
How

574
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,022
how could you not

575
00:43:57,573 --> 00:43:58,944
even say a word to me?

576
00:44:00,454 --> 00:44:01,559
You two...

577
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:04,281
are really scary

578
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:08,134
I...

579
00:44:09,033 --> 00:44:11,190
do you know how I have lived in that house?

580
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,180
Then

581
00:44:14,436 --> 00:44:15,889
can  you come back?

582
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,673
Can you do that?

583
00:44:18,673 --> 00:44:20,469
Why would I? 
  Why would I??

584
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:23,858
After all this

585
00:44:25,814 --> 00:44:27,921
after all this you're asking me to live with you again?

586
00:44:29,853 --> 00:44:31,708
when i was begging you, 
 you ignored me!

587
00:44:34,048 --> 00:44:35,799
And now you're asking me to come back?

588
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:38,533
Why would I?

589
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:41,485
Why would I come back here?

590
00:44:45,402 --> 00:44:47,252
You're the ones who left me.

591
00:45:26,144 --> 00:45:27,183
Father

592
00:45:28,162 --> 00:45:29,406
Are you okay?

593
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,015
It's hot inside, right?

594
00:45:35,288 --> 00:45:36,521
Father!

595
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,296
Father

596
00:45:39,296 --> 00:45:41,181
Are you okay???

597
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:43,540
Father

598
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,037
Just a bit! Wait just a bit

599
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:51,841
Yeah...

600
00:45:52,581 --> 00:45:55,355
This is the only thing

601
00:45:55,355 --> 00:45:57,496
I can do for you.

602
00:46:04,466 --> 00:46:05,535
Ja Dol!

603
00:46:07,296 --> 00:46:09,299
What brought you here?

604
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,326
Did you come because you missed your mom?

605
00:46:13,616 --> 00:46:16,229
Have you heard the news?

606
00:46:16,229 --> 00:46:18,575
It's Mak Se who told you, right?

607
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,814
Ah that bastard, he's such a tattle-tale.

608
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:24,615
Ja Dol.

609
00:46:34,972 --> 00:46:36,325
What happened?

610
00:46:38,658 --> 00:46:40,147
What happened?

611
00:46:40,147 --> 00:46:42,289
He knows everything

612
00:46:43,796 --> 00:46:46,414
Cha-dol found out everything. 
 Find out?

613
00:46:47,418 --> 00:46:49,404
What did he find out?

614
00:46:49,404 --> 00:46:51,619
That he is not the real son of that family.

615
00:46:56,917 --> 00:47:00,488
Did you tell him he was the lord's son?

616
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:06,567
I told him that you were his real father

617
00:47:07,863 --> 00:47:09,869
That's what I told him.

618
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:14,446
What to do?

619
00:47:14,446 --> 00:47:17,117
Our poor Ja Dol.

620
00:47:25,954 --> 00:47:28,045
Don't cry

621
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,748
Don't cry, Dan.

622
00:47:31,488 --> 00:47:33,417
I'll go to Ja Dol.

623
00:47:34,231 --> 00:47:35,877
I'll talk to him.

624
00:47:36,508 --> 00:47:37,752
Don't cry.

625
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:48,520
I told you many times that the uncle of

626
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,385
Lord Jwasang was coming from Gyesung.

627
00:47:50,832 --> 00:47:52,591
And you kicked him out

628
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:53,995
because you gave all the rooms to the poor?

629
00:47:54,762 --> 00:47:59,043
My daughter. Do you know how ashamed and embarrassed I was?

630
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:00,785
I didn't kick him out.

631
00:48:00,785 --> 00:48:03,618
I told him I would give him another room

632
00:48:03,618 --> 00:48:05,620
but he's the one who left.

633
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:09,911
I told you to give him the special room!

634
00:48:09,911 --> 00:48:11,294
In that room

635
00:48:11,294 --> 00:48:13,074
there was someone sick already in there.

636
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:20,231
Then... you gave that big room to an old sick beggar?

637
00:48:23,607 --> 00:48:25,019
My daughter.

638
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:28,583
You bring these people with so many lices crawling around them

639
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:32,429
you feed all the beggars of the town

640
00:48:32,429 --> 00:48:33,942
Do you think I gave you that place

641
00:48:33,942 --> 00:48:37,127
so that you could make it a hide-out cave for the beggars and the poor?

642
00:48:38,755 --> 00:48:39,911
My daughter.

643
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,301
Are you the queen of beggars?

644
00:48:46,254 --> 00:48:47,855
I don't know anything anymore!

645
00:48:47,855 --> 00:48:51,508
If we have any losses, you take full responsibility!

646
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,497
And, go home early today.

647
00:48:54,497 --> 00:48:55,582
Because of that Iljimae brat

648
00:48:55,582 --> 00:48:58,098
the whole region is in an emergency situation.

649
00:48:58,098 --> 00:49:00,609
Don't think of hanging out late at night.
What?

650
00:49:02,274 --> 00:49:06,097
That little rat, we got him tight this time!

651
00:49:06,097 --> 00:49:07,944
What do you mean?

652
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:12,225
We have the whole assembly of guards in this region tonight.

653
00:49:12,225 --> 00:49:15,236
Here and there, it's a whole combined operation.

654
00:49:15,855 --> 00:49:19,251
Tonight, it will be the end for Iljimae.

655
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:21,261
That's what I'm saying.

656
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:24,610
And the thing you were talking about earlier,

657
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:26,317
let's talk about it after this is over.

658
00:49:26,317 --> 00:49:30,471
Until then, you get rid of all the beggars and all their lice! Understood?

659
00:49:30,471 --> 00:49:31,319
I'm going.

660
00:49:33,594 --> 00:49:34,946
I'm telling you, he's not here.

661
00:49:34,946 --> 00:49:39,513
Don't be like this. Please let me see him just once. I have something important to tell him.

662
00:49:39,513 --> 00:49:41,013
I'm telling you, he's not here.

663
00:49:41,013 --> 00:49:43,873
He's out to catch Iljimae. Iljimae.

664
00:49:45,407 --> 00:49:47,786
What? Iljimae? Where to?

665
00:49:48,795 --> 00:49:50,437
I can't tell you that.

666
00:49:50,437 --> 00:49:54,330
I really have to see him. So please tell me.

667
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:57,264
You're like a leech! Go away!

668
00:50:04,962 --> 00:50:06,193
Guard Song.

669
00:50:06,193 --> 00:50:07,798
Where did Guard Byun go for his stake out?

670
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:10,239
It's Lord Seo Young Soo's household.

671
00:50:43,717 --> 00:50:45,732
I have no choice in the matter.

672
00:50:45,732 --> 00:50:47,978
Please just hide out for a few days.

673
00:50:50,731 --> 00:50:52,527
I'm really sorry.

674
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,064
Are you sure?

675
00:50:59,064 --> 00:51:00,590
I am sure.

676
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,060
Iljimae, he's bound to show up here.

677
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,125
Iljimae?

678
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,643
Father! Father!

679
00:51:14,474 --> 00:51:17,800
Father! Please answer me!

680
00:51:33,072 --> 00:51:33,948
Father?

681
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,121
I should have stayed there.

682
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:48,252
Please be there, please.

683
00:51:48,252 --> 00:51:51,149
I hope he's still there.

684
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,904
Yong.

685
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,582
Yong.

686
00:53:28,195 --> 00:53:29,935
It's Lord Seo Young Soo's household.

687
00:54:04,561 --> 00:54:06,920
Is it for real? Was there a fire?

688
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,560
Yes, everyone's there.

689
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,560
How did this happen?

690
00:54:45,396 --> 00:54:46,959
Miss!

691
00:54:46,959 --> 00:54:48,320
Miss!

692
00:54:50,612 --> 00:54:51,903
Miss!

693
00:54:54,307 --> 00:54:55,201
Miss!

694
00:54:56,182 --> 00:54:59,121
Miss! Miss!

695
00:54:59,121 --> 00:55:00,661
Miss!

696
00:55:00,661 --> 00:55:02,551
Miss!

697
00:55:06,533 --> 00:55:08,108
What are you doing here?

698
00:55:08,108 --> 00:55:11,007
There's a fire outside! It's a mess! Come out!

699
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:12,594
Don't worry. Leave.

700
00:55:14,608 --> 00:55:17,617
Just get out! 
 I told you to leave me.

701
00:55:17,617 --> 00:55:19,560
I'm not taking one step away from here.

702
00:55:20,165 --> 00:55:23,746
But why? Do you want to die here?

703
00:55:23,746 --> 00:55:26,064
Why are you doing this?

704
00:55:26,787 --> 00:55:28,842
I'm waiting for someone.

705
00:55:30,014 --> 00:55:31,939
Just come out.

706
00:55:31,939 --> 00:55:34,765
You're going to die!

707
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,111
Heung Kyun.

708
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:41,351
Ahjussi.

709
00:55:43,846 --> 00:55:44,885
Hi.

710
00:55:44,885 --> 00:55:46,839
I'm out to buy some stuff.

711
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:48,509
I have to get back to the palace soon.

712
00:55:48,509 --> 00:55:51,160
Here, read this for me.

713
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,322
What does it say?

714
00:55:54,712 --> 00:55:59,131
Seo Young Soo.

715
00:55:59,131 --> 00:56:01,687
Thanks, bye.

716
00:56:01,687 --> 00:56:04,364
Wait...

717
00:56:18,523 --> 00:56:21,223
Let's talk inside.

718
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:42,656
He went in.

719
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,330
Really?

720
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:57,680
There's something suspicious about the crown prince's illness.

721
00:56:59,243 --> 00:57:00,705
It must be...

722
00:57:00,705 --> 00:57:03,044
You don't say...

723
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:05,027
He killed his own brother.

724
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:08,024
He can kill his son...

725
00:57:10,275 --> 00:57:12,003
Let's go to Chung.

726
00:57:12,003 --> 00:57:15,147
We must reveal the truth.

727
00:57:15,147 --> 00:57:16,646
What are you saying?

728
00:57:16,646 --> 00:57:20,363
His Majesty has said he wouldn't make an issue of it further.

729
00:57:20,363 --> 00:57:23,219
Will you make a mountain out of a molehill?

730
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:25,022
He's a frightening man.

731
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:27,904
He won't let us live.

732
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:29,362
But...

733
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,146
He not only killed his own brother, but Sim Gi Won,

734
00:57:31,146 --> 00:57:34,763
Kwon Du Hyung and Kim Ik Hee, whom he made a blood pact with.

735
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:40,021
There are only the two of us left.

736
00:57:40,021 --> 00:57:41,321
But...

737
00:57:43,396 --> 00:57:45,765
But... I want to trust His Majesty.

738
00:58:57,615 --> 00:59:00,794
You rat... I got you now.

739
00:59:01,817 --> 00:59:03,055
Arrest him.

740
00:59:06,295 --> 00:59:07,537
Kill him!

741
00:59:33,465 --> 00:59:36,779
Can't catch me?

742
00:59:36,779 --> 00:59:38,167
Come and get me.

743
00:59:38,634 --> 00:59:40,990
You're dead when I catch you.

744
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,193
You'll never catch me, you dunce.

745
00:59:48,171 --> 00:59:50,621
I should let my baby catch me...

746
00:59:50,621 --> 00:59:51,986
At least he can get a promotion out of this.

747
00:59:51,986 --> 00:59:53,502
And he'll be acknowledged for his work.

748
01:00:13,212 --> 01:00:14,357
Surprise.

749
01:00:15,581 --> 01:00:17,155
I'm Iljimae.

750
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,520
Iljimae.

751
01:00:23,263 --> 01:00:24,441
What's going on?

752
01:00:26,576 --> 01:00:27,945
I can't do it today.

753
01:00:56,469 --> 01:00:58,358
Why did you say you were Iljimae?

754
01:01:03,363 --> 01:01:04,908
You can become a chief now

755
01:01:04,908 --> 01:01:07,342
since you caught Iljimae, right?

756
01:01:07,342 --> 01:01:08,885
Just like that jerk...

757
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,575
You did it for me?

758
01:01:14,298 --> 01:01:15,911
It's okay.

759
01:01:15,911 --> 01:01:19,765
I only stole some ink stones and stuff.

760
01:01:19,765 --> 01:01:22,995
And I broke some things.

761
01:01:22,995 --> 01:01:24,631
It can't be a serious crime.

762
01:01:24,631 --> 01:01:28,472
And I'm used to flogging.

763
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,866
So don't worry about me.

764
01:01:38,393 --> 01:01:40,380
You heard everything

765
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:43,085
from your mother?

766
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:48,361
I'm really sorry...

767
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:51,861
this fool had to be your father.

768
01:01:51,861 --> 01:01:53,120
You should've

769
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:56,167
abandoned me as Mother did.

770
01:01:57,752 --> 01:02:00,063
Why were you so good to me?

771
01:02:03,001 --> 01:02:04,383
That's why now...

772
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:07,565
I hate and

773
01:02:09,302 --> 01:02:10,963
resent you more.

774
01:02:13,234 --> 01:02:14,567
I...

775
01:02:15,286 --> 01:02:17,496
It's because I'm such a fool.

776
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:22,867
I...

777
01:02:25,372 --> 01:02:28,094
I'm sorry...

778
01:02:29,851 --> 01:02:31,998
I'm sorry, Ja Dol.

779
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,266
Ja Dol.

780
01:02:35,912 --> 01:02:39,812
Ja Dol! Ja Dol... 
 My poor Ja Dol...

781
01:03:00,808 --> 01:03:02,257
Take him out.

782
01:03:02,257 --> 01:03:03,202
Take him away.
Yes

783
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,405
Are you all right?

784
01:03:16,528 --> 01:03:18,467
The Royal Guard

785
01:03:18,467 --> 01:03:21,039
lay in ambush all over town to catch you...

786
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,341
Don't do such a dangerous thing again.

787
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,575
If the fire had spread...

788
01:03:25,575 --> 01:03:29,223
You saw. 
 Don't ever do it again.

789
01:03:38,124 --> 01:03:40,162
I was about to go see you now.

790
01:03:40,162 --> 01:03:41,689
You're right on time.

791
01:03:43,977 --> 01:03:45,725
Beat it.

792
01:03:45,725 --> 01:03:48,049
And don't show yourself to me again.

793
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:53,089
If I ever see you again,

794
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:56,673
I'll kill you.

795
01:03:57,354 --> 01:03:59,350
Of course.

796
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:02,531
I just needed some money.

797
01:04:02,531 --> 01:04:05,580
I'll never come around Hanyang again,

798
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,636
so don't worry.

799
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,926
Young Master.

800
01:04:23,769 --> 01:04:26,350
What did you hear in that room?

801
01:04:32,323 --> 01:04:34,317
I was sleeping...

802
01:04:35,178 --> 01:04:37,490
There was no one in the room.

803
01:04:39,421 --> 01:04:42,084
I didn't hear anything...

804
01:04:42,084 --> 01:04:44,289
Why are you doing this to me?

805
01:04:57,743 --> 01:05:00,122
At his age, with his looks and height...

806
01:05:00,122 --> 01:05:03,222
He dared try to copy Iljimae...

807
01:05:03,222 --> 01:05:04,774
Maybe I can pull it off.

808
01:05:05,571 --> 01:05:10,187
I don't think he heard anything.

809
01:05:10,187 --> 01:05:13,003
He might have heard everything but is feigning ignorance.

810
01:05:14,915 --> 01:05:17,582
It's something no one else must hear.

811
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:23,461
I doubt it.

812
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,485
I don't care whether he heard it or not.

813
01:05:27,321 --> 01:05:30,054
He doesn't want to leave any loose ends.

814
01:05:32,451 --> 01:05:34,049
Take care of it.

815
01:05:36,249 --> 01:05:38,972
Your Highness.

816
01:05:38,972 --> 01:05:40,301
Your Highness.

817
01:05:42,511 --> 01:05:44,747
Summon the royal physician now!

818
01:05:44,747 --> 01:05:46,444
Yes, Your Majesty.

819
01:05:56,476 --> 01:05:58,582
Why are you doing this?

820
01:05:58,582 --> 01:06:01,225
I didn't hear anything.

821
01:06:21,919 --> 01:06:24,414
Is he still out drinking?

822
01:06:47,455 --> 01:07:06,665


823
01:07:06,665 --> 01:07:08,875
