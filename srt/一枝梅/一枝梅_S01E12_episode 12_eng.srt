1
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:36,390
I hear you stole the golden toad in disguise this time?

2
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,199
Are you hurt?

3
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:44,283
How many guards are there?

4
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:49,870
The man who killed you, I will bring him here and make him kneel before you.

5
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:54,428
Even the vase!

6
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:54,907
The vase?

7
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,346
Allow the low class people to improve their social status?

8
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:01,442
Then why do people say you fly around?

9
00:01:38,523 --> 00:01:39,142
It's hard, isn't it?

10
00:01:40,873 --> 00:01:42,257
I know.

11
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,632
I know how hard you live.

12
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,340
Stop putting water.

13
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,741
Our tavern lives on quality alone.

14
00:01:58,096 --> 00:01:59,798
Who says we put water in it?

15
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:03,804
You think we're nothing!

16
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:05,681
You still use your sword on innocent people?

17
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:08,281
What sword?

18
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,103
We haven't used our sword in a while.

19
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:14,627
You know how we try to live by the law these days.

20
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:20,599
Our Castor Oil gang got rid of our opposing gang.

21
00:02:29,342 --> 00:02:30,153
Are you awake?

22
00:02:35,248 --> 00:02:36,100
Drink this.

23
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:38,459
You have to drink it while it's still warm.

24
00:02:38,787 --> 00:02:40,368
They say this is the best medicine when you've lost a lot of blood.

25
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,026
What is this? Why is it so red?

26
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:43,636
It's cow blood.

27
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:45,251
Cow blood?

28
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,393
You're a man! Don't be so squirmy.

29
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:50,620
Drink it away!

30
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,521
Get it out of my sight.

31
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:53,760
You hear weird stuff.

32
00:02:54,047 --> 00:02:54,806
I'm not drinking it.

33
00:02:54,806 --> 00:02:55,602
Hey!

34
00:02:55,798 --> 00:02:58,330
I had to run to Lord Kongpan's household in the north village to get this!

35
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:00,605
Kongpan?

36
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:01,486
Yes.

37
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:06,038
I heard he was going abroad and they were killing a cow, so I went there early in the morning to get it.

38
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:06,914
Drink it.

39
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:20,615
Why is going abroad?

40
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:22,295
How would I know that?

41
00:03:22,647 --> 00:03:23,743
Drink it now!

42
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:25,519
I'm not drinking it!

43
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,728
Oh, Lord Kongpan?

44
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,896
A few days ago, at the beach of Jin sea,

45
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:35,371
they had some kind of foreign ship.

46
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:39,840
I guess they are worried up there it might be a spy ship.

47
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:44,163
I hear that Lord Kongpan himself will go abroad to figure it out.

48
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:47,277
How long do you think it will take?

49
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:48,851
I don't know!

50
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:50,990
It could be months.

51
00:03:51,758 --> 00:03:54,322
If it's complicated, he could stay until next year.

52
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:57,273
I went there yesterday, and they were packing up, big time.

53
00:03:57,852 --> 00:03:59,758
So he's leaving tomorrow?

54
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:00,272
Yeah.

55
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:02,306
I hear he is.

56
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,074
But why?

57
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:06,765
Nothing.

58
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:12,224
You stupid fools!

59
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:15,978
You could not catch one single lowlife thief and you embarrass me like this?

60
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:19,442
If you don't catch this guy, I will tear apart your uniforms

61
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:21,372
and I'm giving up my uniform too, so you remember that!

62
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:33,147
Look at you!

63
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:35,863
You don't believe me?

64
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:38,388
All right, let's see.

65
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:43,279
Do you want me to take off my clothes? Are you going to believe me then?

66
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,654
Please sir, don't. Calm down.

67
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:57,704
You fools.

68
00:04:57,704 --> 00:05:01,811
Do you know how many noblemen's houses were robbed? Do you know how much damage there was?

69
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,493
Just because of one man?

70
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:06,290
Do you even know everyone in the royal court is worried?

71
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:12,198
Go and catch that black rat right now!

72
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,536
Look at you! How dare you stare at me! I'm going to gouge out your eyes!

73
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:24,444
Go! Leave!

74
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:26,231
You bloody fools!

75
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:28,104
Hey, Kang Dosa.

76
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:28,622
Yes sir.

77
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:30,833
You go and bring me Guard Byun

78
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:43,412
Did you find out?

79
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:43,978
Yes.

80
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:44,945
It was quite calm.

81
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:47,344
Why? Did Iljimae rob someone else's house again?

82
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:50,017
No.

83
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:52,399
Go and do your work.

84
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,283
Yes.

85
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:57,700
Brother.

86
00:05:57,946 --> 00:06:02,193
The lord said that you have the list of the guards at each nobleman's house. He wants it.

87
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,249
What about your arm?

88
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:05,385
He wants it now.

89
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:08,092
Give it to me now.

90
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:19,549
Why is this here?

91
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:22,724
What's the matter?

92
00:06:23,994 --> 00:06:24,699
Nothing.

93
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:28,948
I always put this below, but it was on top of the others, somehow.

94
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:33,652
Which one?

95
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:36,324
It's the Cheon-woo club.

96
00:06:37,268 --> 00:06:38,682
It's the list of the members from father's club.

97
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:41,737
Here it is.

98
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,528
The thief...

99
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:54,867
Did you ever bring him here?

100
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:55,775
What?

101
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,206
The thing is...

102
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:02,457
What are you saying?

103
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:07,032
The books on the bookshelf, the brushes in this room.

104
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:10,206
Have they ever been removed or changed places?

105
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:13,162
You would never make such a mistake, would you?

106
00:07:14,832 --> 00:07:15,616
What?

107
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:16,895
That list.

108
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:18,373
Give it to me.

109
00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:21,069
Now!

110
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:04,750
Did you bring it?

111
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:05,871
Leave it there.

112
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,358
What is the Cheon-woo club?

113
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,287
The Cheon-woo club?

114
00:08:13,404 --> 00:08:14,185
Why do you want to know?

115
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:15,849
There's just something I need to know.

116
00:08:20,758 --> 00:08:23,616
It's a social gathering of people against any war.

117
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:26,938
Well now, even if they are not notorious noblemen against the war,

118
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:29,275
anyone who has enough authority can join.

119
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:30,039
But why?

120
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,546
The thief, he robbed from all the members of the Cheon-woo club.

121
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:41,241
Tonight, you pair up and will stake out at the houses of all the Cheon-woo club members.

122
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:44,938
Bang Dosa and Guard Park, you will be at Lord Kim Yoo.

123
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:45,644
Yes sir!

124
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:48,888
Kang Dosa and Guard Kim, you will be at Lord Hong's household.

125
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:49,717
Yes sir.

126
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:51,091
Choi Dosa and Guard Heo.

127
00:08:51,806 --> 00:08:53,318
You will be at Lord Lee Keum Boo.

128
00:08:53,652 --> 00:08:54,114
Yes sir.

129
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:55,703
Byun Dosa and Guard Song.

130
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:57,630
You will be at Lord Lee Shi Baek's house.

131
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:58,621
Yes sir.

132
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:13,973
It could be months.

133
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:17,254
If it gets complicated, they could stay until next year.

134
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,174
Damn the Cheon-woo club.

135
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:46,312
Am I right or what?

136
00:09:47,183 --> 00:09:47,866
Yes sir.

137
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:51,727
Who is it?

138
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:58,074
Hey, you're here!

139
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,061
I called her here.

140
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:01,355
But sir!

141
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:06,737
You sweet precious thing!

142
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:10,610
Hey.

143
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:13,985
You stay here and watch out if anyone's coming.

144
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:16,727
Let's go.

145
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,770
I spotted

146
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:20,812
somewhere really nice.

147
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:50,763
Well well

148
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:54,402
Just wait! Wait!

149
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:55,772
What? What? What?

150
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:56,439
I need to go to the bathroom.

151
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,359
I'll be quick!

152
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,275
No, I can't wait!

153
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,275
Geez!

154
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:03,389
I'm at an important moment right now!

155
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,536
Just wait a little.

156
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,895
All right, hurry up then.

157
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:10,799
Hye ran.

158
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:13,317
You come back as soon as possible, all right?

159
00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:31,246
Oh geez.

160
00:11:31,246 --> 00:11:34,766
Okay, so I spoil her and tell her she's pretty and she thinks she can mess with me?

161
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:36,134
Come out!

162
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:37,747
Aren't you going to show yourself?

163
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:39,342
I'm going to kill you!

164
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:43,421
What is this?

165
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:47,772
Who is it?

166
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:11,645
Please! Don't kill me!

167
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:12,665
Don't kill me!

168
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:34,519
Over there.

169
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:37,122
He went there!

170
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:44,680
You don't say a word, understood?

171
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:48,686
So embarrassing!

172
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:52,982
Well, well, I guess he knows how to be embarrassed.

173
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:11,645
That jerk!

174
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:12,478
Hey!

175
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:14,690
Spread out!

176
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:23,407
He's hurt his leg. He can't be too far.

177
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,036
Search all the surroundings!

178
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,878
Yes sir!

179
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:54,208
Ma'am, are you all right?

180
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:55,742
Shall we stop for a while?

181
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:13,492
Stop!

182
00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:19,053
Open it!

183
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:21,840
What are you doing?

184
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,478
Where is he?

185
00:15:28,517 --> 00:15:29,054
Move away!

186
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:31,744
Push it over!

187
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:35,651
What is this?

188
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:38,168
This is the airway from the ice storage.

189
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:39,215
You...

190
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,850
The ice storage is over there.

191
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:42,975
Let's go!

192
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:33,140
Open this door!

193
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:38,592
Come on come on!

194
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:52,190
Throw it up here!

195
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:55,561
Come up!

196
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:57,604
Let's go!

197
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,270
Yes sir.

198
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:03,173
Come on quick! Move!

199
00:17:03,173 --> 00:17:03,866
Yes sir, we're coming.

200
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:13,835
It's here!

201
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:14,902
Good!

202
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:21,474
You dog!

203
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:50,508
What took you so long?

204
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:09,481
He came.

205
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:14,245
He's alive.

206
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:15,560
You still don't see it, do you?

207
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,303
He approached you with a specific purpose!

208
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:19,903
He made his appearance at one of the members' house!

209
00:18:20,644 --> 00:18:21,789
Well...

210
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:24,416
it could  have been just a coincidence.

211
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,457
Just a coincidence?

212
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,771
All right.

213
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:29,589
I will catch him.

214
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:32,077
And I will show it to you directly.

215
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,919
He has no fever.

216
00:18:53,493 --> 00:18:54,458
Are you sick?

217
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:59,457
How come a strong young man like you gets sick like that?

218
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:01,286
Don't go out too much!

219
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:02,414
Father.

220
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:04,914
Please let me rest.

221
00:19:04,914 --> 00:19:06,291
Sure sure.

222
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:13,441
But what kind of guards go around each house and make all the young men undress?

223
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:15,749
Weird...

224
00:19:16,976 --> 00:19:17,794
The guards?

225
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:18,907
Yes yes.

226
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,433
I do wonder what it's about.

227
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:24,036
Hey by the way, brother Gun, he has some good body!

228
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:26,975
Get some rest.

229
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:42,690
You pathetic thing!

230
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,884
I told you to stay put!

231
00:20:45,042 --> 00:20:45,810
Why don't you listen to me?

232
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:03,362
I told you to stop!

233
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:11,825
Go and find anyone with a sword wound on their leg!

234
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:16,855
Look at you, pathetic lot.

235
00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:20,055
Fight with weapons in the middle of the market.

236
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,397
He will also have a wound at the waist.

237
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,108
You bloody fool!

238
00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:29,843
You have no father or mother?

239
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,782
I dare you to hit me again!

240
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:34,379
I'm going to kill you!

241
00:21:35,288 --> 00:21:35,691
Kill me!

242
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:43,812
Kill me! Kill me if you can!

243
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:44,761
Take off your shirt.

244
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:06,852
Yong!

245
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:11,402
Hey buddy!

246
00:22:14,356 --> 00:22:14,823
What is this?

247
00:22:15,936 --> 00:22:16,518
Are you hurt?

248
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:23,936
The thing is...

249
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,659
It's those guys! They did this to me!

250
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,057
How dare you!

251
00:22:31,468 --> 00:22:31,888
Let's go.

252
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,105
We have to see that wound.

253
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,701
But he's one of the suspects.

254
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:36,927
What?

255
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:39,434
This guy is one of my guys.

256
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:41,500
Let's go.

257
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,850
What are we going to do?

258
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:50,152
It hurts so much!

259
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:59,068
I caught that Iljimae and  had him all chained up above the well.

260
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:01,326
But that guard Byun made a stupid mistake!

261
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:06,639
Hey, Miss!

262
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:09,184
Are you going somewhere?

263
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:13,218
Oh, this?

264
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,682
That gang was making a mess, so I took care of it.

265
00:23:17,682 --> 00:23:20,361
It's just a scratch.

266
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:22,364
Miss!

267
00:23:25,107 --> 00:23:26,554
Yong, let's go.

268
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:28,915
I'm going to feed you some meat, so that you can recover.

269
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:30,573
Meat?

270
00:23:31,195 --> 00:23:33,012
I love meat!

271
00:23:33,515 --> 00:23:37,691
That Iljimae, he must have been scared by me.

272
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,271
You haven't changed at all.

273
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:52,769
I heard that my son was disrespectful towards your daughter the other day.

274
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,759
I should have come to you sooner with my apologies.

275
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,449
Not at all.

276
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:03,539
A butterfly wouldn't just pass by a flower, would it?

277
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:11,206
Here...

278
00:24:13,441 --> 00:24:15,141
What is this?

279
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:18,158
It's just a small present.

280
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:24,832
You have been such a strong link between our country and Chung. We owe our peace to you.

281
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:33,016
How about our crown prince? Is he well?

282
00:24:33,363 --> 00:24:37,434
The emperor has many compliments to say about the crown prince.

283
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:41,847
But...

284
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:48,780
is your king still unwilling to pay his respects towards his due Emperor?

285
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:52,530
Or does he have some personal feelings against us?

286
00:24:53,552 --> 00:24:55,132
Personal feelings?

287
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:01,749
I was just wondering if he thinks the incident on the year of Byungja was my fault.

288
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:04,285
Not at all.

289
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:06,578
Nonsense.

290
00:25:07,682 --> 00:25:09,484
Well, good then.

291
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:12,699
Well, I'm happy then.

292
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:20,581
The other day, that proud Lord Kim Ik Hee came by, and today, you.

293
00:25:21,194 --> 00:25:21,741
What?

294
00:25:22,456 --> 00:25:25,553
Kim Ik Hee?

295
00:25:28,134 --> 00:25:31,159
He was just asking if we had news from Chung.

296
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:17,619
Who?

297
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,569
Who got rid of all the horse poop for me?

298
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:21,862
It can't be Dae Shik.

299
00:26:23,106 --> 00:26:23,793
It's me, Yong.

300
00:26:24,395 --> 00:26:25,362
How is it?

301
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:27,623
It's so clean and smooth, isn't it?

302
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,837
It's even shining!

303
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:53,709
What is your angle?

304
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,707
Teach me how to fight.

305
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,373
Well, I can fight with alcohol and win.

306
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,468
Fight?

307
00:27:01,397 --> 00:27:02,529
What is that?

308
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:04,748
Does it involve alcohol?

309
00:27:08,642 --> 00:27:09,171
Master!

310
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:19,752
Please teach me how to fight!

311
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,577
I really want to learn.

312
00:27:21,954 --> 00:27:22,682
Go away!

313
00:27:23,002 --> 00:27:23,685
Please!

314
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:33,801
What are you looking at like that?

315
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:35,522
What's out there?

316
00:27:35,984 --> 00:27:39,273
I think I may have eaten something wrong.

317
00:27:42,354 --> 00:27:42,932
You stupid girl.

318
00:27:42,932 --> 00:27:44,755
I told you to eat a little.

319
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:46,150
What are you, some kind of girl version of Dae Shik?

320
00:27:46,977 --> 00:27:51,702
It hurts here, and I feel full, although I haven't eaten.

321
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:53,474
What is wrong with me?

322
00:27:53,858 --> 00:27:55,021
Am I going to die?

323
00:27:55,203 --> 00:27:55,387
Huh?

324
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:57,111
Look at you!

325
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,696
Yes, it's a kind of illness too.

326
00:28:00,903 --> 00:28:01,949
You're in love.

327
00:28:04,353 --> 00:28:05,285
Are you seeing someone?

328
00:28:06,277 --> 00:28:08,503
No...

329
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:11,423
Dating?

330
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:16,734
Oh my, she really is!

331
00:28:19,135 --> 00:28:19,691
Please! Just once!

332
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:23,539
No way...

333
00:28:45,664 --> 00:28:46,576
Kang Dosa.

334
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,198
What is he doing like that? It's been a few days already.

335
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:55,730
He nearly caught Iljimae twice already, but he escaped right under his nose.

336
00:28:55,996 --> 00:28:58,012
I guess he's mad at himself.

337
00:28:58,561 --> 00:28:59,849
He's so stubborn.

338
00:29:02,646 --> 00:29:03,821
Guard Byun.

339
00:29:04,294 --> 00:29:05,130
Come here.

340
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:39,063
He says he has a message from the office.

341
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:45,904
Please teach me.

342
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:50,618
Go and tell them I received the message.

343
00:29:55,364 --> 00:29:57,230
It won't matter to him even if you stay like that forever.

344
00:29:58,583 --> 00:29:59,183
Leave.

345
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:06,166
I hear Kim Ik Hee went to see Jung Myung Shin.

346
00:30:06,812 --> 00:30:09,001
I need to meet with the king in secret.

347
00:30:29,023 --> 00:30:29,844
Where are you going?

348
00:30:30,097 --> 00:30:31,013
Geez, you scared me!

349
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,122
What are you doing there?

350
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,830
You held on for quite some time this time.

351
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:38,153
You have the wandering bug again?

352
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:39,812
Where are you going this time?

353
00:30:41,113 --> 00:30:42,365
I'm going to paradise.

354
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,942
Yeah, right, paradise.

355
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,574
Why again?

356
00:30:48,211 --> 00:30:50,997
Do you have something troubling you?

357
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:54,843
I need to stay hidden for a while.

358
00:31:13,802 --> 00:31:15,584
There's a man I need to lay my hands on.

359
00:31:21,324 --> 00:31:22,342
Where are you going?

360
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:23,501
Move.

361
00:31:23,703 --> 00:31:24,542
Take me with you.

362
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,564
I'm leaving because I don't want to see you. Why would I take you with me?

363
00:31:27,894 --> 00:31:28,997
Then you're not leaving.

364
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,853
There's no way you're leaving!

365
00:31:32,952 --> 00:31:34,671
Why do you want to catch him so badly?

366
00:31:35,069 --> 00:31:39,008
it's the only way for me to live as a decent human being.

367
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,673
It's the fastest way for me to be on top.

368
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:45,629
Move.

369
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:47,764
You can't leave!

370
00:31:51,774 --> 00:31:52,323
You can't leave.

371
00:31:52,323 --> 00:31:53,245
No!

372
00:31:58,492 --> 00:31:59,172
You can't leave.

373
00:31:59,348 --> 00:32:00,416
Take me with you!

374
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:15,747
Take me with you!

375
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:16,483
Please!

376
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:19,317
Take me with you.

377
00:32:20,326 --> 00:32:21,522
Why do you want to learn how to fight?

378
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,535
I have something to finish.

379
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:34,937
And I can't die before I finish it.

380
00:32:52,663 --> 00:32:53,316
Here!

381
00:32:55,596 --> 00:32:57,339
I bought this with the money you gave me.

382
00:32:57,825 --> 00:32:58,383
Money?

383
00:32:58,697 --> 00:32:59,749
Your money.

384
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,443
Do you want this good looking fellow to tie it up for you?

385
00:33:07,508 --> 00:33:08,238
All right, let's make you all pretty.

386
00:33:11,552 --> 00:33:13,284
How is your father?

387
00:33:13,674 --> 00:33:14,870
He's much better now.

388
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:17,447
Done!

389
00:33:20,997 --> 00:33:22,697
Little Yang Soon is so pretty!

390
00:33:23,949 --> 00:33:26,872
Even if you don't get to see me, you can't have eyes for other men, all right?

391
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,400
Where are you going?

392
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:32,942
I'm going to build a strong body to get married to Yang Soon.

393
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:35,096
It's all about the strength with men!

394
00:33:35,611 --> 00:33:36,433
But...

395
00:33:36,726 --> 00:33:37,857
where are you going for that?

396
00:33:38,464 --> 00:33:39,239
Somewhere.

397
00:33:39,626 --> 00:33:42,070
You listen to your parents, all right?

398
00:33:42,617 --> 00:33:43,540
I'm leaving.

399
00:33:44,395 --> 00:33:45,529
Come back soon.

400
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:49,148
I'm not going to have eyes for other men, I'll wait for you like a lady.

401
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:51,529
All right!

402
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:59,442
My ribbon!

403
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:03,135
What, my competition was that little girl?

404
00:34:18,604 --> 00:34:19,284
Father.

405
00:34:21,742 --> 00:34:22,912
I won't be able to come for a while.

406
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,739
I will come back, a strong man like you.

407
00:35:28,832 --> 00:35:30,746
So this was your home.

408
00:35:42,694 --> 00:35:43,323
Read this.

409
00:35:45,738 --> 00:35:48,066
He wants to study hard for the civil examination. So he went into the mountains.

410
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:50,193
Where?

411
00:35:51,012 --> 00:35:53,813
I heard there's somewhere Kong He knew well.

412
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:59,018
There's nothing else special for me?

413
00:35:59,694 --> 00:36:00,351
Dan...

414
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,781
Ajumma, he told you not to worry.

415
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:09,829
If he's going to study, why bring the cauldron and the bucket?

416
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:13,812
You didn't treat him well, but still, you're the only one he thinks about.

417
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,650
Well, I'm a little sad.

418
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:20,693
I'm going to go.

419
00:36:20,908 --> 00:36:21,320
Sure.

420
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:35,274
Oh my.

421
00:36:35,274 --> 00:36:37,465
I'm so careless, I dropped my bag.

422
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:39,600
Go and fetch it.

423
00:36:40,136 --> 00:36:40,828
What?

424
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:51,067
It's freezing!

425
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,937
What is this? My clothes!

426
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,868
What's so heavy?

427
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:14,271
You be careful with that! It's a blanket made of cotton.

428
00:37:14,728 --> 00:37:16,535
It gets really cold at night.

429
00:37:55,157 --> 00:37:55,935
Ajussi.

430
00:37:56,489 --> 00:37:57,738
We already passed by here.

431
00:37:58,118 --> 00:37:59,354
Who asked you to follow me?

432
00:37:59,354 --> 00:38:00,443
Leave!

433
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:07,981
I'm going straight ahead!

434
00:38:11,308 --> 00:38:12,485
I'm coming with you!

435
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:40,409
What a green mountain!

436
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,869
Get the clothes dry!

437
00:38:58,813 --> 00:39:01,107
You cheater, you liar!

438
00:39:05,654 --> 00:39:09,238
Kim Ik Hee asked news from Chung to Jung Myung Soo?

439
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:10,504
Yes, Your Majesty.

440
00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:16,419
He says he just asked if there was anything in Chung, that is all.

441
00:39:16,774 --> 00:39:17,622
What about Jung Myung Soo?

442
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:20,539
He has no idea whatsoever.

443
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,149
I see.

444
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:26,225
It's about time they smelled something.

445
00:39:28,053 --> 00:39:29,042
Go and throw them a bait.

446
00:39:30,647 --> 00:39:32,167
A bait...?

447
00:39:38,481 --> 00:39:40,430
It looks like it's been dead for a while.

448
00:39:42,694 --> 00:39:44,049
Yes sir.

449
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,954
I hear Byung pan is desperately looking for Lee Won Ho's son.

450
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:51,832
What?

451
00:39:52,114 --> 00:39:53,309
The child is alive?

452
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:55,331
We have to find him first!

453
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:58,775
If we find his son, we have a way out.

454
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,270
Let's find Geom and let's get rid of the king!

455
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:08,095
A conspiracy?

456
00:40:18,273 --> 00:40:21,867
By the way, why did you only pay for one hour?

457
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,258
I came a long way for you.

458
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,944
I'm going to leave now.

459
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:28,530
Oh come on, Myung Wol, I have no money.

460
00:40:29,044 --> 00:40:30,358
You can't go like this.

461
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:31,679
What kind of man is he?

462
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:34,486
Chop the wood!

463
00:40:35,428 --> 00:40:36,447
Come on, one drink for you!

464
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:45,076
I'm so hungry.

465
00:40:52,505 --> 00:40:53,658
You thief!

466
00:40:54,262 --> 00:40:56,304
You're not even worth Iljimae!

467
00:40:57,513 --> 00:40:59,474
Myung Wol brought this for me!

468
00:41:00,015 --> 00:41:00,997
You're so cheap!

469
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:07,076
Myung Wol said

470
00:41:08,485 --> 00:41:10,773
Iljimae is nowhere to be seen these days.

471
00:41:13,411 --> 00:41:16,235
This is some cheap old chicken! It's not tender at all.

472
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:18,613
I thought I was going to lose my tooth!

473
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:19,423
Ouch.

474
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:21,688
But the thing is

475
00:41:24,894 --> 00:41:28,145
I don't think Iljimae's objective is to steal.

476
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,797
What other purpose would a thief have?

477
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:36,555
Maybe he's looking for something else.

478
00:41:37,097 --> 00:41:38,031
Stealing

479
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:42,347
is just a scheme, a plan to hide that true purpose.

480
00:41:43,063 --> 00:41:45,046
Schemes and plans, that's your field.

481
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:46,519
You're so full of lies.

482
00:41:47,521 --> 00:41:48,872
Well then, if it's not.

483
00:41:53,138 --> 00:41:55,920
Stealing things is the way to make people think he's just a thief.

484
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:58,405
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

485
00:42:01,678 --> 00:42:03,900
In life, you lose some and you gain some.

486
00:42:04,138 --> 00:42:06,861
Don't try to be a dog and mess things around.

487
00:42:42,446 --> 00:42:43,556
I'm not doing this!

488
00:42:43,556 --> 00:42:45,031
I'm not doing this anymore!

489
00:42:46,682 --> 00:42:48,980
I clean, and you make a mess! What am I supposed to do?

490
00:43:21,911 --> 00:43:23,372
My poor skin!

491
00:43:23,827 --> 00:43:24,915
You're being lazy now?

492
00:43:25,178 --> 00:43:27,266
When are you going to teach me how to fight?

493
00:43:27,266 --> 00:43:30,006
Maybe I'll teach you when you learn how to avoid this cloth.

494
00:43:30,312 --> 00:43:31,416
Really?

495
00:43:35,564 --> 00:43:37,809
So they did take the bait?

496
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:41,396
Yes, your Majesty.

497
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,578
When they start looking for Lee Won Ho's son

498
00:43:45,637 --> 00:43:47,412
I will take care of them right away.

499
00:43:55,293 --> 00:43:56,310
Thank you!

500
00:44:03,697 --> 00:44:04,919
Yong!

501
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,332
Bong Soon!

502
00:44:20,431 --> 00:44:21,233
My dear daughter!

503
00:44:24,557 --> 00:44:25,067
That stupid girl!

504
00:44:27,027 --> 00:44:27,526
Yong!

505
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:28,771
Yong!

506
00:44:31,571 --> 00:44:32,063
Yong!

507
00:44:37,751 --> 00:44:39,014
Move away!

508
00:44:39,774 --> 00:44:42,616
I have to chop wood and clean the house too.

509
00:44:44,163 --> 00:44:44,862
My poor shoulder!

510
00:44:46,566 --> 00:44:47,485
You jerk!

511
00:44:50,867 --> 00:44:53,860
How long since my last meal like this? It's so good!

512
00:45:00,834 --> 00:45:03,371
It's completely useless to raise a daughter.

513
00:45:05,376 --> 00:45:06,462
Look at her.

514
00:45:12,945 --> 00:45:13,653
Try this.

515
00:45:13,653 --> 00:45:16,149
This is eel. It's supposed to be really good for men.

516
00:45:17,565 --> 00:45:19,096
Only the strength counts when it comes to men!

517
00:45:19,664 --> 00:45:20,198
Strength!

518
00:45:25,612 --> 00:45:26,372
What's that?

519
00:45:30,177 --> 00:45:31,263
Did you throw the cloth again?

520
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,661
Yong, are you ok?

521
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,492
You're going to ruin this beautiful face!

522
00:45:41,258 --> 00:45:42,386
Look at her!

523
00:45:43,515 --> 00:45:45,773
It's completely useless to raise a kid!

524
00:45:58,159 --> 00:45:59,681
But how did you know and avoid it?

525
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,664
Nothing's free in this world.

526
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,952
My poor back.

527
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:30,822
Do you want me to teach you some?

528
00:46:31,926 --> 00:46:32,496
What?

529
00:46:33,818 --> 00:46:35,277
You? Very funny. What do you know?

530
00:46:40,735 --> 00:46:41,493
So, you think I don't know anything?

531
00:46:42,138 --> 00:46:42,948
Do you want to have a go?

532
00:46:47,698 --> 00:46:48,526
No thank you.

533
00:46:48,603 --> 00:46:49,696
It's quite all right.

534
00:46:55,394 --> 00:46:55,983
Blood!

535
00:46:58,908 --> 00:46:59,359
Hey.

536
00:46:59,807 --> 00:47:01,680
Do you think I'll let you go easy just because you're a girl?

537
00:47:01,854 --> 00:47:02,693
I'm going to...

538
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:07,209
All right.

539
00:47:07,753 --> 00:47:08,718
Let's fight.

540
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:10,363
I'm going to kill you.

541
00:47:29,816 --> 00:47:30,543
You're dead!

542
00:47:40,898 --> 00:47:42,030
How did you avoid it back there?

543
00:47:43,546 --> 00:47:44,211
It's easy.

544
00:47:44,557 --> 00:47:48,389
Imagine the cloth is poop.

545
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:49,727
What? Poop?

546
00:47:52,354 --> 00:47:54,044
It's disgusting!

547
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,523
That is so you.

548
00:47:58,845 --> 00:48:02,992
Even if you can avoid it, my dad won't teach you that easily.

549
00:48:03,459 --> 00:48:05,718
You also know how to fight, a little.

550
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,753
I learned by myself.

551
00:48:10,347 --> 00:48:11,450
Why would you learn how to fight?

552
00:48:15,535 --> 00:48:19,349
There's someone I need to revenge.

553
00:48:22,392 --> 00:48:23,030
Are you going to kill him?

554
00:48:23,189 --> 00:48:23,975
Of course.

555
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:28,680
Don't say a word to my father!

556
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:33,017
If you even open your mouth... 
 You know what's going to happen, right?

557
00:48:52,544 --> 00:48:53,052
Yong.

558
00:48:55,071 --> 00:48:55,700
What?

559
00:48:58,273 --> 00:48:59,289
It's hard, right?

560
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:02,751
What?

561
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:18,514
This is hard.

562
00:49:24,035 --> 00:49:25,957
What a crappy life.

563
00:49:59,337 --> 00:50:00,807
I'm not leaving!

564
00:50:00,807 --> 00:50:01,761
Leave! Now!

565
00:50:03,575 --> 00:50:04,373
Yong!

566
00:50:04,518 --> 00:50:05,343
I'm not leaving!

567
00:50:06,702 --> 00:50:07,825
Why?

568
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,117
Go! Leave!

569
00:50:09,796 --> 00:50:10,863
Don't ever come back!

570
00:50:11,776 --> 00:50:14,671
Don't ever come back. If you do, I'm going to kill you.

571
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:17,725
You jerk! I brought all this food for you!

572
00:50:19,205 --> 00:50:19,890
Father!

573
00:50:21,658 --> 00:50:22,567
Go!

574
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:24,090
Father, I don't want to go!

575
00:50:26,094 --> 00:50:27,027
Yong!

576
00:50:28,439 --> 00:50:29,225
Yong!

577
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:33,687
You bastard!

578
00:50:33,888 --> 00:50:35,368
What did you do to my Bong Soon?

579
00:50:35,821 --> 00:50:37,462
She only cared about me, and now look what she's become!

580
00:50:42,451 --> 00:50:42,886
Poop!

581
00:50:44,902 --> 00:50:46,107
I avoided it!

582
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:48,924
Now, you're going to teach me, right?

583
00:51:11,758 --> 00:51:17,122
All right, I did this, it's time to take my responsibilities.

584
00:51:30,718 --> 00:51:31,741
All right, swing that at me.

585
00:51:34,432 --> 00:51:34,963
Really?

586
00:51:36,412 --> 00:51:39,053
But you have to teach me from the basics.

587
00:51:39,069 --> 00:51:44,334
You carried water, you chopped wood, you cleaned the room. That's all the basics, what else?

588
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:49,050
If you can avoid a flying cloth and a flying wood stick

589
00:51:50,459 --> 00:51:51,934
it means you already know how to fight.

590
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:06,883
Your opponent is not a tree.

591
00:52:09,825 --> 00:52:13,580
He is fast, he flies over rooftops.

592
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,469
Your sword is to block the opponent's sword.

593
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:30,394
From now on, I'm the only one attacking.

594
00:52:31,076 --> 00:52:31,589
What?

595
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:34,677
What kind of rules are those?

596
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:36,247
My kind.

597
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:40,608
They say he fled to Chung.

598
00:52:41,171 --> 00:52:41,575
What?

599
00:52:42,705 --> 00:52:43,733
I heard he killed himself.

600
00:52:44,135 --> 00:52:47,015
They say that he got hurt by the sword, became crippled and killed himself.

601
00:52:47,288 --> 00:52:48,229
Haven't you heard?

602
00:52:49,164 --> 00:52:51,544
Iljimae was actually a woman.

603
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:54,195
I knew it! He had a fine nice body.

604
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:55,585
A woman?

605
00:52:56,642 --> 00:52:57,273
No way.

606
00:52:57,946 --> 00:52:58,832
I'm telling you.

607
00:52:59,396 --> 00:53:04,140
That's why she could avoid all those inspections.

608
00:53:05,425 --> 00:53:06,654
They didn't search the women, did they?

609
00:53:09,198 --> 00:53:10,197
Which one is the truth?

610
00:53:11,067 --> 00:53:12,611
Did he escape to Chung?

611
00:53:13,308 --> 00:53:14,514
Did he kill himself?

612
00:53:14,986 --> 00:53:16,936
Or did she get married?

613
00:53:18,372 --> 00:53:20,364
I'm going to tell you.

614
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:27,122
Iljimae was a woman and she got married in Chung. Marriage was too hard and she killed herself. The end.

615
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:33,513
I'm telling you, it's a woman.

616
00:53:34,482 --> 00:53:35,671
Just eat.

617
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:44,319
She got married to someone in Chung. But it was too hard. So she killed herself.

618
00:53:49,008 --> 00:53:49,901
By the way.

619
00:53:51,035 --> 00:53:54,288
Because he's gone, no one is looking for my locks.

620
00:53:54,662 --> 00:53:55,864
I'm not hungry anymore.

621
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:00,744
By the way... do you have any more rice?

622
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,067
I thought you weren't hungry?

623
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,030
Me?

624
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,363
No, I'm hungry.

625
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:15,439
Didn't you keep this for Yong?

626
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:17,482
I wonder if I can still eat it.

627
00:54:17,809 --> 00:54:20,153
Is he even getting fed?

628
00:54:34,762 --> 00:54:35,530
I'm full.

629
00:54:54,227 --> 00:54:55,671
There are nine basic rules in sword attack.

630
00:54:56,384 --> 00:55:00,459
No matter how strong or fast you are, you can't avoid these nine methods.

631
00:55:00,986 --> 00:55:04,919
If you can stop them all, then you won't lose to anyone.

632
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,352
Strike!

633
00:55:09,399 --> 00:55:10,147
Diagonal strike!

634
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:11,234
Diagonal strike!

635
00:55:11,923 --> 00:55:12,442
Parallel strike!

636
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:13,767
Diagonal strike!

637
00:55:14,332 --> 00:55:14,854
Strike!

638
00:55:15,304 --> 00:55:15,962
Up strike!

639
00:55:18,192 --> 00:55:18,628
Stab!

640
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:47,490
You're quite good.

641
00:55:47,993 --> 00:55:49,731
Right? I'm good, aren't I?

642
00:55:50,571 --> 00:55:53,320
This is like a child's game!

643
00:55:54,441 --> 00:55:57,450
I'm Yong, I live by the looks.

644
00:55:58,423 --> 00:56:01,349
From tomorrow, let's use real swords.

645
00:56:02,907 --> 00:56:03,486
No.

646
00:56:05,535 --> 00:56:06,816
Why not?

647
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:08,877
You are never to fight to kill.

648
00:56:11,762 --> 00:56:12,986
A long time ago...

649
00:56:13,241 --> 00:56:14,986
I used to kill people like a butcher would kill cows.

650
00:56:16,702 --> 00:56:22,863
As long as it was for something I believed in, I thought killing people was nothing.

651
00:56:24,151 --> 00:56:24,673
That's why...

652
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:30,618
Women, old people, children. I killed them all without hesitation.

653
00:56:34,736 --> 00:56:35,694
With these hands.

654
00:56:39,817 --> 00:56:42,700
What were the things you believed in?

655
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:46,816
I don't know...

656
00:56:47,965 --> 00:56:49,031
What were they?

657
00:56:53,048 --> 00:56:55,800
I was a killer. What do you think I believed in? 
 I had no belief you fool!

658
00:56:58,438 --> 00:57:01,236
I don't know what you believe in

659
00:57:02,026 --> 00:57:05,950
but the moment you kill someone, all that belief becomes nothing.

660
00:57:09,165 --> 00:57:12,472
You'll be just the same.

661
00:57:18,537 --> 00:57:20,687
People called me 'the killer'.

662
00:57:22,274 --> 00:57:23,823
But I don't care.

663
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:26,904
I killed anyone who stood in my way.

664
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:29,651
For my belief.

665
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,075
What are your beliefs?

666
00:57:37,774 --> 00:57:40,939
He is my belief.

667
00:58:42,238 --> 00:58:42,697
Do you want some?

668
00:58:43,749 --> 00:58:44,684
No.

669
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:53,407
Just once!

670
00:59:41,371 --> 00:59:42,746
Get up! Wake up!

671
00:59:43,399 --> 00:59:44,362
I don't want to go!

672
00:59:51,399 --> 00:59:52,071
Father!

673
00:59:52,745 --> 00:59:53,946
Even a dog is left alone when it's eating!

674
00:59:53,999 --> 00:59:55,153
You're not even worth a dog!

675
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:30,098


676
01:00:42,799 --> 01:01:03,468
