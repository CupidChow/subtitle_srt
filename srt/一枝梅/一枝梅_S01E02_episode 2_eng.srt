1
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,174


2
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:58,889
Geom! No matter what happens to Father, you have to survive.

3
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:00,300
Father!

4
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,760
  Support our volunteers. 
 Do not make hardsubs of our work.  

5
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:19,091
Who commanded you to be here?

6
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:43,302
How... can you do this to me? How...

7
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:46,806
What Gwang Hae did was right?

8
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:53,887
Two suns can't exist in one sky.

9
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:04,798
I sincerely cherished you.

10
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:14,233
Therefore, I don't want to let you die in others' hands.

11
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:16,398
What are you doing?

12
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:18,814
Is there anything inside?

13
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,956
There is nothing.

14
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:13,122
Yeah, it was this house

15
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:16,623
Just because of that damn torn piece of paper...

16
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,869
Ouch! Oh! I'm dying.

17
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:50,060
I lost all my skills I used to have when I was young.

18
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:55,519
But where is this place?

19
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:18,561
Oh crap! What's this?!

20
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:25,247
Help me, help me...

21
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:29,374
What's that? Is... that a ghost?

22
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:41,233
Help me, help me, help me...

23
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:46,780
Help me.

24
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:52,623
Help me

25
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:57,273
Help me.

26
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,732
Help me.

27
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:14,853
Rebel Lee Won Ho hurry up and receive the imperial edict.

28
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:26,869
Search the house thoroughly!

29
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:29,534
Go and find the criminal of high treason, Lee Won Ho immediately!

30
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:32,512
Wh, wh, wh, what? High treason?

31
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:36,744
Oh Heaven! What the heck is going on?

32
00:11:12,244 --> 00:11:16,114
Oh gosh! What the hell is going on?

33
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:17,838
Oh my god! what should I do?...

34
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:21,757
I'm going insane.

35
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,416
Where does that child come from?

36
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:31,918
Ah... He is... uhm...

37
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:42,402
After realizing his treacherous plan's failed, he committed suicide

38
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,300
But there are some strange things.

39
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:50,152
In a normal suicide case, people stab himself... but why did he slash?

40
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:54,293
And especially, he held his sword by his left hand.

41
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:57,475
Your curiosity is activated again.

42
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:59,634
Maybe he is a left-handed person.

43
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:04,053
Moreover, there's no trace of hesitation.

44
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:10,083
In a suicide case, normally we find traces of hesitation, but in this case... at one try?

45
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:15,647
Stop saying nonsense and clean up the corpse!

46
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:22,353
Sir, I just found this under the stone pillar.

47
00:12:22,353 --> 00:12:23,759
Oh! this...!

48
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,443
What is that?

49
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:26,776
It's an indictment.

50
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:30,224
He is definitely the mastermind of this treacherous plan.

51
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,140
Where are we going?

52
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,569
Didn't you say that somebody died?

53
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:51,618
I'm bringing the newly sewed clothes to the prosecutor´s office.

54
00:12:51,618 --> 00:12:56,764
Maybe I can find out what happened where.

55
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:14,658
By the way, that boy...

56
00:13:14,658 --> 00:13:17,479
Have I met him somewhere before?

57
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:22,625
Please have some.

58
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:27,040
The Lady gave it to me but I'm full already.

59
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,260
That's very nice, thank you.

60
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,737
It's delicious.

61
00:13:30,737 --> 00:13:33,074
Why is this office so chaotic?

62
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:35,069
Did something happen?

63
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:36,836
Didn't you know?

64
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:41,251
Now, the rebels streamed into here in a line like susages.

65
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:43,824
I heard that the leader had committed suicide.

66
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:44,743
Suicide?

67
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:49,523
Yes, if he died then everything would end. But what would happen to his family?

68
00:13:49,523 --> 00:13:52,762
I heard that his son has disappeared

69
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:54,678
so we're looking for him everywhere.

70
00:13:54,678 --> 00:13:56,259
A son?

71
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:57,316
Yeah.

72
00:13:57,316 --> 00:14:01,757
Who is the one that committed suicide? Where does he live?

73
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:07,321
Near Hanyang...He is a noble called Lee Won Ho, if I'm not wrong.

74
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:10,099
I'm not sure what kind of person he is.

75
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,070
Do you know him?

76
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,389
No, I don't.

77
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:13,486
It's the first time I hear of this name.

78
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:27,984
Father, Father, Father...

79
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,540
That's right, I'm not mistaken.

80
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,571
You are Lee Won Ho's son.

81
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:41,515
While my son was living in poor and hearing he was a thief's son,

82
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:45,930
you were growing up like the apple of his eye in a noble family.

83
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:51,281
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

84
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:52,806
What are you doing now?

85
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:54,211
Move aside!

86
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:56,039
This boy is the son of a rebel.

87
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,282
You know that hiding a rebel's son will lead to serious consequences.

88
00:14:58,282 --> 00:15:00,493
If people find out, our life will be end either.

89
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:02,178
Please calm down.

90
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:05,678
If we hand him over to the Prosecutor´s Office, the boy will die.

91
00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:07,912
That's what I want.

92
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:08,879
What? What?

93
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,798
What's wrong with you?

94
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:13,346
Please calm yourself down.

95
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,030
Please talk to me.

96
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,929
Come here.

97
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:16,754
Let me go!

98
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:29,086
Let me go!

99
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:33,864
No matter of what you tell me, I will hand him over to the Prosecutor´s Office.

100
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:35,951
Why are you so upset? Please calm down.

101
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:43,422
That boy is Lee Won Ho's son.

102
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:49,460
What? So the dead person lying in the yard was...

103
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,535
Yeah, he is Lee Won Ho.

104
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:57,584
He died before I have a chance to revenge.

105
00:15:57,584 --> 00:16:02,416
Wait here, I will make him, even in hell, see what happens to his son.

106
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,689
I will revenge even in that way.

107
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:08,790
But...no matter how hateful and revengeful you are

108
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,507
if that baby is truly his son

109
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:15,033
then he also has the same bloodline with our Ja Dol.

110
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:17,724
Isn't he the younger brother of Ja Dol?

111
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:05,554
 10 years ago. 

112
00:17:05,554 --> 00:17:12,146
After everything is settled, you must give me 100 bugs.

113
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:17,936
But if you fail to do it, I won't give you even a penny.

114
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:22,116
Don't worry. Just go and wait for me drinking something.

115
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:23,291
I will finish this up quickly and go find you right away.

116
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:41,238
Even a bag wants to cause me a trouble.

117
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:47,220
Wh, wh, Who are you? !!!

118
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:02,188
I kidnap you just because of my living. Please understand me.

119
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:20,918
I am.... just obeying what I was told to do.

120
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:23,178
I'm sorry.

121
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:30,217
I know I cannot do this but I still wanted to meet you.

122
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:34,867
After seeing your face, I feel really relieved.

123
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:38,158
You look like a good person.

124
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:44,558
Everywhere I go, I hear... people saying that I have a kind face... uh, uh, uh,!

125
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:50,723
This is not much. I count everything on you.

126
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:53,153
Please make her happy

127
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:56,287
She is a nice woman

128
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:58,508
and the most precious person to me.

129
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,658
Help me support this! Be careful!

130
00:19:06,658 --> 00:19:09,897
It's so heavy!

131
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:17,342
Oh tiring!

132
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,697
She truly looks like a fairy.

133
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:23,193
Take this!

134
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:23,864
Thanks.

135
00:19:23,864 --> 00:19:25,309
You've worked hard.

136
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:27,086
What are you doing?

137
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:28,967
Oh, oh, okay.

138
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,299
Be careful.

139
00:19:35,964 --> 00:19:37,561
Bye!

140
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:49,656
But I don't know what makes a maid suffer such a marriage?

141
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:59,269
Wait, there is no road to that direction...?

142
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:16,483
Please don't hold a grudge against me.

143
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:19,722
I'm just doing what your master asked me to do.

144
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:23,536
Because you have Young Master's kid as a maid, you are going through this mess.

145
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:32,157
What the hell are you doing now?

146
00:20:39,053 --> 00:20:46,632
You said to kidnap her and live with her. Why are you trying to kill a person now?

147
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:49,627
Please spare my life!!

148
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:51,487
I'm innocent!

149
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:54,518
I'm just obeying the instruction.

150
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:00,060
I'll give you back all the money I took.

151
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:09,799
Pass me this women. Got it?

152
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:17,123
It's not a big problem.

153
00:21:17,123 --> 00:21:19,683
She is just horrified.

154
00:21:19,683 --> 00:21:22,922
The baby is safe as well.

155
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:27,363
A baby?

156
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:32,536
He didn't intended to kill you.

157
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:37,125
No way... He even gave me money, telling me to make you happy.

158
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:42,462
But I can't tell you the truth.

159
00:21:42,462 --> 00:21:44,578
I will not.

160
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:52,206
Although you use harsh language, I know that you still love him so much.

161
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:58,005
I can't say it since I'm afraid you won't ever give your heart to me.

162
00:21:58,005 --> 00:22:01,505
Cannot say it

163
00:22:05,345 --> 00:22:07,866
Are you acting like fortune´s orphan? tsk, tsk

164
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:14,776
Is my Ja Dol doing well?

165
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:17,074
How boorish! Now his name is Shi Hoo, Okay?

166
00:22:17,074 --> 00:22:20,674
By the way, have you heard the treacherous story?

167
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,527
I eavesdropped my master talking

168
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:27,915
He said they found an undeniable treacherous evidence under the stone pillar of his house.

169
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:29,012
What?

170
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:31,159
Mistress, please give me a pair of chopsticks!

171
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:34,629
This woman, not working but running somewhere? Mistress!

172
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:40,167
Oh damn! Does it mean that Ja Dol caused his biological father's death?

173
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:46,514
What to do now? Why does fate seem to play trick on us?

174
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:53,332
Oh, Heaven! This karma is all created by me

175
00:23:03,024 --> 00:23:06,028
They haven't found his son yet

176
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:07,804
And about what you ordered

177
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,704
when Palace Guards stormed into his house,

178
00:23:10,704 --> 00:23:13,002
there was nothing like wardrobe.

179
00:23:13,002 --> 00:23:15,946
There was nothing?

180
00:23:15,946 --> 00:23:19,376
That is strange. Why did the wardrobe disappear?

181
00:23:21,082 --> 00:23:28,617
The best archer of Joseon could possibly miss it, huh?

182
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:31,079
We stop here today.

183
00:23:44,245 --> 00:23:49,398
...about 9 years old and about this height. Have you seen any boy like that?

184
00:23:49,398 --> 00:23:50,540
No, I haven't.

185
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:28,964
Go away! Children are not allowed to see this. Go away!

186
00:24:28,964 --> 00:24:32,467
They will do posthumous dismemberment.

187
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:36,333
Posthumous dismemberment?

188
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:40,513
You know... pulling the limbs into pieces...

189
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:42,367
So horrible!

190
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:55,037
Start executing!

191
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,565
(Father...)

192
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:20,898
Pull it more!

193
00:25:32,286 --> 00:25:42,919
Mother, mother... sister...

194
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:56,600
I will never forget. Never ever.

195
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,400
Who's that?

196
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,000
Big brother.

197
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,200
What?

198
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,000
You... you were the one that said my sister was dirty and pushed her away last time, right?

199
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,700
It was....

200
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,800
Let me see, you are being chased?

201
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,800
This way!

202
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,500
Please don't! Please save me.

203
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,200
I don't know what happened, but people like you should be punished.

204
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:10,981
I will give you this.

205
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,000
What a miraculous thing.

206
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,000
How much money could I get by selling it?

207
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,800
Yeah, it is very expensive.

208
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,400
Really?

209
00:28:27,543 --> 00:28:33,892
Father, father, father...

210
00:28:33,892 --> 00:28:36,581
Eat it.

211
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,800
Why is he being like this?

212
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,600
It is because he ate degenerated food.

213
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,500
But I am fine.

214
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,900
Since he is a noble.

215
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,100
He might not have eaten this type of food before.

216
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,700
Will he die?

217
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,700
I don't know

218
00:29:12,941 --> 00:29:15,608
I should get some medicines for him.

219
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:20,258
Do you have money?

220
00:29:23,915 --> 00:29:25,898
It will be okay if I sell this, he said that it is very expensive.

221
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:27,931
I want to go with you.

222
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:31,205
You need to stay here to take care of him.

223
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:34,756
No, I want to go with you.

224
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:40,490
I'll be back soon. mm... I will buy your favorite cake for you.

225
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,966
Really?

226
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:51,840
How could it be possible for a beggar to have this item?

227
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,260
Did you steal it?

228
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,166
It is mine. My father gave it to me.

229
00:30:05,394 --> 00:30:08,428
He may be a child whom you are looking for.

230
00:30:10,883 --> 00:30:15,842
You only need to find him in a beggar village near the Soo Pyo Bridge.

231
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:23,631
Wow, are you giving me this much money?

232
00:30:50,573 --> 00:30:52,396
Are you all right?

233
00:30:54,064 --> 00:30:55,740
Where did he go?

234
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,773
He went to go buy medicine.

235
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,000
Medicine?

236
00:31:18,147 --> 00:31:23,164
He is also going to buy that rice cake that I like, with the trinket that he sold of yours.

237
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:26,456
That stuff? Trinket?

238
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:29,904
How long has it been since he left?

239
00:31:29,904 --> 00:31:32,438
A little while ago...

240
00:31:32,438 --> 00:31:35,703
He said he would be back soon, I could die, I'm so hungry.

241
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:54,616
Where are you going? Don't go! I'm scared, big brother.

242
00:31:57,817 --> 00:32:00,258
No way. Don't want to go...don't go...

243
00:32:00,258 --> 00:32:02,400
Brother said he is going to buy rice cakes.

244
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:28,392
Brother is here? Where is he?

245
00:33:52,846 --> 00:33:56,608
It's ok. Don't look down, close your eyes, and jump.

246
00:33:56,608 --> 00:33:59,089
On the count of three...we are jumping...ok?

247
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:02,316
I'm scared...just scared.

248
00:34:02,316 --> 00:34:06,639
I'm here. I'll protect you, and I won't let go of this hand.

249
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:12,177
One...

250
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,737
Two...

251
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:16,879
Three!

252
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,254
Let me live!

253
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:47,886
Please spare me! Let go of me! Let me live...

254
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:50,446
Let me live!

255
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:56,611
Ahh..let me live...

256
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,283
Let me live!

257
00:35:07,987 --> 00:35:13,120
The boy died from falling off the cliff, and I killed the girl.

258
00:35:15,088 --> 00:35:19,155
That's right...that is more like you.

259
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:23,987
As you ordered, we took care of the body.

260
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,000
Why the body?

261
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,799
They might be saying that it might not be Lee Won Ho's kid after all...

262
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:42,169
back then Lee Won Ho had a son next to him...

263
00:35:42,169 --> 00:35:44,163
Could it...

264
00:35:44,163 --> 00:35:47,863
They will look into it.

265
00:36:09,702 --> 00:36:12,602
Look, aigoo...

266
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:15,736
Wait!

267
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:27,334
By chance, didn't we meet before at Nam-Moon? You're that young master aren't you?

268
00:36:27,334 --> 00:36:29,255
Persimmon Pastry.

269
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:33,473
You are mistaken.

270
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:47,422
Uh, what was the name of that traitor who was that man?

271
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:51,471
What was it... Lee Won Ho?

272
00:36:51,471 --> 00:36:53,801
Lee Won Ho?

273
00:36:53,801 --> 00:36:55,860
I am Lee Geom. Lee Geom

274
00:36:55,876 --> 00:36:59,943
Me.... I am Lee Won Ho.

275
00:37:07,302 --> 00:37:12,813
Capturing him would be awarding, huh?

276
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:17,829
Yes, what has become of Lee Won Ho's family members?

277
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:20,859
His wife and daughter are being interrogated.

278
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:22,801
I heard the son died.

279
00:37:24,312 --> 00:37:25,091
Ohh it's hot!

280
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:29,244
Oh my, child! Are you okay? Nurse/maid!

281
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:32,692
Child, how could this be? how? Right here.

282
00:37:32,692 --> 00:37:35,423
Isn't Master Lee Won Ho...?

283
00:37:35,423 --> 00:37:37,107
Oh yeah, that's right.

284
00:37:37,107 --> 00:37:41,522
Ohh, we adults shouldn't be speaking about this matter in front of you.

285
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:44,952
Are you okay? You didn't get burned? Hm?

286
00:38:00,498 --> 00:38:02,655
But what is the name of that bird?

287
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,632
Whistle bird.

288
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:06,294
Whistle bird?

289
00:38:06,294 --> 00:38:10,335
Wow! Really, the bird's song really sounds like a whistle.

290
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:14,175
However that bird is a pitiful bird.

291
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,963
Older brother.

292
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:55,605
Yong Jae older brother...

293
00:39:05,424 --> 00:39:11,671
Chan, I am going to quit.

294
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:19,830
I won't murder women and children anymore.

295
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:25,254
I'd rather kill pigs to live my life.

296
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:59,799
He wanted to tell you that things are all taken care of thanks to you

297
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:03,142
Well.. all I did was just burying the document sealed with blood...

298
00:40:03,142 --> 00:40:06,056
Right, so you are gonna work at the palace?

299
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:06,930
Yes, sir

300
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:12,834
Right, right, in regarding to swordmanship, you are second to none in this nation

301
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:16,204
Well, actually, there's Young Jae

302
00:40:18,346 --> 00:40:27,724
So now you feel sudden relief as he's disappeared or what?

303
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:31,668
Let's go inside and make a toast for celebrating that! Hahaha

304
00:40:35,668 --> 00:40:38,800
Oh my god, what is this?

305
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,544
Who the heck did this? Who did this!

306
00:40:42,544 --> 00:40:43,293
Bastard!

307
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:48,073
I have been taking care of you humble thing because I felt pity for you

308
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:49,937
Do you have any idea how precious this ink water container is?

309
00:40:49,937 --> 00:40:53,337
This is the most precious treasure imported from the Great Ming Empire

310
00:40:53,337 --> 00:40:55,988
I didn't do that. I mean it!

311
00:40:55,988 --> 00:41:00,873
How dare you retort against me?

312
00:41:00,873 --> 00:41:05,484
My son, Shi Wan, saw that you were running away after you broke it!

313
00:41:05,484 --> 00:41:07,351
I have no idea what you are talking about!

314
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:13,281
How dare you little bastard retort against me like that? Your attitude!

315
00:41:13,281 --> 00:41:16,726
Today, I am gonna teach you a lesson!

316
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:19,733
It's possible that he's not the one who broke it

317
00:41:19,733 --> 00:41:24,566
There's no such person in this family who'd do this except him!

318
00:41:43,923 --> 00:41:48,782
Take a look at. You see the bloodstain on the piece?

319
00:41:48,782 --> 00:41:50,767
So?

320
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:54,555
I think someone who broke the ink water container might have been cut

321
00:41:54,555 --> 00:41:58,499
However, I don't have that kind of cut on my hand

322
00:42:06,082 --> 00:42:10,672
Well, we will talk about this later. I have a guest

323
00:42:27,774 --> 00:42:32,746
He has some chilly eyes

324
00:42:32,746 --> 00:42:35,127
Who's that boy?

325
00:42:35,127 --> 00:42:39,520
Huh? Oh...a son

326
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:47,688
Well..if he didn't do this, then who dared to...

327
00:42:47,688 --> 00:42:49,856
I am confused...

328
00:42:49,856 --> 00:42:53,513
Hey, who is he?

329
00:42:53,513 --> 00:42:57,693
I don't know but he has one kind of an aura, doesn't he?

330
00:43:08,907 --> 00:43:14,398
It's reported that a boy suspected as Geom has been caught by a soldier in the Left District Office

331
00:43:14,398 --> 00:43:18,878
What? Isn't he already dead?

332
00:43:18,878 --> 00:43:22,736
Yes he is..but...what do you want me to do?

333
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:23,684
Confirm it

334
00:43:25,557 --> 00:43:28,752
You know, I've seen him before

335
00:43:28,752 --> 00:43:32,618
You! What have you been doing behind the corner?

336
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:36,420
Do you know him?

337
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,985
Yeah, I've met him at the market street couple of days ago

338
00:43:43,198 --> 00:43:47,691
Then, can you confirm his face for me?

339
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:48,579
Yes, sir

340
00:43:50,217 --> 00:43:54,444
You go to the district and escort the family of the traitor to the Bureau of Judicial Affairs

341
00:43:54,444 --> 00:43:57,173
Be sure to pass by the market street at the South Gate

342
00:45:02,894 --> 00:45:04,778
Stop

343
00:45:08,775 --> 00:45:10,160
Stop this!

344
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:28,916
Are you the wife of Lee Won Ho?

345
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:30,589
Yes, I am

346
00:46:11,442 --> 00:46:13,218
Your mother?

347
00:46:23,429 --> 00:46:24,294
Mo.....

348
00:46:28,187 --> 00:46:32,209
You bastard! What did you to my son? Where is my son, Geom?

349
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:34,717
You didn't do anything to my little son, did you?

350
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,677
Who are you? You killed my son?

351
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:49,398
Then, you shall be dead! You shall be! Now!

352
00:46:57,353 --> 00:47:01,231
You shall be dead now!

353
00:47:08,677 --> 00:47:10,714
Is he the one?

354
00:47:10,714 --> 00:47:13,157
He's...

355
00:47:13,157 --> 00:47:14,058
You shall be dead, now!

356
00:47:24,454 --> 00:47:28,347
I think she's crazy

357
00:47:28,347 --> 00:47:30,593
Take her away

358
00:47:43,328 --> 00:47:44,542
Stop that

359
00:47:59,145 --> 00:48:01,505
She's committed a high treason

360
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:03,246
What should we do?

361
00:48:51,285 --> 00:48:57,399
Geom, please throw the stone to me. I am okay

362
00:49:01,081 --> 00:49:02,910
He...

363
00:49:05,433 --> 00:49:13,724
He's not the son of Lee Won Ho

364
00:49:15,293 --> 00:49:16,964
Are you sure?

365
00:49:16,964 --> 00:49:24,121
Yes, I am. I am sure he's not the one

366
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:09,723
I told you, master. I told you I'd repay your kindness...

367
00:50:18,661 --> 00:50:20,049
Let him go

368
00:50:42,698 --> 00:50:48,105
Geom! Geom! My little boy, Geom!

369
00:51:22,451 --> 00:51:29,666
My baby...my baby...

370
00:51:39,044 --> 00:51:41,604
Is he awake?

371
00:51:41,604 --> 00:51:46,389
Hey, baby, are you okay?

372
00:51:46,389 --> 00:51:48,761
Father?

373
00:51:48,761 --> 00:51:50,120
Huh?

374
00:51:50,914 --> 00:51:52,780
Mother?

375
00:52:14,503 --> 00:52:19,459
Don't worry, he'll be okay.

376
00:52:19,459 --> 00:52:21,794
Yeah

377
00:52:21,794 --> 00:52:22,968
Take care

378
00:52:22,968 --> 00:52:24,243
Yes.

379
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:38,767
The doctor told me that he could have lost his memory because of some shocking incident

380
00:52:38,767 --> 00:52:41,162
This could be permanent

381
00:52:41,162 --> 00:52:43,913
It's too much for a little kid

382
00:52:43,913 --> 00:52:51,106
You know, as this has happened, why don't we raise him for a while?

383
00:52:51,106 --> 00:52:53,492
No, we can't do that

384
00:52:53,492 --> 00:52:56,122
Then why did you take him to here?

385
00:52:56,122 --> 00:52:58,416
The..situation was...

386
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:00,893
Please, honey

387
00:53:00,893 --> 00:53:05,787
I am somehow responsible for what he's been gone through...

388
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:06,819
It's my karma

389
00:53:06,819 --> 00:53:07,737
What are you talking about?

390
00:53:07,737 --> 00:53:11,151
Anyway, I am begging you, please let me keep him

391
00:53:11,151 --> 00:53:14,438
No! You are asking me to raise the son of Lee Won Ho?

392
00:53:14,438 --> 00:53:16,645
Just this once, please

393
00:53:16,645 --> 00:53:23,019
I saved your life and I've raised your son like my own son so far.

394
00:53:23,019 --> 00:53:26,110
So, please just this once, huh?

395
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,616
But...

396
00:53:27,616 --> 00:53:32,684
Let's see...how would you like to name him?

397
00:53:32,684 --> 00:53:35,897
Oh, what about Gaetong (Dog turd in Korean)?

398
00:53:35,897 --> 00:53:38,065
You know there's a proverb that 'A hero comes from Gaechun ('creek' in Korean)'

399
00:53:38,065 --> 00:53:43,238
You know what I mean? 'A hero comes from Gaechun....' Huh?

400
00:53:43,238 --> 00:53:47,913
Well, it means that...well....very often, a hero comes from a creek....and...

401
00:53:47,913 --> 00:53:49,402
Gaetong....

402
00:53:49,402 --> 00:53:53,138
If you are really  not into this one, well...

403
00:53:53,138 --> 00:53:57,553
Oh, what about Yong? Yong! Yong! I like this one! Yong! Haha

404
00:54:01,602 --> 00:54:03,561
She doesn't like this one?

405
00:54:03,561 --> 00:54:05,964
I like it so damn much...

406
00:54:05,964 --> 00:54:10,754
Yong! Hey, yong! Come here, Yong!

407
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,727
Oh, my little boy, Yong is now awake!

408
00:54:16,727 --> 00:54:20,462
You don't remember? It's your name, Yong

409
00:54:20,462 --> 00:54:24,824
Your father is Swe Dol, your mother is Dani and we are one family, you know?

410
00:54:24,824 --> 00:54:27,306
We are one family from the day one, got that?

411
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:31,538
All right, all right

412
00:54:46,655 --> 00:54:48,091
So, how's she doing?

413
00:54:48,091 --> 00:54:50,242
She's doing great

414
00:54:50,242 --> 00:54:53,350
She's pretty clever

415
00:54:58,731 --> 00:55:01,718
Take well care of that poor girl

416
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:04,922
Sure, sure, trust me

417
00:55:04,922 --> 00:55:08,136
Oh, I will bring you some more soup. Will be back in a second

418
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:19,760
She is our lucky charm!

419
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,082
Are you gonna...keep her?

420
00:55:23,082 --> 00:55:24,828
Are you crazy?

421
00:55:24,828 --> 00:55:28,268
I am gonna sell her to Mr. Park. He'll pay us 500 nyangs.

422
00:55:28,268 --> 00:55:32,900
Mr. Park? Isn't he standing at the front gate of Heaven by now?

423
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:36,775
Well they say an old man is healed if he hugs a girl while he sleeps

424
00:55:36,775 --> 00:55:39,822
He's crazy!...He won't make it anyway

425
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:44,158
Come here, Madam

426
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:54,842
Brother...brother...

427
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:22,741
Brother...

428
00:56:25,249 --> 00:56:26,999
Brother...

429
00:56:42,124 --> 00:56:43,456
Go!

430
00:56:58,686 --> 00:57:00,096
I said go!

431
00:57:00,096 --> 00:57:03,188
Be a good girl, okay?

432
00:57:03,188 --> 00:57:07,829
I am scared, I don't want to be sold!

433
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:40,064
 13 years later 

434
00:57:40,064 --> 00:57:45,518
We are from different status and you dared to lie to me?

435
00:57:45,518 --> 00:57:54,367
So you thought it actaully made sense that you could study in the Northern Cheonghakdang?

436
00:57:54,367 --> 00:58:00,456
I am telling you, don't ever think about hanging around the school

437
00:58:00,456 --> 00:58:02,555
Understand that?

438
00:58:04,488 --> 00:58:06,003
Let's go

439
00:58:21,468 --> 00:58:30,049
Geom, you have to survive even if something happens to me

440
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:33,353
Promise me, that you will survive

441
00:58:41,213 --> 00:58:42,993
Let's see...

442
00:58:46,345 --> 00:58:51,012
Damn it, not even a rat?

443
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:04,491
What's that? A human?

444
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:24,513
Father, mother, Ge...Geom will never going to die, father!

445
00:59:24,513 --> 00:59:32,599
Geom? Did he just say Geom?

446
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:38,842
Then he is the.... Hahaha

447
00:59:38,842 --> 00:59:44,746
I knew he was going to make it

448
00:59:44,746 --> 00:59:47,489
Father, father!

449
00:59:49,912 --> 00:59:53,131
Are you okay?

450
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:57,781
You were about to be frozen to death

451
00:59:57,781 --> 01:00:02,718
Here, some hot soup will make you feel better

452
01:00:02,718 --> 01:00:06,950
Yes

453
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:13,298
So, how come were you found in the mountain?

454
01:00:13,298 --> 01:00:21,944
I am Yong in the Southern Gate

455
01:00:21,944 --> 01:00:24,975
Anyway, thank you

456
01:00:24,975 --> 01:00:26,882
So you are...

457
01:00:26,882 --> 01:00:32,211
Oh, me? I am just a hunter

458
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:37,096
I came here to check out if something had been caught in the trap

459
01:00:37,096 --> 01:00:41,014
And obviously I got a big one

460
01:00:41,014 --> 01:00:44,358
Wow? What did you catch? Huh?

461
01:00:44,358 --> 01:00:48,276
A wild boar? A Tiger? Please show me, huh?

462
01:00:59,378 --> 01:01:03,505
Hahaha, Yong?

463
01:01:03,505 --> 01:01:06,588
Whatever

464
01:01:06,588 --> 01:01:12,047
You told me that you were Gyum with your own mouth.

465
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:17,402
Geom, the son of the traitor, Lee Won Ho

466
01:01:20,465 --> 01:01:23,750
You little fool! It's almost lunch time and you are not going to the school?

467
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:27,303
Ah...I am not going, never!

468
01:01:27,303 --> 01:01:28,504
What did you say?

469
01:01:28,504 --> 01:01:32,736
I am going through backbreaking lives to afford your tuition and you don't wanna go to the school?

470
01:01:32,736 --> 01:01:34,127
So you are not going or what?

471
01:01:34,127 --> 01:01:35,337
Please, give me a break!

472
01:01:35,337 --> 01:01:36,482
How dare you!

473
01:01:36,482 --> 01:01:39,058
Why do you bother me so bad, it's still in the morning!

474
01:01:39,058 --> 01:01:40,991
Now get your ass up and wash you face!

475
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:43,448
No. I am not going! Never!

476
01:01:43,448 --> 01:01:50,807
Mom, mom, can I stop going to the school? You know, I won't be able to pass the exam anyway, would I?

477
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:54,313
Oh, get of! You are giving me a bad luck now by blocking the morning table!

478
01:01:54,313 --> 01:01:58,833
Oh, come on, people would think that I am your step-son

479
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:09,580
Anyway, what am I gonna do for today...

480
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:10,559
Let's play with me!

481
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,745
Get off! Oh, come on!

482
01:02:13,745 --> 01:02:22,000
Whenever I am dressed up, those churls bother me....They are just so annoying

483
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,493
Oh, I am so pissed off

484
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:31,430
Excuse me, sir

485
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:33,207
Excuse me

486
01:02:35,193 --> 01:02:41,044
You pathetic guy full of affliction...Wanna see the paradise?

487
01:02:41,044 --> 01:02:41,723
Paradise my ass

488
01:02:41,723 --> 01:02:46,582
Got a killer

489
01:02:46,582 --> 01:02:50,300

Well, it's not for hands

01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:37,899
Oh, my god!!! What is he doing? Oh my god!

563
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:42,124

01:08:46,605 --> 01:08:47,924
Damn it!

566
01:08:50,379 --> 01:08:54,872
You bastard! You know how much it is to rent the brassware factory for a day?

567
01:08:54,872 --> 01:08:59,783
Then why did you pick the sleeping lion's nose, huh?

568
01:08:59,783 --> 01:09:02,187

578
01:09:35,101 --> 01:09:41,135
A mysterious medicine made of virgin's vigor, a carp with golden hair, and a centipede

579

580
01:09:49,024 --> 01:09:50,644

581
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:56,156
Then, all right, exchange?

582
01:09:56,156 --> 01:09:58,237
Fifty more bucks

583
01:09:58,237 --> 01:09:59,499
Fifty?

584
01:09:59,499 --> 01:10:02,190
All right, forget about it

585
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:03,875
The negotiation is over

586
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:08,041
Hey!

587
01:10:09,164 --> 01:10:11,254
Give me back my money!

588
01:10:11,254 --> 01:10:13,353
Rip off my belly!!

589
01:10:13,353 --> 01:10:15,068
You're going to...

590
01:10:16,662 --> 01:10:18,725
What kind of bastard...?

591
01:10:18,725 --> 01:10:20,823
This kind. What are you gonna do about it?

592
01:10:20,823 --> 01:10:22,244
Ah.. father...

593
01:10:22,244 --> 01:10:24,263
Is this school?

594
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:27,398
Ah! Father! My ear's going to rip off!

595
01:10:27,398 --> 01:10:29,070
I'm gonna kill you. Just follow me

596
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:30,428
Aigoo! Father!

597
01:10:30,428 --> 01:10:31,917
Where are you going!

598
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:36,916
Father, I don't want to go to school.

599
01:10:36,916 --> 01:10:38,761
This little rascal, I should just bust your head!

600
01:10:38,761 --> 01:10:40,564
Follow me!

601
01:10:40,564 --> 01:10:42,698
Father... ah, actually...

602
01:10:45,292 --> 01:10:48,818
I... I wanted to buy this for you!

603
01:10:48,818 --> 01:10:51,587
And what is this? Huh?

604
01:10:53,845 --> 01:10:55,493
He's alive?

605
01:10:55,493 --> 01:11:00,861
Yes. A hunter that lives near the southern gate reported it to the authorities.

606
01:11:00,861 --> 01:11:02,977
That can't be...

607
01:11:02,977 --> 01:11:04,936
It doesn't make sense.

608
01:11:04,936 --> 01:11:08,515
That child died 13 years ago...

609
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:12,903
But it seems Shim Ki Hyun has secretly contacted the hunter.

610
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:21,093
Find him first.

611
01:11:21,093 --> 01:11:23,117
And when I do...?

612
01:11:23,117 --> 01:11:25,886
Kill him. Without a trace.

613
01:11:25,886 --> 01:11:27,258
I understand.

614
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,200
(studying chinese)

615
01:11:38,265 --> 01:11:40,645
What is the meaning?

616
01:11:42,735 --> 01:11:44,198
What?!

617
01:11:44,198 --> 01:11:46,706
Hey, over there!

618
01:11:46,706 --> 01:11:48,064
Sit right down!

619
01:11:49,852 --> 01:11:53,597
Ah, Teacher. My son was a bit late.

620
01:11:53,597 --> 01:11:56,476
Aigoo, Swe Dol!

621
01:12:01,048 --> 01:12:04,417
Swe Dol, you came at a good time.

622
01:12:04,417 --> 01:12:06,559
Let's talk for a bit, hmm?

623
01:12:06,559 --> 01:12:08,570
Free study time!

624
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:10,059
Go!

625
01:12:17,355 --> 01:12:20,374
I really didn't want to come,

626
01:12:20,374 --> 01:12:24,374
Ah, but my father just wouldn't let me...

627
01:12:24,374 --> 01:12:26,621
Then I'll be going.

628
01:12:29,306 --> 01:12:33,705
Who said you can just come and go?

629
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:58,943
I thought I told you not to show yourself to me?

630
01:12:58,943 --> 01:13:00,606
Arh!

631
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:07,271
You should behave yourself, in front of a noble!

632
01:13:11,192 --> 01:13:28,186


633
01:13:28,186 --> 01:13:30,210
