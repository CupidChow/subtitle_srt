1
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,976


2
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:39,387
Stand strong on your legs.

3
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:44,187
This is my number one treasure.

4
00:00:45,294 --> 00:00:48,073
Kill him.

5
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:50,724
Why would you get rid of the blade? What kind of sword doesn't have a blade?

6
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,337
Yang Soon.

7
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:01,607
Take him out!

8
00:01:24,738 --> 00:01:28,479
Episode 14

9
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:37,568
Have something to eat.

10
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,026
Here, eat this.

11
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,050
How did it go?

12
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,597
She is not at the inn. 
 She's not?

13
00:02:14,597 --> 00:02:18,139
Then... where was she last night?

14
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,840
Madam, her maid is nowhere to be seen either.

15
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:24,090
But what...?

16
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,069
Tell his lordship right away.

17
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,414
But he's in an emergency. I can't see him.

18
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:35,150
Eun Chae!

19
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,017
The country is ravaged by these rebels.

20
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:39,758
What has happened to you?

21
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,061
What are you doing? Go out and find her right now!

22
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:01,276
I thought you said it was all over.

23
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:03,868
I know but...

24
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:07,060
Well, you know, these lowlifes,

25
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,860
they can be very stubborn.

26
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,845
That's enough!

27
00:03:10,845 --> 00:03:13,691
I will take care of it personally.

28
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,497
That bastard.

29
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,352
I think you will have to help me, Your Majesty.

30
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:34,206
Attacking the place of stay of the Chung envoy

31
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:37,973
is a direct insult to the Chung Emperor.

32
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:43,817
But what power do I have to clam down the angry crowd?

33
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:51,448
Your Majesty, please do not forget that the crown prince in Chung is very popular right now.

34
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,838
The crown prince has a big farming business going on with

35
00:03:55,838 --> 00:04:00,309
Joseon slaves he buys from the Namtak slave market in Shimyang.

36
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:03,527
He makes a lot of money

37
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:08,738
and he is also quite successful in saving the Joseon prisoners made slaves

38
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:11,165
and the Emperor of Chung

39
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:14,498
has made high compliments on how he would make

40
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:19,882
a great King of Joseon if he could.

41
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:22,306
Are you threatening me?

42
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:25,319
Threats and insults against my son and myself

43
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,797
are threats and insults to the Emperor himself.

44
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:33,545
So, Your Majesty,

45
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:37,907
please make sure to deal with that bothersome crowd today.

46
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:40,432
Otherwise... 
 You may go now.

47
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:47,778
All right then, I trust Your Majesty and will take my leave.

48
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:08,732
Call for Byungpan. Right now.

49
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:29,185
Did you bring it?

50
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:33,334
Good job. Nobody followed you?

51
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,805
No. It was quite hard though.

52
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:39,219
What a terrible smell!

53
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,311
What do you have here?

54
00:05:42,246 --> 00:05:43,481
What is that?

55
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:45,840
Open it.

56
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,262
Right now!

57
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:06,088
You go out there.

58
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:10,660
What if I go out and I get hurt?

59
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,773
What about me?

60
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:16,912
You know how to give a good talk with that smooth mouth of yours.

61
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:20,833
Go and show what your mouth can do.

62
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,216
No.

63
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,333
I don't want to tell lies.

64
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,702
Lies?

65
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,884
You jerk!

66
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:31,252
Guard Byun.

67
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:34,226
It's an order.

68
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:37,986
You're just a guard. If you disobey orders from your superior

69
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,300
you know what happens, right?

70
00:06:41,898 --> 00:06:43,865
Give us the envoy from Chung!

71
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:48,699
Let him out!

72
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:00,438
Calm down!

73
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:05,334
His lordship will soon explain himself to you.

74
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:19,569
Why are you the one out?

75
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:22,213
It just happened.

76
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:24,845
That's not the judge. He's just a guard.

77
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:29,143
I will tell the truth about this incident instead of the judge.

78
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:35,623
This incident is a simple accident.

79
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:40,739
He shouted to the child to move away but the child didn't hear him

80
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:43,279
and that is how this unfortunate accident happened.

81
00:07:43,826 --> 00:07:47,251
What? Just an unfortunate accident?

82
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:50,318
He saw Yang Soon but he didn't stop his horse.

83
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:53,959
I saw it with my very own two eyes.

84
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:58,155
He didn't even tell her to move away!

85
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:04,180
Go back to your homes right away.

86
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:10,551
If you don't go home, everyone will be imprisoned

87
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:12,439
and you will be severely punished, old or young, man or woman.

88
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:18,499
Orders of Judge Byun.

89
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,038
Move away, Guard!

90
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:23,327
You're just a stupid guard, what are you doing out here?

91
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,492
Tell Jung Chi Hong to come out!

92
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:28,779
If he has nothing to hide, tell him to come outside and explain himself directly to us.

93
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:43,633
Tell Jung Chi Hong to come out!

94
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:45,443
What the hell is the King doing?

95
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:47,675
Is he that scared of Jung Myung Soo?

96
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:50,386
True!

97
00:08:57,994 --> 00:09:01,616
True! True!

98
00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:03,049
Tell him to come out!

99
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:07,092
Come out, you rat!

100
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,441
Well well, Miss, you're here too!

101
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:34,764
How come you came to this humble place?

102
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:39,882
Wow, whatever you wear is fine on you.

103
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:44,418
Anyways, what a nice surprise to see you here.

104
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:48,943
I'm telling  you, it's destiny, for the both of us.

105
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,767
Good job.

106
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:07,627
But you could have done better.

107
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:11,033
They're even louder now.

108
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:17,511
I told you to calm them down.

109
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:20,592
My sincere apologies, Your Majesty.

110
00:10:20,592 --> 00:10:25,098
I did try to calm them down, like you told me...

111
00:10:25,098 --> 00:10:28,875
but they are such a foolish crowd that does not understand common sense.

112
00:10:30,452 --> 00:10:35,876
They are so foolish we would have to throw horse excrement at them or something.

113
00:10:43,378 --> 00:10:46,225
There's nothing to be done. Let's just get over with it.

114
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:50,523
Horse excrement?

115
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:54,009
Well, the thing is...

116
00:10:54,985 --> 00:10:58,112
Yes, but

117
00:10:58,112 --> 00:11:01,644
there's nothing you should worry about.

118
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:04,652
What if they are dry?

119
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:08,730
Well, dry horse droppings...

120
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,752
Well, dry horse excrement

121
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:14,809
is quite flammable

122
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:17,598
but wet ones

123
00:11:17,598 --> 00:11:22,006
just stink bad and do not catch fire that easily.

124
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:24,811
Is that so?

125
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:28,386
It may be nothing, but to make gunpowder

126
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:31,451
sometimes people use dry horse excrement.

127
00:11:34,812 --> 00:11:36,526
Gunpowder?

128
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:44,646
It stinks!

129
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:49,811
You should have brought dry ones instead!

130
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:53,411
Hey, it is in this state that they stink longer. You know nothing.

131
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:58,592
True true. If they get hit by this, they will stink like horse droppings for days.

132
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,750
Their wives will avoid them for three four days at least.

133
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,586
You slick bastard. Ever since your wife left you, you get yourself weird ideas.

134
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:10,232
What? You jerk. I'm going to shove this in your mouth.

135
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:12,075
What?

136
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:14,576
You look like horse dropping yourself.

137
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:16,668
What? I look like horse dropping?

138
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:20,165
Stop it! 
 No!

139
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,334
Byung pan, say what you have to say.

140
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,471
What did they bring?

141
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:31,628
Well Your Majesty

142
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:34,068
the thing is...

143
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:40,824
I heard that they brought dry, really dry horse excrement.

144
00:12:40,824 --> 00:12:42,461
Dry excrement, you say?

145
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:44,577
Yes, Your Majesty.

146
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:50,034
Well, if you lit fire on these dry horse excrement...

147
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:52,500
Boom!

148
00:12:54,179 --> 00:13:00,176
They will transform into horrible bombs

149
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:03,964
and they will explode the Chung envoys and all their guards as well.

150
00:13:08,428 --> 00:13:12,636
Your Majesty, this is not a simple rebellion.

151
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:16,258
People all over the country are bringing horse droppings

152
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:26,542
I mean horse excrement, in their carriage, and gathering around the Chung envoy house.

153
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:31,961
Your Majesty, you cannot stay silent any longer. 
 That is true.

154
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:34,937
Your Majesty, this is a revolt.

155
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:41,103
A revolt? 
 Yes Your Majesty!

156
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,845
This is all my fault.

157
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:49,789
That is utter nonsense Your Majesty.

158
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:54,170
They already have very dangerous weapons.

159
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,280
If you leave them like this

160
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,320
the country will be in absolute chaos.

161
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,318
Then what should I do?

162
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:10,262
Your Majesty, please make a decision.

163
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:13,550
It's all my fault. All my mistakes.

164
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:00,538
Father

165
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:03,782
Mother

166
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,646
Brother

167
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:58,353
I came a bit late this year.

168
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:07,454
Bong Soon is doing fine.

169
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:05,503
What are we supposed to do with this?

170
00:17:05,503 --> 00:17:10,004
Just throw them! 
 Geez, the things we have to do!

171
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:37,876
But how?

172
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:42,527
I will find it out.

173
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:47,927
Hey, sir!

174
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:51,188
Yong!

175
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:54,817
Hey! What is this smell?

176
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:58,808
How have you been?

177
00:17:58,808 --> 00:18:01,747
I couldn't see you yesterday.

178
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:05,220
You stay right next to me, ok?

179
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,299
Geez, I'm always so popular.

180
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:11,084
But the thing is, I'm such a dutiful son...

181
00:18:12,523 --> 00:18:14,079
Your parents are here too?

182
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,761
Yes, over there.

183
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:21,722
Take them out of here. Right now!

184
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:23,605
Something big is going to happen!

185
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:25,902
What? Why?

186
00:18:31,037 --> 00:18:32,233
Yong.

187
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:35,465
What are you doing over there? Come here!

188
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:37,324
Come on!

189
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,047
Yes...

190
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,804
Yong, I'm not lying.

191
00:18:42,804 --> 00:18:44,464
Get out of here!

192
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:47,659
Come here!

193
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,302
Hey! Don't hang out with guys like him!

194
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:56,445
Come!

195
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:59,585
Don't let go of my hand. You stay right next to me.

196
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,326
It's going to be a mess.

197
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:13,878
Eun Chae!

198
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:21,113
No! Eun Chae! She's going to die if she stays there!

199
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:25,886
What do you mean, she's going to die?

200
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:27,175
Let me go! Eun Chae!

201
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:33,391
Let me go! Let me go!

202
00:19:34,537 --> 00:19:35,883
Miss!

203
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:43,471
Get inside!

204
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,182
You stay right behind me.

205
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:11,560
Yong!

206
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:13,635
What?

207
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:17,030
Dan! Have you seen our Yong?

208
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,590
Did he go somewhere?

209
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,797
I told him to hold my hand tight!

210
00:20:21,797 --> 00:20:23,983
But he isn't here anymore.

211
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:25,544
Yong!

212
00:20:25,544 --> 00:20:27,629
Yong!

213
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:29,529
Yong!

214
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:33,194
Here, horse poop! Grab one each.

215
00:20:33,194 --> 00:20:35,672
We're going to stop them with this.

216
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:37,821
Here!

217
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,544
You're going to see what it's like to be hit with horse poop!

218
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:48,294
We're going to throw it at you!

219
00:20:54,306 --> 00:20:55,086
One!

220
00:20:58,073 --> 00:20:59,466
Two!

221
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:05,917
Your Majesty, this incident is not a simple rebellion.

222
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:10,260
It's a tumult and a revolution that wants to destroy this country.

223
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,435
If they were to throw bombs at us, what are we going to do?

224
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:16,166
What do you want me to do?

225
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:21,053
I don't want the people or the soldiers to get hurt.

226
00:21:36,482 --> 00:21:38,604
Get back!

227
00:21:38,604 --> 00:21:40,453
Three!

228
00:21:42,828 --> 00:21:45,693
I am afraid that these soldiers, in their youth,

229
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:49,431
might actually shoot at them.

230
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:57,626
Wait!

231
00:22:18,698 --> 00:22:21,685
Chi Hong!

232
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:46,083
It's Iljimae!

233
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:49,150
Iljimae!

234
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,158
Iljimae!

235
00:22:50,158 --> 00:22:51,437
Iljimae!

236
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:52,843
Aim!

237
00:22:54,682 --> 00:22:57,329
No! Don't shoot!

238
00:22:57,329 --> 00:23:00,426
Withdraw your bows!

239
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:03,490
Shoot!

240
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:34,184
Catch him!

241
00:27:14,788 --> 00:27:17,100
Unchain Jung Chi Hong!

242
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,185
What's wrong?

243
00:28:00,498 --> 00:28:01,690
Nothing.

244
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:25,741
You jerk! Have a taste of horse droppings!

245
00:28:34,434 --> 00:28:36,904
Pull him down!

246
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:43,801
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

247
00:28:46,504 --> 00:28:47,758
Say it yourself.

248
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:50,025
Tell us the truth.

249
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:54,090
Yes. I was drunk, and I was on my horse

250
00:28:55,304 --> 00:28:56,849
I was running through the South Gate

251
00:28:56,849 --> 00:29:00,705
and this little girl was just sitting there so...

252
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,730
I tried to jump over her

253
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,283
and I ran away because I was scared.

254
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:15,671
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

255
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,519
Say sorry to my daughter.

256
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,370
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

257
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,779
Kill him!

258
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:31,438
Stop. If we kill a weak man

259
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,966
then we'll be the same

260
00:29:33,966 --> 00:29:37,465
as this man and the others.

261
00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:40,373
Still, a guy like him deserves to die!

262
00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:43,202
True! Apologies are not enough!

263
00:29:43,737 --> 00:29:47,636
The reason we are like this is because the king is too weak!

264
00:29:47,636 --> 00:29:50,822
It's true! They aimed at us to kill us!

265
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,891
They tried to kill us!

266
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:57,690
How can they do this to innocent people?

267
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,966
True! We won't let him go

268
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:03,397
until the king apologizes himself!

269
00:30:05,364 --> 00:30:10,176
King? Yeah right! We don't need a king like that.

270
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:14,921
Now, our king is Iljimae! Yes, Iljimae!

271
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:17,422
Yes! Iljimae is the king!

272
00:30:17,422 --> 00:30:22,215
Everyone! Let's send Iljimae to the palace!

273
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,070
Your Majesty.

274
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,085
For now

275
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,254
appeasing the people and their anger

276
00:30:40,254 --> 00:30:42,977
is the most urgent thing to do.

277
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:47,979
Yes sir. If this incident is not peacefully over

278
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:51,252
But that doesn't mean we can turn our back to Jung Myung Soo.

279
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:55,944
If we turn against him and Chung doesn't see it with a good eye...

280
00:30:55,944 --> 00:30:57,300
But Your Majesty

281
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,295
if you don't appease the people now

282
00:31:00,295 --> 00:31:03,347
a national rebellion will occur

283
00:31:03,347 --> 00:31:07,005
and if that is the case, Jung Myung Soo won't have to report it

284
00:31:07,005 --> 00:31:10,310
the Chung Empire will know it anyways.

285
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:14,133
That's why appeasing the people

286
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:17,998
is the most urgent thing to do, your Majesty.

287
00:31:17,998 --> 00:31:21,909
Scribe Hong, bring me something to write.

288
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:27,018
Iljimae! Iljimae!

289
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,036
Move away!

290
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:29,771
I have a message from the king.

291
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:43,441
We have an order from the king.

292
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:53,278
Since we now know clearly what happened

293
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,297
I cannot let this pass by.

294
00:31:56,297 --> 00:32:01,133
I will give Jung Chi Hong the punishment that he deserves.

295
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:06,917
I convey my sincere condolences to the child who has unfortunately been the victim

296
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:09,016
and to her parents

297
00:32:09,016 --> 00:32:13,547
I will give them 30 silver coins and 20 silk rolls.

298
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,044
Tell the king this.

299
00:32:16,044 --> 00:32:19,332
We don't need any silver or silk

300
00:32:19,332 --> 00:32:22,962
just make sure that the criminal gets the punishment he deserves for killing.

301
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:25,670
True! Yes!

302
00:32:31,002 --> 00:32:33,777
I am very angry.

303
00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:38,053
How can they oppress my poor people

304
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:40,431
and how did it come to

305
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:43,593
have guards aiming arrows at them?

306
00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:46,185
I am very upset and devastated.

307
00:32:46,185 --> 00:32:48,179
I will find out the soldiers

308
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:51,411
that aimed at my people

309
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:55,422
and they will get the punishment they deserve.

310
00:32:56,316 --> 00:33:00,322
Do you think we're stupid or what?

311
00:33:00,322 --> 00:33:04,591
Iljimae!

312
00:33:58,054 --> 00:33:58,817
Father.

313
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,426
Yong, where were you last night?

314
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:10,425
I was back there! Father! You let go of my hand!

315
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:14,569
But fortunately, I knew where to hide.

316
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:20,370
Hey but that guy, Iljimae or something, was amazing! I was impressed!

317
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,539
He was awesome!

318
00:34:26,985 --> 00:34:28,359
What is this?

319
00:34:29,357 --> 00:34:31,499
it's not for your mother, is it?

320
00:34:31,499 --> 00:34:34,338
It was for Yang Soon.

321
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,700
I found it on the streets on my way here.

322
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:41,108
But where is mother?

323
00:34:42,273 --> 00:34:44,037
Dan!

324
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:46,661
Dan!

325
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:09,506
No, it can't be.

326
00:35:10,504 --> 00:35:12,642
It can't be.

327
00:35:18,472 --> 00:35:21,464
What the? Why did he put this here?

328
00:36:44,483 --> 00:36:46,282
Yang Soon!

329
00:38:39,426 --> 00:38:40,668
Oh my god.

330
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:48,262
What to do...

331
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,046
What am I going to do?

332
00:39:00,617 --> 00:39:05,577
He remembers it all...

333
00:39:07,259 --> 00:39:09,628
What am I going to do?

334
00:39:09,628 --> 00:39:14,341
He's looking for his father's murderer!

335
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:21,645
What about me and Ja Dol?

336
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:28,400
What am I going to do?

337
00:39:30,128 --> 00:39:32,483
What am I going to do?

338
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:08,963
It's all over now, so be at peace.

339
00:40:08,963 --> 00:40:13,405
We had a hard time convincing the king.

340
00:40:14,685 --> 00:40:17,540
These stupid lowlifes!

341
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,364
I was ashamed to be from Joseon.

342
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:24,992
Lord Oh, you don't have to do this.

343
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:27,304
I didn't come from a noble family either.

344
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:30,892
That's not what I meant...

345
00:40:32,704 --> 00:40:33,720
It's quite all right.

346
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,080
I hear that you are also quite interested in pottery?

347
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,301
I have an openwork white porcelain in the shape of a lotus in my house.

348
00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:44,536
Oh, an openwork?

349
00:40:44,536 --> 00:40:47,273
How did you get that precious item?

350
00:40:47,273 --> 00:40:49,891
I hear that you were also very interested in painting.

351
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:53,282
In my house, I have a famous painting.

352
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:58,666
In my house, I have a 300-year old ginseng.

353
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:02,985
If this goes smoothly

354
00:41:02,985 --> 00:41:05,715
Sir Oh, Sir Jung, Sir Kim,

355
00:41:05,715 --> 00:41:08,841
I will not forget your sincerity.

356
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,675
Not at all.

357
00:41:46,353 --> 00:41:47,480
What is this?

358
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:50,829
Did he rob these people's houses?

359
00:41:51,844 --> 00:41:53,471
What did he write?

360
00:41:53,471 --> 00:41:56,109
You stupid fool! Why can't I read?

361
00:41:56,728 --> 00:41:59,278
You're a blind guy!

362
00:42:39,085 --> 00:42:40,179
Drink!

363
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:44,458
Why are you wearing this? It's out of fashion.

364
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:45,848
Get rid of this!

365
00:42:46,936 --> 00:42:50,208
Didn't you see Iljimae yesterday? He had steel armor!

366
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:53,208
Don't worry, I asked Heung Kyul anyways.

367
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:56,688
He said he was going to give me an armor in steel today.

368
00:42:56,688 --> 00:42:59,155
I was so impressed.

369
00:42:59,155 --> 00:43:01,999
We got beaten up so bad, but still, people weren't afraid.

370
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:04,252
There were even more people than yesterday.

371
00:43:04,252 --> 00:43:06,766
Where did they all come from anyways?

372
00:43:06,766 --> 00:43:09,797
I know! They are pissed, so they make their way here.

373
00:43:09,797 --> 00:43:14,388
The noblemen are busy stealing from the government.

374
00:43:14,388 --> 00:43:16,797
The regional offices are using

375
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:19,511
meat and drinks in their storage to party everyday.

376
00:43:19,511 --> 00:43:20,463
I wish that was all.

377
00:43:20,463 --> 00:43:24,232
They keep storing the missing money by the blood and sweat of the people.

378
00:43:24,232 --> 00:43:27,474
Exactly! Although I'm not a nobleman...

379
00:43:27,474 --> 00:43:29,945
They declare themselves to be slaves to escape from the taxes

380
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:32,852
or they just wander around the country without anywhere to go.

381
00:43:32,852 --> 00:43:34,794
If you go outside of the city's walls,

382
00:43:34,794 --> 00:43:37,354
there are many people dying of hunger, I hear.

383
00:43:37,354 --> 00:43:40,728
They all gathered during this rebellion because they were angry.

384
00:43:40,728 --> 00:43:42,031
It's what the people want.

385
00:43:42,031 --> 00:43:45,998
They realized this time how scary it is, once people get their minds to it.

386
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,986
The trend these days is Iljimae.

387
00:43:48,986 --> 00:43:52,688
Iljimae! 
 My hero, Iljimae!

388
00:43:52,688 --> 00:43:55,106
In troubled times like this, we need a hero.

389
00:43:55,106 --> 00:43:55,770
Of course.

390
00:43:58,712 --> 00:44:03,109
Dae Shik, in troubled times like this, we need food!

391
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:05,492
Go and get me some rice.

392
00:44:06,092 --> 00:44:08,781
What a disastrous thing, Your Majesty.

393
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:13,040
They dare call that burglar the king.

394
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,978
I can't even bear to say it with my own mouth.

395
00:44:18,312 --> 00:44:19,568
The King...

396
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:23,884
What a terrible thing that has fallen upon us.

397
00:44:23,884 --> 00:44:26,874
I am so ashamed.

398
00:44:26,874 --> 00:44:29,046
They can't catch one single thief

399
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:31,770
what is it that you're doing at the office?

400
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:36,031
Do you even know how much money you're spending?

401
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:37,859
What?

402
00:44:38,725 --> 00:44:40,173
Hey, look here Lord Gongpan.

403
00:44:40,173 --> 00:44:44,189
Do you think I'm not catching him because I don't want to?

404
00:44:44,189 --> 00:44:46,759
If you're that ashamed

405
00:44:46,759 --> 00:44:49,203
then you go yourself

406
00:44:49,203 --> 00:44:52,106
and you try to catch him!

407
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,359
Seriously!

408
00:44:54,447 --> 00:44:56,813
According to the rumors

409
00:44:56,813 --> 00:44:58,551
your daughter

410
00:44:58,551 --> 00:45:01,995
was among the rebels.

411
00:45:01,995 --> 00:45:04,247
What?

412
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:10,075
Are you out of your mind?

413
00:45:11,121 --> 00:45:13,293
Look here Lord Gongpan!

414
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,897
Do you think you can say anything?

415
00:45:14,897 --> 00:45:18,762
Did you see it yourself? Did you?

416
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:28,181
I thought there was a fly on your face.

417
00:45:28,713 --> 00:45:32,236
I thought I had heard some flies.

418
00:45:36,013 --> 00:45:38,585
Oh my, did I surprise you all?

419
00:45:39,274 --> 00:45:44,355
I have this habit of throwing this when I'm catching flies.

420
00:45:47,715 --> 00:45:51,220
Don't just stay here. Go out and catch that thief.

421
00:45:52,972 --> 00:45:54,834
But don't kill him.

422
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:59,035
You must drag him in front of me.

423
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:04,278
Why is he behaving like that?

424
00:46:04,278 --> 00:46:07,320
What flies can there be in this place?

425
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,973
You really don't know, do you?

426
00:46:09,973 --> 00:46:12,373
Look at you...

427
00:46:12,373 --> 00:46:16,870
You must read between the lines and into His Majesty's heart.

428
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:22,113
The flies he heard, he meant us.

429
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:23,583
What?

430
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:29,344
He threw that ink stone at us.

431
00:46:29,344 --> 00:46:32,954
It was only an ink stone because he is the King

432
00:46:32,954 --> 00:46:34,597
but imagine if it were us!

433
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:40,382
Gongpan, did you see?

434
00:46:40,382 --> 00:46:43,175
Did you actually see her? Did you?

435
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,473
I'm asking you, did you see her?

436
00:46:46,468 --> 00:46:50,000
I spoil you, care for you

437
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,794
and you embarrass me like this?

438
00:46:52,794 --> 00:46:54,156
All right.

439
00:46:57,805 --> 00:46:58,950
Oh my. Oh my.

440
00:46:59,757 --> 00:47:03,644
You foolish girl. You're such a pretty and weak girl.

441
00:47:03,644 --> 00:47:07,791
How dare you be among these thugs? Aren't you even scared?

442
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:10,018
How were they dangerous?

443
00:47:10,018 --> 00:47:13,072
Was it the horse dropping in their hands that made them so dangerous?

444
00:47:13,072 --> 00:47:16,378
What was it that scared you so? What?

445
00:47:20,627 --> 00:47:22,007
Who is it?

446
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,788
Who told the soldiers to shoot at them?

447
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:29,801
Was it you? Did you order it?

448
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,196
It's not me! No! It wasn't me!

449
00:47:34,057 --> 00:47:35,792
Look at her, she doesn't believe me.

450
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:37,671
I'm telling you, it wasn't me!

451
00:47:38,251 --> 00:47:40,961
All right.

452
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:42,503
All right. Just go inside and get some rest.

453
00:47:43,383 --> 00:47:47,122
And you are forbidden to go out of the house ever again!

454
00:47:47,122 --> 00:47:48,042
Go!

455
00:47:56,062 --> 00:47:57,891
Iljimae has come back

456
00:47:57,891 --> 00:48:01,489
and he will definitely target houses of the Cheon-woo club.

457
00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:04,328
Yes, indeed.

458
00:48:05,568 --> 00:48:07,389
That stupid Cheon-woo club.

459
00:48:08,226 --> 00:48:11,233
This time we won't let him escape.

460
00:48:12,127 --> 00:48:15,299
You go and tell the others to gather up for a meeting.

461
00:48:19,544 --> 00:48:20,850
Ajussi.

462
00:48:22,953 --> 00:48:24,378
Is there something wrong?

463
00:48:25,557 --> 00:48:26,724
No one's here?

464
00:48:26,724 --> 00:48:27,797
No.

465
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:32,927
Here, read this for me, will you?

466
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:36,035
What is this? 
 Just read it! Quick!

467
00:48:39,913 --> 00:48:42,969
I think these are names...but the handwriting...

468
00:48:42,969 --> 00:48:44,479
So who are they?

469
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:46,294
Who are these people?

470
00:48:47,238 --> 00:48:48,924
Who are they?

471
00:48:48,924 --> 00:48:55,429
Oh, they ordered some locks, but I can't find their houses with just this.

472
00:48:56,191 --> 00:48:58,408
Just read. So, who wants my locks?

473
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:01,990
Oh Gap Soo.

474
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:04,952
Sa Gwan Woong, Jin Moon Han.

475
00:49:06,391 --> 00:49:09,186
Jung Hyung Gu.

476
00:49:09,772 --> 00:49:13,983
Hong Gwan Boo Jae Hak.

477
00:49:15,046 --> 00:49:19,540
Seung Jung Won, Do Seung Ji

478
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,017
Lord Kim Woo Jin

479
00:49:22,017 --> 00:49:24,673
Wow, you have some orders from some rich men!

480
00:49:24,673 --> 00:49:28,706
Oh Gap Soo, Jung Hyung Goo, Kim Woo Jin?

481
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:33,297
You know I only deal with these kinds of people. Didn't you know?

482
00:49:33,297 --> 00:49:35,120
Thanks.

483
00:49:40,118 --> 00:49:43,146
There are no nobleman's house that is safe from Iljimae these days.

484
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,653
So I'm installing them in advance.

485
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:49,071
This is a lock I recently invented.

486
00:49:49,371 --> 00:49:53,112
Iljimae? This won't budge a bit.

487
00:49:53,112 --> 00:49:55,785
Really? Then what about the money?

488
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:56,586
Don't worry about it.

489
00:49:57,357 --> 00:50:01,606
Just make sure to tell about me to the others. 
 All right then.

490
00:50:05,082 --> 00:50:07,935
I will make sure he never steals again.

491
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:10,991
Never again.

492
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:36,421
That black rat

493
00:50:36,421 --> 00:50:38,474
has come back.

494
00:50:38,474 --> 00:50:42,865
Everyone will be on a stake out tonight. 
 Team 1!

495
00:50:43,732 --> 00:50:45,206
Lord Kim Yoo's household.

496
00:50:45,206 --> 00:50:46,610
Team 2! 
Yes!

497
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,336
Lord Hong Seo Beom's household.

498
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,800
Team 3! 
 Yes!

499
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,742
Lord Choi Nae Gil's household.

500
00:50:51,742 --> 00:50:52,987
Team 4!

501
00:50:55,466 --> 00:50:57,675
Father! What are you doing?

502
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:01,349
It's me, Yong! I'm not Dan!

503
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:05,334
Come on, I only have one son.

504
00:51:07,118 --> 00:51:09,035
You know how much I love you, right?

505
00:51:09,135 --> 00:51:10,396
I don't know anything!

506
00:51:11,726 --> 00:51:14,025
Come here!

507
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,536
You'd better get here when I'm still nice!

508
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:20,546
That little brat!

509
00:52:20,613 --> 00:52:25,208
Damn it! It's cold and all, and he makes us work at night!

510
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:28,592
Am I right or what?

511
00:52:28,992 --> 00:52:30,043
Yes you are.

512
00:52:30,043 --> 00:52:31,882
What are you saying?

513
00:54:19,921 --> 00:54:21,784
So, this is 300 years old?

514
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:08,706
This will go to Lord Jung, so wrap it up carefully as soon as the sun rises.

515
00:55:08,706 --> 00:55:10,108
Yes, sir.

516
00:56:43,075 --> 00:56:46,260
Why did you block this door?

517
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:50,688
We don't use that door. We only use the other one, so leave it like that.

518
00:56:50,688 --> 00:56:54,369
I see. All right, I'll have it done soon, so you can go ahead attend your other business.

519
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,202
All right, then. Call me when you're done.

520
00:57:13,065 --> 00:57:19,988
We never know, so I need to make sure that my boy can at least escape.

521
00:57:31,867 --> 00:57:34,666
You brat...

522
00:57:35,914 --> 00:57:38,977
I'm going to ...

523
00:57:42,165 --> 00:57:44,296
No no no.

524
00:57:45,173 --> 00:57:49,399
You can't steal. No.

525
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,976
No, no, no.

526
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:15,350


527
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,785
