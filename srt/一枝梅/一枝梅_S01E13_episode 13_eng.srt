1
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,800


2
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:41,892
Tell me how to fight!

3
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:42,858
Please master!

4
00:00:44,017 --> 00:00:45,017
Teach me.

5
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:47,725
You can't leave! You have to take me with you!

6
00:00:47,725 --> 00:00:49,642
There's someone I need to get hold of.

7
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:52,392
I can't die until I complete it.

8
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:59,683
I hear Iljimae is nowhere to be seen these days.

9
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:03,183
I don't think Iljimae's purpose is to steal.

10
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:13,392
What was your belief in justice?

11
00:01:13,392 --> 00:01:17,350
There's no belief or justice to killers.

12
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,608
He is the justice I believe in.

13
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,017
Yes yes, thank you.

14
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:30,517
We will soon begin.

15
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,717
Thank you.

16
00:01:38,717 --> 00:01:41,683
I know you must all be busy,

17
00:01:41,683 --> 00:01:44,017
so I thank you very much for coming

18
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:48,892
to what is going to be the best inn in town.

19
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:53,267
Let us first hear some announcement.

20
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:56,892
Eun Chae, go ahead and explain to them.

21
00:01:56,892 --> 00:01:58,267
Yes.

22
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,433
So far, in every inn,

23
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:09,142
they only had some wood to make fire and some water

24
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:11,892
travelers had some difficult time

25
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:15,225
carrying all their pots and pans.

26
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:19,308
However at our inn, we have everything at your disposal.

27
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:22,683
So from now on, your body is all you need to carry around.

28
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,308
Plus, in every room of our inn,

29
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:31,517
we put on a floor heating system, so we took care of the cold and the humidity issues.

30
00:02:32,058 --> 00:02:36,475
It will be the perfect inn even for the sick ones.

31
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:43,517
So please take a look around as comfortably as you want.

32
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:47,892
A large room, a cozy heated floor system,

33
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:51,100
the view is superb and the transportation means are also convenient.

34
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,292
We offer you the best quality. Keum-nu kak!

35
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:59,767
Take a look around please! Thank you.

36
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,933
My my, I had no idea you would honor us with your presence.

37
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:12,517
Your presence, dear envoys from Chung, in this humble place,

38
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:15,183
the words fail me to thank you.

39
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,392
If you need a room, just say the words.

40
00:03:18,392 --> 00:03:21,350
We will serve you for free as long as you want.

41
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,475
We have everything ready for you of course.

42
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:32,725
Look at you again! You really have a thing for horses.

43
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:36,392
Look at how he shines! He must be of a good breed.

44
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:38,850
Do you like it?

45
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:47,183
I knew it, you are no ordinary woman.

46
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:50,475
I can see you like horses

47
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:55,142
so, what do you say, would you like to have a fun ride with me?

48
00:03:55,142 --> 00:03:57,850
I am very well-known for my speed.

49
00:03:58,517 --> 00:04:00,975
Please bring some salt.

50
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:01,892
I'm sorry?

51
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:04,933
I think we may have some bad spirits in this inn.

52
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:13,683
Look at all his facial grease.

53
00:04:13,683 --> 00:04:16,933
I would rather have anyone from the Castor Oil gang with grease in their hair.

54
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,017
When he was here all the time, he was so annoying,

55
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:24,142
but now that he doesn't show up anymore, I kind of miss him.

56
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,392
You are also a bit curious, aren't you?

57
00:04:29,992 --> 00:04:32,933
What? 
 Apparently he's gone to the mountains to study.

58
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:36,017
There's something missing I feel,

59
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:38,725
maybe his charm did manage

60
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:40,058
to get me after all.

61
00:04:46,175 --> 00:04:49,225
What about Iljimae? Still no news?

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,100
Nothing. I only hear strange rumors.

63
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,808
That he's dead, that he's gone to Chung.

64
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,642
Without Iljimae, life has gotten so boring!

65
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,350
As fast as  you can!

66
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,017
You musn't let your opponent escape you or stop you.

67
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:52,842
If your opponent is in your space, then you're dead.

68
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:57,975
We're not done yet!

69
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,692
It's over.

70
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,914
I won!

71
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,622
Yong wins!

72
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,625
It's not an attack to kill.

73
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,617
It's an attack to live and to let live.

74
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:57,212
That's how you should attack.

75
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:29,928
Brother.

76
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:32,844
It's so hard to see you these days.

77
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:38,317
Are you still upset with me?

78
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,228
Why would I be upset with you?

79
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:46,521
You may go.

80
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,427
Please teach me how to shoot arrows.

81
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:59,842
Actually, I've really wanted to learn.

82
00:07:59,842 --> 00:08:04,343
You also taught me how to ride horses.

83
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:37,400
Do you know how dangerous this is?

84
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,701
Aren't you even afraid?

85
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:42,213
If it's dangerous, you teach me then.

86
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:51,788
Here.

87
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:56,172
You've had it with you all this time?

88
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,465
Straighten your back.

89
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:07,647
Stand looking at the aim in front.

90
00:09:08,354 --> 00:09:10,447
Stand strong on your legs.

91
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,369
When you reach this point, you have to stop breathing.

92
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:27,819
Do I shoot now?

93
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:29,227
Shoot.

94
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:35,997
I may have well been a general in my past life!

95
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:43,371
You're really ok now, right?

96
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,894
Ajussi!

97
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:08,416
Master.

98
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:12,294
Where is this liar again?

99
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:28,553
Who the hell is it?

100
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:32,785
I'm going to kill you if I catch you!

101
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,050
Make sure not to let your opponent know where your arrow comes from.

102
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,624
That way they will never know where you really are.

103
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,877
It's a sword I've used for a long time.

104
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:29,319
Use it

105
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,612
to kill anyone standing in your way.

106
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:34,235
That person may be your friend or your enemy, but kill him.

107
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,419
That's what a sword is for.

108
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:39,799
What is this?

109
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,534
What do you think? It's a sword.

110
00:11:41,845 --> 00:11:43,817
This is my most beloved treasure.

111
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:48,328
I made a special request to remove the blade.

112
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:53,211
What? Why would you do that? What kind of sword doesn't have a blade?

113
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:55,552
Well, here's one!

114
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,999
You used to call me 'master'

115
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,478
and now that you have no use of me anymore, it's back to 'ajussi'?

116
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,759
Yong.

117
00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:12,641
There are two kinds of sword in this world.

118
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:16,374
One to kill others.

119
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:25,828
And on the other hand, one to save others.

120
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:32,047
I hope that you will never have to hold a sword in your life.

121
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:35,175
But if, if you have to use it

122
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:37,144
then use it to save the world.

123
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:40,524
You must use it for a good cause, to save others.

124
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:41,901
Do you understand?

125
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:46,398
I'm asking if you understood!

126
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:50,658
Yes, yes... all right, ajussi.

127
00:12:55,723 --> 00:12:57,444
Even without a blade

128
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:00,735
if you really want it, it can be a sword to kill others.

129
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:04,255
Killing people

130
00:13:04,823 --> 00:13:06,448
is not about what weapon you use.

131
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:09,496
It's your heart.

132
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,588
Father.

133
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:33,780
I will remember what you told me.

134
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,107
I will never forget.

135
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:49,440
You're really not coming?

136
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,411
I'm telling you, I'm going to enjoy a bit more of this paradise.

137
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:57,104
I was in such a mess because of you all this time.

138
00:13:57,104 --> 00:14:00,297
Come on, you want Myung Wol again, don't you?

139
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,441
Have a good time!

140
00:14:07,441 --> 00:14:11,791
I will tell Shim Duk that you're having ample meditation.

141
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,545
You little rascal!

142
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:20,552
By the way, is the thief still wrecking havoc over there?

143
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:23,334
Oh, the righteous Iljimae?

144
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,126
It's been a while he hasn't made an appearance!

145
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:28,102
There are rumors he might be dead.

146
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:29,787
Righteous? Right!

147
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,997
I really think he's looking for something else.

148
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,831
Stealing and distributing it around

149
00:14:41,332 --> 00:14:44,678
is just a stupid scheme to hide what he really wants!

150
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:51,042
What are you saying?

151
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:53,575
What do you think? I'm just saying stupid stuff.

152
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:57,483
You lose some, you gain some in life.

153
00:14:58,601 --> 00:14:59,572
Woof woof!

154
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:04,186
Go!

155
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:11,713
You lose some and you gain some in life.

156
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:27,844
Ajussi! Yong is coming!

157
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:32,262
Ajussi, Yong is coming back, he is!

158
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:36,436
Ajussi, Yong is coming back, Yong!

159
00:15:37,747 --> 00:15:40,917
Yong is coming back!

160
00:15:42,895 --> 00:15:45,362
Oh come on, why don't you buy some!

161
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:55,097
Oh come on, put out the good stuff! It's not like this is your first time selling them.

162
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:58,098
You impatient girl! Just wait a little bit.

163
00:15:58,098 --> 00:16:00,180
Geez.

164
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:05,313
So you're happy, huh?

165
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:11,398
Why? It's pretty, isn't it? It's a present from my husband.

166
00:16:13,261 --> 00:16:14,476
Your husband?

167
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:17,354
You little brat!

168
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:28,059
We're going to have a tour of the village!

169
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:30,238
There are so many people around. Do you think it will be all right?

170
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:34,450
Hey, the more obstacles there are, the more fun we'll have riding!

171
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,301
Still, something could happen.

172
00:16:37,857 --> 00:16:39,366
Do you know who my father is?

173
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:42,410
Even the king of this country can't say peep in front of him.

174
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,084
He's the envoy of the great Chung Empire!

175
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:52,915
Just trust me and we'll have the ride of our lives!

176
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:03,913
Don't mess around with him.

177
00:17:03,913 --> 00:17:07,907
What did you say?

178
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:11,382
No matter how much you try to seduce him

179
00:17:11,382 --> 00:17:14,464
Yong is bound to come to me.

180
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:19,012
You little brat, you're still fresh from your mother's womb! We shall see then!

181
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:21,083
We'll see who becomes Yong's wife.

182
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:25,474
People who say 'we shall see later', they're actually not that scary or threatening.

183
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:29,094
Yong is under my charm spell!

184
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,574
Bastard! He didn't get me one!

185
00:18:05,907 --> 00:18:08,560
How dare she have eyes for my husband?

186
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,353
We're already promised to each other.

187
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,289
Hey, there's a great obstacle there! Get over it!

188
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:57,337
Yang Soon!

189
00:18:57,337 --> 00:19:00,992
My baby!

190
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:03,974
Yang Soon my baby!

191
00:19:03,974 --> 00:19:08,310
Yang Soon! Yang Soon!

192
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,804
Yang Soon!

193
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:16,474
Yang Soon my baby!

194
00:19:30,026 --> 00:19:32,448
You bastards!

195
00:20:01,226 --> 00:20:02,548
Stop right there!

196
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:04,332
Stop you jerk!

197
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:06,715
You bastards!

198
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:13,690
Stop right there!

199
00:20:32,374 --> 00:20:34,167
Close the doors!

200
00:20:46,658 --> 00:20:47,581
Open!

201
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:49,919
Open the doors!

202
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:55,118
Come out here you bastards!

203
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:03,636
That's some bad luck!

204
00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:05,549
What's wrong?

205
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:12,885
Why is it so calm?

206
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:18,436
Yong, the cutie pie of South Gate, is back!

207
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:27,328
It's me, the cutie pie of South Gate!

208
00:21:31,307 --> 00:21:34,702
Hey, Yong, the cutie from South Gate is back...

209
00:22:23,624 --> 00:22:28,274
Hey!

210
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:37,718
What is wrong with you?

211
00:22:43,022 --> 00:22:46,154
Get out of there! Come out!

212
00:22:46,154 --> 00:22:50,130
You bastard! Come out!

213
00:22:50,612 --> 00:22:53,378
We're telling you, go away!

214
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,889
She's so stubborn!

215
00:22:57,889 --> 00:22:59,446
Take her out of here!

216
00:23:04,535 --> 00:23:08,458
Release him! Make him come out!

217
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:11,393
Get him out of there!

218
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,398
Let's go.

219
00:23:14,948 --> 00:23:18,620
I'm not going! I can't! I'm staying here until that jerk comes out.

220
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,832
I'm not going! I won't!

221
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,619
Just let him go!

222
00:23:25,543 --> 00:23:28,655
Sirs, we're so sorry to have made such a fuss.

223
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:31,588
This girl here has such a temper!

224
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:34,912
That jerk went in there!

225
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,418
The one who killed Yang Soon and ran away

226
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:40,009
is hiding in there!

227
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:42,882
They're telling you he's not there! They didn't see him!

228
00:23:42,882 --> 00:23:45,103
Let's just go. Let's talk.

229
00:23:46,481 --> 00:23:48,537
Let me go!

230
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:54,836
Stop it! What are you going to do about it?

231
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:58,646
You jerk! Do you even know how Yang Soon got killed?

232
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:01,686
She went to find the ribbon you gave her and got hit!

233
00:24:01,686 --> 00:24:03,689
How dare you do this to her?

234
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:05,957
Do you even call yourself a human being?

235
00:24:52,296 --> 00:24:55,007
Geez, she's like a leech, this one!

236
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:11,951
I'm not going to move one bit until that jerk comes out.

237
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:17,150
Sure. Go ahead. Whatever.

238
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,950
Don't you move from there! Not one step!

239
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,675
I'm leaving.

240
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:31,162
I've never seen anyone so stubborn in my life.

241
00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:10,261
Change of guards!

242
00:26:18,492 --> 00:26:19,759
Eat some.

243
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:27,038
Eat something.

244
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:08,764
There she is, sitting like that

245
00:27:08,764 --> 00:27:11,439
and nobody's coming to check?

246
00:27:22,644 --> 00:27:23,611
Hey? What's that?

247
00:27:40,537 --> 00:27:41,799
Ajumma.

248
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:44,461
Ajussi.

249
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:56,242
What?

250
00:27:57,152 --> 00:27:58,240
What is this?

251
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,867
The man who killed my daughter

252
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:06,510
I want him to at least apologize, I want him to say he's sorry at the very least.

253
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:09,327
That way

254
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:14,571
my baby can reach the heavens in peace.

255
00:28:48,466 --> 00:28:51,595
Why isn't he coming? He said he would come yesterday.

256
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,693
Come on...

257
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:56,168
What if he's in trouble?

258
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:13,238
Yong's father!

259
00:29:15,832 --> 00:29:17,330
Who is this?

260
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,357
My little Yong is back! 
 Father!

261
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,867
My baby! Why are you so late?

262
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:27,854
Let me see you.

263
00:29:27,854 --> 00:29:34,043
You had a hard time studying, didn't you? 
 Not at all.

264
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:35,651
Look at you, where are your plump cheeks? 
 Haha my cheeks...

265
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:40,939
But where is your faithful Dan?

266
00:29:40,939 --> 00:29:42,998
Dan! Our baby is here!

267
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:44,849
Mother!

268
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,350
But...

269
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,888
What is this?

270
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:50,108
It's a ribbon.

271
00:29:51,384 --> 00:29:54,116
You little boy. You bought it for your mother, didn't you?

272
00:29:54,116 --> 00:29:56,174
But your mother is too old for ribbons.

273
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,302
It's not a ribbon. It's nothing,

274
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,431
Do you have a girl?

275
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:07,057
Oh come on. There's no girl.

276
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:11,075
Mother!

277
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:15,708
Here I am, back in town,after some serious studying.

278
00:30:16,308 --> 00:30:21,712
Father, Mother, have you been well?

279
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:26,451
I'm back, let me bow to you.

280
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:31,219
Just eat.

281
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:35,157
Of course of course! Thank you!

282
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:38,346
So, did you study a lot?

283
00:30:38,346 --> 00:30:40,507
You're not sick or anything, are you?

284
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,757
You're back for good, right? You're not going away again, are you?

285
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,585
One question at a time!

286
00:30:45,585 --> 00:30:48,447
All right all right. Just eat and take some rest.

287
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:56,617
Your precious son is here, where are you going now?

288
00:30:56,617 --> 00:30:59,407
The village is in a mess!

289
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:02,099
Yang Soon...

290
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:07,553
Bong Soon... I'll be back in a second and tell you.

291
00:31:07,553 --> 00:31:09,554
You stay here and eat.

292
00:31:09,554 --> 00:31:12,566
Dan, I'll be gone!

293
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:13,662
I'm coming with you.

294
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,932
You're going too?

295
00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:18,802
I'm also a mother with a child.

296
00:31:20,686 --> 00:31:21,549
Let's go.

297
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,645
So everyone is out there?

298
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:50,777
Yes, my father is there too. 
 Let's go.

299
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:52,953
What? Why are you going there?

300
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:55,627
You're a nobleman's daughter.

301
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:57,611
Is a nobleman not a citizen of this country?

302
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:02,684
Miss, you can't!

303
00:32:11,794 --> 00:32:12,533
Swe Dol!

304
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,948
Hey, you're here.

305
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:26,204
Miss, you have to go back! Please!

306
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:33,597
Miss! What are you doing here?

307
00:32:33,597 --> 00:32:36,319
You have to go back!

308
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:41,201
Well, look here, you seem like the daughter of a high class nobleman.

309
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:44,598
How come you honor us with your presence in this humble place?

310
00:32:44,598 --> 00:32:49,580
What if your precious silk skirt gets some dirt?

311
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,900
That jerk!

312
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:56,812
Miss!

313
00:32:57,722 --> 00:32:59,589
Is it fine now?

314
00:32:59,589 --> 00:33:03,557
That jerk who killed a child and is hiding out there, less of an animal that he is.

315
00:33:03,557 --> 00:33:06,053
I want him out here too. That's why I came.

316
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:09,491
Why? Can't I be here just became I come from a noble family?

317
00:33:09,491 --> 00:33:10,941
Not at all.

318
00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:30,766
Don't worry. Go inside.

319
00:33:30,766 --> 00:33:34,191
But... there are so many people out there.

320
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:38,756
How dare they? Do they even know who I am?

321
00:33:47,821 --> 00:33:52,137
Welcome! Please come in!

322
00:33:56,461 --> 00:33:58,811
I've briefly heard what happened.

323
00:33:58,811 --> 00:34:02,143
What is all this?

324
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:06,316
It's nothing really. They're upset over nothing.

325
00:34:08,428 --> 00:34:11,984
I trust you will take care of it.

326
00:34:14,543 --> 00:34:17,649
Why did he run away in the first place?

327
00:34:19,787 --> 00:34:24,750
A few years ago, when you came as an envoy to Chung

328
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,892
I took great care of you.

329
00:34:27,892 --> 00:34:29,834
You do remember that, don't you?

330
00:34:31,314 --> 00:34:33,237
Of course...

331
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,304
During the havoc in the Byungja year

332
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:40,696
you were demoted, and I made sure that you came back to your position.

333
00:34:40,696 --> 00:34:43,558
I hope you haven't forgotten that either.

334
00:34:43,558 --> 00:34:49,249
Not at all. How could I ever forget such a gesture?

335
00:34:49,793 --> 00:34:52,608
But... your son

336
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:56,134
was drinking while riding I hear?

337
00:35:02,348 --> 00:35:03,692
Lord Byung pan

338
00:35:03,692 --> 00:35:07,569
you are a smart man, so you must know

339
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:11,522
you must know what role I play

340
00:35:11,522 --> 00:35:13,948
in the foreign relations between your country and the Chung empire.

341
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:18,026
Of course I know.

342
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:22,907
I will make sure you have all the guards at your disposal.

343
00:35:22,907 --> 00:35:25,690
So your son should have no worries at all

344
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,106
and he can take some rest.

345
00:35:30,494 --> 00:35:35,454
All right then, I put all my trust in you.

346
00:35:44,588 --> 00:35:49,000
You lowlife!

347
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:52,832
You killed Yang Soon!

348
00:35:52,832 --> 00:35:55,187
Get out of there and kneel in front of us! Apologize!

349
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:58,891
You bastard! You come out of there now!

350
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:01,627
Come out before we open that door!

351
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,987
He's not coming out? 
 You jerk! I used to be a criminal!

352
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:12,931
Anyways, just come out before we unlock that door!

353
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:14,781
Aren't you going to come out?

354
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,308
1,2,3!

355
00:36:32,687 --> 00:36:34,429
If you don't leave now

356
00:36:34,913 --> 00:36:37,048
we will all take you in.

357
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:52,264
We pay our taxes

358
00:36:52,264 --> 00:36:54,994
and you use them to protect killers!

359
00:36:57,556 --> 00:36:59,097
Let's go!

360
00:37:04,581 --> 00:37:06,828
What are you doing? Stop them!

361
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:27,578
What are you doing?

362
00:37:29,328 --> 00:37:32,568
You are guards! What about the person who murdered a child?

363
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:35,572
What are you doing to innocent people?

364
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:39,240
The people's will is the highest will of all.

365
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,621
You are national guards!

366
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,648
Come on, quick, quick.

367
00:38:06,098 --> 00:38:06,871
My turn.

368
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:15,416
Come on, quick.

369
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:21,662
Just take them in and beat them up.

370
00:38:23,145 --> 00:38:27,585
People like them need to be beaten a bit to get their senses back.

371
00:38:31,916 --> 00:38:34,300
But sir, among the protestors

372
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,396
there's the daughter of a nobleman's family.

373
00:38:38,387 --> 00:38:42,582
What? Whose daughter is that? Who is that stupid nobleman?

374
00:38:42,582 --> 00:38:45,278
How do they educate their child?

375
00:38:45,278 --> 00:38:47,635
We haven't figured out yet who she is.

376
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:51,503
I don't know! Whatever. Just take a couple of them in and beat them.

377
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:55,913
Teach them a lesson.

378
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:02,813
Don't touch the nobleman's daughter.

379
00:39:02,813 --> 00:39:04,435
That's going to get us into more trouble.

380
00:39:15,926 --> 00:39:16,925
Push them away!

381
00:40:06,856 --> 00:40:09,171
Push it!

382
00:41:34,546 --> 00:41:36,741
Damn, I don't have a hammer.

383
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,534
Oh, the Castor Oil gang!

384
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,124
What? You still haven't gotten rid of them?

385
00:41:45,124 --> 00:41:49,873
No. More people are coming now because they heard the news.

386
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:52,628
But our guards are all tired.

387
00:41:53,674 --> 00:41:57,763
These lowlifes! They really want to have a go?

388
00:41:59,044 --> 00:42:00,520
All right then.

389
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,803
Bring all the gangs in this city!

390
00:42:08,866 --> 00:42:12,674
They are all gathered in front of the gate

391
00:42:12,674 --> 00:42:17,985
so don't be scared and just deal with them.

392
00:42:21,265 --> 00:42:23,053
Hey, it's Yong.

393
00:42:23,053 --> 00:42:26,625
Yong!

394
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:31,440
My dear brothers! How have you been?

395
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,748
How long has it been?

396
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:39,760
Yong!

397
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,725
You little thing.

398
00:42:45,914 --> 00:42:49,137
You were supposed to study. I don't smell any ink.

399
00:42:49,137 --> 00:42:51,359
It looks like you got even stronger in body.

400
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,114
Yeah right.

401
00:42:53,114 --> 00:42:55,506
It's true. You look very strong.

402
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:58,516
By the way, where's our hammer?

403
00:42:59,725 --> 00:43:02,642
I saw it the other day lying around here.

404
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:06,516
Over there. But what for?

405
00:43:06,516 --> 00:43:08,408
Oh, I just need it for something.

406
00:43:14,365 --> 00:43:17,797
Chief!

407
00:43:18,406 --> 00:43:20,243
They want us to get rid of them all.

408
00:43:20,243 --> 00:43:24,376
Let's go.

409
00:44:27,538 --> 00:44:30,326
What? Are you gangs now?

410
00:44:30,326 --> 00:44:32,068
Boys!

411
00:44:32,068 --> 00:44:36,421
Shall we do some stretching? Crush them all!

412
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:37,403
Sang Deuk!

413
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:42,357
Mother! What are you doing over there? Come here. It's dangerous.

414
00:44:42,357 --> 00:44:45,025
You little brat! You come over here!

415
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:49,099
How dare you call yourself one of the people?

416
00:44:50,051 --> 00:44:51,831
Come  here now!

417
00:44:51,831 --> 00:44:57,964
You little brat!

418
00:45:00,078 --> 00:45:01,610
What the...?

419
00:45:03,556 --> 00:45:04,583
Kang Woo!

420
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,390
Grandfather!

421
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:10,777
Are you crazy? What are you doing over there?

422
00:45:10,777 --> 00:45:13,182
Come here this once!

423
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,093
Hey!

424
00:45:19,093 --> 00:45:19,986
Yook Kam!

425
00:45:20,732 --> 00:45:21,656
Father!

426
00:45:21,656 --> 00:45:25,318
You come here! 
No, father!

427
00:45:36,056 --> 00:45:37,115
What?

428
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:38,767
He told us he was into fights!

429
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:42,130
How dares he lie to us!

430
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,714
Boys!

431
00:45:44,714 --> 00:45:46,412
We're joining them now!

432
00:45:54,124 --> 00:45:54,934
Yong!

433
00:45:56,724 --> 00:45:59,000
No! Why would I?

434
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,645
You come here this once!

435
00:46:01,645 --> 00:46:04,573
What if I get hurt? I barely managed to get away earlier.

436
00:46:04,573 --> 00:46:08,682
I don't want to. I want to have a long and easy life.

437
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,267
Why are you people so immature?

438
00:46:11,267 --> 00:46:13,547
The king says not to! The king!

439
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,259
What I mean is...

440
00:46:23,259 --> 00:46:27,654
If you're here like this, all your shops will be empty

441
00:46:27,654 --> 00:46:29,726
and what if you get robbed?

442
00:46:32,518 --> 00:46:37,324
I'll protect your shops, you stay here.

443
00:46:40,535 --> 00:46:41,774
Hey!

444
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:50,127
Let's go!

445
00:47:11,268 --> 00:47:15,881
What? Even the Castor Oil gang?

446
00:47:15,881 --> 00:47:20,711
Yes, with the gang on their side, the people have gotten stronger. We're in a weak position.

447
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,052
Seeing what's happening now, they are going to break the door any time soon.

448
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:32,728
All right then.

449
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:36,976
I will show them what I'm capable of.

450
00:48:06,121 --> 00:48:09,650
Jung Chi Hong that dog! Do you know what he's doing inside?

451
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,857
He's playing games!

452
00:48:11,857 --> 00:48:15,246
What? It's all because of him that we're going through this mess!

453
00:48:15,246 --> 00:48:18,172
And he dares call himself a man.

454
00:48:19,974 --> 00:48:21,449
He should die.

455
00:48:35,798 --> 00:48:37,580
You're having some rough time too.

456
00:48:38,172 --> 00:48:41,964
Here, have some. It's ok.

457
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:44,125
Come on, eat. It's all right.

458
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,351
My Dan, she's over there

459
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:55,273
she's not only pretty, she can also cook very well. Just have some.

460
00:48:55,273 --> 00:48:56,862
Come on, eat.

461
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,346
It's good, right?

462
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:04,063
Good work. I'm going now.

463
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,219
You're from a noble family. You shouldn't be here.

464
00:51:19,553 --> 00:51:24,183
Look at all this blood! 
 Just stay put!

465
00:51:34,735 --> 00:51:35,998
My tooth!

466
00:51:39,615 --> 00:51:42,375
My other tooth is shaky too. Those jerks.

467
00:51:43,511 --> 00:51:45,139
You're a man. Be stronger.

468
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:49,628
You think that too?

469
00:51:49,628 --> 00:51:53,994
Before they took out my tooth, I was quite good looking.

470
00:51:54,936 --> 00:51:56,554
If you die

471
00:51:59,807 --> 00:52:01,590
I can't live without you.

472
00:52:24,794 --> 00:52:27,340
I am so sorry I don't know what to say.

473
00:52:28,063 --> 00:52:30,344
I'm the only one unhurt.

474
00:52:30,344 --> 00:52:32,616
Why should you be sorry, Miss?

475
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,722
Don't say things like that.

476
00:52:37,662 --> 00:52:39,936
Please let me borrow your clothes.

477
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,893
This dress is quite uncomfortable.

478
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,123
Follow me.

479
00:52:50,329 --> 00:52:56,056
Ajumma, look at my forehead. 
 Stay put! You're such a baby!

480
00:52:57,254 --> 00:52:58,744
Does it hurt a lot?

481
00:52:58,744 --> 00:53:01,607
Yes. But hey, where is Yong?

482
00:53:01,607 --> 00:53:03,020
I haven't seen him all day.

483
00:53:04,269 --> 00:53:06,418
I saw him a bit earlier on.

484
00:53:06,418 --> 00:53:09,182
Did he run away because he got scared?

485
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:28,875
Those bastards! Even a worm knows how to wriggle when he's stepped on.

486
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:32,362
We may die, but we can't back out. Right?

487
00:54:32,362 --> 00:54:33,311
Of course.

488
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:36,864
They use all our money to eat all they want.

489
00:54:36,864 --> 00:54:39,395
And then they use that strenght to beat on the people?

490
00:54:39,395 --> 00:54:41,141
These bastards! Thieves!

491
00:54:41,141 --> 00:54:43,520
Those damn guards!

492
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:49,543
Come to think of it, when Yong said he wanted to be a guard, good thing I stopped him, right?

493
00:54:51,517 --> 00:54:53,896
All right, should we go?

494
00:54:55,472 --> 00:54:57,438
Let's get ready!

495
00:54:58,168 --> 00:55:00,878
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!

496
00:55:00,878 --> 00:55:04,154
But... are we going to be ok?

497
00:55:04,154 --> 00:55:05,290
What?

498
00:55:07,697 --> 00:55:09,710
What are you trying to say?

499
00:55:10,205 --> 00:55:13,146
You want to back out?

500
00:55:13,788 --> 00:55:16,031
Go! Go you jerk!

501
00:55:16,031 --> 00:55:19,009
All right, I'm going.

502
00:55:19,009 --> 00:55:22,846
Maybe you've forgotten that I have 20 horses at my house.

503
00:55:22,846 --> 00:55:23,982
I'm leaving. Sure, why not.

504
00:55:24,256 --> 00:55:26,626
Don't stop me. I'm leaving.

505
00:55:26,626 --> 00:55:29,693
Oh come on, stay. Don't do this.

506
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:31,741
Come on!

507
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:05,440
It's all over now.

508
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,815
These lowlifes

509
00:56:07,815 --> 00:56:11,003
they just need to know what this stick feels like

510
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:16,674
That's how they get their sense back.

511
00:56:19,498 --> 00:56:23,978
Thanks to you, I'm going to rest peacefully.

512
00:56:23,978 --> 00:56:26,871
I won't forget this one. I owe you.

513
00:56:26,871 --> 00:56:28,534
Don't mention it.

514
00:56:57,211 --> 00:57:00,136
You'll see. You'll see what I'm going to steal this time.

515
00:57:00,263 --> 00:57:14,241


516
00:57:14,241 --> 00:57:16,218
