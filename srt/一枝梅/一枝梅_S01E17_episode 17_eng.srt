1
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:34,951
Even if I'm not here, you have to live happily ever after with Dan.

2
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,428
Next!

3
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:42,147
Let's live happily ever after until we die.

4
00:00:42,147 --> 00:00:44,192
There's always someone better.

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,839
How did you unlock it?

6
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,500
Whose son am I?

7
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,223
Your father and you would have been both dead!

8
00:00:52,223 --> 00:00:54,192
Now unlock it.

9
00:00:54,676 --> 00:00:57,681
He'll be dead, with our combined operations.

10
00:01:01,873 --> 00:01:03,688
Come out now!

11
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:04,512
Let me go!

12
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,635
Arrest him!

13
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:06,950
Come and get me.

14
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,863
What did you hear there?

15
00:01:12,863 --> 00:01:15,126
I don't know what you're talking about.

16
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:21,787
      Episode 17 

17
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,357
You open it.

18
00:01:39,357 --> 00:01:42,155
What could he have possibly heard in there that they ...

19
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:50,751
Father.

20
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,763
Father!

21
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:55,898
What happened?

22
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:57,485
I...

23
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:59,432
I don't know.

24
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,770
Father!  Father!

25
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:14,617
Hold him!

26
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:09,147
He has an accomplice.

27
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,135
What happened?

28
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:16,726
It's the latest Western lock that even Iljimae couldn't unlock.

29
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:24,580
Father...

30
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:35,899
Ja Dol.

31
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:38,577
Please slow down.

32
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:40,541
I'm out of breath.

33
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,049
Just hold on a little bit. Just a little.

34
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,287
I'll take you to the doctor.

35
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:49,426
Take me home.

36
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:54,146
I want to see my Dan.

37
00:03:55,374 --> 00:03:58,125
Take me to Dan.

38
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:02,938
Ja Dol.

39
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:06,546
Don't blame your mother.

40
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,579
Your mother...

41
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:18,780
she just wanted you to have a good life.

42
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,825
Please don't talk anymore Father. You'll get tired. Don't talk.

43
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:30,327
Take care of Yong.

44
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:37,626
You have to take care of him.

45
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:42,057
He can get into a lot of trouble.

46
00:04:43,556 --> 00:04:50,106
You, Ja Dol and Yong, you are both my sons.

47
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:55,715
You're brothers.

48
00:04:57,624 --> 00:05:00,719
Think of yourselves as brothers.

49
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:04,934
Don't fight with him.

50
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:08,126
Try to get along.

51
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:10,695
Get along well.

52
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:27,470
I hear it wasn't Iljimae.

53
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,167
Yeah. It was just a thief.

54
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:34,882
Well, thank God. All sorts of nobodies are now trying to imitate Iljimae.

55
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:37,750
Short and toothless too! How dare he.

56
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,576
Tell me about it.

57
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:49,297
What happened?

58
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:52,539
What happened?

59
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:54,268
What happened?

60
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,853
Well...

61
00:05:57,853 --> 00:06:01,583
the thing is...

62
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,297
go home.

63
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:19,096
Where are you going?

64
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:20,777
I'm going to fetch the doctor.

65
00:06:38,952 --> 00:06:43,769
You must be busy. You should go.

66
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:47,357
Father.

67
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:51,762
I'm not going to die, so don't worry.

68
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:57,993
I'll be here with your mom.

69
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:05,192
I'll come again tomorrow.

70
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:08,037
All right.

71
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:22,937
My faithful Dan.

72
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:28,725
I'm sorry.

73
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:33,897
I promised we would live happily ever after,

74
00:07:33,897 --> 00:07:41,022
Yong, you and I.

75
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:43,596
We will.

76
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,283
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:50,439
I'm sorry. I only gave you a hard time.

78
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:55,208
Stop it. You have nothing to be sorry for.

79
00:07:56,408 --> 00:08:01,390
I'm the one who did nothing good for you.

80
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:09,175
That nobleman, he didn't order to kill you.

81
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:16,788
He even gave me money, he held my hand tight

82
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:20,156
and he told me you were important.

83
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:24,312
He told me to take you and live happily.

84
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,597
But I couldn't tell you.

85
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:37,246
I was afraid you would never care for me.

86
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,281
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

87
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:47,912
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

88
00:08:50,642 --> 00:08:54,388
It doesn't matter.

89
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:59,443
You're the only one for me.

90
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:03,974
You've been the only one for me for a long time.

91
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,703
It's the truth.

92
00:09:15,878 --> 00:09:18,313
Dan.

93
00:09:18,313 --> 00:09:25,471
I was mean to you

94
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:28,934
so that you could leave me anytime.

95
00:09:29,758 --> 00:09:35,738
I didn't want to get hurt if you left me.

96
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:42,193
But I was worried you would really leave me.

97
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:50,396
I was always so worried and anxious.

98
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:56,197
I see.

99
00:09:56,197 --> 00:10:03,599
Thank you so much, for living with someone like me.

100
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:13,263
My faithful Dan.

101
00:10:16,923 --> 00:10:20,208
My faithful Dan.

102
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:24,387
Please don't sleep. Please.

103
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:34,660
Look at my lips.

104
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,679
My lips.

105
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,001
They're pretty, right?

106
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:48,679
I wanted to look pretty for you.

107
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:08,881
Yes, you're pretty.

108
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:13,242
You're too pretty for my eyes.

109
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:21,709
What?

110
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:28,554
Yong... he will be hungry when he gets home.

111
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:35,416
All right, I'll have the rice ready for him.

112
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:40,011
All right, promise.

113
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:54,765
My baby.

114
00:11:57,397 --> 00:12:01,702
I hope I have paid for all our sins.

115
00:12:35,785 --> 00:12:43,780


116
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:07,119
Yong's father! Pretty Dan!

117
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,055
I'm hungry! Give me something to eat!

118
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:27,053
Father!

119
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:28,534
Father!

120
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:30,784
Father!

121
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,198
Father!  Father!

122
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:39,143
Father, what happened to you?

123
00:13:41,074 --> 00:13:44,616
Father!

124
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:48,348
Father! Please open your eyes!

125
00:13:48,348 --> 00:13:50,285
Open your eyes.

126
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:53,542
Father! Open your eyes!

127
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,050
Father! What happened to you?

128
00:14:00,726 --> 00:14:03,889
Father! Father!

129
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:08,550
Open your eyes!

130
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,283
Father, wake up!

131
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:15,221
The sun is high up in the sky, what are you doing?

132
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,146
Wake up!

133
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:20,720
Wake up Father!

134
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:24,321
Father!

135
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,546
Father!

136
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,290
My son!

137
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:18,145
My dear son!

138
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:51,707
How could this happen?

139
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:54,069
They won't even allow us to have a funeral.

140
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:56,492
We can't even put him in a coffin.

141
00:15:56,492 --> 00:16:00,057
Isn't this too harsh?

142
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:02,905
Swe Dol!

143
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:07,587
Swe Dol  you bastard!

144
00:16:08,653 --> 00:16:12,021
Ahjussi!

145
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:51,088
It's been a long time since we've had rain. It's refreshing.

146
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:55,502
I'm relieved.

147
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,714
She is really harsh isn't she?

148
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:04,880
I had no idea she was that cold.

149
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,542
We came here because we were worried.

150
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:08,994
Let's go.

151
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,643
How can she eat? So cold.

152
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:13,003
So harsh.

153
00:17:52,426 --> 00:17:55,191
On a day like this, you can drink.

154
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,688
Hey, hey!

155
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:06,796
I'm sorry.

156
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:10,191
I had no power.

157
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,012
Well...

158
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:19,951
Yes, go ahead, drink and forget about it all.

159
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:25,684
Your father... he's so...

160
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:30,105
Why did he disguise as Iljimae and rob that place? At his age?

161
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:37,055
Yong.

162
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:40,134
I just...

163
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:43,408
Sir, we brought in  sikhe .

164
00:18:43,408 --> 00:18:46,795
Yes, yes, bring it in.

165
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:50,102
Yong.

166
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:09,153
Have some  sikhe 

167
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,370
Here, have some of this.

168
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,696
Young lord, what is the matter?

169
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,740
What happened?

170
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:39,672
I feel sorry.

171
00:19:39,672 --> 00:19:41,511
He was so foolish.

172
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,832
Yong, I'm sorry. I didn't bring money.

173
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,014
What is this?

174
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:10,427
Hey, won't this do?

175
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:11,624
I'll bring the money right away.

176
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:14,047
Of course this works too!

177
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,836
Geez, you're way too happy.

178
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:21,299
My brother, you have to wake up!

179
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,172
Excuse me,

180
00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:30,755
it's cold outside.

181
00:20:30,755 --> 00:20:33,220
Have this.

182
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:39,564
Let's go.

183
00:20:39,564 --> 00:20:41,398
Well, well.

184
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:24,781
Here you go.

185
00:21:24,781 --> 00:21:26,162
It's good, isn't it?

186
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:28,101
Chew it before you swallow it.

187
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:30,455
Why did they kill you?

188
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:34,159
What was it that you shouldn't have heard?

189
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,520
I will not let them get away with this, Father.

190
00:22:49,924 --> 00:22:57,967


191
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,635
Seo Young Soo!

192
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:22,688
He killed someone?

193
00:24:22,688 --> 00:24:25,855
It was the scam of the century! Lying to everyone like that.

194
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:28,262
Everyone was fooled.

195
00:24:28,262 --> 00:24:29,156
What?

196
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:31,645
What kind of hero does that?

197
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:35,017
You said that Iljimae was the trend.

198
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:36,272
I said that?

199
00:24:36,272 --> 00:24:39,006
When did I say that? This rice cake laughs at you my friend.

200
00:24:39,006 --> 00:24:43,112
Hey you brat! This is surely a conspiracy!

201
00:24:43,112 --> 00:24:47,191
Some bastard wants to dump it all on our hero.

202
00:24:47,191 --> 00:24:50,854
Ahjussi, where do you hear all that crazy stuff?

203
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:52,999
You even said Iljimae was a woman.

204
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:54,905
Yes, so what?

205
00:24:54,905 --> 00:24:57,319
Iljimae was sent to get married to Chung

206
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:58,761
and then she killed herself.

207
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:00,203
And then...

208
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,921
Swe Dol you bastard.

209
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:07,901
Swe Dol!

210
00:25:07,901 --> 00:25:11,323
Ahjussi, have some decency!

211
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:14,683
What decency? I have decency. You're the one who's not decent.

212
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:15,872
What did I do?

213
00:25:15,872 --> 00:25:17,298
You brat.

214
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:22,036
Who killed him? Who?

215
00:25:22,036 --> 00:25:24,898
And I haven't found the one who killed my father!

216
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,573
How dare you kill him?

217
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:42,269
Yong.

218
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:43,871
Come in.

219
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:49,563
What?

220
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:26,876
He paralyzed him, and then killed him by pushing on the blood canal.

221
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,326
He must have been an expert.

222
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:38,437
Iljimae was there robbing Seo Young Soo and now he's also known as the killer?

223
00:26:38,437 --> 00:26:39,804
Yes, Your Majesty.

224
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:43,782
What a fortunate coincidence!

225
00:26:43,782 --> 00:26:47,893
It's like hitting two birds with one stone!

226
00:26:49,236 --> 00:26:53,932
Why don't we push along those lines?

227
00:26:53,932 --> 00:26:55,187
I'm sorry?

228
00:26:55,187 --> 00:26:58,552
Don't they call him the king of the people?

229
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:03,640
Show them what their king is really about.

230
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:10,230
Yes, Your Majesty, that is exactly what I was thinking.

231
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,002
Cheon.

232
00:27:13,002 --> 00:27:16,135
Bring in Yi Jeong Seob.

233
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,527
Yes, Your Majesty.

234
00:28:03,064 --> 00:28:05,099
Guard Byun!

235
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:06,603
Help me out.

236
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:36,846
Your Majesty, I tried to stop Lord Seo.

237
00:28:36,846 --> 00:28:39,491
Please have faith in my loyalty.

238
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:45,313
I know, I have heard about it all.

239
00:28:45,313 --> 00:28:50,721
I won't harm you, so you can rest in peace.

240
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:53,482
Us seven, you know we were not ordinary friends.

241
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:59,708
They had to meet death, because they are the ones who betrayed me.

242
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:03,078
How things went,

243
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:05,124
I am quite upset about it as well.

244
00:29:05,124 --> 00:29:06,256
Your Majesty.

245
00:29:06,256 --> 00:29:10,208
You're not the one who's upsetting me now.

246
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,074
It's Iljimae, he's the only one.

247
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:25,781
It's only by catching him that we'll settle down the people.

248
00:29:28,014 --> 00:29:33,776
You will help me in finding Iljimae.

249
00:29:33,776 --> 00:29:35,785
Yes, your Majesty.

250
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:38,543
You may go now.

251
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,354
Cheon.

252
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,691
Yes.

253
00:29:50,691 --> 00:29:53,142
I will have it ready.

254
00:29:57,074 --> 00:29:59,704
What on earth is this?

255
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:03,223
My brother, you're here.

256
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:06,975
What is it? So early in the morning.

257
00:30:06,975 --> 00:30:08,719
Look at this.

258
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:11,178
Sh Hoo was looking at it.

259
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:13,759
I have no idea what it is.

260
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,778
But seeing how he was all over this...

261
00:30:18,412 --> 00:30:20,728
there must be something to it.

262
00:30:21,715 --> 00:30:23,307
What do you think it is?

263
00:30:24,672 --> 00:30:26,265
I don't know...

264
00:30:29,464 --> 00:30:31,684
Iljimae.

265
00:30:31,684 --> 00:30:36,152
All right, if I catch him, I can live.

266
00:30:36,152 --> 00:30:38,786
Sir! Sir!

267
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:41,818
This was stuck on the column of the house.

268
00:30:53,212 --> 00:30:55,610
Yi Jeong Seob!

269
00:30:56,303 --> 00:31:06,668


270
00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:43,380
I will be the one to catch him!

271
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,430
Are you sure you're going to be all right?

272
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,094
Close the door!

273
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,237
What did he hear in there that they would do this to him?

274
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:39,695
Why didn't the door open?

275
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:41,307
Who put ...?

276
00:32:41,307 --> 00:32:43,962
Yi Jeong Seob!

277
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,295
Why did you kill him?

278
00:32:46,295 --> 00:32:47,137
Him?

279
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:52,684
The thief who was at Seo Young Soo's place when you were there!

280
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:56,870
What did he hear?

281
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:17,982
Did you get rid of him?

282
00:33:17,982 --> 00:33:22,858
Well, the thing is, I went in there to kill him, but the real Iljimae came.

283
00:33:22,858 --> 00:33:24,091
What?

284
00:33:35,428 --> 00:33:38,031
What did he do to you?

285
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:44,152
Take my sword!

286
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:48,537
Take my life!

287
00:34:16,243 --> 00:34:19,441
You are... Lee Won Ho's....?

288
00:36:36,149 --> 00:36:39,029
He's the one who told the authorities!

289
00:37:22,726 --> 00:37:23,859
What's the matter?

290
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:25,946
Iljimae ran away towards the mountains.

291
00:37:25,946 --> 00:37:28,222
Have your men there.

292
00:37:42,747 --> 00:37:45,580
Yong? Geom?

293
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:52,504
Don't worry. I won't report you.

294
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:57,193
You saved my son's life.

295
00:37:57,193 --> 00:38:00,182
I didn't see anything today.

296
00:38:02,476 --> 00:38:04,238
Blood?

297
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,944
Are you on the run?

298
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:12,811
Go this way. There will be a small route on the side. Go!

299
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:22,678
Geez, you scared me!

300
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:29,302
What are you doing here in the middle of the night? 
 Only wild boars come around here.

301
00:38:29,302 --> 00:38:31,212
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

302
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,377
Oh, the one who was all in black?

303
00:38:38,511 --> 00:38:40,525
He ran away this way.

304
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:43,083
Father!

305
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:45,696
I caught all of these.

306
00:38:45,696 --> 00:38:52,919
But there was a man all in black limping and running over there.

307
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,115
I was scared to death!

308
00:38:54,115 --> 00:38:56,390
It was a wild board! You saw wrong.

309
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,754
No, I didn't.

310
00:39:01,517 --> 00:39:03,186
I caught rabbits!

311
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:48,330
Yong! Wake up.

312
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,459
You can't die here.

313
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,336
Mother.

314
00:40:38,198 --> 00:40:39,612
Who is it?

315
00:40:47,436 --> 00:40:49,310
Yong! Yong!

316
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,994
Yong!

317
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:53,117
Wake up!

318
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,235
Yong!

319
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:56,620
Yong! Wake up!

320
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,233
Yong!

321
00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:30,373
Hold on. Hold on just a little more.

322
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:32,879
I will bring the doctor in.

323
00:41:53,028 --> 00:41:54,885
Ja Dol.

324
00:42:02,774 --> 00:42:05,274
Give him to me.

325
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:22,079
Get up!

326
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:25,465
Ja Dol! Don't do this!

327
00:42:25,465 --> 00:42:27,517
Don't do this, please!

328
00:42:27,517 --> 00:42:29,618
Leave me alone! Don't you know what happens to you if you hide a thief?

329
00:42:29,618 --> 00:42:31,420
Ja Dol, please!

330
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,818
Ja Dol.

331
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:34,757
Get up!

332
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,419
Ja Dol, don't do this. Don't do this. Please.

333
00:42:44,419 --> 00:42:46,971
Ja Dol, please save my Yong. Please.

334
00:42:46,971 --> 00:42:50,074
How could you have such a man as your child?

335
00:42:50,074 --> 00:42:55,533
My father died because of him.

336
00:42:55,533 --> 00:43:00,986
Now I know why he went into that house disguised as him.

337
00:43:00,986 --> 00:43:03,034
He wanted to save him and instead!

338
00:43:03,034 --> 00:43:03,923
Ja Dol!

339
00:43:03,923 --> 00:43:06,131
Leave me alone!

340
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:07,733
Ja Dol, please.

341
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:13,402
All right, if you won't let me go, I'll slay him right here.

342
00:43:13,402 --> 00:43:17,418
He's your brother!

343
00:43:17,418 --> 00:43:20,546
You are brothers

344
00:43:20,546 --> 00:43:24,634
sharing the same blood.

345
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:42,660
Didn't you say you adopted him?

346
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,800
Then... is he your son of a different father?

347
00:43:56,869 --> 00:43:59,048
Well well.

348
00:44:00,781 --> 00:44:04,427
Thank god they didn't touch his heart. But it was close.

349
00:44:04,427 --> 00:44:07,819
Just a few inches away and... my my.

350
00:44:09,152 --> 00:44:13,423
Until when is Yong going to hang out with that gang?

351
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:30,417
Ja Dol.

352
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:35,827
Do you expect me to believe that story?

353
00:44:35,827 --> 00:44:39,276
You told me I was the son of Lord Byun.

354
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:43,164
And then you told me I was the son of my dead father

355
00:44:43,164 --> 00:44:47,934
and now, I'm the son of a traitor?

356
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,055
I'm sorry.

357
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:53,949
Who is that traitor?

358
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:58,202
That... I cannot tell you.

359
00:44:58,202 --> 00:45:01,830
For your sake and for Yong's sake.

360
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:05,705
You're worried about him? Even now?

361
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:07,144
He's a poor kid.

362
00:45:07,144 --> 00:45:12,345
Even Father, who died, until his very end,

363
00:45:12,345 --> 00:45:14,284
he kept saying how pitiful he was.

364
00:45:14,284 --> 00:45:18,787
Please, please take care of him.

365
00:45:19,806 --> 00:45:23,814
Take care of him? You have to understand one thing very clearly.

366
00:45:23,814 --> 00:45:26,659
He's the most notorious thief of Joseon

367
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:30,410
and I'm a guard of the Royal Guards.

368
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:32,891
I have to slay him

369
00:45:32,891 --> 00:45:38,155
and that's the only way I can live a happy life, like you always wanted.

370
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:40,871
He's your brother.

371
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:46,044
Please. How can two brothers kill each other?

372
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:51,519
Don't come telling me now that we are brothers.

373
00:45:52,696 --> 00:45:57,229
From the moment you sent me to that household and ignored me,

374
00:45:57,229 --> 00:46:04,126
I have been the son of Lord Byun.

375
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:19,016
I will leave for now, but the day he starts breaking into other people's home,

376
00:46:19,016 --> 00:46:24,023
I will kill him, without any hesitation.

377
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:32,980
Ja Dol.

378
00:46:34,146 --> 00:46:36,447
Ja Dol!

379
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:41,544
Iljimae showed up at Yi Jeong Seob's house?

380
00:46:41,544 --> 00:46:43,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

381
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,252
But we couldn't catch him.

382
00:46:50,445 --> 00:46:52,550
But Your Majesty,

383
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:57,931
now finally, he will surely be taken for a killer.

384
00:46:57,931 --> 00:47:03,494
Now people won't kill him the people's king, hero, or guide.

385
00:47:03,494 --> 00:47:06,932
Now nobody will ever say that.

386
00:47:06,932 --> 00:47:09,569
Is that so?

387
00:47:09,569 --> 00:47:15,140
Cheon, you go and look around, find out what the people are saying.

388
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,587
Yes, Your Majesty.

389
00:47:16,784 --> 00:47:18,364
Iljimae killed a man.

390
00:47:18,364 --> 00:47:21,010
Is it for real? 
 The man saw him!

391
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:22,805
How can this be?

392
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:24,973
I  had my doubts, but apparently it is true!

393
00:47:24,973 --> 00:47:28,670
No, it cannot be!

394
00:47:33,188 --> 00:47:38,032
I will go look around that way.

395
00:47:42,423 --> 00:47:47,146
Did Iljimae really kill that nobleman?

396
00:47:47,146 --> 00:47:49,319
I can't believe it.

397
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:53,171
He fed the hungry, gave medicine to the ill,

398
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:56,121
how can such a man kill another man?

399
00:47:56,121 --> 00:47:59,168
Right. It's a little bit suspicious, right?

400
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:02,267
Well actually, Iljimae is better than the king, isn't he?

401
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:04,472
Well of course!

402
00:48:04,472 --> 00:48:07,803
It's not because he's in the palace that he's a true king. A king should behave like one.

403
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:09,500
True.

404
00:48:10,898 --> 00:48:20,661


405
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,277
What is it?

406
00:48:29,277 --> 00:48:31,407
Why are you living like this?

407
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:34,893
Did you leave because you wanted to live like this?

408
00:48:37,306 --> 00:48:39,906
What did I do? What's wrong with this?

409
00:48:39,906 --> 00:48:42,266
Let's go to the palace.

410
00:48:42,266 --> 00:48:45,472
His Majesty was very sorry to see you go.

411
00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:49,759
My palace is right here.

412
00:48:49,759 --> 00:48:54,310
Over there is the Queen's palace, and here is the side room.

413
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,886
This one is the enuch, that one the court lady.

414
00:48:56,886 --> 00:48:58,520
Hyung!

415
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,428
Dad! Dad, you're not coming?

416
00:49:00,428 --> 00:49:02,504
I'm coming you brat!

417
00:49:05,554 --> 00:49:09,168
Leave. Before my daughter sees you.

418
00:49:09,168 --> 00:49:13,047
Is that child... the child of that day?

419
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:16,224
Does she know too?

420
00:49:16,224 --> 00:49:18,133
That we killed her brother?

421
00:49:19,141 --> 00:49:21,895
She knows that and yet she's still with you?

422
00:49:21,895 --> 00:49:24,212
Don't say anything to her.

423
00:49:25,068 --> 00:49:27,141
Don't ever come looking for me.

424
00:49:28,516 --> 00:49:30,349
That man you knew is dead.

425
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:48,095
Bong Soon.

426
00:49:48,095 --> 00:49:50,293
Is it true?

427
00:49:50,293 --> 00:49:52,249
Did you kill my brother?

428
00:49:52,249 --> 00:49:54,092
Bong Soon.

429
00:49:59,188 --> 00:50:04,918
Were you the one who killed my brother

430
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,280
and then tried to kill me too?

431
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:19,894
How dare you insult my lord?

432
00:50:24,946 --> 00:50:28,947
My father and my mother

433
00:50:28,947 --> 00:50:31,483
the people in the village

434
00:50:31,483 --> 00:50:33,505
did you kill them all?

435
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:41,052
Why?

436
00:50:41,052 --> 00:50:43,965
Why? Why did you kill them all?

437
00:51:04,941 --> 00:51:12,154
He must be the one who killed my father. He killed all these noblemen as well.

438
00:51:22,403 --> 00:51:24,674
Where do you think you're going?

439
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:28,092
Eat this.

440
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:30,534
Mother.

441
00:51:30,534 --> 00:51:33,954
I will be out in the village

442
00:51:33,954 --> 00:51:37,173
so you eat and take some rest.

443
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:48,355
By the way, I dried your clothes near the stove.

444
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:52,182
Get rid of them once they're all dried. Before anyone sees.

445
00:52:04,092 --> 00:52:05,009
Dosanim!

446
00:52:05,009 --> 00:52:06,432
My brother!

447
00:52:06,432 --> 00:52:09,473
Where  have you been? I didn't see you yesterday or the day before.

448
00:52:09,473 --> 00:52:12,175
I heard Iljimae killed another man?

449
00:52:13,316 --> 00:52:15,554
Yes. Lord Yi Jeong Seob.

450
00:52:15,554 --> 00:52:18,817
Are they sure it was Iljimae who killed him? Nobody saw him.

451
00:52:19,413 --> 00:52:21,657
The servant at the house saw it.

452
00:52:21,657 --> 00:52:23,530
He saw it himself?

453
00:52:24,657 --> 00:52:28,777
He saw it, right in front of him. Iljimae killed him with a knife.

454
00:52:28,777 --> 00:52:31,458
Apparently he used a dagger

455
00:52:32,548 --> 00:52:34,813
but Iljimae is known for his skills,

456
00:52:34,813 --> 00:52:36,788
yet the knife wasn't pushed too deep.

457
00:52:36,788 --> 00:52:38,780
Is that so?

458
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:42,855
Dosanim, was the dagger stuck in a straight angle?

459
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,461
It was a bit twisted.

460
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:53,358
I can smell something is not right.

461
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,138
What smell?

462
00:53:02,243 --> 00:53:03,420
Here.

463
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,409
Throw it.

464
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:10,988
Wow.

465
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:12,629
You're quite good at this.

466
00:53:12,629 --> 00:53:16,391
Oh come on. Have you already forgotten how good I am at swords?

467
00:53:16,391 --> 00:53:18,379
Remember the card game?

468
00:53:19,936 --> 00:53:21,885
But what about this?

469
00:53:21,885 --> 00:53:26,201
Look at the difference between killing right in front of the man and by throwing the knife at the man.

470
00:53:28,553 --> 00:53:32,259
If the killer killed right in front, like you did, the dagger is embedded very deep in the body.

471
00:53:32,259 --> 00:53:36,091
Especially because the intent was clearly to kill, the killer used all his strength.

472
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:37,583
That's what he would have done.

473
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:40,058
But

474
00:53:40,058 --> 00:53:43,866
if you throw the dagger, even if the killer were a great expert,

475
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:45,954
it can't go in too deep.

476
00:53:48,721 --> 00:53:51,315
He could have pushed the knife in slowly.

477
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:58,611
That's why you're still in that position. Think!

478
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:01,075
We're talking about Iljimae here.

479
00:54:01,075 --> 00:54:03,347
Haven't you seen him at the palace?

480
00:54:03,347 --> 00:54:05,632
The man is an expert with swords and daggers.

481
00:54:05,632 --> 00:54:08,156
If he had really wanted to kill,

482
00:54:08,156 --> 00:54:11,407
why would he have killed him slowly and gently?

483
00:54:11,407 --> 00:54:13,065
He would have just pushed in the dagger, as powerful as he could.

484
00:54:15,245 --> 00:54:19,706
And, in addition, the dagger that was in Lord Yi Jeong Seob,

485
00:54:20,309 --> 00:54:23,131
as you can see, the handle

486
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:25,731
is slanted.

487
00:54:25,731 --> 00:54:32,031
A dagger thrown by an expert flies in, twisting around, and is therefore more dangerous.

488
00:54:32,031 --> 00:54:34,308
That's why

489
00:54:34,308 --> 00:54:36,671
Lord Yi Jeong Seob,

490
00:54:37,889 --> 00:54:41,299
although the dagger wasn't pushed in very deep,

491
00:54:42,803 --> 00:54:44,691
had to die on the spot.

492
00:54:46,872 --> 00:54:51,692
The real killer would have probably thrown the knife from over there.

493
00:54:53,177 --> 00:54:54,810
You bastard!

494
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:57,706
Why did you lie about Iljimae killing your lord?

495
00:54:59,488 --> 00:55:03,358
It was you, wasn't it? You're the one who killed Lord Yi Jeong Seob.

496
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:07,394
I just followed orders.

497
00:55:15,414 --> 00:55:16,938
Damn it!

498
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,697
Are you all right?

499
00:55:22,107 --> 00:55:23,000
Who gave you the orders?

500
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,488
Who?

501
00:55:29,468 --> 00:55:31,006
Byun Shik.

502
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:50,080
And I cared for... the daughter of the enemy...

503
00:55:51,616 --> 00:55:54,185
I...

504
00:56:04,386 --> 00:56:05,413
Byun Shik.

505
00:56:11,694 --> 00:56:13,160
My lord!

506
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,987
My lord!

507
00:56:16,345 --> 00:56:18,419
My lord!

508
00:56:18,419 --> 00:56:20,716
What's all this fuss about?

509
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:23,979
What? What?

510
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:40,012
How dares he? In my household?

511
00:56:40,012 --> 00:56:44,572
Hold on...right at this moment?

512
00:56:44,572 --> 00:56:48,840
What am I to do with this rat?

513
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,004
Hey! Over there!

514
00:56:51,568 --> 00:56:58,731


515
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:38,480
How come you told me you wanted to see me?

516
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:47,983
Is there something wrong?

517
00:57:48,727 --> 00:57:52,556
I don't think we'll ever meet again.

518
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:54,550
What?

519
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:57,335
I thought you were the smart daughter of a nobleman.

520
00:57:57,335 --> 00:57:59,767
But apparently you have a hard time understanding what I'm saying.

521
00:58:01,308 --> 00:58:03,743
I have no use for you anymore.

522
00:58:05,267 --> 00:58:07,399
Why are you doing this? All of a sudden?

523
00:58:07,399 --> 00:58:12,341
I hope you don't really believe I'm a hero.

524
00:58:14,764 --> 00:58:18,055
My arm that day, I'm the one who pushed a knife in it.

525
00:58:19,631 --> 00:58:23,833
I heard you had the list of all the noblemen, so I had a look and left it where it was.

526
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,853
Do you understand?

527
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:32,071
I just needed the daughter of the Chief of the Royal Guards.

528
00:58:35,736 --> 00:58:38,921
Then...

529
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:43,380
your feelings...

530
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,964
were they all fake?

531
00:58:50,854 --> 00:58:54,215
Nothing was true from the beginning.

532
00:58:55,504 --> 00:58:58,679
Not even for a moment.

533
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:02,485
I saw you fell into my trap and I just enjoyed it for a while. That is all.

534
00:59:06,727 --> 00:59:12,428
The daughter of Lord Byun Shik. I had high expectations, since you were known to be smart.

535
00:59:12,428 --> 00:59:15,869
But you were quite easy to fool.

536
00:59:15,869 --> 00:59:21,341
I thought of fooling you around a little bit more, but I have my bit of conscience.

537
00:59:21,341 --> 00:59:24,770
I got what I needed, thanks to you.

538
00:59:55,894 --> 01:00:00,316
Everyone guard your posts do your death! I don't want a single rat coming in! Understand?

539
01:00:00,316 --> 01:00:01,619
Yes sir!

540
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,097
This is quite well built.

541
01:00:12,845 --> 01:00:16,726
All right, how have you been, my treasures?

542
01:00:17,432 --> 01:00:21,852
My dear precious ones.

543
01:00:22,918 --> 01:00:25,399
All right, see you later.

544
01:00:52,378 --> 01:00:56,763
You think you're the only one who can climb walls? I can climb over rooftops too!

545
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:10,151
I don't care if you're the mighty Iljimae,

546
01:01:10,151 --> 01:01:13,288
how could you possibly know about my secret vault?

547
01:01:33,133 --> 01:01:34,502
Who goes there?

548
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,944
Move! Move away!

549
01:01:44,248 --> 01:01:45,456
Go!

550
01:01:50,906 --> 01:01:53,288
Where have you been? It's late!

551
01:01:53,288 --> 01:01:55,573
What's going on?

552
01:01:55,573 --> 01:01:59,990
That stupid rat, he gave us a warning,  he's going to come to our house tonight.

553
01:02:03,766 --> 01:02:04,923
What about Shi Hoo?

554
01:02:04,923 --> 01:02:06,476
Him?

555
01:02:08,504 --> 01:02:11,575
He's on duty tonight.

556
01:02:11,575 --> 01:02:15,078
I can't let him catch Iljimae.

557
01:02:20,054 --> 01:02:22,431
Look at this beautiful color.

558
01:02:24,911 --> 01:02:26,978
My precious.

559
01:04:14,235 --> 01:04:16,032
My precious vase!

560
01:04:16,032 --> 01:04:19,250
My precious!

561
01:04:25,814 --> 01:04:29,753
You! Please spare me my life.

562
01:04:29,753 --> 01:04:31,386
I'll give you all this

563
01:04:31,386 --> 01:04:34,437
but please spare my life.

564
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:36,957
Let me go.

565
01:04:39,328 --> 01:04:42,304
Father! Father!

566
01:04:52,494 --> 01:04:55,962
I hear the noblemen keep secret vaults.

567
01:04:55,962 --> 01:04:57,674
Is there one here as well?

568
01:04:57,674 --> 01:05:00,812
Do you plan on robbing us?

569
01:05:00,812 --> 01:05:03,242
You might as well try.

570
01:05:03,242 --> 01:05:05,063
We don't have any here.

571
01:05:10,078 --> 01:05:12,931
That house over there is always in the dark.

572
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:17,859
No one lives there.

573
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:25,893
Man's greed has no end.

574
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:44,721
Why did you kill him?

575
01:05:44,721 --> 01:05:47,872
Kill him? Who? What are you talking about?

576
01:05:48,613 --> 01:05:51,110
Seo Young Soo, Yi Jeong Seob!

577
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:55,730
Who told you...? Who the hell are you?

578
01:05:55,730 --> 01:06:00,061
Shim Gi Won, Gwon Doo Hyung, Kim Ik Hee, you killed them too, didn't you?

579
01:06:13,137 --> 01:06:17,042
Lee Won Ho! You killed Lee Won Ho too, didn't you?

580
01:06:17,042 --> 01:06:21,695
Lee Won Ho...you....you!

581
01:06:25,501 --> 01:06:28,049
Yes, yes.

582
01:06:28,049 --> 01:06:32,458
I sent men in all these houses.

583
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:34,859
But I just followed orders.

584
01:06:34,859 --> 01:06:36,101
Don't lie to me.

585
01:06:36,101 --> 01:06:39,078
I may look like a liar, but I never lie.

586
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,631
It's the truth.

587
01:06:41,603 --> 01:06:43,245
Who gave you the orders?

588
01:06:43,245 --> 01:06:45,377
The thing is...

589
01:06:45,377 --> 01:06:47,732
Who gave you the orders?

590
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:18,375


591
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:20,360
