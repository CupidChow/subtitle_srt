1
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:35,911
Magpie! Magpie!

2
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:43,669
I'll give you my old tooth, so please give me a new one.

3
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:47,979
You will not get another tooth.

4
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,851
What?

5
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:52,289
Why?

6
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,939
Because you're already old.

7
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:55,415
So what?

8
00:00:55,415 --> 00:00:57,810
You don't get a new tooth when you're old.

9
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,413
That doesn't make sense!

10
00:01:00,413 --> 00:01:04,273
Then, if you shave your head when you get old, your hair won't grow back!

11
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,808
Are hair and bones the same?

12
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:11,607
Bones? Then if you cut your nails when you get old, they won't grow back!

13
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:13,415
Nails aren't the same as bones...

14
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:15,598
Of course they're the same!

15
00:01:16,318 --> 00:01:17,252
It's the same..

16
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,021
just softer...

17
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:22,858
Just trust me. You won't get a new tooth.

18
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:26,161
Damn it.

19
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:30,562
That stupid magpie.

20
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:32,722
Ohh! Where are you going?

21
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,441
Don't be too upset, ok?

22
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:44,780
Of course. I'm already used to mom's beatings.

23
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,781
I know.

24
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:54,395
But why didn't you run away today?

25
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:59,661
Hmm.. nothing. 
 or maybe because I realized I deserve that beating.

26
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:04,366
Oh my, you really sound mature now.

27
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:10,170
Father... 
 What?

28
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:13,478
Thank you. 
 Why?

29
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:16,345
For everything.

30
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:21,811
You punk. You don't have to thank your parent.

31
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:27,589
But, if you're grateful, then pass the civil exam.

32
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:32,233
Agrh.. I've had enough.

33
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:39,678
Ok, I will not tell you to go to school. 
 But be sure to study on your own.

34
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:45,826
Study, then show those noble brats they're wrong. Ok?

35
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:50,358
Aigoo.. I need to get a drink.

36
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:54,594
Be careful on your way down.

37
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:41,163
Hey! You brat!

38
00:03:41,163 --> 00:03:43,913
Get up! 
  Get your butt off to school!

39
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:48,067
No! I'm not going! I already quit school!

40
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,758
Oh yeah...

41
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:58,980
You brat! Then study more on your own! Get going!

42
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,552
What's wrong with you? 
  You brat! Hey!

43
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,530
Why are you beating me?

44
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:13,395
Mom! I don't want to take the civil exam!

45
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:15,704
What's the point of taking it anyway?

46
00:04:15,704 --> 00:04:19,989
Go now. Making such fuss early in the morning... 
 You chase the luck away.

47
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,406
Mom, come on! I'm your son.

48
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:28,910
But maybe my good looks will get some luck.

49
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,214
This brat! Go wash up!

50
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:34,850
Father!

51
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:40,088
FIne! I'll wash up! 
 Now!

52
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,076
Please allow me to pour some drinks.

53
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,846
Please enjoy yourself.

54
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:21,150
I really don't know what His Majesty 
 plans to do with Shim Gi Won.

55
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,199
Wait...

56
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,866
Excellency!

57
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:34,485
You must read His Majesty's mind.

58
00:05:34,485 --> 00:05:39,946
What did he say at the court today?

59
00:05:40,398 --> 00:05:47,723
 "My heart which has been betrayed by a close friend has been torn into pieces..." 

60
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,885
Isn't that what he said?

61
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:51,126
So what?

62
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:55,597
Can't you read between the lines?

63
00:05:55,797 --> 00:06:00,669
Since His Majesty's heart has been torn into pieces...

64
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:09,080
Evidently, the heart of the one who betrayed him 
 should be torn into pieces too!

65
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:16,351
Which means... 
 death by cutting the body.

66
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:19,254
What are you saying?

67
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:21,780
You are not making sense!

68
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,661
Lord Shim is a noble...
 and a friend of His Majesty too!

69
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:31,602
His Majesty wouldn't do that to his friend!

70
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:36,404
You should remember that! 
 But wait! What are you doing here?

71
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:40,815
This banquet is for the lords
 who have passed the civil exam.

72
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:43,662
Get out of here!

73
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,583
Oh... then please enjoy your evening.

74
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:57,492
They'll kill him by cutting his body in four. 
 But why would such a high official plot treason?

75
00:06:57,492 --> 00:07:03,176
Who knows? But the rumor is he's been framed.

76
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:14,509
Hey, you!

77
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:32,628
Hey, just five cents, you can buy our latest product... 
 We even have toys that can help you to have a child.

78
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:38,867
And a glove that will keep you from getting one! 
 Fish for anything you want, just 5 nickels.

79
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:42,137
Hey! Your line is tangled up!

80
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:46,460
Time's up! Too bad!

81
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:48,343
Again.

82
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:04,159
Father... Father!

83
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,397
Father!

84
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:12,034
Father! Our new business is a huge success!

85
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:15,370
Father...

86
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:22,778
My... my... my money!

87
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:27,415
Here, your customer came by.

88
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:30,152
Uncle, can I borrow some money?

89
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:32,687
Oh my, I don't even have a cent!

90
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:38,493
Here you go... 
 It's the wine of a snake that ate wild ginseng.

91
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,037
Wait a minute.

92
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:58,213
Damn you! You made it with a grass snake 
  and put some dye on it!

93
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:00,048
No...

94
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:02,684
You dare cheat me?!

95
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:10,392
I've already eaten all types of snake! From Cobra to Python! 
 Arrgh! You damn!

96
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:18,400
You black mask! You're on it too, huh?

97
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,407
This purse seems familiar!

98
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:31,680
What are you talking about? It's mine! 
 You got proof? You have a name on this?

99
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,249
What's that?

100
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:36,718
Look!

101
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:38,687
"Yong"

102
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:41,323
How did that get in there?

103
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:46,962
I have a habit of writing my name on my things!

104
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:51,767
Look, Yong!

105
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:58,273
What do you have to say now? I got you!

106
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:06,748
Then tell him I'll wait at the bar over there.

107
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:11,686
That arrogant!

108
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:19,661
Eat! Don't even bother to chew! Just swallow!

109
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,096
Move! What are you doing?

110
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:25,651
Father.

111
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:30,644
A man needs some meat on him.

112
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:37,479
I've got to fatten him up to get a fair price when 
 I sell him to the Ming merchants.

113
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:41,411
Look, please give me some more time.

114
00:10:41,411 --> 00:10:45,186
Then pay up!

115
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,857
Didn't you sign a release of your 
 son's body parts? Huh?

116
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:52,527
Take him away!

117
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:59,839
Look! I will have some huge sum of money soon.

118
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,406
Huge sum of money? Then how?

119
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:06,687
By hunting down animals?

120
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:09,382
When? In the next few decades?

121
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:11,098
I really mean it!

122
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:14,587
Just give me some more time.

123
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:18,673
Ten days! You have exactly ten days!

124
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:25,826
This is your last chance! 
 Either get the money or fatten your son up! Got that?

125
00:11:25,826 --> 00:11:30,911
Excuse me. Did you see a tall bald guy?

126
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:31,834
No?

127
00:11:34,908 --> 00:11:36,745
Father!

128
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:40,013
Father, you're so dead...

129
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:40,881
So dead!

130
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:43,803
Stop right there! Father!

131
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,000
Father! 
 Father!

132
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,238
Where did he go?

133
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:55,031
Welcome.

134
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,343
Out of there!

135
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,951
Get out! I know you're here! Open the door!

136
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:28,572
You're dead meat when I'm done!

137
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:31,465
You will die of embarrassment first!

138
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:34,201
Want to be thrown into a pit of shit?!

139
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:37,137
Once more and it'll be my 100th time!

140
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:40,340
My nickname is pile of shit! You can even ask my father!

141
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,609
You don't have much to show anyway!

142
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:49,816
But where did this old fart go?

143
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,222
Just wait! You old fart.

144
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:54,387
You!

145
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:56,611
You there! Where's that weakling?

146
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:58,191
Who? Are you talking about Yong?

147
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:01,361
He was there a minute ago.

148
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,097
Or maybe he's in the outhouse. (bathroom)

149
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:13,974
What is it?

150
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:15,201
Keep it down.

151
00:13:18,393 --> 00:13:22,367
It is rumored that you investigate too.

152
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:25,371
You know what? I'm the best in town.

153
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,419
But it'll cost you money.

154
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:28,555
You find people too?

155
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:32,626
Of course! I'm the expert in that area! 
 Men who took your money, or your runaway wife.

156
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:36,473
Someone I know is looking for government slaves.

157
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:38,031
Which area?

158
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:39,299
I'm not really sure...

159
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:42,535
But I do have their name.

160
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:44,638
Really?

161
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:46,740
Uhm.. let's see..

162
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,044
In cases like this, it'll take more time and money.

163
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:53,246
Just find them for me. Money is not a problem.

164
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:54,514
I understand.

165
00:13:54,648 --> 00:13:57,150
I have contacts all over the country.

166
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,351
Hey!

167
00:13:58,351 --> 00:14:00,754
But be sure to have the money ready! Ok!

168
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:02,088
Let's go!

169
00:14:11,398 --> 00:14:12,666
Where's my money?

170
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:16,670
Well..

171
00:14:17,237 --> 00:14:18,305
I lost it...

172
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:19,606
Lost it?

173
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:26,179
Don't be too disappointed. 
 It went back to its owner, after all.

174
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,784
You should have denied it! 
 -I did!

175
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:36,323
But there's one way to get it back.

176
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:49,712
Hey! You who have nothing to show!

177
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:51,932
You!

178
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:54,497
This wicked woman!

179
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:58,367
Sorry about that! I thought you were my father.

180
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,109
As an apology..

181
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:04,737
Have a drink.

182
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,770
You're so unkind.

183
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,388
Then I'll drink it.

184
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:19,230
You know I heard the story.

185
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:22,502
That my father took away your money.

186
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:28,373
I had no idea! How could he be so shameless?

187
00:15:28,957 --> 00:15:30,577
I can't bear to face you.

188
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:32,814
I'm sorry. I apologize on his behalf.

189
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:36,683
You really don't need to do this.

190
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,487
But I'll only forgive you just this once!

191
00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:47,608
By the way.

192
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:49,140
I heard you're looking for someone.

193
00:15:52,236 --> 00:15:54,574
You even asked Slick, right?

194
00:15:55,863 --> 00:15:57,217
How did you know that?

195
00:15:57,217 --> 00:16:00,904
He told you he got contacts all over the county?

196
00:16:00,904 --> 00:16:02,802
We're one of them.

197
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:04,082
What?

198
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:09,359
Treason?

199
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:12,529
Then that's under the Royal Guard's juristriction.

200
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:16,865
There must be a record of treason criminals in their office.

201
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:18,058
Royal Guards?

202
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:25,424
Nice. One of us is a royal guard.

203
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:27,802
I'll call in a favor to him.

204
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:32,534
But keep it a secret to Slick, all right?

205
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:37,650
With that temper of his, he'll set his hair on fire if he finds out.

206
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:40,113
I understand.

207
00:16:46,697 --> 00:16:49,457
Anything interesting here?

208
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,923
That man, why was he peeking? There's nothing to eat here. He seems pretty normal too.

209
00:17:05,923 --> 00:17:06,373
Why?

210
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:11,744
There is some punk peeking inside.

211
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:14,064
Such a weirdo.

212
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:31,358
He's no pushover. He wants 400 coins but 
 I bargained it down to 200 coins.

213
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:35,772
What about you? I only have 200 coins.

214
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,733
I don't make much from this kind of work anyway.

215
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:42,198
Since I owe you one for my father, we'll call it even.

216
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:45,977
Take this.

217
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:47,301
And...

218
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:50,917
This is the information about the person I'm looking for.

219
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:55,155
Ok. Go wait over there.

220
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:14,469
Here. As promised, 20 coins for you.

221
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:18,300
Come on! You're only sneaking out a piece of paper! It's too expensive!

222
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:20,833
Death by cutting body parts?

223
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:24,818
You're a smart man.

224
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:27,187
Thank you.

225
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,309
Ok you may leave now.

226
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:36,363
You'll hear good news soon.

227
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:39,694
Excuse me.

228
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:57,927
Do you know why I still keep him close?

229
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,126
That man  has many weaknesses.

230
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:07,880
And those are the ones that are resilient and quick.

231
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:12,216
They know how to survive.

232
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:14,434
But.

233
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:19,400
Sa Cheon, I know why you are worried.

234
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:23,736
We took care of Shim Gi Won.

235
00:19:26,178 --> 00:19:28,281
Kwon Du Hyung is the only one left.

236
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:29,849
Yes.

237
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:34,186
He will be killed within a few days.

238
00:19:41,795 --> 00:19:45,976
You're a close friend of Yong?

239
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,401
So?

240
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:51,171
I heard Yong's parents are not his biological parents.

241
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:53,777
What are you saying?

242
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:59,455
The rumor must've spread because his mom's so hard on him.

243
00:19:59,455 --> 00:20:05,619
But even I think she's his stepmother
 He even ran away from home because of her.

244
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:06,620
She's hard on him?

245
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,487
Yes.

246
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:09,322
Dae Shik.

247
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:13,660
Get us some food.

248
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,594
And treat me right.

249
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:21,668
Yong is not adopted, is he?

250
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,971
What are you talking about?

251
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:27,440
That man was asking.

252
00:20:28,642 --> 00:20:30,810
I practically raised him.

253
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:38,485
You remember it, don't you? 
 I dropped him when he was three and he fell on a rock.

254
00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:42,388
That's true.

255
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:46,426
That's why he's a bit dumb until now.

256
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:52,840
That's not true! He's cunning as a fox!

257
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:04,210
That's the man.

258
00:21:05,845 --> 00:21:09,816
He's the one who was lurking around our house.

259
00:21:11,918 --> 00:21:13,386
He's dead meat this time.

260
00:21:16,223 --> 00:21:19,726
How come no one knows?

261
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:21,428
You, bastard!

262
00:21:27,072 --> 00:21:32,635
Who are you? Why are you searching for information about Yong?

263
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:37,681
Yong isn't your natural son, right?

264
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:43,375
What are you talking about? He is indeed my child.

265
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:46,613
He's the son of traitor Lee Won Ho.

266
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:48,592
What are you saying?

267
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:53,767
Yong is the son that I bore in my womb and that I gave birth to.

268
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:57,040
Why are you questioning about someone else's son?

269
00:21:57,515 --> 00:21:59,371
You think I don't know?

270
00:21:59,371 --> 00:22:04,839
Do you guys know the charge for hiding the son of a traitor? Do you know that?

271
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:07,584
If you don't believe me, then go ahead and notify the authority.

272
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:13,040
But, if it's proven that he's the one I gave birth to, don't you dare dream of getting away with it!

273
00:22:13,756 --> 00:22:16,197
Let's go!

274
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:26,267
This rascal!

275
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:30,128
Yong...Yong is my son.

276
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:34,224
Just look at me! We're exactly identical.

277
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:41,383
What?

278
00:22:41,383 --> 00:22:45,752
The records of the male and female servants you are looking for are all in a secret vault.

279
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:46,516
A secret vault?

280
00:22:46,516 --> 00:22:48,117
You're not allowed to be there.

281
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,123
Low ranking officers like me don't have permission to get in there.

282
00:22:50,123 --> 00:22:54,256
And even someone of a higher rank like Mr. Do Si Hyun can't walk in freely.

283
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:57,350
Sir!

284
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,556
I will give you 10 more pieces of silver.

285
00:22:58,556 --> 00:23:01,600
Even if you gave me fifty thousand pieces, the impossible just can't be done.

286
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,325
I want to live long.

287
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:07,248
Sir!

288
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,365
Then we won't be able to make more money.

289
00:23:13,376 --> 00:23:16,101
Got a better idea?

290
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:19,885
Listen!

291
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:20,866
Share some tok with your neighbors.

292
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:21,867
Tok?

293
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:25,232
You don't mean to tell him to share tok for Yong's birthday, do you?

294
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:30,905
Geez, the way you think...

295
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,453
What then?

296
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:36,615
No... Just bury him.

297
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,663
What? 
 Bury him?

298
00:23:38,663 --> 00:23:40,064
Father...

299
00:23:40,064 --> 00:23:43,144
No, I don't mean to bury him as a whole.

300
00:23:43,144 --> 00:23:46,097
Leave out the head, just bury the body...

301
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:48,100
I just want to scare...

302
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,789
Better go and share the cake of Tok...

303
00:23:51,953 --> 00:23:55,177
Why suddenly share Yong's birthday tok with us?

304
00:23:55,637 --> 00:24:00,352
Anyway, if anyone asks, just tell Yong is my son, okay?

305
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:02,473
Right!

306
00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:05,573
But who is he anyway?

307
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:15,039
Yong's real father had some huge debts and fled or something like that.

308
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,437
So they are looking for Yong everywhere.

309
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:20,983
I understand...

310
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:22,489
Get it?

311
00:24:22,489 --> 00:24:26,413
But losing your tooth makes you look even more attractive!

312
00:24:26,413 --> 00:24:28,469
This lady...

313
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:30,588
How could this be attractive?

314
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:32,700
Charge of your business, and remember what I said...

315
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,971
Okay?

316
00:24:35,644 --> 00:24:38,327
I have been married for long...

317
00:24:38,327 --> 00:24:40,266
Am I really attractive?

318
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:43,824
I told you I'd fill that hole in your tooth and your heart.

319
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:47,720
The virgin men are so difficult to entice.

320
00:24:48,544 --> 00:24:50,693
Virgin?

321
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,915
That man is still virgin?

322
00:24:53,915 --> 00:24:56,317
Isn't he Yong's father?

323
00:24:56,317 --> 00:24:59,860
Yes, of course.

324
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,064
But what do you mean, he's still a virgin?

325
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:07,019
When Yong was young, he was very sick...

326
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:10,539
Since then he started to sleep separately from his wife...

327
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:13,419
So just between us, we call him 'virgin'.

328
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:15,995
Yong was sick?

329
00:25:16,896 --> 00:25:18,304
He was seriously sick.

330
00:25:18,304 --> 00:25:22,357
so sick he can not remember anything from childhood...

331
00:25:22,357 --> 00:25:25,915
He carried around medicines the whole time.

332
00:25:28,395 --> 00:25:31,000
Carried around medicines?

333
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,488
You're dead now!

334
00:25:35,392 --> 00:25:37,243
Move!

335
00:25:40,924 --> 00:25:42,747
Hey!

336
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,831
Where is that girl?

337
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:48,221
Hey, what's wrong?

338
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:51,429
The father and daughter cheated me!

339
00:25:52,743 --> 00:25:55,141
My money!

340
00:26:08,395 --> 00:26:13,628
Enjoy!

341
00:26:13,628 --> 00:26:17,384
Everyone to enjoy and eat!

342
00:26:17,384 --> 00:26:18,705
Do not be so!

343
00:26:18,705 --> 00:26:22,645
Do not bother.

344
00:26:22,645 --> 00:26:26,492
If you don't have enough drinks, then order some more!

345
00:26:26,492 --> 00:26:29,637
I'll be dancing now.

346
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,773
Serving more wine!

347
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:35,680
Master, you have a guest.

348
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,408
Who? 
 A guest?

349
00:26:37,408 --> 00:26:40,133
He is waiting in the back.

350
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:47,036
I'll go out for a while.

351
00:26:47,036 --> 00:26:50,983
Even if I'm not here, please enjoy...

352
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:53,658
I'll be back soon.

353
00:26:53,658 --> 00:26:56,709
Eat, eat.

354
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:17,381


355
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:21,625
I'm sorry.

356
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:23,061
All right, master?

357
00:27:23,061 --> 00:27:25,100
You're so bad.

358
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:29,433
Oh, you're here.

359
00:27:38,037 --> 00:27:41,180
That son of yours, master. I remembered him as a child.

360
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:46,408
Really? He said he wanted to take the exam for the civil service or something.

361
00:27:46,408 --> 00:27:48,661
In that situation, it would be difficult to pass the exam.

362
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:50,658
What?

363
00:27:50,658 --> 00:27:52,960
Oh, congratulations.

364
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,283
I hear you've been appointed as both the Strategic advisor and spokesman for the Palace.

365
00:27:57,283 --> 00:28:01,308
That's why I invited some noblemen to eat here...

366
00:28:01,308 --> 00:28:03,965
All thanks to you...

367
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:08,880
Oh, no thanks to Shim Gi Won, I should say.

368
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:15,941
I fixed a nice table in the next room, so treat yourself.

369
00:28:26,616 --> 00:28:29,140
Hey, Swe Dol!

370
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,873
Doctor!

371
00:28:30,873 --> 00:28:33,027
Why are you here? 
 You are here for a medical visit?

372
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:34,492
Yes!

373
00:28:34,492 --> 00:28:37,799
So is Yong preparing for his exam?

374
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,276
Of course, you can count on him for being first already.

375
00:28:41,276 --> 00:28:42,613
Yes!

376
00:28:42,613 --> 00:28:46,353
Hey, before you take the exam, bring him to me.

377
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:49,099
I'll broil a nice soup for him.

378
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:50,955
Isn't that really expensive?

379
00:28:50,955 --> 00:28:53,624
Thank you, doctor.

380
00:28:53,624 --> 00:28:58,585
Yong still doesn't remember his childhood, does he?

381
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:01,871
No...

382
00:29:01,871 --> 00:29:04,437
Well, well. Go ahead and keep up with your business.

383
00:29:04,437 --> 00:29:05,361
All right then.

384
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:06,771
Yes.

385
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:13,200
He really has a good heart.

386
00:29:13,696 --> 00:29:17,296
I could not raise my own son the way he does with Yong.

387
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:24,456
Fine. 
 I'll find it myself.

388
00:29:24,456 --> 00:29:26,981
What is so frightening about the Forbidden Palace?

389
00:29:29,745 --> 00:29:34,075
Mom! Sister! 
 Wait for me.

390
00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:36,433
Geom will be there for you soon.

391
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:56,144
These people have no respect for anyone!

392
00:29:57,457 --> 00:29:59,280
Who are you?

393
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,376
I just came to watch...

394
00:30:03,808 --> 00:30:07,877
The Forbidden Palace, so this is the place where ghosts and and demons can be captured.

395
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:13,979
You who protect the people, keep up the good work.

396
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:38,865
What are you doing?

397
00:30:38,865 --> 00:30:41,264
Just push them!

398
00:30:44,412 --> 00:30:46,363
Move it!

399
00:30:47,285 --> 00:30:51,560
Who dares disturb the Forbidden Palace!

400
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:56,116
How dare you?

401
00:30:56,116 --> 00:31:01,466
Tomorrow... I will stand before the king and the mandarins.

402
00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:07,589
To uncover the secret of the conspiracy of treason.

403
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,524
Let me go!

404
00:31:10,524 --> 00:31:12,572
What are you doing?

405
00:31:12,572 --> 00:31:17,067
Gently, these are noble mandarins.

406
00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:19,963
So bring them out gently.

407
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:25,787
Let me go! 
 What are you doing?

408
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,005
"Kwon Doo Hyun, nephew of Shim Gi Won"

409
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:47,369
Here, try...

410
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:51,800
this is a special tea made from a hundred-year old tree.

411
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,400
that only the King can drink.

412
00:31:56,447 --> 00:32:03,135
I only bring it out for very important guests so please enjoy it before it gets cold.

413
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:06,683
If you don't coordinate the tasks at Private Law department things will become difficult.

414
00:32:06,683 --> 00:32:10,192
That's what I'm saying.

415
00:32:10,192 --> 00:32:14,205
How dare you break into Forbidden Palace's Office of Records Archive in broad daylight.

416
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:21,486
It will become very difficult for me. The Court's business has its own rules and regulations.

417
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:24,627
Your words are harsh! What do you mean by 'breaking in'!

418
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:27,780
For several days now,

419
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,820
we told you to give us all the documents regarding Shim Gi Won's conspiracy.

420
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:38,027
Up to now you haven't done a thing.

421
00:32:38,027 --> 00:32:40,499
Tsk, tsk..

422
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:43,872
Because you didn't bring the edict here.

423
00:32:43,872 --> 00:32:52,519
Fine, I'll bring the Imperial Edict tomorrow, so prepare to hand us all the documents.

424
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:57,198
Do as you please then.

425
00:33:01,536 --> 00:33:06,753
Oh, you should be with us tomorrow as well.

426
00:33:07,496 --> 00:33:11,403
We spoke to the criminal Kwon Doo Hyun while he was being questioned,

427
00:33:11,403 --> 00:33:15,417
and tomorrow in front of the King and court,

428
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:19,937
he said he will reveal everything regarding the conspiracy.

429
00:33:19,937 --> 00:33:23,125
The truth behind the conspiracy you say?

430
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:28,582
That I don't know. I suppose everything will be revealed tomorrow.

431
00:33:28,582 --> 00:33:31,639
See you at the trial then.

432
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:33,862
Let's go, my lord.

433
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,524
Swe Dol! Where is Swe Dol now?

434
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:44,304
Oh, my. Swe Dol!

435
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:47,564
Is Swe Dol a pair of shoes? Why would he be here?

436
00:33:47,564 --> 00:33:52,037
I think I got him into trouble.

437
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:54,952
Trouble? Did you grab him or something?

438
00:33:55,485 --> 00:33:56,673
You made him fall for you?

439
00:33:56,673 --> 00:34:00,221
Am I a wrestler, making him fall for what?

440
00:34:01,893 --> 00:34:05,451
I... I told that guy..

441
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,400
Is there..

442
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:20,504
Doctor Song.

443
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:40,497
That leech! If he meets Doctor Song, he'll find everything out.

444
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:43,442
Dad, please try and stall him.

445
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:50,436
Madam, I'm looking for Doctor Song who is rather short.

446
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:51,667
I don't know.

447
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:54,023
What do you know then!?

448
00:34:56,414 --> 00:34:59,862
What do you have your eyes for if not to see? Watch where you're walking!

449
00:34:59,862 --> 00:35:00,918
What did you say?!

450
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:03,949
What, now you can't use your ears properly?

451
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:08,115
Who the heck are you?

452
00:35:08,115 --> 00:35:13,456
I'm going to walk away because I'm short on time so watch where you're going next time!

453
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:15,619
Whatever!

454
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:22,000
What a crazy fellow!

455
00:35:26,837 --> 00:35:33,529
Yong? Of course I know him. I know his father well too.

456
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:36,261
There is talk that Yong,

457
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:42,406
that he was really sick when he was young. It was so bad that his memory isn't all there.

458
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:52,041
Why yes he was terribly sick. His fever was really high that morning.

459
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:57,542
One's memory wouldn't be completely intact after a fever like that.

460
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,915
How old was he when that happened?

461
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:03,315
He was...

462
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:06,954
a little over 2 years old.

463
00:36:06,954 --> 00:36:10,816
Wasn't it when he was about 9 years old?

464
00:36:10,816 --> 00:36:19,778
What are you saying? You think I don't know the difference between a 2 year old and a 9 year old!?

465
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:22,079
How dare you?

466
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:29,909
Take your medicine and go!

467
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:31,801
Here you go.

468
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:41,049
Yong's father is really something. Raising a child that's not his so well.

469
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:44,761
Raising another person's child isn't so easy..

470
00:36:48,517 --> 00:36:50,433
Crazy.

471
00:36:56,252 --> 00:36:57,623
Did you tell him what we told you to say?

472
00:36:57,623 --> 00:37:01,976
Of course! He was completely fooled.

473
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:53,945
What is this?

474
00:37:53,945 --> 00:37:56,804
The High Court hasn't been effective lately.

475
00:37:57,952 --> 00:38:02,935
Anyways, Kwon Doo Hyun says he will reveal the truth about the conspiracy tomorrow?

476
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:05,724
Please don't concern yourself.

477
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:11,566
As soon as I return into Forbidden Palace, I will kill him.

478
00:38:11,566 --> 00:38:14,550
How will you be able to handle that?

479
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,862
He's a criminal who is due to be killed anyways and,

480
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:21,826
if he's already dead from the torture during questioning then..

481
00:38:21,826 --> 00:38:25,094
Do you think the High Court will just stand idle and do nothing?

482
00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:27,690
Are you trying to make things bigger?

483
00:38:29,549 --> 00:38:30,594
Then how...

484
00:38:30,594 --> 00:38:34,098
We need to make Doo Hyun shut his mouth!

485
00:38:34,098 --> 00:38:37,444
Yes, I understand.

486
00:38:37,444 --> 00:38:44,654
But if the document falls into the hands of High Court,

487
00:38:44,654 --> 00:38:47,779
it will be quickly revealed that they are false documents.

488
00:38:50,403 --> 00:38:53,032
Those will have to disappear then too.

489
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:57,085
What? By themselves?

490
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:01,428
Cheon, you need to help me.

491
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:03,694
Yes.

492
00:39:24,814 --> 00:39:31,982
You plan to expose the truth regarding the conspiracy in front of the King and High Court?

493
00:39:33,568 --> 00:39:36,162
Do your best.

494
00:39:53,237 --> 00:39:56,366
I don't want to see the King in this state tomorrow.

495
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:58,741
Please give me a chance to fix myself up before appearing before the King.

496
00:40:00,282 --> 00:40:05,287
I'll ask the upper authority for permission and if they agree then I'll prepare some new clothes for you.

497
00:40:06,418 --> 00:40:08,441
Thank you.

498
00:40:34,004 --> 00:40:36,545
Fine,

499
00:40:36,545 --> 00:40:38,251
Let's give this a try.

500
00:41:42,308 --> 00:41:47,072
Thank you. Even when I go to the other side,

501
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:49,162
I will not forget your kindness.

502
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:40,721
What's that?

503
00:42:42,856 --> 00:42:44,640
Fire?

504
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:55,373
What's going on?

505
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:57,027
The Record Archives are on fire.

506
00:42:57,027 --> 00:42:58,935
What? The Records Archives?

507
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:03,608
Not there! Not there!

508
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:07,518
Move aside. Just for a second!

509
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:11,970
 Push, push, push. Move out of the way. 

510
00:43:54,976 --> 00:43:57,011
How can I find it?

511
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:06,147
Where is it?

512
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,680
Watch out! It's dangerous!

513
00:44:19,663 --> 00:44:21,441
Who are you? I've never seen you before.

514
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:24,284
What are you doing in the Records Archives?

515
00:44:26,702 --> 00:44:29,227
Get that guy!

516
00:45:10,691 --> 00:45:12,364
This way!

517
00:45:45,615 --> 00:45:46,709
It's him!

518
00:46:23,262 --> 00:46:25,229
He's not here. Let's go!

519
00:47:02,746 --> 00:47:06,315
Father... Mother.

520
00:47:08,157 --> 00:47:12,011
What do I do now?

521
00:47:26,414 --> 00:47:32,350
Don't just take a look but also bring back all the dirty clothes too.

522
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:38,027
Ah, don't pretend you're the master's son in front of others.

523
00:47:38,027 --> 00:47:40,386
Yes.

524
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:58,316
 Look over everything. Be quick. 

525
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:08,460
Aigoo, you've come.

526
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,918
What a terrible thing to have happened.

527
00:48:12,918 --> 00:48:19,430
Some guy must have lit on a candle in the middle of the night.

528
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,196
That then turned into..

529
00:48:23,621 --> 00:48:28,297
What are you doing over there instead of going out and bring in the guy that did this.

530
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:32,539
I will get the one responsible for this

531
00:48:32,539 --> 00:48:38,415
and he will be severely and thoroughly punished.

532
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:41,181
Please hand over the criminal Kwon Doo Hyun.

533
00:48:41,181 --> 00:48:46,445
Of course. Shall we go?

534
00:48:58,084 --> 00:49:00,881
Escort criminal Kwon Doo Hyun back to High Court!

535
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:02,824
Yes.

536
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,306
My lord.

537
00:49:24,164 --> 00:49:26,572
General Prosecutor of Forbidden Palace,

538
00:49:26,572 --> 00:49:28,275
Your relative..

539
00:49:28,275 --> 00:49:30,706
Tell him to come in.

540
00:49:31,663 --> 00:49:32,728
Please come in.

541
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:39,062
Alright.

542
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:41,455
Wait right here.

543
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:46,169
He seems to have killed himself by biting his tongue off.

544
00:49:46,169 --> 00:49:47,457
Are you sure about that? 
 Yes.

545
00:49:47,457 --> 00:49:49,379
There are no signs of other causes.

546
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,425
Let's go for now.

547
00:49:53,425 --> 00:50:00,310
I have to report back to the King. So write down the results of the recent investigation in full detail.

548
00:50:04,946 --> 00:50:07,958
Bring the body to the Corpse Gate.

549
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:09,142
Yes.

550
00:50:10,323 --> 00:50:11,648
Let's go.

551
00:50:11,648 --> 00:50:14,140
Prosecutor of Forbidden Palace.

552
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:14,918
What?

553
00:50:14,918 --> 00:50:20,147
There is somthing strange here. There are drag marks in the grass.

554
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:24,292
Isn't this a sign that the chair was dragged to the door?

555
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:28,351
I am certain that I replaced the grass patch last night.

556
00:50:28,351 --> 00:50:32,627
Are you saying that someone dragged him to the door and killed him?

557
00:50:32,627 --> 00:50:35,333
The guy that was way over here?

558
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:38,383
Was dragged to this point? How could that possibly happen?

559
00:50:38,383 --> 00:50:41,990
Didn't you say that the door was locked when you first discovered what had happened?

560
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:43,182
Well then,

561
00:50:43,182 --> 00:50:47,655
Who else has a key to this door?

562
00:50:47,655 --> 00:50:51,891
I have the only key.

563
00:50:52,973 --> 00:50:55,537
You killed him? You did it, didn't you?

564
00:50:56,247 --> 00:51:00,299
Did a ghost kill him? Was it a ghost?

565
00:51:00,299 --> 00:51:02,821
Why are you talking rubbish when you don't know a thing.

566
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:05,316
Excuse me, a mark on this chest indicates that,

567
00:51:05,316 --> 00:51:07,637
he was stabbed.

568
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:17,889
Looking at the blotch seems like it was being thrust in by an iron hook.

569
00:51:17,889 --> 00:51:19,956
Over here.

570
00:51:19,956 --> 00:51:23,368
He was dragged by a hook from outside the window and,

571
00:51:23,368 --> 00:51:25,100
and maybe he was forced to bite his own tongue?

572
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:30,354
So there is no need to open the door, you could still..

573
00:51:30,354 --> 00:51:32,902
That could have happened.

574
00:51:32,902 --> 00:51:35,151
Boy!

575
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:40,186
Are you an investigator? How dare you come here and pass judgement here.

576
00:51:40,484 --> 00:51:42,359
Write it down quickly,

577
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:45,022
Death by biting of one's own tongue!

578
00:51:48,742 --> 00:51:51,817
Be careful not to cross the line. Go!

579
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:01,162
Lord Prosecutor, who is he?

580
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:04,479
He's just someone who lives in our house.

581
00:52:05,517 --> 00:52:09,117
Can't you tell by looking!? He's the errand boy!

582
00:52:09,117 --> 00:52:14,499
You don't seem to understand. The Forbidden Palace is in a state of emergency.

583
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:17,409
There is no time to meet with such weak evidence now.

584
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:19,899
I'm saying that I'm completely sure.

585
00:52:19,899 --> 00:52:24,782
Just take Soe Dol for questioning and he will tell you everything.

586
00:52:24,782 --> 00:52:29,746
Let's say what you're telling me is the truth. But who is Soe Dol?

587
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:35,502
Regardless if it's his son or not, what's that got to do with the son of a traitor?

588
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:39,441
What I meant was, more than 10 years ago.

589
00:52:39,441 --> 00:52:43,787
If you want to receive the reward, then go and look for some actual proof.

590
00:52:43,787 --> 00:52:45,266
 My lord, shall we go. 

591
00:52:45,266 --> 00:52:46,266
 Let's go. 

592
00:52:46,266 --> 00:52:48,029
No wait....

593
00:52:48,758 --> 00:52:50,061
Proof?

594
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:54,587
Where is there better proof than...

595
00:52:54,587 --> 00:52:57,362
My lord. My lord.

596
00:52:57,362 --> 00:53:01,173
You jerk...

597
00:53:04,173 --> 00:53:05,998
It seems that the gentleman was right.

598
00:53:05,998 --> 00:53:07,042
About what?

599
00:53:07,042 --> 00:53:15,050
I don't think he killed himself, wouldn't you agree? He was suppose to reveal the truth tomorrow so why would he kill himself?

600
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,611
Stop talking nonsense.

601
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:18,482
This isn't nonsense.

602
00:53:18,482 --> 00:53:21,995
What about the guy who set fire to the Record Archives?

603
00:53:21,995 --> 00:53:23,280
We never got that guy, right?

604
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,147
Yes, he snuck out like a rat.

605
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:53,028
Who are you?

606
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:57,976
No, you can't!

607
00:54:13,892 --> 00:54:15,455
Who was that?

608
00:54:15,455 --> 00:54:16,860
Did you see his face?

609
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,487
I don't think he was a guard.

610
00:54:21,908 --> 00:54:23,861
What is that?

611
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:27,493
I took it from that guy.

612
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:41,528
 Please tell Geom, 

613
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:46,543
  Before I die, there is something I want you to know that's why I wrote this in a hurry. 

614
00:54:46,543 --> 00:54:50,065
 The person who killed your father is.. 

615
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:01,692
It's regarding the unfair death of your father.

616
00:55:17,241 --> 00:55:20,949
What now? It's in the hands of those officers.

617
00:55:24,411 --> 00:55:28,907
Even if you are full of suspision, you have no proof.

618
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:35,532
Those guys at the High Court are probably hopping mad right now.

619
00:55:36,986 --> 00:55:40,185
You took care of the problem, right?

620
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:46,246
Of course. Kwon Doo Hyun was certified as biting his own tongue to commit suicide.

621
00:55:46,246 --> 00:55:51,273
The related documents at Records Archive have been relocated to a secret place.

622
00:55:52,908 --> 00:55:58,445
If they knew that all the burned documents were fake, they'd probably fall over.

623
00:56:01,603 --> 00:56:03,780
You did good work.

624
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,479
No problem.

625
00:56:06,479 --> 00:56:11,378
I almost got busted by that smart fellow Shi Hoo.

626
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:20,271
After seeing the tear in Kwon Doo Hyun's clothes he got suspicious.

627
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:27,993
Those who go through torture already have tears in their clothes.

628
00:56:27,993 --> 00:56:29,819
How did he know?

629
00:56:31,517 --> 00:56:39,256
Kwon Doo Hyun wore new clothes to meet the Master of High Court.

630
00:56:39,256 --> 00:56:42,767
I thought it was his final request so I showed a little mercy.

631
00:56:43,684 --> 00:56:45,682
Master,

632
00:56:45,682 --> 00:56:49,803
have you confirmed that he left no evidence right before his death?

633
00:56:49,803 --> 00:56:56,780
Of course. We looked though all his clothes and belongings and found nothing.

634
00:57:34,835 --> 00:57:37,858
Mother, food.

635
00:57:39,437 --> 00:57:40,642
Pathetic boy.

636
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:45,568
I thought I was going to die from hunger.

637
00:57:45,568 --> 00:57:48,068
I finally feel better.

638
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:49,560
Mother.

639
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,600
Mother, it's so hard to fool around in the casino now.

640
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,200
Losing all the money is sad enough.   In addition there's nothing to eat and being thrown out as well.

641
00:57:57,496 --> 00:58:01,401
See if I ever go back to that gambling hall.

642
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:04,206
You pathetic boy.

643
00:58:04,206 --> 00:58:10,107
Your father barely slept a wink last night waiting for you, then he left at the crack of dawn to search for you.

644
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:15,663
Father shouldn't be so protective.

645
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,212
Rascal, let's see how I should beat you.

646
00:58:22,212 --> 00:58:25,516
Father!

647
00:58:26,733 --> 00:58:29,742
Dad, even dogs get left alone to eat.

648
00:58:29,742 --> 00:58:31,129
You're less than a dog.

649
00:58:31,129 --> 00:58:34,492
Why am I less than a dog? Stop it dad! Pretty Dani is watching!

650
00:58:34,492 --> 00:58:37,656
I said come here! Don't move!

651
00:58:37,656 --> 00:58:38,831
Get over here!

652
00:58:38,831 --> 00:58:41,941
You better stop right there!

653
00:58:43,761 --> 00:58:47,383
 Did you want me to become a noble person? 

654
00:58:47,383 --> 00:58:53,273
 But can you see the shell of a person I am? 

655
00:58:54,085 --> 00:58:59,503
 Is this the person you really wanted me to become, Mother? 

656
00:59:00,422 --> 00:59:02,000
  I... 

657
00:59:03,192 --> 00:59:05,281
 am jealous of that boy. 

658
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:18,694
Wait.

659
00:59:24,384 --> 00:59:26,507
Are these the clothes of prisoner Kwon Doo Hyun?

660
00:59:26,507 --> 00:59:29,025
Yes they are.

661
00:59:36,436 --> 00:59:38,080
What did you do with the body?

662
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,521
I had them toss the body out into the Corpse Gate.

663
00:59:40,521 --> 00:59:42,552
I must go check it for myself.

664
00:59:42,552 --> 00:59:44,857
My Lord.

665
00:59:45,855 --> 00:59:48,454
Why are you guys in panic mode?

666
00:59:49,245 --> 00:59:51,652
Kwon Doo Hyun's corpse has been stolen.

667
00:59:51,652 --> 00:59:53,500
What? Stolen?

668
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:58,396
Someone suddenly hit us from the back, and by the time I came to my sense the body was gone.

669
00:59:58,396 --> 01:00:03,704
You jerk! This is why you haven't been promoted for 13 years.

670
01:00:03,704 --> 01:00:10,035
If you don't have the capability then just use your eyes!

671
01:00:10,035 --> 01:00:13,618
What should I do with you?

672
01:00:13,618 --> 01:00:15,286
Go find it.

673
01:00:15,286 --> 01:00:16,055
Yes.

674
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:28,999
Mother, where's father?

675
01:00:28,999 --> 01:00:30,531
He went to Hong Kyun's house.

676
01:00:30,531 --> 01:00:32,162
Really?

677
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:36,324
Someone was looking for you.

678
01:00:36,324 --> 01:00:37,509
Who?

679
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:41,639
I don't know.  Not long after you left.

680
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:45,153
He said he would wait for you on the Nam Mun bridge.

681
01:00:46,108 --> 01:00:48,813
Are you in debt from gambling again?

682
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:54,534
Mother, you're ruining my reputation. I never ever ask for loans.

683
01:00:54,534 --> 01:00:57,752
Pathetic fellow.

684
01:01:04,521 --> 01:01:07,197
Could it be them?

685
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:30,234
My Lord he is here.

686
01:01:30,234 --> 01:01:33,529
What are you doing?

687
01:01:44,002 --> 01:01:57,905


688
01:01:57,905 --> 01:01:59,940
