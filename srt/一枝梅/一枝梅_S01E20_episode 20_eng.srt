1
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:34,782


2
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:39,120
But the sword that killed my father

3
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,816
had all these six symbols combined.

4
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:41,639
You mean

5
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:41,994
there is one more?

6
00:00:41,994 --> 00:00:43,149
My mother?

7
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:44,637
There was a man named Lee Won Ho

8
00:00:44,637 --> 00:00:45,748
she was a maid at his household.

9
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:50,062
They take turns for patrol 7 times a day and there are 100 guard in front of the royal court.

10
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:55,982
If he is alive and enters the palace

11
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:57,405
I will make sure to get him.

12
00:00:57,405 --> 00:00:59,696
I will find out

13
00:00:59,696 --> 00:01:02,274
who killed my father.

14
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:04,246
You can't rob the palace with shabby clothes.

15
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:07,059
This... this ... where did you get it?

16
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:09,836
Geom.

17
00:01:10,673 --> 00:01:12,641
The people who killed my father

18
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:14,182
are definitely inside the palace.

19
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,778
You...

20
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:43,987
That's right.

21
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:47,393
I remember those eyes.

22
00:01:49,753 --> 00:01:52,263
I think you once came to submit a complaint.

23
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,809
But why are you here?

24
00:01:56,809 --> 00:02:04,242
I applied to work as palace guard so that I may serve my people.

25
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:06,223
Is that so?

26
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,240
But why is a palace guard doing this job?

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,447
They are in shortage of people because of the banquet and they needed it as soon as possible.

28
00:02:14,447 --> 00:02:15,982
Is that so?

29
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:18,650
What is  your name?

30
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:28,952
My name is... Oh Ryong.

31
00:02:28,952 --> 00:02:33,939
You have those same lively eyes.

32
00:02:43,776 --> 00:02:46,871
Hey! You're not Oh Ryong, you're Na Yong.

33
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:48,718
What, you've decided to change your family name?

34
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:52,035
How could I tell him my real name?

35
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:55,964
I saw that the dragon on the king's garment had five claws.

36
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:57,343
That's how I came up with Oh Ryong.

37
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,588
Oh Ryong.

38
00:02:58,588 --> 00:03:01,649
Haha. 
 Hyung, you have to go quickly.

39
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,688
From here on we'll take care of carrying out the supplies.

40
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:04,813
All right then.

41
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:06,110
I'm going.

42
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:16,356
It's definitely his friend.

43
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:18,998
He will come here for sure.

44
00:03:23,391 --> 00:03:24,915
The food warehouse has been robbed. You're wanted over there, right now!

45
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:25,620
What?

46
00:03:28,204 --> 00:03:29,153
Guard here safely.

47
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:31,471
Iljimae will definitely come here.

48
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:33,637
Don't worry.

49
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:35,689
This place is very well guarded.

50
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:37,822
Grab it down now!

51
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:42,737
That little rat! How did he hang it up there?

52
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:45,415
Slowly, slowly.

53
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:47,615
Geez.

54
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:59,400
Iljimae is robbing the food warehouse!

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,144
You are all wanted over there.

56
00:04:01,144 --> 00:04:01,730
Really?

57
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,701
Please go ahead.

58
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,391
Let's go.

59
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,874
Where is Iljimae? Where?

60
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:16,993
Why are you here?

61
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:20,829
He said that you were surrounding Iljimae and you needed back up.

62
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,101
Who said that?

63
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:24,081
That guard...

64
00:04:42,474 --> 00:04:44,444
Home quarters for the members of the royal family.

65
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:26,963
Quick!

66
00:05:26,963 --> 00:05:30,608
Can we really get out?

67
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:36,413
Look here.

68
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:38,473
He says here that we can escape! Iljimae said that.

69
00:05:38,473 --> 00:05:39,584
Dig, quick!

70
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:50,309
By any chance

71
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,381
is there a secret passage that leads to outside of the palace?

72
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:59,008
There's nothing there.

73
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:01,189
There used to be a pond here.

74
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:03,398
A secret passage?

75
00:06:03,398 --> 00:06:05,629
No, there is no such thing.

76
00:06:07,477 --> 00:06:09,750
Do you have an old map?

77
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,314
An older map that was made before this one.

78
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:14,985
An older map...

79
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:16,599
Wait.

80
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:20,979
This is the map before the coup.

81
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,440
What is this?

82
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:33,875
Why is it on that map

83
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,657
but not on this one?

84
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:40,771
Oh, that pond? They covered it up during the coup.

85
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:44,630
A pond...

86
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:49,496
They originally built a small pavilion on top of it, but because there used to be a pond, the soil crumbled

87
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:51,352
so now they have left it as bare soil.

88
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:55,383
So if you dig here, it will be very easy.

89
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:59,806
Underneath that, there are sewers that lead to outside the palace

90
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:01,458
so you...

91
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:03,618
Run! Quick!

92
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,195
The men are getting outside of the palace.

93
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,306
I will look for the entrance, so you make sure to guard the gates of the palace.

94
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,009
Somebody must be diggin on the other side too.

95
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:17,484
What? Hey!

96
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:24,084
That jerk has no respect at all! Every since he was a guard he's telling me to do this and that.

97
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:26,205
How dare you order me around?

98
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:28,137
I know!

99
00:07:29,812 --> 00:07:33,202
Let's go! Whoever catches him first wins!

100
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,727
Follow me!

101
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,113
Hey, no words yet?

102
00:07:38,113 --> 00:07:39,285
What is it?

103
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:42,320
I don't see them.

104
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:45,163
Come here!

105
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:53,071
Who are you people?

106
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:54,841
Dear sirs.

107
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,648
We hear that the rain water keeps coming through under this wall

108
00:07:57,648 --> 00:07:59,173
so we're under construction.

109
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:01,238
Construction?

110
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:02,651
Move away.

111
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,804
You bastards, you're definitely caught here. There is nowhere to go.

112
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:10,506
Hey, you guys, keep these guys here

113
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:12,116
and the rest of you, follow me.

114
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:32,477
Come quickly! I think we're nearly there.

115
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:34,548
Where is it?

116
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:37,084
Hey! It's over there!

117
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,041
Over there! Let's go!

118
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,796
Come here quickly!

119
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:05,013
We're telling you, it's not that. 
 Stay quiet!

120
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:11,263
Wow, you dug it quite well.

121
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:13,041
But why aren't they coming out?

122
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:20,664
Don't mess up with us!

123
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:23,429
That's enough. They need to breathe at least.

124
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,118
But what is this hole here?

125
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:30,166
Oh my god! Dae Shik!

126
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,078
Dae Shik!

127
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:40,284
Just in case, dig another hole.

128
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:44,505
Next to the right way out, there's a sewer canal that brings out all the filth from the palace.

129
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:52,271
It stinks!

130
00:09:52,271 --> 00:09:54,733
Hey! What is this smell?

131
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,918
I think it's... poop.

132
00:09:56,918 --> 00:09:58,067
What?

133
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:04,169
Over there! There's an exit!

134
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:05,548
Maybe that's the palace.

135
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:08,800
Yes. Let's go back there.

136
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,233
Let's corner them.

137
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,043
Go go go go!

138
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:20,046
Treasure house of the palace.

139
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:40,596
You sell just one piece of treasure

140
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:44,371
and you'll be able to feed 1000 starving people.

141
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:46,336
Yeah, I know.

142
00:10:52,624 --> 00:10:55,013
No clue here either, is there?

143
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:57,215
No.

144
00:10:57,215 --> 00:10:59,575
All right, let's rob this place.

145
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:03,376
I think it might be heavy.

146
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:22,054
Wait wait! Are you going to blow the house?

147
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:25,089
Don't worry. It will blow in about 30 minutes.

148
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:29,058
Wow, what a sight.

149
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:31,157
Everybody did a good job.

150
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,769
See you outside.

151
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:37,232
Here. Yong, you have to come out safe and sound, all right?

152
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:41,371
I bet my whole business on Iljimae robbing the palace.

153
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:43,977
Should I stay?

154
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:47,348
You leaving this place will be much more helpful.

155
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:52,139
All right then, all you have left is the royal quarters, right?

156
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:53,249
Yes.

157
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:57,093
Before that, I have a piece of paper I need to steal.

158
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:57,899
What is it?

159
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:02,430
Go on, make your way out. I can't be absent from my station for too long, so I'll get going too.

160
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,721
Yong, I really hope you find the truth you're looking for.

161
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,516
What's happening?

162
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:19,643
Hey!

163
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:20,996
What's happening?

164
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:24,170
Everything is set here.

165
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,522
We just need to light it up.

166
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:26,329
Is it?

167
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:29,448
Everyone's dead meat now.

168
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:33,379
Hey!

169
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:35,506
Dan!

170
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,475
You're here!

171
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:39,819
Everything's going well according to the plan.

172
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:42,543
Dae Shik also came out a few minutes ago.

173
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:44,299
Is that so?

174
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:49,849
You see? See all these people rooting for Iljimae?

175
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:53,243
Don't you worry a bit.

176
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:08,561
I smell of poop! It's disgusting.

177
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:10,551
Argh!

178
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:13,055
Wait until I catch this jerk.

179
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:19,119
Hey!

180
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:21,731
Come here! Come come.

181
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:28,356
What's that?

182
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,683
Open it up.

183
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,393
Your Majesty! What is all this?

184
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:51,221
The soldiers that were supposed to be sent to the Myung have disappeared?

185
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:56,241
We're looking for them now. We'll catch them soon so don't worry.

186
00:13:56,241 --> 00:14:00,550
Then, at least give me your royal stamp.

187
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:06,452
You may go.

188
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:31,057
You're giving Joseon as the main battlefield to reconstruct the great Myung Empire.

189
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:35,984
The soldiers from Myung will deeply appreciate your promise.

190
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:38,414
I'll see you at the banquet.

191
00:14:38,414 --> 00:14:41,203
Yes, Your Majesty.

192
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:51,596
Do you trust that man, Your Majesty?

193
00:14:51,596 --> 00:14:54,742
What can I do but trust him?

194
00:14:56,598 --> 00:15:00,283
If Myung were to rise again, I'll be grateful.

195
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,699
Enters his Royal Highness.

196
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,788
Look how big this is.

197
00:16:12,731 --> 00:16:15,011
No fish at all?

198
00:16:16,662 --> 00:16:18,833
Look at her.

199
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,158
Even here?

200
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:25,910
She's set her mind to become the queen of all beggars nationwide!

201
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:36,297
Anyways, this Jung Myung Soo bastard, he accepts my presents, but no word from him yet?

202
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:38,983
Sir! Sir!

203
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:40,749
Sir!

204
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,701
Why? What's all the noise about?

205
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,746
There's big trouble at the royal palace.

206
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:47,194
What? Why?

207
00:16:47,194 --> 00:16:51,246
Iljimae is running wild inside the palace.

208
00:16:51,246 --> 00:16:56,207
Everybody in the country is going to see it.

209
00:16:58,377 --> 00:17:02,087
Lee Won Ho's son is in the palace?

210
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:09,465
So, he wants to have a face off with the king now, does he?

211
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:17,337
Like father like son.

212
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:26,471
You! Don't even say one word about that brat to Eun Chae!

213
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:28,007
Yes sir.

214
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,421
You got rid of me? And now look what happened to you. Good for you!

215
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:43,304
Hey, you rat! Since you're in the palace anyways, why don't you just blow it up?

216
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:14,504
Protect the king!

217
00:19:05,674 --> 00:19:08,195
It will be dangerous to carry it out with the cart.

218
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:09,778
Here, take this.

219
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:23,469
Isn't this paper? It will get wet.

220
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:27,737
Yes, but I've coated it, so it won't get wet. Want to see?

221
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:44,689
Hey, Castor Oil Gang, you thought I didn't recognize you, didn't you?

222
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:50,572
Even with that outfit, you stand out, you moron.

223
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:02,451
Over there!

224
00:20:10,336 --> 00:20:12,821
Hey! Grab them!

225
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:20,046
Go and get them!

226
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:22,780
Let's go!

227
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:37,005
We won!

228
00:20:39,662 --> 00:20:41,273
Father!

229
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:45,311
Hey you! When did you change into those clothes?

230
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,807
We stole them in advance and had them in the palace.

231
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,837
Did you do it? It's Iljimae who did it!

232
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:55,540
You brat!

233
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,345
Anyways, he is amazing!

234
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:02,124
This is so great.

235
00:21:03,282 --> 00:21:05,794
Where's Yong? Where is Yong?

236
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:08,948
He will be out soon. Don't worry.

237
00:21:11,091 --> 00:21:13,029
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

238
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:14,315
The home quarters for the royal family.

239
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,064
The office for the personal royal guards.

240
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:18,486
The office for palace guards.

241
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:21,390
The treasure house.

242
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:27,536
This guy must know that we built these places to celebrate the coup and engraved the symbols.

243
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:33,637
What on earth is he looking for?

244
00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:36,046
What about the king's treasure house?

245
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:38,491
Everything is fine over there.

246
00:21:43,987 --> 00:21:45,630
The king's treasure house.

247
00:22:29,872 --> 00:22:33,668
For the king to enter his special treasure house, he needs three keys.

248
00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:35,805
That many?

249
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:38,022
Who has the keys?

250
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:40,318
The chief of the personal royal guards, the chief of the palace guards,

251
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:43,648
and the chief of architecture. These are the three people with the keys.

252
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:46,740
They never let the keys out of their sight.

253
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,279
What is so great in there that there are three keys?

254
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,505
That's not all. There's word that there's a hideout for the king inside the palace.

255
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:56,974
He had it made because he was scared of coups and other incidents.

256
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:59,012
Really? Where?

257
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:02,404
I don't know. Nobody's actually seen it, it's just rumors.

258
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:37,564
Another key.

259
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:51,961
Oh, this?

260
00:23:55,253 --> 00:23:57,937
Check my special treasure house right now.

261
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,604
Yes sir.

262
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:39,606
Why are you sweating so much?

263
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:43,049
You remember what I taught you the other day?

264
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:49,374
Don't shake your hand. Steady.

265
00:24:49,374 --> 00:24:53,539
Be careful and thorough. I'm here.

266
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:03,558
Use the first stick to open the way into the lock.

267
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:08,313
Good good. Now use the second stick to get into the open passage.

268
00:25:08,313 --> 00:25:10,331
Good good.

269
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:16,673
No problem here.

270
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:25,662
It worked.

271
00:25:25,662 --> 00:25:31,259
You can now open every lock.

272
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:33,853
Now turn the keys.

273
00:25:33,853 --> 00:25:35,718
Quick quick.

274
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:59,693
My dear Yong. You're awesome.

275
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:07,383
I said I wanted to see His Majesty.

276
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:09,494
Why are you bringing me here?

277
00:26:09,494 --> 00:26:13,477
His Majesty is resting for a while to recover from the incident at the banquet.

278
00:26:13,477 --> 00:26:16,680
I will pass on the message, so tell me what you have to say to him.

279
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:22,494
How dare you be disrespectful to me? You're a simple gang leader.

280
00:26:23,887 --> 00:26:29,082
Did he really give me his royal stamp? Or did he draw a cherry blossom?

281
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:32,507
I have to hear it from his majesty personally.

282
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:37,042
It's Iljimae's doing.

283
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:39,838
Are you the king?

284
00:26:39,838 --> 00:26:43,392
His Majesty treats you well and you think you're the king?

285
00:26:47,745 --> 00:26:51,239
Right now I'm going to the Imperial Ambassador,

286
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:53,715
and show him this pledge.

287
00:26:53,715 --> 00:26:55,330
We'll see.

288
00:27:10,382 --> 00:27:12,427
Get rid of it.

289
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:29,489
Before I die I have to tell you something urgent, and I leave these words behind.

290
00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:32,736
The one who killed your father is none but...

291
00:28:32,736 --> 00:28:34,593
Thank you young master.

292
00:28:34,593 --> 00:28:35,744
Your name is?

293
00:28:35,744 --> 00:28:38,011
My name is Geom. Lee Geom.

294
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:39,967
Your name, sir?

295
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:41,518
Me?

296
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:44,897
My name is Lee Won Ho.

297
00:29:19,504 --> 00:29:23,074
No...

298
00:29:23,074 --> 00:29:24,628
The king?

299
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:08,087
But then...

300
00:30:08,087 --> 00:30:09,647
that house...

301
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:16,260
with my own hands?

302
00:30:24,848 --> 00:30:27,583
My father...

303
00:30:28,381 --> 00:30:30,775
My father...

304
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,779
It was the king who killed him?

305
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:46,873
Who is it?

306
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:53,598
Why did he rob the food warehouse? There's no symbol engraved there.

307
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,634
Hold on...

308
00:30:58,634 --> 00:31:01,987
The boy I saw in front of the food warehouse.

309
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:05,625
My name is Oh Ryong.

310
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,601
Yes...

311
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:12,415
I applied as a palace guard to serve the people.

312
00:31:13,781 --> 00:31:18,958
Yes. Him. Those eyes.

313
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:23,837
You should not forget the promise you made, when you made your vow to build a Joseon for the people.

314
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,987
He had Won Ho's eyes.

315
00:31:30,617 --> 00:31:34,143
That boy is... Geom.

316
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:39,850
I can feel the power of the sun, strong and loved by all.

317
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,676
How can the sky have two suns?

318
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:48,082
Bring Lee Geom here right now!

319
00:31:53,961 --> 00:31:55,860
Cheon.

320
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:00,008
Cheon, Cheon, where are you?

321
00:32:00,008 --> 00:32:01,401
Cheon!

322
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:03,670
It's Iljimae! Catch him!

323
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:54,943
I am Lee Won Ho's son too.

324
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:31,475
Let's go.

325
00:36:49,284 --> 00:36:52,356
How dare you come here on your own?

326
00:36:52,356 --> 00:36:59,492
I wanted to find you anyways after the banquet, find you and cut your throat.

327
00:37:04,245 --> 00:37:07,641
Right then, what is it that you have to say?

328
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,934
Let the boy live, please.

329
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:21,977
How dare you lie to His Majesty?

330
00:37:21,977 --> 00:37:24,479
You betrayed our lord?

331
00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:30,739
Our lord? Cheon. Open your eyes.

332
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:36,225
In your eyes, is he still our lord? Is our work for him truly the great cause?

333
00:37:36,225 --> 00:37:40,230
When he brought down the coup, what was his excuse?

334
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:45,893
Wasn't it because Kwanghae, having killed all these men, was not worthy to be a king?

335
00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:54,040
But the king, he also killed his brother and his friends to maintain his position

336
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,788
and even his son.

337
00:37:55,788 --> 00:38:00,058
If I admit he is wrong, what becomes of me?

338
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:03,151
What about me? I devoted all my life to him.

339
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:05,192
From that moment on

340
00:38:05,192 --> 00:38:10,658
I become a simple murderer. That is why he has to be my lord

341
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:13,157
and the work I do for him has to be a great cause.

342
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:13,837
Cheon.

343
00:38:13,837 --> 00:38:21,382
I will bet everything I have and am to protect His Majesty.

344
00:38:26,535 --> 00:38:27,620
Kill him.

345
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:06,992
Your father will go with you.

346
00:39:27,412 --> 00:39:33,616
Bong Soon! Bong Soon is alive!

347
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:47,327
Yong, you'll come back safe and sound, right?

348
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:52,533
You'll take me and leave, right?

349
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:58,428
I won't go anywhere, I'll wait here.

350
00:39:59,943 --> 00:40:02,652
Come back soon.

351
00:40:06,134 --> 00:40:08,015
Cheon.

352
00:40:11,062 --> 00:40:13,602
Where is Cheon?

353
00:40:14,908 --> 00:40:16,262
Cheon?

354
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:32,794
How dare you come here? You're just a thief.

355
00:40:32,794 --> 00:40:35,665
The ignorant people treat you like a king

356
00:40:35,665 --> 00:40:38,554
so you think you're some kind of king?

357
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:50,818
Why did you kill my father?

358
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:54,141
I should have killed you then.

359
00:40:56,028 --> 00:41:02,710
The sun in the sky... it wasn't Won Ho, it was you.

360
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,155
Because of you, my dear brother,

361
00:41:07,155 --> 00:41:08,867
Won Ho had to die.

362
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:11,277
Your brother?

363
00:41:11,277 --> 00:41:13,789
Your brother?

364
00:41:22,411 --> 00:41:27,567
Why did you kill him? Why did you kill my father?

365
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:36,048
If it can protect my throne, I am willing to do worse than that.

366
00:41:36,048 --> 00:41:38,693
Is that why you killed your own son?

367
00:41:38,693 --> 00:41:41,573
Is that why you killed so many innocent people?

368
00:41:41,573 --> 00:41:48,874
Brother or son, anyone who threatens my throne

369
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:51,901
will die in my hands. You too!

370
00:41:57,373 --> 00:42:00,487
And you dare call yourself a king?

371
00:42:00,487 --> 00:42:04,819
We don't need a king like you. You'd better serve us dead.

372
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:07,011
Die!

373
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:33,120
I will bring you to my father.

374
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,728
I will bring you to my father and you will kneel in front of him.

375
00:42:37,174 --> 00:42:38,878
Go ahead.

376
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,813
Iljimae is holding the king as hostage

377
00:43:31,813 --> 00:43:34,582
but he is completely surrounded by the guards

378
00:43:34,582 --> 00:43:36,816
and it's only a matter of time before he dies.

379
00:43:40,404 --> 00:43:42,415
Yong! Yong!

380
00:43:42,415 --> 00:43:43,701
Yong!

381
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:51,753
Oh my god.

382
00:43:51,753 --> 00:43:53,745
Ajumma, wake up.

383
00:43:53,745 --> 00:43:55,320
Wake up, wake up.

384
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,743
Wake up.

385
00:43:57,743 --> 00:44:01,200
Hey. Look here.

386
00:44:02,657 --> 00:44:04,846
Geom.

387
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,529
Geom.

388
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:47,376
Go! You have to finish what you have to do.

389
00:45:00,827 --> 00:45:03,139
Let us take care of the guards. Just go!

390
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:33,053
Apologize!

391
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,549
My brother.

392
00:45:38,521 --> 00:45:42,744
I am sorry.

393
00:45:42,744 --> 00:45:45,943
Please forgive me.

394
00:45:48,628 --> 00:45:54,486
Free my father and my family from the false charges.

395
00:45:54,486 --> 00:45:59,057
All right. All right.

396
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:08,088
One more thing. Ask for forgiveness to all the people who have suffered because of you.

397
00:46:08,088 --> 00:46:10,566
All right.

398
00:46:21,963 --> 00:46:25,038
I have two fathers.

399
00:46:26,856 --> 00:46:31,275
One who taught me about what is right in the world

400
00:46:31,275 --> 00:46:36,486
and one who only knew how to take care of me, like a fool, and sacrificed everything.

401
00:46:36,486 --> 00:46:40,021
What kind of father were you?

402
00:46:40,021 --> 00:46:44,868
To your son? To your people?

403
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:55,480
You don't have the right.

404
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,433
Step down from the throne immediately.

405
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:04,872
Promise me!

406
00:47:04,872 --> 00:47:07,707
All right.

407
00:47:07,707 --> 00:47:11,593
If you don't keep your promise

408
00:47:11,593 --> 00:47:16,379
I will come for you once again.

409
00:47:16,379 --> 00:47:19,830
But why don't you kill me?

410
00:47:36,951 --> 00:47:38,831
Go.

411
00:48:01,868 --> 00:48:03,446
Won Ho.

412
00:48:06,948 --> 00:48:08,694
Won Ho.

413
00:48:12,086 --> 00:48:13,732
Won-ho.

414
00:48:25,145 --> 00:48:29,688
Father.

415
00:48:29,688 --> 00:48:32,603
I...

416
00:48:32,603 --> 00:48:35,894
let him live.

417
00:48:41,903 --> 00:48:46,122
This is the right thing to do,

418
00:48:46,122 --> 00:48:49,655
isn't it?

419
00:51:16,912 --> 00:51:21,958
Whether he be my enemy or my friend

420
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:27,782
if he is blocking my way, you said to kill him.

421
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:51,141
I too am Lee Won Ho's son.

422
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:06,990
Father.

423
00:53:02,768 --> 00:53:06,104
No more old-fashioned stories!

424
00:53:06,104 --> 00:53:08,666
This is the latest trend.

425
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:13,653
The love story between the dog and the wolf. 
  (Four years later) 

426
00:53:13,653 --> 00:53:16,227
Hey, this is not a place for kids. Go away.

427
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:19,796
Go away! You little brat. How old are you?

428
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:20,635
5.

429
00:53:20,635 --> 00:53:21,585
Why are you so big for a 5 year old?

430
00:53:21,585 --> 00:53:22,641
Just.

431
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:23,917
What is up with those scars on your face?

432
00:53:23,917 --> 00:53:25,110
It's nothing.

433
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,314
Go away!

434
00:53:26,314 --> 00:53:31,554
I learned my alphabet through all these books!

435
00:53:31,554 --> 00:53:32,794
Who do you think I am?

436
00:53:32,794 --> 00:53:35,240
You little brat!

437
00:53:39,222 --> 00:53:41,326
What's your name?

438
00:53:41,326 --> 00:53:44,405
I'm the cutie of the South Gate!

439
00:53:44,405 --> 00:53:46,207
My name is Gaetong.

440
00:53:46,207 --> 00:53:47,299
Gaetong?

441
00:53:47,299 --> 00:53:51,939
My father said that's where the dragons come from, so he said to name me Gaetong.

442
00:53:51,939 --> 00:53:54,159
What kind of name is that?

443
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:57,404
It makes me look uncool.

444
00:53:57,404 --> 00:54:00,600
How come you do everything like Yong?

445
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,075
Yong?

446
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:04,780
Damn! They should have named me Yong too!

447
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,186
Yong! Yong!

448
00:54:07,186 --> 00:54:08,967
Gaetong.

449
00:54:08,967 --> 00:54:10,055
It's mom.

450
00:54:10,055 --> 00:54:12,164
Faithful Dan.

451
00:54:31,773 --> 00:54:34,780
It's been a long time.

452
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,071
How have you been?

453
00:54:36,071 --> 00:54:37,395
Fine.

454
00:54:37,395 --> 00:54:40,019
How have you been?

455
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:47,612
It's Dae Shik hyung. Let's go see.

456
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:09,932
It's been four years.

457
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:13,393
Yes, it's been that long.

458
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,839
How about Master? Is he still well?

459
00:55:19,979 --> 00:55:22,368
Miss!

460
00:55:22,368 --> 00:55:23,815
Sum-sum!

461
00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:30,017
Miss, you didn't give us any news all this time.

462
00:55:31,618 --> 00:55:33,632
Why did you make her cry?

463
00:55:33,632 --> 00:55:35,772
She pooped.

464
00:55:35,772 --> 00:55:37,940
Our little Yeon,

465
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,540
did you poop?

466
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:44,661
Miss, how have you been all this time?

467
00:55:44,661 --> 00:55:46,589
Go and wash her.

468
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:50,375
All right, let's go and wash, Yeon.

469
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:53,767
Our little Yeon.

470
00:55:55,902 --> 00:55:58,383
You have a pretty baby.

471
00:55:58,383 --> 00:55:59,997
What a pretty name too.

472
00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:03,076
I think it must be the name of his first love, but he won't say.

473
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:05,870
Who is it?

474
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:10,060
What about that kid? How does he live?

475
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,817
Who?

476
00:56:14,061 --> 00:56:15,916
That boy...

477
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:19,576
Who? Who? Yong?

478
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,962
Yong is doing very well of course.

479
00:56:24,725 --> 00:56:28,241
You must be tired, you should go and rest.

480
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:29,456
All right.

481
00:56:31,107 --> 00:56:32,571
What about Shi Hoo?

482
00:56:32,571 --> 00:56:35,376
He is doing fine.

483
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,275
Come to the palace with me.

484
00:56:52,648 --> 00:56:55,061
Nobody saw what happened that day.

485
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:56,257
No.

486
00:56:56,257 --> 00:57:01,470
I like it now, teaching those children.

487
00:57:04,962 --> 00:57:09,680
So, that message in blood, it's still nowhere to be seen.

488
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,551
I have to keep it, so that they can stay.

489
00:57:15,514 --> 00:57:18,820
The people my brother wanted to protect.

490
00:57:48,635 --> 00:57:51,524
But you know, that bird, he is quite a pitiful bird.

491
00:57:51,524 --> 00:57:53,560
Pitiful? Why?

492
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,462
It comes every time the cherry blossom blooms

493
00:57:56,462 --> 00:57:59,919
and can't leave the flowers.

494
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:07,013
Even dead, that child must be happy.

495
00:58:29,728 --> 00:58:32,919
Here he is!

496
00:58:32,919 --> 00:58:36,507
What a sight!

497
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:42,826
There's nowhere in this world I can't rob!

498
00:58:42,826 --> 00:58:45,619
I'm Iljimae!

499
00:58:50,012 --> 00:58:51,075
Hey hey hey

500
00:58:51,075 --> 00:58:55,793
Dae Shik's father, you don't look anything like

501
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:58,178
that man from Chung!

502
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:05,712
By the way, did you hear?

503
00:59:05,712 --> 00:59:08,990
Last night, Lord Han's household got robbed.

504
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:14,313
But his method is exactly the same as Iljimae's 4 years ago.

505
00:59:14,313 --> 00:59:19,729
Then... does it mean that Iljimae came back to life?

506
00:59:19,729 --> 00:59:21,905
He's a fake.

507
00:59:21,905 --> 00:59:24,005
It's not red cherry blossom

508
00:59:24,005 --> 00:59:26,141
but a red azalea instead.

509
00:59:26,141 --> 00:59:29,981
I'm telling you, Iljimae died.

510
00:59:29,981 --> 00:59:30,773
Of course.

511
00:59:30,773 --> 00:59:32,788
Did you see it? Did you?

512
00:59:32,788 --> 00:59:34,749
Did you see him die?

513
00:59:34,749 --> 00:59:37,063
There's also word that he got sold to Chung.

514
00:59:37,063 --> 00:59:41,320
Yes, and there's also word that he became a cripple after being hit with the sword.

515
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,662
Yes yes.

516
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:46,029
Here here, I'll sum it up for you.

517
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:50,108
Iljimae got struck by a sword and ran away to the mountains

518
00:59:50,108 --> 00:59:55,167
and there he saw beautiful azaleas, so now he draws azaleas.

519
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:58,184
That's a very old story.

520
00:59:58,184 --> 01:00:01,929
What am I saying is, now, the trend is azalea! End of story.

521
01:00:02,668 --> 01:00:04,627
What a bold little kid.

522
01:00:05,937 --> 01:00:06,792
What about Chung?

523
01:00:08,011 --> 01:00:09,639
Shoe order!

524
01:00:10,222 --> 01:00:11,588
Shoe order!

525
01:00:11,588 --> 01:00:13,208
Why are you so late?

526
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:17,497
Ahjussi, if you want me to deliver here, that's very inconvenient for me.

527
01:00:17,497 --> 01:00:20,676
From now on, you come and get them yourself.

528
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:26,121
You little brat. You got kicked out of the palace and that's how you treat your customers?

529
01:00:28,352 --> 01:00:33,570
Shik Duk ajumma said that if you call Myung Wol once more, she will come here right away.

530
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:36,931
Just know when to stop. I'm leaving now.

531
01:00:36,931 --> 01:00:40,906
Hey by the way, what about that foolish father of yours? Is he well?

532
01:00:40,906 --> 01:00:43,421
Yes. He started a new business.

533
01:00:43,421 --> 01:00:45,909
Geez, what is going to ruin this time?

534
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:49,383
He only needs his mouth for this one.

535
01:00:49,383 --> 01:00:50,519
I'm going.

536
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:52,709
Bye!

537
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:05,517
Where is he again anyways?

538
01:01:13,145 --> 01:01:18,629
Well, I think everyone is here, so I'll start the story.

539
01:01:19,944 --> 01:01:22,020
Why are you here again? Go away!

540
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,334
Shh!

541
01:01:23,334 --> 01:01:25,687
All right all right, I won't do it.

542
01:01:27,691 --> 01:01:29,420
Here here.

543
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,615
Today's story

544
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,850
Here Here.

545
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:38,373
Let me clear my throat.

546
01:01:42,127 --> 01:01:43,806
Here.

547
01:01:43,806 --> 01:01:46,316
Today's story

548
01:01:46,316 --> 01:01:49,586
is what I call 'The return of Iljimae'.

549
01:01:51,761 --> 01:01:53,413
Once upon a time

550
01:01:53,413 --> 01:01:56,140
one night, when rain was drizzling,

551
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:57,010
At the Sunlim gate.

552
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:58,476
No, that's not true.

553
01:01:58,476 --> 01:02:00,754
It's the Honghwa gate.

554
01:02:00,754 --> 01:02:03,208
Also, it wasn't raining.

555
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:06,851
That night, an arrow broke into the gate!

556
01:02:11,927 --> 01:02:14,264
Did you close it? Did you close the door?

557
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:15,954
Yes, Your Majesty.

558
01:02:17,606 --> 01:02:21,151
You're fake, aren't you? You're an impostor.

559
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,947
Cheon.

560
01:02:25,947 --> 01:02:27,737
Did you find him?

561
01:02:27,737 --> 01:02:30,445
Iljimae is coming.

562
01:02:30,445 --> 01:02:34,648
Your Majesty, Iljimae and Cheon are both dead.

563
01:02:37,884 --> 01:02:41,585
Where is Cheon? Call Cheon for me.

564
01:02:42,237 --> 01:02:44,473
He will come.

565
01:02:44,473 --> 01:02:47,935
He said that if I didn't keep my promise, he would come back for me.

566
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:49,982
He said he will come.

567
01:04:35,841 --> 01:04:54,393
