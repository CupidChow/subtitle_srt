1
00:00:50,347 --> 00:00:51,347
destiny?

2
00:00:54,812 --> 00:00:57,153
How dares he? To my sister?

3
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:59,236
She was his sister?

4
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:03,356
You got something to say?

5
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:05,910
The guy who sued your sister, that's him!

6
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,754
Let go of me

7
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:08,510
Let go!

8
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:11,525
Fire and the last number is seven!

9
00:01:14,498 --> 00:01:15,947
This year, at their house with Chun-woo club members...

10
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:16,862
Chun-woo club?

11
00:01:16,862 --> 00:01:18,218
It's a social club that's made up of powerful men.

12
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:20,973
He also knows how to use a sword, why doesn't he look for the thief himself?

13
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:21,751
A sword?

14
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,436
Episode 10

15
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:58,965
There will be at least 50 guards on the day of the meeting

16
00:02:00,514 --> 00:02:02,353
You guys! Guard the outskirts!

17
00:02:02,353 --> 00:02:04,988
30 government inspectors!

18
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:07,529
Don't you even dare let a rat in! Do you understand?

19
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:08,669
Yes, Sir!

20
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:14,629
It'll be impossible for him to even step foot into the house.

21
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:19,066
Go!

22
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:23,825
Visitors entering the house during the meeting will be strictly prohibited.

23
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:32,604
I am Park Jeong Hee, the lord of Young-dong

24
00:02:32,604 --> 00:02:36,334
Lord Park! Welcome!

25
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:38,865
Please, do come inside!

26
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:43,522
Lord Shim personally comes out to verify the faces of the members of the Chun-woo club.

27
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:47,630
That bastard does not have any way in to the house.

28
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:56,999
Hey you servant! Why aren't you working?

29
00:02:58,092 --> 00:03:00,931
But, who's this woman?

30
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:04,642
Sweet mother of god!

31
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,775
Sweet mother of god! Aigoo!

32
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:08,808
What's the matter?

33
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:11,058
That thing..

34
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:14,306
How do I look?

35
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:17,925
Geez! You don't even have a look!

36
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:21,074
You bunch of frauds! You guys are bored, aren't you?

37
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:23,020
You have nothing better to do, so this is what you do!

38
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,006
Do I look like I'm fooling around to you? Then you are a fool

39
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:29,895
I'm doing this as a side job, to pay up your foolish debt!

40
00:03:29,895 --> 00:03:32,203
Servant, during meal time

41
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:33,946
Hair dresser, during spare time!

42
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:36,350
Oh! So you will have two jobs?

43
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:41,336
Very wise! Very wise my servant!

44
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:44,941
By the way, its a surprise that you had such a skill, Bong Soon

45
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:47,952
I've done every type of work that pays!

46
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:50,944
Oooh, these eyebrows are as pretty as crescent moon

47
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:54,291
A person's life can change just by changing the shape of their eyebrows!

48
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,977
His lips are red like a cherry!

49
00:03:56,977 --> 00:04:00,380
What's this reddish stuff?

50
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,833
Oh, this rouge?

51
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,398
Do they sell this?

52
00:04:03,398 --> 00:04:09,211
Bong Soon! Your first client is here!

53
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:10,622
Yes ma'am

54
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,983
Goodness, that girl sure is strong.

55
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:26,789
If you say that you want to take this girl as your wife, I'll rip your teeth off,

56
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:28,448
so don't even think about...

57
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:31,126
Where is he?

58
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:33,307
Hey Yong?!

59
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:43,810
Where did I lose it?

60
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:52,815
You didn't have to...

61
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:55,133
It's nothing compared to your gracious

62
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:59,792
release of my servants, which solved the work shortage problem.

63
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:01,742
It wasn't that much trouble.

64
00:05:01,742 --> 00:05:04,575
If you need more please ask for more.

65
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:08,507
Yes ma'am, I'll be going now

66
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:16,138
Ma'am, servants?

67
00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:19,859
Yes, I heard that the contract servants didn't work hard enough

68
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:24,019
So I've pulled out a list of government servants and sent her the reliable ones

69
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,544
Where did you get the lists?

70
00:05:26,544 --> 00:05:29,040
Of course from the palace

71
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,006
You could do such a thing?

72
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:35,679
Hey kid, my husband is a high rank officer

73
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:37,602
Such a work is nothing to him

74
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:41,161
ma'am, ma'am

75
00:05:45,317 --> 00:05:49,812
What a pity. Stop it and pack your stuff!

76
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:52,677
What?! Planning to flee?!

77
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:56,429
Careful of what you say! If we get caught, will be spanked for 50 times

78
00:05:56,429 --> 00:06:00,466
I don't wanna lose my sleek ass

79
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:06,376
Dad, your butt is hanging on your thigh

80
00:06:06,376 --> 00:06:08,520
Believe me and just pack your stuff!

81
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,626
DId you hook a guy?

82
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:11,848
Is he a wealthy widower?!

83
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:19,806
Why do we have to be so shabby? Its all because of that maidservant or something we tried to find, isn't it?

84
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:20,913
Yes, it is

85
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:26,158
Then! As soon as we get that maid, we won't have to live like this anymore.

86
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:28,688
Yes that is true, but how?

87
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,498
My lady has promised me to find her

88
00:06:31,498 --> 00:06:37,682
Now we are free! Ummm the smell of freedom

89
00:06:37,682 --> 00:06:40,610
Ewww... It smells like horse dung

90
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,380
Well done girl! Good girl

91
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,806
OH MY DAUGHTER BONG SOON!!!

92
00:06:48,806 --> 00:06:53,196
I'm going out.  Don't drink too much

93
00:06:54,454 --> 00:06:56,376
Hey! Where are you going?!

94
00:06:56,376 --> 00:07:00,149
Where does she go to everyday?

95
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:03,033
Perhaps she might have actually hooked a wealthy guy

96
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:07,682
Suspicious, very suspicious

97
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:11,400
Stop pooping, you horse!

98
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,221
You fool!

99
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,374
Have you seen a person looking for this?

100
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:20,120
Sorry but I haven't

101
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,977
Excuse me, have you seen anyone looking for this thing?

102
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:30,621
No, sorry

103
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:38,786
It's made of a tiger's claw..

104
00:07:43,065 --> 00:07:48,142
Excuse me, have you seen a norigae made of a tiger's claw?

105
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:50,641
Isn't it the one with goblin's face on it?

106
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:51,613
You've seen it?! seen it?

107
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:53,356
Ummmm..

108
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:58,687
Are you looking for this?

109
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,624
Why do you have it?

110
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:02,503
Is it yours?

111
00:08:02,503 --> 00:08:05,002
Give it! I've been looking for it for ages!

112
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:08,354
Why is it yours?

113
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:11,926
Because its mine!

114
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:14,529
I thought I had lost it.

115
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:21,214
I'm scared

116
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:23,799
I''m here. I'll take care of you

117
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:26,318
I'll never let go of this hand

118
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:37,200
This can't be right

119
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,557
No way

120
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,727
Can't be true

121
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,164
Sit! Sit!

122
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:52,422
What is it?

123
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:54,091
Just sit here

124
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,459
Come closer, I've got something to give you

125
00:09:01,663 --> 00:09:03,212
Surprise!

126
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:05,225
What's this?

127
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:06,925
This is what is called a rouge

128
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:12,407
This is something that you put on your lips

129
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:13,909
Hold on let me get an oil

130
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:15,496
How did you get such a precious good?

131
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:18,020
Of course I bought it.

132
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,360
You are suspecting me?

133
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,945
Then how did you get the  money?

134
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:22,493
What the..

135
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,905
You are truly suspecting me, aren't you?

136
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:32,421
Are you suggesting that I've stolen this stuff?

137
00:09:33,826 --> 00:09:38,398
I only bought it because I thought you would look pretty.

138
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,703
Alright, thank you for the present.

139
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:55,087
Try it! Try it now!

140
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:57,377
Later

141
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:02,751
She will look so nice

142
00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:08,202
This is embarrassing!

143
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:16,250
Why did you join here?

144
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,387
Huh?

145
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:20,250
Ummmmmmm, it's that..

146
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,079
You've come here to seek the legendary assassin, didn't you?

147
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:24,439
Same here.

148
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:25,982
A legendary assassin?

149
00:10:25,982 --> 00:10:31,330
You don't know? The babies even stop crying when the story is told

150
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,382
Who is that?

151
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,578
Oh my god, you know nothing.

152
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:38,236
They're really popular here.

153
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:41,597
They originally come from here, you know.

154
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:47,039
I heard that..

155
00:10:48,309 --> 00:11:12,330

156
00:11:13,191 --> 00:11:17,467
Just by drawing their sword a little bit!

157
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:22,088
Enemies all around would fall dead.

158
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:25,270
You liar. Those stories are all made up, right?

159
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,745
Hey! Do not mock your senior!

160
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:32,442
Alright! Just kidding

161
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,734
Calm down bro.

162
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:39,796
I guess I should learn the way of the sword from them!

163
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:40,702
You can't

164
00:11:40,702 --> 00:11:41,616
Why not?

165
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:46,166
One  was acknowledged for his great skill and has joined the palace guard

166
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,173
and the other one?

167
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,145
The other one has disappeared

168
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:52,261
Disappear? Why?

169
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:57,033
That I don't know. Perhaps he might have left the world

170
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,754
Training in a deep mountain

171
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:00,742
Training?

172
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:05,077
Stop eating!!! You eat more than a pig!

173
00:12:05,077 --> 00:12:07,512
I am not a pig!

174
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:10,302
Stop!Stop eating! Stop!

175
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:14,325
I pity you for having such a father

176
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:21,037
I guess I wasn't mature enough back then

177
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:26,173
Stop!!!!!

178
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:28,847
Do you like it?

179
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:32,747
Are you truly offering these precious goods to us?

180
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:36,935
I wouldn't spare the cost for you two ladies

181
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:39,542
How do I look? Does it fit nicely?

182
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:42,335
It fits perfectly.

183
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:47,343
These things look better on young ladies

184
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:54,581
No ma'am, it looks much better on you.

185
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:58,755
In fact, such a young lady is fine looking even without a norigae

186
00:12:58,755 --> 00:13:03,064
By the way, Eun Chae has to find a good husband now, doesn't she?

187
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:05,224
Have you found anyone?

188
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:07,803
I ask of you to look for a good marriage for her

189
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:11,644
Her dad is keeping her too busy these days.

190
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:15,400
I fear that she won't have time to meet a good husband

191
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:27,214
A girl should not go out so often! Where have you been?!

192
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:29,150
Are you going to the construction site again?!

193
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,892
Yes

194
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:35,681
Stay at home for a while. Jung Chi Hong has even visited you aunt's house

195
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,718
To seek you!

196
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:39,167
How did he know the place?

197
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,906
That's what I would like to know

198
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,326
Oh, and

199
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:44,536
Did he take your handkerchief?

200
00:13:44,536 --> 00:13:48,652
I heard that he claimed you like a lunatic with your handkerchief in his hand

201
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:51,286
A handkerchief?

202
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,030
Hey Eun Chae! Eun Chae!

203
00:13:56,635 --> 00:14:00,178
She won't even listen to me! God damn it!

204
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:04,048
This is all dad's fault!

205
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:08,213
Its all because he beats me like a dog in front of the kids!

206
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:28,594
Now tell me about it, you know the guy that you met the other day, don't you?

207
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:31,590
That day I could tell that you two were not strangers

208
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,907
How do you know him?

209
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,916
Back then

210
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,530
I thought that the kid had reincarnated

211
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,510
What? What kid?

212
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:47,157
Your first love that you said died?

213
00:14:47,157 --> 00:14:50,965
I really hope I could meet him again

214
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,400
But will he visit this place again?

215
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:02,427
We are here

216
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:09,169
Come in please

217
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:15,670
I am Kim Mu Young

218
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:21,725
Oh! Lord Kim! Welcome. Please step inside

219
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:24,966
All the members are here! Close the gate!

220
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:29,199
Hold on!

221
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:41,521
I'm sorry that I'm late. I am a new member of the board, Kang Chul Jung

222
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:44,712
You are charming as I heard. Please come in.

223
00:15:44,712 --> 00:15:46,364
Yes sir.

224
00:15:59,683 --> 00:15:59,710
How did it go?

225
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,095
So?

226
00:16:00,095 --> 00:16:01,809
How did it go?

227
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:02,882
I've sent it

228
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,001
We almost had a tornado coming towards the parliament

229
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:15,210
I guess that I've sorted things out to dodge it

230
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:21,593
If Lord Hopan had been caught, other lords would not have been safe

231
00:16:21,593 --> 00:16:25,557
If so, the parliament would have been a chaos

232
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:28,792
Isn't it so?

233
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:34,066
By the way, I see many new faces today

234
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,161
Yes, I hear there are some new members of the board

235
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:48,714
So today's meeting is a farewell party and also a welcoming party

236
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:52,759
Here you are!

237
00:16:54,474 --> 00:16:57,631
This is one of the new members, Kim Mu Young.

238
00:16:57,631 --> 00:16:59,629
Pay respect to our lords

239
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:07,565
Holy father!

240
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:09,899
You scared the crap out of me!

241
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:12,488
I thought it was a chopped off head

242
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:15,931
You're better at least. Mr. fraud peed himself after seeing this

243
00:17:16,764 --> 00:17:21,447
This is so detailed! How do you create such a thing?

244
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:23,939
First you glue pig's leather to a mask

245
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:32,379
And put some wet papers on to it. Then it appears just like a real human face

246
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:34,444
But does it glue properly?

247
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:36,039
Yes, it sticks well

248
00:17:36,837 --> 00:17:44,001
Careful! If this gets on your skin it will melt your skin in an hour

249
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:48,776
Melts skin?! Geez! This is dangerous!

250
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:57,105
This is a very small present for lord Kim who made it possible for us to go to China as an ambassador

251
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,708
This is pig leather, isn't it?

252
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:12,168
Feels like human flesh

253
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:17,617
Oh! I almost forgot! Someone was looking for you

254
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:18,014
Really?

255
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:20,019
Who is it?

256
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:20,811
Quick go check it out

257
00:18:53,036 --> 00:18:57,004
Thief! Thief! Thief!

258
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:09,759
Attention! Do not panic and close all the path! Do not allow even a rat to sneak out!

259
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:19,384
My golden toad! My gold! My toad!

260
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:34,417
Mr. Byun

261
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,870
No one has managed to sneak out

262
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,492
Whoever took that toad is still in here

263
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:46,997
So regardless of your rank, please cooperate

264
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:48,814
Begin!

265
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:11,129
Excuse me sir, would you please spread your arms

266
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:13,229
Thank you so much

267
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:21,760
Thank you sir! You can go now

268
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:27,914
Excuse me would you raise your arms

269
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:37,976
(Do not touch it! It will melt your skin in an hour)

270
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:41,684
Why do you sweat so much sir?

271
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,087
Thank you sir

272
00:20:56,885 --> 00:20:58,734
Hold there lord

273
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:18,519
You must get on a boat to China! Must!

274
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:16,955
Iljimae!!!  its Iljimae!!!

275
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,818
Find it!

276
00:23:11,818 --> 00:23:13,183
Yes, sir

277
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:16,504
Call the archers!

278
00:23:16,504 --> 00:23:19,234
Archers to the front!

279
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:33,217
Aim!

280
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:39,737
That rat!

281
00:23:39,737 --> 00:23:46,587
If you don't surrender now your body will be full of holes!

282
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:52,065
How dare you ignore my words!

283
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:55,574
You are a dead man!

284
00:23:59,887 --> 00:24:02,092
Hey you do it

285
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:10,008
Shoot!

286
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:29,887
So you are the Iljimae huh?!

287
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,810
What the heck? What is this?!

288
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,522
Where is he?! Where is he?!

289
00:24:59,522 --> 00:25:01,485
What the heck is that?!

290
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:50,842
We've conducted a thorough search, but haven't found it anywhere

291
00:25:53,164 --> 00:25:54,815
Perhaps its flown to the sea

292
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:56,904
Chun-Woo Club?

293
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,447
Chun woo club..

294
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,113
Is it a special day today, mother?

295
00:27:07,113 --> 00:27:09,794
Your father has a meeting with his friends

296
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:14,035
Friends? But I've never seen his guests

297
00:27:14,035 --> 00:27:21,661
Yes, but it is a very special meeting with very close friends

298
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:25,210
So you must pay respect to them

299
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,822
Do you understand?

300
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:28,332
Yes, mother

301
00:27:34,254 --> 00:27:35,473
Geom!

302
00:27:37,594 --> 00:27:39,446
Would you draw me a flower?

303
00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:43,379
But I don't have a paper to draw

304
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:44,966
Oh yes the paper...

305
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:50,714
Draw it here if you don't mind

306
00:27:50,714 --> 00:27:52,060
Alright sister

307
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,405
How is it?

308
00:28:06,462 --> 00:28:10,446
This is fantastic! How do you draw so fast?

309
00:28:13,704 --> 00:28:21,447
Sky, Friend? A friendship that pledged to sky?

310
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:34,171
Your father was murdered

311
00:28:35,118 --> 00:28:38,227
They say you can never trust anyone.

312
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:43,312
We were very close, and the club was special to us...

313
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:52,890
Now I see! He is among the Chun-Woo club

314
00:28:55,290 --> 00:29:01,430
So, it wasn't Won Ho's son that Kwon Do Hyung tried to inform the truth, but Kim Ik Hee..

315
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,202
I've got the wrong guy

316
00:29:07,202 --> 00:29:11,665
Your Majesty! I will arrest those guys for treason.

317
00:29:11,665 --> 00:29:12,698
Leave them

318
00:29:13,553 --> 00:29:14,146
Sir?

319
00:29:14,146 --> 00:29:18,385
But your Majesty, those guys betrayed you

320
00:29:18,385 --> 00:29:22,886
Even so, if we arrest them for treason, someone might see it suspiciously

321
00:29:23,704 --> 00:29:28,059
I heard there are rumors about Shim Gi Won's conspiracy, among first lords

322
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:28,869
But..

323
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:31,691
They don't know anything yet, do they?

324
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:39,256
Yes Majesty, they are just waiting fro a letter from Chung

325
00:29:42,484 --> 00:29:44,294
Now is not the time yet

326
00:29:46,253 --> 00:29:53,344
Yes, your Majesty, that is also my will

327
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:00,216
What is it?

328
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,064
Doesn't look alike

329
00:30:04,706 --> 00:30:07,281
What are you talking about?

330
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:12,482
Yong isn't your real son, is he?

331
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:13,753
What?

332
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:21,552
He and I look exactly the same. Look carefully next time

333
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:24,875
Look at these gentle eyes

334
00:30:25,703 --> 00:30:30,161
You and him have no similarities, look at your height.Be honest with me. I've heard things.

335
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:35,340
I'm telling you the truth! He is my son! Did that hunter guy come to you also?

336
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,798
I should have killed that guy!

337
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:46,893
Yong and I even share this similarity of eternal hunger!

338
00:30:48,441 --> 00:30:50,268
I got to eat something

339
00:31:00,396 --> 00:31:03,744
Oh!Ma'am! What is a rouge? Is it a food?

340
00:31:03,744 --> 00:31:04,624
A rouge?

341
00:31:04,624 --> 00:31:09,579
Yeah! Bong Soon is obsessed of her rouge and thinks that I've stolen her stuff

342
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:15,575
Is a rouge that delicious? I don't even know the taste of it

343
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:27,640
Why? You don't like it?

344
00:31:28,943 --> 00:31:31,147
Bring this back to the pub, on your way

345
00:31:32,085 --> 00:31:34,034
This to the pub? Why?

346
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:39,320
Forget it, I'll bring it back then

347
00:31:40,947 --> 00:31:55,326
Are you really suspecting me? I've really put my hands off since Ja Dol left like that. 
 Why are you doing this to me? You really think I have no sense at all?

348
00:31:56,082 --> 00:32:00,210
You shouldn't suspect a person like that! You're so cruel

349
00:32:17,555 --> 00:32:22,789
You are pathetic. It wouldn't be easy to find another pathetic guy like you

350
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:30,480
Just spend a night with her! For women, the body comes first, and then the mind will follow.

351
00:32:33,155 --> 00:32:35,657
She won't come to me, ever

352
00:32:38,027 --> 00:32:43,423
He still lives in her mind

353
00:32:43,423 --> 00:32:44,844
That guy?

354
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:46,365
Yes

355
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:51,661
Today is his memorial day

356
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:29,466
You should return, your Majesty

357
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:32,735
You've emptied your seat for too long, your Majesty

358
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:36,106
Do you know what day it is today?

359
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:42,308
Today is the day that Kwon Oh died

360
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,756
How did it go?

361
00:33:48,532 --> 00:33:50,118
Still looking for him, your Majesty

362
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,744
Where you going?

363
00:33:57,283 --> 00:34:01,890
I've heard a rumor that you hang around with that nobleman's son all the time

364
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,891
Are you jealous bro? huh?

365
00:34:07,277 --> 00:34:09,182
Yong you! Follow me

366
00:34:10,991 --> 00:34:13,250
Where? Where are we going?

367
00:34:16,939 --> 00:34:18,887
You're giving this to me?

368
00:34:18,887 --> 00:34:20,516
You said you've lost it, didn't you?

369
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:23,790
Goodness! Look at this color! Fantastic

370
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:27,536
Where did you get it? This isn't cheap stuff

371
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:28,937
It isn't yours?

372
00:34:29,392 --> 00:34:30,757
I've found mine

373
00:34:33,564 --> 00:34:35,190
What the...

374
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,710
The color isn't pretty at all!

375
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,527
The weather seems cloudy...

376
00:34:45,805 --> 00:34:48,127
Ummm, ma'am?

377
00:34:48,974 --> 00:34:52,720
The government servants list that I asked of you last time...

378
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,797
Oh that! It's in the drawer

379
00:34:56,797 --> 00:34:57,482
Really?

380
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,303
Who is that servant, by the way?

381
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:12,561
According to my husband that woman servant murdered an officer and was executed recently

382
00:35:32,354 --> 00:35:33,713
My brother...

383
00:35:37,388 --> 00:35:38,814
 You're being pursued, aren't you? 

384
00:35:40,532 --> 00:35:41,511
 Please have mercy 

385
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:45,276
 Whatever it is, boys like you gotta pay for what you did 

386
00:35:47,254 --> 00:35:48,432
 Here! Take this 

387
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:52,124
 Wow... 

388
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,518
My brother

389
00:35:56,683 --> 00:35:57,634
I've found him

390
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:09,212
The man who didn't let go of my hand and protected me is alive

391
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:29,800
Can you see? Those powerless and miserable people

392
00:36:32,711 --> 00:36:36,661
Here! Take this and beat up that boy

393
00:36:40,925 --> 00:36:41,422
Bro!

394
00:36:41,422 --> 00:36:43,300
You did not know this is what we do?

395
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,666
If you can't do it, get out of the circle!

396
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:59,167
Boss, even though we are the bad guys, how could you do such a thing to a child?

397
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:04,210
Trust me, I'm trying to make him leave

398
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,185
Take a break and have some of this please

399
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:13,356
Thank you! Bless you my lady

400
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,276
Thanks to you, we get to eat and even earn money at the same time. Thank you

401
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:20,994
Its my pleasure, I thank you for the hard work

402
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:25,649
In a short time the building will be done and I'll let you live in it

403
00:37:25,649 --> 00:37:29,322
No, my lady, how could humble people like us do so?

404
00:37:29,322 --> 00:37:31,840
Father! Father!

405
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,142
Whats wrong?!

406
00:37:32,142 --> 00:37:34,202
They are destroying the village!

407
00:37:34,202 --> 00:37:34,745
What?!

408
00:37:34,745 --> 00:37:38,582
Those bad guys are beating up mom and grandma

409
00:37:41,082 --> 00:37:42,405
Let's go!

410
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,337
You lots!

411
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:25,258
Stop it right now!

412
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,766
My lady!

413
00:38:34,027 --> 00:38:35,990
You okay? Are you okay?

414
00:38:42,343 --> 00:38:43,135
You...

415
00:38:45,452 --> 00:38:48,703
My lady, this is the guy, isn't he?

416
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:51,955
You're pathetic

417
00:38:54,224 --> 00:38:56,908
What? Pathetic?!

418
00:39:01,432 --> 00:39:06,465
How dare you do such a thing to a child?! You lots are worse than an animal

419
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:10,972
Worse than an animal, my lady? I'm disappointed

420
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,156
We don't enjoy this either.

421
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:21,577
We were told by the lord to clean up the mess, we had no choice but to do it

422
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,570
You go and complain it to your father if you want

423
00:39:23,952 --> 00:39:24,929
Father ordered this?

424
00:39:27,694 --> 00:39:28,970
Get out of here!

425
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,427
Hey! Let's go!

426
00:39:33,427 --> 00:39:34,546
Yes!

427
00:39:45,187 --> 00:39:46,573
Leave it!

428
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,702
Let go of this!

429
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:04,262
Aren't you a girl?! You've got some strength

430
00:40:07,437 --> 00:40:08,803
What are you doing?

431
00:40:14,085 --> 00:40:16,872
Don't! It's dirty! Don't do it!

432
00:40:20,416 --> 00:40:22,649
I told you to beat up the kid not your leg

433
00:40:22,649 --> 00:40:25,707
I told you becoming a ruffian isn't your type

434
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:30,882
Put your legs up! I'll smash them!

435
00:40:30,882 --> 00:40:33,460
What's wrong with you?

436
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:36,796
You pushed me?! Bring it on!

437
00:40:40,162 --> 00:40:42,046
What's wrong with you?!

438
00:40:42,046 --> 00:40:43,297
Go do your work

439
00:40:43,297 --> 00:40:47,060
Alright, ok then

440
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:53,247
Your own wife wouldn't even cook for you, I pity you

441
00:40:53,247 --> 00:40:54,943
Who..who says such a thing?

442
00:40:58,078 --> 00:41:01,478
So cute!

443
00:41:01,478 --> 00:41:03,215
Don't you dare touch me!

444
00:41:03,215 --> 00:41:04,692
Go! Go!

445
00:41:04,692 --> 00:41:07,184
Alright I'll be gone then

446
00:41:07,184 --> 00:41:10,891
I'll bring a fresh eel tomorrow

447
00:41:10,891 --> 00:41:14,656
I'll cook a fresh eel for you

448
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:19,473
You're not supposed to do that to a married man! 
 Don't ever come here.

449
00:41:20,847 --> 00:41:23,207
If you're really up to it, just send the eel.

450
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:35,360
That butt! Eww!

451
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,839
Ah, she's so obnoxious!

452
00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:41,534
Hey!You forgot your spoon!

453
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:51,495
What brings you here?

454
00:41:53,728 --> 00:41:57,302
You didn't even have lunch, didn't you? I brought some food

455
00:41:57,302 --> 00:42:01,590
Spare the food! Guys like me don't deserve food. I should just starve to death

456
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:04,175
I am sorry, I misunderstood you

457
00:42:09,643 --> 00:42:11,195
How's the sale?

458
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,085
Its pretty good

459
00:42:14,092 --> 00:42:16,200
That Iljimae guy is our life saver!

460
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:19,830
In this case, that thief is better than our son

461
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:24,049
Don't compare our son to a thief!

462
00:42:25,547 --> 00:42:36,460
My wife has not only pretty face but also beautiful mind and great cooking skills.

463
00:42:39,713 --> 00:42:41,384
Come!Come! This is the place

464
00:42:43,014 --> 00:42:48,459
Wow! I've even been to the palace, but this place is even more better!

465
00:42:50,374 --> 00:42:52,561
Oh, Eun Chae! Where are you going?

466
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:56,169
I'm on my way to father

467
00:42:56,169 --> 00:42:58,043
You're going to complain about something, aren't you?

468
00:43:00,315 --> 00:43:06,415
Say hello to this man Yong, he is my loyal servant

469
00:43:07,694 --> 00:43:09,376
I devote my self to you sir!

470
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,013
This is my sister, Eun Chae

471
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:20,306
We've met each other today, didn't we? Perhaps we are destiny!

472
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:28,596
My lady! Don't be so shy!

473
00:43:36,401 --> 00:43:39,276
Have you seen my sister?

474
00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:42,271
Just met by chance on the road

475
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,853
My lord!

476
00:43:45,853 --> 00:43:47,037
Whats wrong?

477
00:43:47,037 --> 00:43:48,428
Gotta use the toilet! Sorry!

478
00:43:48,428 --> 00:43:51,166
Its that way! Hurry

479
00:44:31,477 --> 00:44:34,796
 My father is also a member of the Chun-woo club 

480
00:44:48,918 --> 00:44:50,241
Lee Won Ho

481
00:44:51,886 --> 00:44:53,637
Plotting treason

482
00:44:53,637 --> 00:44:54,638
Suicide

483
00:45:05,056 --> 00:45:06,182
What are you doing here?

484
00:45:08,952 --> 00:45:11,145
Ummmm...its that..

485
00:45:11,145 --> 00:45:12,284
Get out of here!

486
00:45:14,497 --> 00:45:19,739
Oh! I've come here to give you this back

487
00:45:22,631 --> 00:45:24,667
Get out now!

488
00:45:25,575 --> 00:45:27,378
Yes, my lady

489
00:45:37,924 --> 00:45:40,831
My lady! My lady!

490
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:43,597
Whats all the fuss about?

491
00:45:43,597 --> 00:45:44,485
Its up!

492
00:45:44,485 --> 00:45:46,297
What is up?

493
00:45:46,297 --> 00:45:48,579
Iljimae! I heard Iljimae was in action!

494
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,138
For sure?

495
00:45:50,138 --> 00:45:56,266
This time he disguised himself and fleed with the golden toad!

496
00:45:56,266 --> 00:46:01,512
He even used a dummy that looked exactly like Iljimae to confuse the guards!

497
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:06,346
That is extrodinary! He is not a common thief

498
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:12,426
Yes indeed my lady! This is a secret, but he even gives back what he has stolen to its original owners!

499
00:46:12,426 --> 00:46:15,346
Then we could call him a righteous outlaw?

500
00:46:15,346 --> 00:46:18,595
Yes! Iljimae is the model of righteous outlaw, isn't he?

501
00:46:19,172 --> 00:46:19,886
You're right

502
00:46:20,672 --> 00:46:23,977
I wonder whether Iljimae uses magic and tricks like the Jun-Woo-Chi

503
00:46:24,966 --> 00:46:27,254
He is great anyway

504
00:46:27,735 --> 00:46:30,217
Magic!

505
00:46:52,163 --> 00:46:55,746
Sir, we meet again

506
00:46:56,697 --> 00:46:57,664
Off duty?

507
00:46:57,664 --> 00:46:58,941
What business do you have here?

508
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:03,211
Master Byun invited me

509
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:03,826
What?

510
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:07,395
Oh, you are curious about how the master and I got close?

511
00:47:08,306 --> 00:47:11,966
Its because my socializing skill is so great! Nothing more

512
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:13,391
Pathetic

513
00:47:13,391 --> 00:47:19,810
What's pathetic? Oh is it because he is the one who pulled my father's teeth out?

514
00:47:20,414 --> 00:47:23,165
Well, the past is in the past and..

515
00:47:23,165 --> 00:47:26,513
My father wasn't very innocent, so..

516
00:47:27,832 --> 00:47:32,775
By the way sir, I heard you've captured a fleeing government servant recently

517
00:47:33,526 --> 00:47:37,060
Capturing a fleeing slave must be very rewarding, isn't it?

518
00:47:37,728 --> 00:47:40,358
It seems like they haven't granted you a special promotion

519
00:47:43,885 --> 00:47:49,663
I'm sorry sir! Sorry sir! I will shut my mouth

520
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:05,643
This! This is pure gold and..

521
00:48:06,954 --> 00:48:07,684
and...

522
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,723
This one is a jade

523
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:15,419
This too! This one looks good, doesn't it?

524
00:48:15,419 --> 00:48:17,598
You certainly are a fashion leader my master!

525
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,084
I thought the big black dot under your ear was actually a giant mole

526
00:48:23,705 --> 00:48:27,918
I always thought that your fit line is beautiful and clean!

527
00:48:28,986 --> 00:48:31,887
Here master! Try this one on!

528
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:32,558
Shall I?

529
00:48:35,322 --> 00:48:38,816
By the way, your sister, she seems like a heroine

530
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:42,042
I've heard that she is constructing her own guest house by herself?

531
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:43,439
Oh, that?

532
00:48:44,263 --> 00:48:46,479
That's nothing. Father gave that to Eun Chae.

533
00:48:47,161 --> 00:48:49,270
Lady Eun Chae is extraordinary!

534
00:48:49,824 --> 00:48:52,738
Your father must care for her a lot, huh?

535
00:48:52,738 --> 00:48:54,190
He loves her

536
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:58,931
He even trusts her with all the classified documents.

537
00:48:58,931 --> 00:49:01,302
Classified documents?

538
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:09,113
You know, the list of wealth for each noble family, the number of soldiers, bribes, and so on.

539
00:49:29,955 --> 00:49:32,709
I've never seen the like of this in my life.

540
00:49:33,454 --> 00:49:38,613
What's wrong with him? 
 I think it's because of that thing, right?

541
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:12,639
Geom, Yeon...

542
00:50:16,021 --> 00:50:17,662
You're alive somewhere, aren't you?

543
00:50:47,675 --> 00:50:51,789
Daddy, why have you gotten so old suddenly?

544
00:50:52,864 --> 00:50:55,082
Still you eat all the healthy food

545
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,651
I wish you could stop doing all the hard works

546
00:52:30,597 --> 00:52:34,903
Why does she have to work so late with those lowlife people?

547
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:38,617
All you get by working with them is itchy

548
00:52:38,617 --> 00:52:40,308
I'm itchy just by imagining it!

549
00:52:42,704 --> 00:52:46,750
Servants are useless.

550
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:50,004
You take care of the business. Go clean that dirty guys and bring the lady home,  OK?

551
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:56,311
But, she were so stubborn last time.

552
00:52:57,218 --> 00:53:01,721
Since when did you start to question my order?

553
00:53:02,573 --> 00:53:09,473
Bring her home! If its necessary bring her by force

554
00:53:09,473 --> 00:53:11,717
Yes, my lord

555
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,395
Gee-bong

556
00:53:15,702 --> 00:53:23,174
If you happen to touch my precious daughter, even by a flash, I'll kill you

557
00:53:23,174 --> 00:53:25,016
Do not worry my lord!

558
00:53:33,092 --> 00:53:37,344
Go shit yourself!

559
00:53:38,981 --> 00:53:39,474
Bro!

560
00:53:40,495 --> 00:53:43,865
What brings you  here?

561
00:53:45,081 --> 00:53:47,898
I'm quite close to the Master Byun, you know.

562
00:53:48,619 --> 00:53:50,458
What about  you?

563
00:53:51,502 --> 00:53:54,114
I can't stand this job anymore because of the lady

564
00:53:54,114 --> 00:53:59,936
How could you possibly bring her by force and not touch her?! Damn you shit lord!

565
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:00,681
You mean lady Eun Chae?

566
00:54:40,205 --> 00:54:45,308
Let's go home my lady! You're only making us difficult

567
00:54:45,308 --> 00:54:48,013
Let go of this! Do not lay your hands on me!

568
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:52,908
My lady, I'm also in an awkward situation here

569
00:54:52,908 --> 00:54:54,952
What you doing?! Let's go!

570
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:30,882
Careful you girl!

571
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:35,321
Are you ok my lady? Its nothing, don't worry my lady

572
00:55:35,321 --> 00:55:37,080
Let's move

573
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:13,567


574
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,368
