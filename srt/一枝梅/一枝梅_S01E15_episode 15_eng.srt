1
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,019


2
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:43,247
It's Iljimae!

3
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:54,553
What's this? 
 It was for Yang Soon.

4
00:00:59,982 --> 00:01:05,477
What am I going to do? He's remembering.

5
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:29,201
Guard Byun!

6
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:31,574
It's been robbed!

7
00:01:31,907 --> 00:01:33,126
What? Which house?

8
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:39,965
My poor baby.

9
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:41,127
Lords Oh Gap Soo and Kim Woo Jin have also been robbed.

10
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:46,812
I looked into the members list of the Cheon-woo club

11
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:49,771
but no matter how much I looked, these three lords were not on the list.

12
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:52,785
How come?

13
00:02:56,214 --> 00:02:59,454
The thief only robs members of the Cheon-woo club.

14
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:03,459
You guessed right a couple of times

15
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,667
and it got to your big head, didn't it?

16
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:10,351
You had no idea you had the bull's hind leg...

17
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,243
Do you mean the actual proverb 'To catch a mouse with the bull walking backward'? 
  (meaning getting something by chance) 

18
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:24,914
You know

19
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:27,652
that red flower blossom

20
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:31,066
doesn't it look like it's mocking you?

21
00:03:34,116 --> 00:03:35,049
You don't think so?

22
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:39,094
Let's go.

23
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:17,014
What is this?

24
00:04:17,455 --> 00:04:19,545
It stinks!

25
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:21,440
Stinks?

26
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,261
It's a 300-year old ginseng!

27
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:26,263
A 300-year old ginseng?

28
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:31,844
It smells all bitter.

29
00:04:31,844 --> 00:04:32,934
I'm going to have a taste.

30
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:34,807
It's a porridge.

31
00:04:36,197 --> 00:04:37,066
It's hot!

32
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:42,232
Let me go!

33
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:45,253
Iljimae left this for us!

34
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:48,003
So that the ones who got hurt during the revolt could gain some energy!

35
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:50,496
That bat again?

36
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:53,215
He meddles in everyone's business.

37
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:55,341
People are cheering for him

38
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:57,126
so he has learned how to please the crowd.

39
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:07,009
How dare you!

40
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,102
You pathetic little things.

41
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:15,430
Do you have money lying around? Why are you imitating that bat-like jerk?

42
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,855
Your parents work so hard to earn money

43
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:20,602
and you are so immature!

44
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:23,449
What are you?

45
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:24,787
You Jung Chi Hong!

46
00:05:24,787 --> 00:05:27,676
You should be judged by the people and Iljimae!

47
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:31,393
What? Are you kidding me? Get out!

48
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:35,522
You little rats!

49
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:47,988
Dae Shik, how's the business going?

50
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:57,259
Hey, Iljimae!

51
00:05:57,952 --> 00:05:59,620
One bowl of maehwa alcohol!

52
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,739
Sure.

53
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:03,154
Here you go.

54
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:05,130
Bon appetit.

55
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:15,328
Here here!

56
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:17,121
My dear Duk!

57
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:22,446
I'm here! Come out right now!

58
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:26,069
Here! Here!

59
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,007
Dae Shik! Did something terrible happen while I was gone?

60
00:06:31,552 --> 00:06:33,033
Are you going to war?

61
00:06:35,756 --> 00:06:37,835
My dear husband is here!

62
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:42,876
Look at you! You're so thin!

63
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:44,995
You missed me, didn't you?

64
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:50,781
What took you so long?

65
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:54,571
All the Gisaeng houses are waiting for you.

66
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,853
What? The Gisaeng house?

67
00:06:58,234 --> 00:07:00,091
Where were you and what exactly did you do?

68
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:01,161
Tell me!

69
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:04,396
Who do you think your husband is?

70
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:08,409
Come here!

71
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:10,356
All right, all right!

72
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:13,371
You're in such a hurry!

73
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,721
Hi Dosanim!

74
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:32,564
Yong, my brother, welcome.

75
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,217
Let's go.

76
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:35,744
What? Where are we going?

77
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,361
The lock was untouched...

78
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,954
Who knew he would cut off the whole door?

79
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:59,030
So...did you find out something?

80
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:02,785
Let's go.

81
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:04,308
Sure.

82
00:08:06,424 --> 00:08:10,006
Well, dear sir Guard, it's been a while!

83
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:12,898
So, have you been well during all this time?

84
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:18,149
You're still not very talkative, are you?

85
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:20,809
Well then, good day.

86
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:27,077
What is that little brat doing here again?

87
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,213
Is he Byun Dosa's leech or what?

88
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:33,650
Is he even allowed to bring him around to the crime scene?

89
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,329
Look at these! They would cost a fortune!

90
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:38,667
Right, Dosanim?

91
00:08:58,085 --> 00:08:58,857
What's that?

92
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:04,529
I think it's some kind of fire residue.

93
00:09:05,873 --> 00:09:06,838
Fire residue?

94
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:13,688
Yes, this is indeed some kind of fire residue.

95
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:18,495
If there's residue, then it means that something did burn here.

96
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,694
Oh my, could it be? A rope?

97
00:09:24,727 --> 00:09:28,982
Yes, that's it. Something came down from the rooftop

98
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:31,153
and went back through the roof.

99
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:42,501
What is staring at the door going to bring you?

100
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:45,712
The thief

101
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,270
came from the roof.

102
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:57,739
He opened the rooftop

103
00:09:57,739 --> 00:10:00,985
came down through a rope and stole everything

104
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:02,006
and he went back.

105
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:05,171
With the rope again.

106
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,823
He burn the rope

107
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:10,091
because he wanted to get rid of any evidence

108
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:13,952
of how he came here and left.

109
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:17,373
Then why is the door broken?

110
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:18,664
Well, that...

111
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:24,470
Oh that! That's because...

112
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,909
He came down with the rope

113
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:30,185
and then cut the door from inside and escaped.

114
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:33,600
No.

115
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:36,129
Iljimae didn't come from up there

116
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:38,874
he definitely came from out the door.

117
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:49,869
The door wasn't cut from the inside

118
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:51,582
it was cut from the outside.

119
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:57,487
This time, Byun Dosa, you're in the wrong.

120
00:10:58,386 --> 00:10:59,517
Then,

121
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:02,046
what is that powder?

122
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:03,165
I don't know.

123
00:11:03,941 --> 00:11:06,465
Maybe, like you said,

124
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:09,867
he could have gotten in through the roof.

125
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:13,902
But this door was definitely cut from the outside

126
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,740
then...

127
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:18,859
he has an accomplice.

128
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:23,204
Oh... an accomplice.

129
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:24,967
Accomplice? Yeah right.

130
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:28,491
Get in line! Get in line!

131
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,048
Come on!

132
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:39,429
Lord Lee Seung Min's household, three fish-locks.

133
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:45,986
Lord Lee Sang Wook's household, two lotus-locks, and one additional padlock.

134
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,035
Hey, don't cut in line!

135
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:52,398
You there who cut in line!

136
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,034
People shouldn't...

137
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:59,725
Oh, you're the one who made the reservation!

138
00:12:01,023 --> 00:12:03,165
Get in line!

139
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:06,276
Ajussi! Swe Dol ajussi!

140
00:12:06,674 --> 00:12:09,081
Ajussi! Was my father here?

141
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,862
I haven't seen him since this morning.

142
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:13,736
I have to take him this.

143
00:12:13,736 --> 00:12:15,024
Oh, your father?

144
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,047
He went to his second job.

145
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:18,103
His second job?

146
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,624
I'm going to break this over your head!

147
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:31,129
I told you the slippery ones don't work!

148
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:35,681
What if Iljimae comes here

149
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:37,892
and he steps on it and falls down?

150
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:40,896
Are you going to take the responsibility?

151
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:57,812
He told you to be careful.

152
00:12:57,812 --> 00:12:58,631
Thank you.

153
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:04,463
Where does the horse come from?

154
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:06,908
My father sent it to me.

155
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:09,843
And just a little while ago he was so mad at you!

156
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:14,463
Isn't it some kind of bribery to convince you to stay calm and not get into trouble?

157
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:17,805
I know. I guess it is, yes.

158
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:20,692
You have your wish fulfilled. You really wanted it.

159
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:24,044
If I were you, I would have asked

160
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:25,663
for jewelry or something.

161
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:27,778
Isn't he handsome?

162
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:31,670
It's a horse, how handsome can it be?

163
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:34,675
Hold on, this horse

164
00:13:34,675 --> 00:13:36,322
is very similar!

165
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:40,235
Miss, you haven't named it yet, have you?

166
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:43,679
Shall I name it for you?

167
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:46,227
How about Iljima?  ('ma' means horse) 

168
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:47,894
Iljima?

169
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:48,619
It fits perfectly, don't you think?

170
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:52,467
It's black, and it's fast. Iljima!

171
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:03,524
Have you heard?

172
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:04,559
Yes.

173
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:10,941
This time, none of the three households were members of the Cheon-woo club?

174
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:16,202
See? I told you so.

175
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:17,798
How can you defend a thief?

176
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:24,120
Never mind. I'm leaving.

177
00:14:30,196 --> 00:14:33,390
Look carefully and follow me.

178
00:14:33,796 --> 00:14:37,930
Wherever the rabbit is about to pass, bend a tree branch like this

179
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,640
and put it like this

180
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,120
the rabbit will jump its way over here

181
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:49,456
It's ok, I'm not hurt.

182
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,853
I feel bad for the rabbit, Father.

183
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:51,967
You fool.

184
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:57,078
I raised you without your mother! You should feel bad for me!

185
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:01,304
Here...

186
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:04,895
Are you Hunter Jang?

187
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:07,128
Yes, but who are you?

188
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:10,270
I'm telling you, I'm sure of it.

189
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,391
Lord Shim Gi Won, who passed away, also met him.

190
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:17,611
The day Lord Shim was executed

191
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:19,875
and the day that slave woman who ran away was hung

192
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,078
he was there at both places.

193
00:15:25,294 --> 00:15:28,046
Really? 
 I'm telling you, it's him.

194
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:31,279
Why don't you meet with him first?

195
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:34,571
All right.

196
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:36,544
Go and tell him.

197
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:40,957
If he wants to know about his father's death, he can come meet me tomorrow.

198
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,476
Sir.

199
00:15:48,564 --> 00:15:50,858
If it's certain, I will give you the rest.

200
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:54,955
And, remember that this is all a secret.

201
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:57,689
If this secret is discovered,

202
00:15:58,288 --> 00:16:01,273
your son's life and yours are over.

203
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:05,606
Of course, don't you worry.

204
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:29,189
Haven't you heard something?

205
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,858
What?

206
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:34,757
Lee Won Ho's son is alive!

207
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:42,668
You were also very close with Lee Won Ho, wasn't he?

208
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,958
So we should keep this secret from His Majesty.

209
00:16:49,063 --> 00:16:50,688
Oh, that rumor?

210
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:52,251
Yes, I did hear about that.

211
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:56,139
I did do my research after hearing it

212
00:16:57,545 --> 00:16:58,938
that is...

213
00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:00,196
That is?

214
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:02,698
No, it's nothing.

215
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:04,553
Have you found him?

216
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:06,828
Well, actually...

217
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:12,910
We found him, yes, but he's dead.

218
00:17:13,977 --> 00:17:16,039
He's dead?

219
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,036
Yes.

220
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,316
He was alive until recently

221
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:24,118
but after his sister died, he was involved in a gang fight

222
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:26,433
and he got stabbed with a sword.

223
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:33,022
Oh, I see.

224
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:35,637
I even verified the body.

225
00:17:41,718 --> 00:17:44,428
The poor child, what was he guilty of?

226
00:17:45,486 --> 00:17:47,970
If only I had found him sooner

227
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,323
I would have taken care of him

228
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:55,342
as if  he were my own son, with all my love.

229
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:57,439
What a shame.

230
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:14,454
His Majesty is here.

231
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:35,467
You fool.

232
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:37,733
Why didn't you avoid it?

233
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,311
Even if it had been a sword

234
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:42,760
I wouldn't have avoided it.

235
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,778
I'm sorry.

236
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:45,773
You are

237
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:47,937
like a god to me.

238
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:52,307
Your Majesty, Lord Byungpan is here.

239
00:18:52,307 --> 00:18:53,734
He may come in.

240
00:19:00,888 --> 00:19:04,847
I heard you were here.

241
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,155
What is this about?

242
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:11,394
I heard Lee Won Ho's son is dead.

243
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,141
What?

244
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:15,740
Are you sure?

245
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,861
Yes, I am. I heard it from Kim Ik Hee himself.

246
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:24,088
I understand he even verified the body himself.

247
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:25,370
Can you trust him?

248
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,489
I also had my men check it out

249
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:30,648
and it is certain information.

250
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:31,844
Is that so?

251
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:39,986
Then, how about going for a hunt tomorrow? It's been a long time.

252
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,794
We have something to hunt.

253
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:47,681
Yes, Your Majesty, I will have it ready.

254
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:49,874
We have to cajole Jung Myung Soo as well.

255
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:54,155
We need to get over with things that need to be completed.

256
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:57,515
Oh, the hunt?

257
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,401
That is exactly what I meant.

258
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:06,284
It's been a long time for me too, Your Majesty,

259
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:09,691
I might do some stretching.

260
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:19,612
Hey, Geom.

261
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:27,401
Oh, you? I thought you were being quiet for a while, and here you are again.

262
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:32,901
Well, true, I was getting curious about your whereabouts because I didn't see you.

263
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:36,979
So, do you still get by like this?

264
00:20:38,451 --> 00:20:40,206
I came here to tell you something.

265
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:47,233
Lord Kim Ik Hee wants to see you tomorrow morning.

266
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:49,097
It's about your father's death.

267
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:52,824
Geez, is it about my father again? My father is not dead!

268
00:20:52,824 --> 00:20:55,572
All the households in this village

269
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:58,072
are protected by my father's locks.

270
00:20:58,072 --> 00:20:59,470
Geez.

271
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:02,570
I did my job, I told the message.

272
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:07,649
You're so dirty!

273
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,446
You dirty pig!

274
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,478
Kim Ik Hee?

275
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,901
Kim Ik Hee...

276
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:54,262
You can still see the scars.

277
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:57,133
You should have escaped the beatings.

278
00:21:57,587 --> 00:22:00,612
You tried to protect me and took all of them.

279
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,450
Come inside.

280
00:22:04,145 --> 00:22:05,523
I'll put some ointment on them.

281
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:07,746
It's fine. They are all healed now.

282
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:09,605
It doesn't hurt anymore.

283
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:14,268
But why is this brat not coming home?

284
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:17,503
I can only sleep when he comes home.

285
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:22,094
Tonight, I won't let him out of my sight, whatever happens.

286
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:24,701
I'm going to have right next to me.

287
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:28,180
Whatever pleases you then.

288
00:23:10,151 --> 00:23:12,794
Hey, one more here.

289
00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:16,036
Bong Soon, bring them this drink quickly.

290
00:23:16,036 --> 00:23:20,369
And Bong Soon, clean up that table quickly.

291
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:23,937
Also, bring me some alcohol from the barrel.

292
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:33,508
Yong!

293
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:35,878
You're here.

294
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:39,828
Would you like some maehwa alcohol?

295
00:23:39,828 --> 00:23:42,907
Don't you know I'm a gentleman who doesn't drink?

296
00:23:42,907 --> 00:23:44,308
No need for maehwa alcohol.

297
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:46,850
Sit here.

298
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,495
Why?

299
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:55,970
Here. 
 What? Did I do something wrong again?

300
00:23:58,675 --> 00:23:59,726
You're free.

301
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:02,541
Why?

302
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,564
What do you mean why? I'm letting you go free. You don't want that?

303
00:24:05,118 --> 00:24:08,486
No! I want to be in your debt forever.

304
00:24:08,486 --> 00:24:10,255
What are you, crazy?

305
00:24:10,255 --> 00:24:13,725
How are you going to do that? Go! Go! Leave!

306
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:15,858
If you don't leave

307
00:24:15,858 --> 00:24:17,846
I'm going to report you to the authorities.

308
00:24:22,814 --> 00:24:25,143
What's wrong?

309
00:24:25,143 --> 00:24:26,290
Hey! Let me go!

310
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,579
What is happening over there?

311
00:24:31,777 --> 00:24:34,407
That's so weird.

312
00:24:35,514 --> 00:24:36,557
What is wrong with you?

313
00:24:36,557 --> 00:24:37,975
Oh, you're scared now?

314
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:40,399
My master is setting me free, I should repay him back.

315
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:42,259
Are you crazy?

316
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,645
You're crazy!

317
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:06,577
My my, look at how you're turning red!

318
00:25:06,577 --> 00:25:10,147
Hold on... it's your first, isn't it?

319
00:25:10,147 --> 00:25:11,615
It's your first, right?

320
00:25:12,557 --> 00:25:16,375
I didn't see you that way, but you're quite innocent!

321
00:25:19,755 --> 00:25:22,345
I'm going to kill you!

322
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:02,483
Right.

323
00:26:03,552 --> 00:26:05,708
When I meet with Kim Ik Hee tomorrow

324
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,964
everything will be over.

325
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:44,130
Take Seom Seom in. 
 I'm sorry Miss?

326
00:26:44,743 --> 00:26:46,859
I have my horse.

327
00:26:49,364 --> 00:26:50,585
Iljima.

328
00:26:51,768 --> 00:26:53,386
What?

329
00:27:19,582 --> 00:27:21,934
You were quite the archer.

330
00:27:24,198 --> 00:27:26,104
Do you know

331
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:28,953
how much I went looking for you?

332
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,249
You were hurt

333
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,717
Do you know how long it has been?

334
00:27:37,717 --> 00:27:41,921
I came here to thank you for saving my life.

335
00:27:42,848 --> 00:27:44,517
All right.

336
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:49,757
Well, then.

337
00:28:46,647 --> 00:28:48,602
Miss!

338
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:39,024
You don't know, do you?

339
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:42,242
When the flower blossoms

340
00:29:43,363 --> 00:29:45,373
it is so beautiful here.

341
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,566
It's a special place for me.

342
00:30:06,566 --> 00:30:09,415
I really wanted to show you.

343
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:16,861
When I was a child, I met a boy here.

344
00:30:20,545 --> 00:30:22,556
He was my first love.

345
00:30:24,945 --> 00:30:26,451
But...

346
00:30:27,176 --> 00:30:29,905
that boy died.

347
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,325
He is still in my heart.

348
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:42,779
Even dead

349
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,817
that boy must be quite happy.

350
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:55,343
And then I met a man here.

351
00:30:57,358 --> 00:31:00,493
I wondered whether he was that boy who had come back to life.

352
00:31:01,368 --> 00:31:04,387
I had that stupid thought for a while.

353
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,406
That's such nonsense.

354
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,570
And...

355
00:31:30,232 --> 00:31:32,566
Your face...

356
00:31:32,566 --> 00:31:35,108
could you show it to me?

357
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,616
I'm sorry.

358
00:32:37,784 --> 00:32:39,289
I may not

359
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:41,396
see you again.

360
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:48,023
Why?

361
00:34:16,983 --> 00:34:18,260
This house

362
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,942
sell it to me.

363
00:34:19,942 --> 00:34:22,745
Don't talk nonsense. Get out of here immediately.

364
00:34:22,745 --> 00:34:25,037
The pot may seem small

365
00:34:25,037 --> 00:34:26,448
but it is quite deep.

366
00:34:26,448 --> 00:34:29,702
Even I could fit in here.

367
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:32,279
You don't believe me?

368
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,781
There's quite a lot of amount of money in  here.

369
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,116
It's money I've earned without food and sleep.

370
00:34:41,116 --> 00:34:43,831
Please sell this house to me.

371
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:47,494
You there, get this girl out immediately.

372
00:34:47,494 --> 00:34:49,827
Go away!

373
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:54,950
By the way Madam, the workers are here, shall I tell them to start?

374
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,650
Yes. Don't touch the other trees

375
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,859
and tell them to just root out that blossom tree.

376
00:35:00,237 --> 00:35:02,924
I have to go to check.

377
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:10,529
Don't hurt the other trees.

378
00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:12,162
Be careful.

379
00:35:12,162 --> 00:35:13,230
Yes Madam.

380
00:35:13,756 --> 00:35:17,660
But this tree is over 100 years old. Why?

381
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,703
It is quite a sight when the flowers blossom

382
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:22,451
but on other days, it's quite the eye sore.

383
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:24,881
It's just plain big.

384
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:27,223
Take it out.

385
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:29,168
No! No!

386
00:35:30,268 --> 00:35:31,210
No! You can't!

387
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,850
She's not gone yet? Get her out of here immediately!

388
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,546
Sell it to me.

389
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:36,466
What?

390
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:40,033
I'll give you all this money.

391
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:41,390
Sell it to me.

392
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,122
It's quite enough for a tree, isn't it?

393
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:46,733
You're giving me all that money? 
 Yes.

394
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,596
Sell it to me.

395
00:35:49,595 --> 00:35:50,447
Is that so?

396
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:52,037
All right then.

397
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:55,783
You have to let it be there.

398
00:35:55,783 --> 00:35:57,498
You can't take it away, ever!

399
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,286
Aunt!

400
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,056
Thank god.

401
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:09,171
It's still here.

402
00:36:14,502 --> 00:36:16,227
You want to take this tree out?

403
00:36:16,227 --> 00:36:18,149
No you can't.

404
00:36:18,149 --> 00:36:19,042
Hey.

405
00:36:20,398 --> 00:36:22,258
Please move away.

406
00:36:23,494 --> 00:36:27,307
Take three steps away from it.

407
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:28,785
You.

408
00:36:30,777 --> 00:36:32,129
It's mine.

409
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,000
Aunt?

410
00:36:34,415 --> 00:36:36,344
I want to get rid of it anyways

411
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:39,159
but she gave me money, so...

412
00:36:42,823 --> 00:36:45,336
I'll give you ten times that amount, so please don't sell it.

413
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,191
Leave it as it is.

414
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:48,682
You're too late.

415
00:36:51,245 --> 00:36:53,730
This is Bong Soon's property from now on.

416
00:36:57,884 --> 00:37:00,523
Grow, my baby.

417
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:02,374
You have to blossom again next year, don't you?

418
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:09,349
You're wanted at the court.

419
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:11,235
His Majesty is planning to go hunting today.

420
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:12,095
Hunting?

421
00:37:12,095 --> 00:37:13,602
Why suddenly?

422
00:37:13,602 --> 00:37:14,600
I do wonder too.

423
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:17,259
Everyone at the court

424
00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:19,801
is to be there. It's an order.

425
00:37:22,738 --> 00:37:24,475
All right.

426
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:44,703
This is just for you, so hunt at your will.

427
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,809
Sure.

428
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:50,496
Don't worry.

429
00:37:50,496 --> 00:37:53,762
Do you really think I'll send your son away from this country?

430
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:58,783
Once we have Iljimae, it will be all over.

431
00:37:59,122 --> 00:38:00,473
Well then...

432
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,176
Just wait a little.

433
00:38:05,668 --> 00:38:07,899
I understand, Your Majesty.

434
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:10,475
Shall we start the hunt?

435
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:42,339
It is indeed Geom.

436
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,388
Are you all right?

437
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:34,316
Yes.

438
00:39:34,821 --> 00:39:36,305
Bastard.

439
00:39:36,305 --> 00:39:38,244
What good has he done?

440
00:39:47,182 --> 00:39:49,575
Your Majesty, you don't disappoint me.

441
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:53,036
You still have your hunting skills.

442
00:39:54,343 --> 00:39:56,238
Let's go back now.

443
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:12,372
What?

444
00:40:14,764 --> 00:40:16,042
What is it?

445
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:17,842
The thing is...

446
00:40:20,813 --> 00:40:21,932
What?

447
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:23,717
Go there at once.

448
00:40:23,717 --> 00:40:25,851
Yes your Majesty. 
 Shi Won, let's go.

449
00:40:46,753 --> 00:40:48,433
Bring him.

450
00:41:06,582 --> 00:41:09,342
How did he meet such fate in such a place?

451
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,839
What happened?

452
00:41:56,839 --> 00:41:58,540
His lordship

453
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:02,213
has passed away.

454
00:42:02,213 --> 00:42:03,906
What? How?

455
00:42:03,906 --> 00:42:05,226
He went out hunting

456
00:42:05,226 --> 00:42:07,297
and he had an accident.

457
00:42:07,297 --> 00:42:08,765
His lordship...

458
00:42:18,855 --> 00:42:20,575
About your father's death.

459
00:42:20,575 --> 00:42:24,343
I'm about to tell you about the unfair death of your father.

460
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:27,756
Tell Geom.

461
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:30,449
Why...

462
00:42:31,486 --> 00:42:32,533
Who on earth?

463
00:42:43,046 --> 00:42:46,075
He is the best rider in town

464
00:42:46,075 --> 00:42:47,701
and he falls over his horse during the hunt?

465
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:49,741
It's nonsense!

466
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:52,037
What tragedy is this?

467
00:42:54,946 --> 00:42:59,124
My heart aches for what happened to Kim Ik Hee.

468
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:02,440
But why did you want to speak to me privately about?

469
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:06,577
Your Majesty,

470
00:43:06,577 --> 00:43:09,524
we have nothing to do with this incident.

471
00:43:09,524 --> 00:43:11,533
This incident? What do you mean?

472
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:14,092
Is there something I don't know about?

473
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,290
Well, Kim Ik Hee

474
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:19,136
came to us with Kwon Doo Hyung's message written in his own blood

475
00:43:19,136 --> 00:43:22,391
but we assumed that it was all staged

476
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:26,793
and we tried to stop him when he wanted to take the message to Chung.

477
00:43:26,793 --> 00:43:28,596
Yes, Your Majesty.

478
00:43:28,596 --> 00:43:31,146
We only found out recently

479
00:43:31,146 --> 00:43:34,431
that he tried to get a message to Chung.

480
00:43:34,431 --> 00:43:37,796
We didn't know he actually did it.

481
00:43:37,796 --> 00:43:40,395
We do apologize for not

482
00:43:40,395 --> 00:43:42,930
acting more strongly with him.

483
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:47,736
Your Majesty, we deserve to die.

484
00:43:47,736 --> 00:43:49,378
I see.

485
00:43:49,378 --> 00:43:51,337
So that's what happened.

486
00:43:52,288 --> 00:43:55,000
I had no idea.

487
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:59,306
You must have gone through a hard time during all this time.

488
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:02,052
Your Majesty, Kim Ik Hee

489
00:44:02,052 --> 00:44:04,995
betrayed the promise we made to the heavens.

490
00:44:04,995 --> 00:44:06,637
A promise?

491
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:08,519
I see.

492
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:13,608
Won Ho, Shim Ki Won, Doo Hyung, Ik Hee.

493
00:44:13,608 --> 00:44:15,592
And you two.

494
00:44:15,592 --> 00:44:17,401
Us seven,

495
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:19,498
if it hadn't been for the promise all seven us made,

496
00:44:19,498 --> 00:44:21,820
how could we have gotten rid of Gwang Hae

497
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,520
and how could I be here now?

498
00:44:25,064 --> 00:44:26,289
Your Majesty.

499
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,116
I have not forgotten, for a second,

500
00:44:28,116 --> 00:44:31,610
that you were my precious friends.

501
00:44:32,322 --> 00:44:34,847
So don't worry

502
00:44:34,847 --> 00:44:36,620
and get back to your homes reassured.

503
00:44:37,322 --> 00:44:42,490
Yes, Your Majesty, you do us honor.

504
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:53,882
I will kill them both right now.

505
00:44:55,215 --> 00:44:56,380
No.

506
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,922
No matter what,

507
00:44:59,922 --> 00:45:02,296
they are the ones who allowed me to be here today.

508
00:45:03,071 --> 00:45:05,626
As long as they don't threaten my position

509
00:45:05,626 --> 00:45:08,310
there's no reason to kill them, is there?

510
00:45:09,608 --> 00:45:11,856
Let's leave them as they are and watch them.

511
00:45:13,596 --> 00:45:15,904
I will put a trail on them.

512
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,378
Still?

513
00:45:19,558 --> 00:45:21,445
If I have to wait like this

514
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:24,213
I will go and catch him myself.

515
00:45:25,842 --> 00:45:27,173
Really?

516
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:32,136
Just turn a blind eye to what I will do.

517
00:45:32,136 --> 00:45:35,532
If you can catch Iljimae for us,

518
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,683
then I will turn a blind eye to anything.

519
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:43,397
But, if you catch him, you'll have to turn him in to our authorities and offices.

520
00:45:43,397 --> 00:45:45,662
Our offices are not doing very well these days.

521
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:47,372
Tomorrow, send some guards

522
00:45:48,926 --> 00:45:51,649
to my place of stay.

523
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:54,217
Sure, I can arrange that.

524
00:46:12,474 --> 00:46:13,955
Hey, hey.

525
00:46:13,955 --> 00:46:15,610
Go away!

526
00:46:16,322 --> 00:46:17,935
Here...

527
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:20,400
there was this man who used to be a thief here.

528
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,835
Who? Swe Dol?

529
00:46:21,835 --> 00:46:23,028
Dan?

530
00:46:23,028 --> 00:46:26,524
Go to that locksmith shop over there.

531
00:46:30,406 --> 00:46:32,265
Wait!

532
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:34,930
What now?

533
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,779
It's boor skin.

534
00:46:36,779 --> 00:46:38,529
My father told me to bring it to you.

535
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:41,302
Right. Are you Hunter Jang's son?

536
00:46:42,193 --> 00:46:44,819
By the way, you have to leave soon.

537
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:47,270
They are taking everyone away. It's a mess.

538
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:59,543
Dae Shik.

539
00:47:01,042 --> 00:47:02,655
Dae Shik!

540
00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:07,482
Why are you so surprised?

541
00:47:08,858 --> 00:47:10,012
Is Dae Shik out?

542
00:47:10,012 --> 00:47:11,293
Come here.

543
00:47:12,965 --> 00:47:14,247
What?

544
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:19,406
Geez!

545
00:47:19,406 --> 00:47:21,212
Hide!

546
00:47:21,212 --> 00:47:22,380
What is he doing in there?

547
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:25,632
You get in there too. 
 Why?

548
00:47:25,632 --> 00:47:26,893
The guards

549
00:47:26,893 --> 00:47:30,750
are taking away all the young men!

550
00:47:35,515 --> 00:47:37,149
Where are you going?

551
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:39,095
I'm going to see what's going on.

552
00:47:39,095 --> 00:47:42,049
What do you think you're doing? What if you get caught?

553
00:47:42,049 --> 00:47:45,338
Hey, I am very fast, as you very well know.

554
00:47:45,338 --> 00:47:47,343
Don't worry, I'll be careful when I watch them.

555
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:51,194
Yong! Yong!

556
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,649
Yong!

557
00:47:55,386 --> 00:47:56,619
Please! Don't hurt me!

558
00:48:02,778 --> 00:48:06,183
Hey, he said he doesn't want to! Why are you taking him away?

559
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:07,124
Are you all right?

560
00:48:07,124 --> 00:48:08,117
Take him away too!

561
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:11,611
What are you doing? Leave me alone!

562
00:48:11,611 --> 00:48:13,562
I haven't done anything wrong!

563
00:48:13,562 --> 00:48:15,500
I'm Yong!

564
00:48:17,118 --> 00:48:21,979
Please save Yong! He is so weak!

565
00:48:23,748 --> 00:48:25,807
Why are you leaving?

566
00:48:30,226 --> 00:48:31,545
Stand straight!

567
00:48:36,731 --> 00:48:40,198
Hey, why did you bring us here?

568
00:48:40,198 --> 00:48:43,621
I don't know. Apparently it's a bait to catch Iljimae.

569
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,093
What?

570
00:48:48,687 --> 00:48:52,191
I hear you all gathered here to play Iljimae with me?

571
00:48:53,028 --> 00:48:54,703
Let's have some fun.

572
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:05,138
What's the matter?

573
00:49:05,138 --> 00:49:06,664
Are you sick?

574
00:49:06,664 --> 00:49:09,560
In life you earn some, you lose some.

575
00:49:10,297 --> 00:49:12,571
Hey buddy, being in trade,

576
00:49:12,571 --> 00:49:16,966
it means that sometimes you have big sales, sometimes you don't.

577
00:49:16,966 --> 00:49:18,276
Hey you.

578
00:49:18,276 --> 00:49:22,270
Don't bark like a dog here! You're loud!

579
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:23,240
Do you understand?

580
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:26,502
Look at this lock!

581
00:49:26,502 --> 00:49:28,599
I could open it myself!

582
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:31,203
Even my five-year old son could unlock it! You cheater!

583
00:49:31,203 --> 00:49:33,172
Make a new one! Or give me my money back!

584
00:49:33,172 --> 00:49:34,400
Look at these two.

585
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,198
There's no giving your money back! Once you buy it, it's over!

586
00:49:38,198 --> 00:49:39,661
Leave this place at once!

587
00:49:41,221 --> 00:49:43,011
Take it.

588
00:49:50,934 --> 00:49:52,066
What is wrong with you?

589
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,870
Is Dan giving you trouble?

590
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:57,773
I'm going to take a break from the shop.

591
00:49:59,991 --> 00:50:02,140
I'm with Iljimae.

592
00:50:02,649 --> 00:50:06,408
I can't let Iljimae get caught because of the locks I make.

593
00:50:06,408 --> 00:50:09,992
Good thinking!

594
00:50:11,598 --> 00:50:16,542
I'll make your shoes for free for the rest of your life.

595
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:20,746
Yes! I'll give you soup for free for a month!

596
00:50:20,746 --> 00:50:21,727
What?

597
00:50:23,115 --> 00:50:25,172
Are you the owner of the inn?

598
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:29,127
What? What is Faithful Duk's is mine,

599
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:31,374
and what is mine is... mine.

600
00:50:31,374 --> 00:50:32,498
What?

601
00:50:32,498 --> 00:50:33,720
Faithful Duk?

602
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,662
How dare you? The title 'faithful' belongs to Swe Dol!

603
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,785
What are you saying?

604
00:50:40,406 --> 00:50:44,194
Come here!

605
00:50:44,194 --> 00:50:47,247
Fine, I'm going with Faithful too then!

606
00:50:47,247 --> 00:50:49,385
Did Swe Dol buy the word 'faithful'?

607
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,160
Don't do it!

608
00:51:07,652 --> 00:51:09,272
I'll give this to you

609
00:51:09,272 --> 00:51:11,493
give this to me.

610
00:51:24,153 --> 00:51:26,735
Is something wrong?

611
00:51:27,707 --> 00:51:29,580
Why are you closing the shop so early?

612
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,681
No, it's nothing.

613
00:51:31,681 --> 00:51:34,214
I'm going to take a break for some time.

614
00:51:34,214 --> 00:51:36,242
Ajussi!

615
00:51:36,242 --> 00:51:41,303
Ajussi! Yong was taken away!

616
00:51:41,303 --> 00:51:43,298
Our Yong?

617
00:51:43,298 --> 00:51:45,375
Where? Where did they take him to?

618
00:51:55,262 --> 00:51:56,346
Bok!

619
00:51:56,784 --> 00:51:58,372
Bok!

620
00:51:58,372 --> 00:52:01,696
Bok!

621
00:52:07,463 --> 00:52:10,125
Did they take away your son too?

622
00:52:13,121 --> 00:52:15,104
Bok!

623
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,901
What are you doing here?

624
00:52:27,413 --> 00:52:28,723
Was Yong taken away too?

625
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,778
These bastards!

626
00:52:32,778 --> 00:52:34,865
Don't worry too much.

627
00:52:34,865 --> 00:52:36,408
Nothing's going to happen.

628
00:52:36,408 --> 00:52:39,762
Do you think our Iljimae will just stand by and watch?

629
00:52:40,806 --> 00:52:42,458
He will come. He will come soon!

630
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:45,938
He will change into his black costume and he will come.

631
00:52:45,938 --> 00:52:47,228
He will definitely come.

632
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:51,151
But it's broad daylight. Will he really come?

633
00:52:51,151 --> 00:52:52,737
Have we ever seen him during daylight?

634
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:57,167
That's true... but still, this is a serious matter!

635
00:52:58,146 --> 00:52:59,624
Iljimae is over...

636
00:52:59,624 --> 00:53:02,063
Over? Over where? Where?

637
00:53:02,063 --> 00:53:03,070
He's here!

638
00:53:10,685 --> 00:53:14,382
Why do you all look upset?

639
00:53:14,382 --> 00:53:18,993
Just think of it as a game and enjoy.

640
00:53:20,453 --> 00:53:23,498
Oh, oh, you're scared that they might get hurt?

641
00:53:27,335 --> 00:53:31,953
My son is one of the best archers in Chung.

642
00:53:31,953 --> 00:53:33,786
So don't you worry.

643
00:53:33,786 --> 00:53:38,349
Just enjoy! Enjoy! I even  have food ready.

644
00:53:39,076 --> 00:53:41,374
Just enjoy, huh?

645
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:10,911
It's a bait, your Majesty.

646
00:54:11,842 --> 00:54:13,729
Do you think he will show up?

647
00:54:14,481 --> 00:54:15,981
Yes, Your Majesty.

648
00:54:15,981 --> 00:54:18,371
Considering how things have progressed so far,

649
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:21,842
a matter this serious, he will definitely be here.

650
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:25,358
Once that black bat jerk appears

651
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:28,242
we will get rid of him at once.

652
00:54:28,242 --> 00:54:30,399
Don't you think it will create chaos among the people?

653
00:54:31,266 --> 00:54:32,700
Because of the other incident,

654
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:37,142
there has been some grave misunderstanding between the people and the Chung envoy

655
00:54:37,142 --> 00:54:38,925
Jung Myung Soo

656
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:40,863
has invited the people

657
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:44,017
and they're enjoying some games together.

658
00:54:44,017 --> 00:54:46,609
I have not been reported about this.

659
00:54:47,643 --> 00:54:49,413
Of course Your Majesty.

660
00:54:49,413 --> 00:54:53,614
That is exactly what I mean.

661
00:54:54,233 --> 00:54:58,464
Once we get Iljimae, everything will be quiet.

662
00:54:58,464 --> 00:55:02,100
With him gone, what can they do?

663
00:55:27,143 --> 00:55:28,196
Restrain yourself.

664
00:55:28,831 --> 00:55:30,974
I want to catch Iljimae as well

665
00:55:31,648 --> 00:55:32,936
but this is not right.

666
00:55:33,502 --> 00:55:36,553
What kind of game is that? It's so brutal.

667
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,697
Is that a real archery game?

668
00:55:45,952 --> 00:55:46,890
That's Yong!

669
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:50,142
How dare they? My brother!

670
00:55:51,538 --> 00:55:54,664
He's my man!

671
00:56:06,538 --> 00:56:08,551
He is a very good archer.

672
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:10,855
With that other incident, he won't hurt anyone.

673
00:56:12,649 --> 00:56:14,421
It's just a bait to catch Iljimae.

674
00:56:14,421 --> 00:56:16,117
So calm down.

675
00:56:20,786 --> 00:56:22,045
Come here.

676
00:56:27,979 --> 00:56:29,673
This is too easy.

677
00:56:30,233 --> 00:56:32,494
Hey, bring me some drink.

678
00:56:59,607 --> 00:57:00,982
Look at that.

679
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:04,616
Hey! That guy just peed!

680
00:57:11,153 --> 00:57:12,825
So dirty!

681
00:57:12,825 --> 00:57:14,834
Stay right there! Don't move.

682
00:57:37,196 --> 00:57:39,743
Yong!

683
00:57:39,743 --> 00:57:41,166
Yong!

684
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:46,229
Put him behind my back!

685
00:57:46,637 --> 00:57:48,321
I will carry him!

686
00:57:48,321 --> 00:57:49,078
Just let me carry him!

687
00:57:49,078 --> 00:57:51,729
Here! Put him there!

688
00:57:53,406 --> 00:57:55,981
Yong!

689
00:58:02,535 --> 00:58:03,776
Ja Dol.

690
00:58:11,515 --> 00:58:13,806
What about Bok? What about my son Bok?

691
00:58:19,313 --> 00:58:22,683
Doctor Song! Doctor Song!

692
00:58:25,929 --> 00:58:28,467
So far, except for the one who got shot,

693
00:58:28,467 --> 00:58:31,384
we have them all kept at the envoy's house

694
00:58:31,384 --> 00:58:34,482
but people are getting angrier.

695
00:58:34,482 --> 00:58:37,848
You couldn't take care of that simple thing?

696
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,974
That kid... he's between life and death?

697
00:58:43,505 --> 00:58:44,357
I'm sorry?

698
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,492
Iljimae is behind it.

699
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:49,226
What?

700
00:58:52,717 --> 00:58:54,297
Yes,  yes, of course, Your Majesty.

701
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:57,752
That is exactly what I mean.

702
00:58:58,722 --> 00:59:00,858
Then we should capture him.

703
00:59:00,858 --> 00:59:04,740
Yong! What about my Bok? What happened to my son?

704
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,248
Did he say anything?

705
00:59:07,248 --> 00:59:09,756
Bok!

706
00:59:09,756 --> 00:59:13,328
My little baby!

707
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:19,051
He really shot him with an arrow?

708
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:22,747
Yes, he confessed he shot Chi Hong.

709
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,674
He confessed Iljimae told him to do so.

710
00:59:25,674 --> 00:59:29,033
That's why they are keeping him until Iljimae shows up.

711
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:32,644
If he doesn't show up, they will kill them all for being accomplices.

712
00:59:34,919 --> 00:59:36,054
Kill?

713
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:41,169
No! No! My Bok!

714
01:00:00,033 --> 01:00:03,233
On the case of attempt to murder to Jung Chi Hong,

715
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:05,531
I am very sorry that things turned that way.

716
01:00:06,845 --> 01:00:09,725
No matter the circumstances, murder attempts are not to be forgiven

717
01:00:09,725 --> 01:00:11,528
and this attempt will be dealt with severity.

718
01:00:12,506 --> 01:00:15,595
If Iljimae, who attempted the murder, doesn't turn himself in in four days,

719
01:00:16,188 --> 01:00:20,422
everyone kept in the envoy house will be severely punished as accomplices.

720
01:00:27,564 --> 01:00:30,373
Are we all going to die?

721
01:00:30,373 --> 01:00:34,120
Who the hell is the jerk who said that we were going to kill Jung Chi Hong?

722
01:00:38,187 --> 01:00:42,328
They were beating me up!

723
01:00:42,996 --> 01:00:45,049
They said that if I said that, they would let us go.

724
01:01:06,316 --> 01:01:07,707
You're not going to die, you brat.

725
01:01:07,707 --> 01:01:09,335
You're such a baby.

726
01:01:11,993 --> 01:01:15,404
You know the hunter?

727
01:01:15,404 --> 01:01:18,039
He got so thin because he's worried about his boy.

728
01:01:19,695 --> 01:01:23,538
Today is the fourth day.

729
01:01:27,514 --> 01:01:29,599
Don't use your left shoulder.

730
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:32,696
Be careful, especially tonight.

731
01:01:44,573 --> 01:01:45,872
Finally!

732
01:01:46,932 --> 01:01:49,626
Today is the fourth day.

733
01:01:50,053 --> 01:01:51,505
If that black bat doesn't show up

734
01:01:51,505 --> 01:01:55,448
today.

735
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:58,555
Each and every one of you,

736
01:02:00,728 --> 01:02:02,164
starting with you,

737
01:02:03,433 --> 01:02:05,341
will be dead.

738
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:15,900
That bat is definitely going to show up tonight

739
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,233
so keep your eyes wide open and be on your guards.

740
01:02:19,293 --> 01:02:20,697
If he doesn't show up

741
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,953
are they really all going to die?

742
01:02:22,953 --> 01:02:24,555
I don't know!

743
01:02:24,555 --> 01:02:26,998
I was told to kill them one by one.

744
01:02:26,998 --> 01:02:29,401
Who the hell does Jung Chi Hong think he is?

745
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:30,868
It's everyone in the village!

746
01:02:31,558 --> 01:02:33,020
Shut up.

747
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:35,104
That bat jerk will hear you.

748
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:56,111
Bang on the wall facing the pond?

749
01:04:01,155 --> 01:04:03,661
Bang on this wall?

750
01:04:05,129 --> 01:04:06,519
Is Iljimae outside?

751
01:04:08,338 --> 01:04:09,651
Here!

752
01:04:13,491 --> 01:04:16,153
Let's do what Iljimae tells us.

753
01:04:17,565 --> 01:04:18,804
Let's hit on it!

754
01:04:18,804 --> 01:04:19,963
Yes.

755
01:04:19,963 --> 01:04:21,226
Let's do what Iljimae says.

756
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:24,871
1,2,3.

757
01:04:36,704 --> 01:04:38,787
Over there! It's Iljimae!

758
01:04:43,116 --> 01:04:46,169
You're amazing!

759
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:48,831
Hey!

760
01:06:04,733 --> 01:06:06,991
There are men in here!

761
01:06:06,991 --> 01:06:09,711
There are people alive in here!

762
01:06:17,201 --> 01:06:36,702


763
01:06:36,702 --> 01:06:38,472
