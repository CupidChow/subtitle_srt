1
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,450


2
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:38,571
There's nothing on this earth that cannot be robbed.

3
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:41,774
Since I'm Iljimae.

4
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:49,446
Do you really see it?

5
00:00:49,446 --> 00:00:55,060
Yes. It's a bright red color, with a strong power.

6
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,075
We've supported the Myung Empire. Now look where our country has gone to.

7
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:00,183
You have to watch your words these days.

8
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:02,373
Sir, do you see?

9
00:01:02,373 --> 00:01:07,072
I have your child in me, and what am I doing?

10
00:01:11,428 --> 00:01:14,762
Geom, you have to stay here. Don't move.

11
00:01:14,762 --> 00:01:16,987
Don't even take a breath.

12
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,514
Lee Won Ho, traitor of this country, come take your orders!

13
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:41,352
This kid is Lee Won Ho's kid! He died without even letting me take revenge on him!

14
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,619
That woman is a traitor.

15
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,061
Geom, please throw the rock.

16
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:54,060
Little Yong, are you awake?

17
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,478
You don't remember?

18
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:58,602
Your name is Yong. Your father's name is Swe Dol.

19
00:01:58,602 --> 00:02:01,436
Your mother's name is Dan. We're one family.

20
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:03,399
Since the beginning.

21
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,663
I warned you not to get in my sight.

22
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,599
Two dogs.

23
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,173
They might just be brothers, don't you think?

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,273
1, 2!

25
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:20,073
Wait!

26
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:46,477
I'm sorry!

27
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,082
Who am I?

28
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:59,415
I don't remember my childhood. But I have some strange flashbacks.

29
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:04,467
I'm back.

30
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,343
What?

31
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,016
Oh, you want to find someone.

32
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:29,621
I hear your brother is looking for you!

33
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:38,901
Let me go!

34
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:42,254
Do you want to die?

35
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:43,884
My sister is there!

36
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:45,654
She's there!

37
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:49,973
If you go now, your sister is really going to die!

38
00:03:50,473 --> 00:03:51,890
Yong!

39
00:03:55,787 --> 00:04:00,149
Yong, from Hanyang, is looking for you.

40
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:04,670
Here you are, in front of me, but I can't call you.

41
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:15,595
Don't make a single mistake.

42
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:18,312
Engrave it here.

43
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:23,048
My sister died today.

44
00:04:23,438 --> 00:04:27,307
I can't live anymore

45
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:29,609
pretending I didn't see or didn't hear.

46
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,973
I need to know.

47
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:36,955
I need to know who killed you, father, and my sister.

48
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:39,146
I will make them

49
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,967
feel my pain.

50
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:45,853
It doesn't look like any ordinary sword. Just give up.

51
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:50,808
Unless you go looking for all the noblemen's house, you won't find it.

52
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:02,374
  Episode 11 

53
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:31,805
Make sure you carry this right, you stupid girl!

54
00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:35,547
You must have been startled, Miss. 
 It was nothing. Don't worry.

55
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:37,191
Let's go.

56
00:05:57,962 --> 00:06:00,400
I'm sorry if I scared you.

57
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,024
I thought they were making you get in there against your will.

58
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:06,409
You still have things to do, right?

59
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:24,226
Put it down.

60
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:27,682
We're here, Miss.

61
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:30,578
Miss! Is she sleeping?

62
00:06:33,706 --> 00:06:36,513
Miss! Miss!

63
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:45,054
What is this?

64
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:47,479
Miss! Where is she!

65
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:48,932
What's happening?

66
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,733
Miss, we're going to take you home.

67
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:12,910
I can go by myself, it's all right. Go home and put your kids to bed.

68
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,503
It's night. You sent away your carriage too. How can you go alone?

69
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:21,310
I take this route everyday. Go home.

70
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,068
All right then.

71
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:32,849
Miss!

72
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:05,926
Miss! Miss!

73
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:10,907
Eun Chae! 
 Miss!

74
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:14,641
Miss! 
 Eun Chae!

75
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:45,637
I hear you're very good at drawing flower blossoms.

76
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:51,187
You really are Iljimae.

77
00:09:51,187 --> 00:09:52,506
Right?

78
00:09:53,313 --> 00:09:56,701
You're not scared of me?

79
00:09:56,701 --> 00:10:01,520
I have heard the words. I hear you gave them all back to their rightful owners.

80
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,160
Actually, I was quite relieved.

81
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:13,996
I hear you stole the golden toad this time, under disguise.

82
00:10:13,996 --> 00:10:17,949
Then you were there to help them

83
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,368
and that's when you saw me.

84
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,884
They're quite poor people.

85
00:10:28,884 --> 00:10:33,762
Even the kids go to beg, and many of them are sick.

86
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:37,100
It's spring, but it's still so cold. I'm worried.

87
00:10:38,198 --> 00:10:43,031
Even if I take them to the house, they will still be cold.

88
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,170
I talk too much, don't I?

89
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:57,618
Shall we go now?

90
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:19,582
She came back, you say?

91
00:11:19,582 --> 00:11:20,589
Yes!

92
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:23,410
And then she left alone?

93
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,735
Yes. Is there a problem?

94
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:29,058
No, it's all right.

95
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:31,664
Where is the Miss?

96
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:46,626
She came back. Just a little while ago.

97
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,548
What happened Miss?

98
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:02,781
How can you smile? I thought I was going to faint!

99
00:12:02,781 --> 00:12:06,434
What about Mister Shi Hoo? He was white with fear.

100
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:16,555
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

101
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:17,991
What happened?

102
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:20,056
That is...

103
00:12:23,097 --> 00:12:26,517
The man that father sent forced me to get in the carriage

104
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:28,397
so I ran away.

105
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:29,653
What?

106
00:12:31,506 --> 00:12:35,435
You, by yourself, escaped through the top of the carriage,

107
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:38,150
and then put a rock instead?

108
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:45,557
All right. I'm glad you're fine.

109
00:12:46,895 --> 00:12:48,534
Get some rest.

110
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,296
I heard the rumors.

111
00:13:11,296 --> 00:13:13,850
I hear you returned them to their rightful owners?

112
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:17,897
Actually, I was quite relieved.

113
00:13:21,836 --> 00:13:25,900
I hear you stole the golden toad this time in disguise?

114
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,056
So you went there to help

115
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:53,806
Mother! Mom!

116
00:13:53,806 --> 00:13:56,139
Mom!

117
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:58,513
Oh my, what is all this?

118
00:13:58,513 --> 00:14:02,666
What is this?

119
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,983
Hey!

120
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:26,224
What's wrong?

121
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:29,761
You die with me today!

122
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:31,470
Why would I die?

123
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,164
You went to the poor people's town and made a mess? How dare you hit on a child?

124
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:38,845
I'm so ashamed I can't walk straight in the village!

125
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,976
Why do you live like this?

126
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:43,770
Until when are you going to live this way?

127
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,134
The way you live... if your father knew...

128
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:51,449
if your father knew...

129
00:14:52,631 --> 00:14:55,691
Dan! What's wrong again? Why?

130
00:14:55,691 --> 00:14:57,175
Leave me alone!

131
00:14:57,175 --> 00:14:59,931
No, don't do this!

132
00:15:00,805 --> 00:15:02,163
Ajumma!

133
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,879
I will never let this hand go.

134
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:16,795
Dont' do this, Dan, don't.

135
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:31,343
You're killing me, you stupid girl!

136
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:33,249
Go!

137
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:36,015
Because of you!

138
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:40,697
What are you doing at my place in early morning?

139
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:42,980
No, it's not that. Your mother...

140
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,518
My mother what? What did she do?

141
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:48,509
How can she beat you like that? Even though you...

142
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:50,971
I deserved it.

143
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,511
What are you doing at our place so early in the morning?

144
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,658
I just wanted to bring you some food.

145
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,004
You're so thin, and you don't look good.

146
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:10,249
Hold on... you stood by me the other day in front of the authorities.

147
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:13,159
And today you come here like this.

148
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,883
You...

149
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:17,576
What?

150
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:23,254
You... do you think I'll let you go because you do all this?

151
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:25,188
Don't get yourself any ideas and go to work!

152
00:16:25,188 --> 00:16:27,990
It's not long before you get your wages!

153
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:33,813
Go!

154
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:43,921
Why are you leaving all of a sudden? 
 Did the gang...

155
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,665
Oh no, not at all, Miss.

156
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:49,512
The thing is...

157
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,283
Iljimae stopped by at night.

158
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:55,179
What?

159
00:16:55,179 --> 00:17:00,170
He left food, and money!

160
00:17:00,222 --> 00:17:04,810
We're going to buy some land, build some houses with that money and live like decent people.

161
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,094
Of course, that's what you should do.

162
00:17:07,742 --> 00:17:09,276
What a great thing for you.

163
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:13,778
We will never forget what you did for us.

164
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:27,064
Wherever you go, please let me know.

165
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:32,441
Yes, Miss. Well then, goodbye. Take care.

166
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:34,107
Goodbye.

167
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:49,399
Well Miss, here we meet again.

168
00:17:50,046 --> 00:17:52,929
I guess it's our destiny.

169
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:57,015
Whistle

170
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:03,922
Wow, what a great environment it is here.

171
00:18:04,593 --> 00:18:08,024
We should get rid of that shanty town over there.

172
00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:10,484
Should I get rid of them all?

173
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:12,703
What are you doing at my construction site?

174
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,810
I heard.

175
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,338
I hear you're the actual owner of this house?

176
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,649
So lucky of you to have all that money.

177
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:26,261
I guess you have to be blessed with a good father. 
 Look what I have as a father.

178
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:28,036
How dare you!

179
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:35,989
I wish I could sleep somewhere like here. 
 I couldn't wish for more.

180
00:18:37,805 --> 00:18:43,409
It's so cold!

181
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:51,388
The doctor in our town said that people who are sick should stay in warm rooms.

182
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:54,544
Anyone sleeping here will get sick right away.

183
00:18:56,486 --> 00:19:00,302
I guess I'll go to the government office and lie there.

184
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:09,308
They have warm floors over there, you know.

185
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:27,633
I would like to have a floor heating system.

186
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:34,424
In the old books, they say that warm floors were used as places for the sick ones to get rest.

187
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:38,258
A floor heating system you say?

188
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:40,758
They only have those in palaces or government offices.

189
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:44,049
There's no law that says that, is there?

190
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:48,133
Well, that is a good point.

191
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:51,799
A floor heating system at an inn?

192
00:19:51,799 --> 00:20:01,633
But there are so many rooms. How are you going to handle all the wood for all those rooms?

193
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:07,674
There are many trees surrounding the area, and there are fires every year because of those trees.

194
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:13,174
I hear even the king is worried about those fires. 
 That's true.

195
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:16,174
So, if we could install the heating system not only in our inn

196
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:20,158
What about installing the heating system in each household around the five regions?

197
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:27,632
Then we wouldn't have to worry about the wood for the fire, and also about the forest fires.

198
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:29,674
A floor heating system, you say?

199
00:20:29,674 --> 00:20:31,715
Yes, Your Majesty.

200
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:38,576
With the heating system, the people won't be cold anymore and will revere you.

201
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:42,696
It would be hitting three birds with one stone.

202
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:45,075
People revering me?

203
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,037
What do the others think about this?

204
00:20:50,037 --> 00:20:57,279
Yes, Your Majesty. This is a brilliant idea.

205
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:59,767
Indeed, sir.

206
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:02,104
All right then, be it so.

207
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:03,829
Good work, Byung pan.

208
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,809
Not at all, sir. The honor is all mine.

209
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:13,168
The only thing I think about

210
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:19,006
is the well being of our people and my loyalty towards you.

211
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:25,694
That is the only way I had this idea come to my mind.

212
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:26,820
Your Majesty.

213
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:36,305
Let's work quickly! You're going to spend all day at this pace!

214
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:40,275
Be careful with that! Come on!

215
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:42,403
You're going to ruin this place.

216
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:45,341
Who the hell is he?

217
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:48,293
No talking during work!

218
00:21:48,293 --> 00:21:50,544
What are you doing?

219
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:53,665
Oh, here you are, Miss.

220
00:21:55,257 --> 00:21:56,614
I hear you're having a floor heating system.

221
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:59,330
Thanks to you...

222
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,683
You had built this whole thing, and you are beginning all over again.

223
00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:06,048
When are you going to open the inn and make some money?

224
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:09,455
You should do things easily. Why make extra work for yourself?

225
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,146
And is that why you're lingering around here?

226
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:19,473
With that pretty face of yours, you can be so mean.

227
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:28,029
You may act this way now, but soon enough, you'll be totally under my charm.

228
00:22:31,297 --> 00:22:35,278
You should treat me kindly. It's our destiny, you know.

229
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:49,976


230
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:17,134
Are you hurt?

231
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:22,510
Come this way.

232
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:38,770
How did this happen?

233
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:55,396
I was at lord Yepan, but I didn't know guards would be there.

234
00:23:55,396 --> 00:23:57,688
Lord Yepan?

235
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:01,911
They have many trained guards over there.

236
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:04,288
I hear some of them have special trainings.

237
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:06,525
Especially these days...

238
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:12,171
All the noblemen are quite on their edge because of Iljimae.

239
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:13,806
How do you know all this?

240
00:24:13,806 --> 00:24:16,465
My father is the head of the guards.

241
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:25,506
How many guards do they have?

242
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,413
Hold on.

243
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:54,273
For Lord Yepan, the number of guards is...

244
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:57,038
Miss, I have brought your tea.

245
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:02,160
Is she sleeping?

246
00:25:50,701 --> 00:25:55,502
Father, just wait a little.

247
00:25:56,624 --> 00:26:01,746
The one who killed you, the man who killed my sister.

248
00:26:03,235 --> 00:26:06,888
I will bring him here and make him kneel in front of you.

249
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:21,541
The pain I feel now, I will make him feel the same.

250
00:26:34,628 --> 00:26:36,526
Iljimae.

251
00:26:37,744 --> 00:26:40,448
Let him come.

252
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:27,283
No sign of forced entry, and the room was full of steel needles.

253
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:34,464
How on earth did he steal the vase?

254
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,728
I do wonder... what a strang thing.

255
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:54,110
What water is this?

256
00:27:57,758 --> 00:28:00,016
It's salty.

257
00:28:00,016 --> 00:28:02,115
Is it salt water?

258
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:10,204
Why is the sword on the floor?

259
00:28:29,243 --> 00:28:32,282
Sir! We just have to put it in! Come!

260
00:28:32,282 --> 00:28:34,821
Yes, I'm coming.

261
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:38,261
Argh! Oh my god! Help!

262
00:28:38,261 --> 00:28:40,690
What is this?

263
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,923
Yong!

264
00:28:44,314 --> 00:28:46,210
Sir!

265
00:28:53,305 --> 00:28:55,931
How strong is this?

266
00:28:59,478 --> 00:29:02,532
Die, you filthy thing!

267
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:05,097
We just wanted an octopus

268
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:07,138
and we nearly became his prey!

269
00:29:07,138 --> 00:29:11,413
I know! How strong is this thing?

270
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:15,642
It sucks on whales, sharks, and even you!

271
00:29:15,642 --> 00:29:20,033
And even the vase!

272
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:21,450
The vase?

273
00:29:24,247 --> 00:29:31,680


274
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:35,367
An octopus?

275
00:29:41,176 --> 00:29:43,349
You're so cool!

276
00:29:56,195 --> 00:30:01,105
He went through the roof and apparently took the vase with an octopus.

277
00:30:01,105 --> 00:30:03,195
How did he think of that?

278
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,923
He's amazing.

279
00:31:58,546 --> 00:31:59,157
Koo In Hoo

280
00:32:02,343 --> 00:32:03,772
Koo In Hoo.

281
00:32:05,144 --> 00:32:10,153
Even if Iljimae's father were to be here

282
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:14,596
he will never be able to unlock the lock I made you

283
00:32:14,596 --> 00:32:15,762
so don't worry.

284
00:32:15,762 --> 00:32:17,336
All right.

285
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:18,237
Take care.

286
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:21,311
Yes yes. Bye.

287
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:25,740
So cheap.

288
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,998
Why call me at this hour?

289
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:37,628
It's Iljimae!

290
00:32:49,914 --> 00:32:53,072
Damn it!

291
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:54,815
Damn it!

292
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:04,652
Where did he go?

293
00:33:04,652 --> 00:33:06,742
I saw him with my own eyes!

294
00:33:06,742 --> 00:33:08,999
You know the Lord Kim's house?

295
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:12,214
I was coming out of his house after giving him the lock

296
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:18,427
and right then, I heard this sound cutting across the wind. So I looked up.

297
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:21,745
And Iljimae was there, cutting through the moon with his sword.

298
00:33:21,745 --> 00:33:25,296
Just like you would cut through a watermelon. 
 A watermelon?

299
00:33:26,994 --> 00:33:30,728
And he rolled over two or three times in the air

300
00:33:32,453 --> 00:33:34,343
and then disappeared like the lightning!

301
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:36,781
Just like that.

302
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,526
That's not a man, that's a ghost.

303
00:33:42,526 --> 00:33:48,220
How can a man disappear? And that jump?

304
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,782
Back in the days, I could jump over five times!

305
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:55,028
Sure, sure if you say so.

306
00:33:55,028 --> 00:33:57,888
Yeah, I guess you rolled over in your head five times at least.

307
00:34:01,504 --> 00:34:05,549
Father! Dan tells you to come home for lunch.

308
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:07,958
All right.

309
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:11,084
What's wrong with your leg? Did you fight again?

310
00:34:11,084 --> 00:34:12,538
Fight? No way!

311
00:34:12,538 --> 00:34:15,485
Wait! Come here!

312
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,848
Eun Chae, what is wrong with you?

313
00:34:20,848 --> 00:34:26,027
Look at her!

314
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:33,386
So you really have to give all these goods and treasures to those people?

315
00:34:33,386 --> 00:34:35,936
Is there any good that's worth more than someone's life?

316
00:34:35,936 --> 00:34:41,572
Over 1400 people lost their lives in Pyungando because of the disease.

317
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:44,481
Mother, please give me some of yours too.

318
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:47,983
What? Some of my jewelry?

319
00:34:47,983 --> 00:34:50,658
Do you know how much this is ?

320
00:34:50,658 --> 00:34:54,619
Eun Chae, I understand your tender heart,

321
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:59,489
but this is not something you should meddle in. The government will take care of it all.

322
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:03,313
The government is turning a blind eye because they say they don't have the budget.

323
00:35:03,313 --> 00:35:04,663
So what to do?

324
00:35:04,663 --> 00:35:06,992
The nobles should do something.

325
00:35:06,992 --> 00:35:10,061
You should take a stand in this situation.

326
00:35:10,061 --> 00:35:14,339
You open just one storage room and you'll be able to save hundreds of lives.

327
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:20,699
You.. I spoiled you too much so far! Now you want to take away my stored goods?

328
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:22,373
You...!

329
00:35:22,373 --> 00:35:27,516
Eun Chae, please stop this.

330
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:32,580
If this is how it's going to be, I will go by myself and take care of the sick ones.

331
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,286
Do you know what kind of place that is? Do you want to die?

332
00:35:36,286 --> 00:35:38,263
Then help me!

333
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:44,384
So, the Miss is going to the construction site today too?

334
00:35:44,384 --> 00:35:47,544
Oh, Eun Chae?

335
00:35:47,544 --> 00:35:50,775
There she is. Eun Chae!

336
00:35:57,935 --> 00:36:00,951
Hey! What is wrong with her?

337
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:04,808
Don't even talk about it. She wants to go to Pyungando.

338
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:06,902
Pyungando?.

339
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:20,063
Miss! You're going to die if you go there!

340
00:36:20,063 --> 00:36:21,210
They say the fever kills them all!

341
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,143
Miss! Please!

342
00:36:24,143 --> 00:36:26,442
Miss!

343
00:36:26,442 --> 00:36:30,265
Miss, do you really have to go there?

344
00:36:30,265 --> 00:36:31,666
Don't you worry, I tell you.

345
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:33,450
Miss, no! Please.

346
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,001
Miss!

347
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:37,945
Miss, please! Miss!

348
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:53,880
Miss, you're going to die if you go there.

349
00:36:55,504 --> 00:37:08,057


350
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,809
I'm here to collect the bodies.

351
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:38,388
The bodies smell awful. Take this.

352
00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:43,929
My child is dying! Please  let me go and find some medicine.

353
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:47,494
No! You can't leave this place!

354
00:37:47,494 --> 00:37:53,300
We have no medicine, no food! Do you want us to die here?

355
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,188
There's no use talking to me.

356
00:37:55,188 --> 00:37:58,310
We have orders! What can we do?

357
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,012
Go! Leave!

358
00:38:02,795 --> 00:38:06,657
How can you do this to us?

359
00:38:06,657 --> 00:38:10,288
You just ignore your people who are dying.

360
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:14,610
We can't even leave this village.

361
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:21,199
You useless people!

362
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:28,778
Mom!

363
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,596
Mom, please wake up!

364
00:38:33,596 --> 00:38:36,718
Mom!

365
00:39:07,656 --> 00:39:09,712
Your Majesty,

366
00:39:09,712 --> 00:39:16,126
Iljimae the thief went to Pyungando

367
00:39:16,126 --> 00:39:20,312
where the epidemic is running wild and gave them medicine, food and clothing.

368
00:39:20,312 --> 00:39:25,977
Your Majesty, the whole country is talking about how righteous Iljimae is.

369
00:39:25,977 --> 00:39:33,639
Righteous? Righteous Iljimae?

370
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:42,495
Sir, by righteous they mean someone who steals our riches and distributes them to the poor.

371
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:46,792
Then does it mean that we are all bad and corrupted officials?

372
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:50,836
Sir, this is unfair to us.

373
00:39:50,836 --> 00:39:53,633
Don't feel that way.

374
00:39:53,633 --> 00:39:56,486
It's all because I couldn't get the acceptance of my people.

375
00:39:56,486 --> 00:40:01,631
Sir, that is nonsense!

376
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:07,147
We have to capture that foul thief and give him a severe punishment!

377
00:40:07,147 --> 00:40:09,472
Indeed, your Majesty.

378
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:13,662
All right. Spread the announcement across the country

379
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:17,202
and to anyone who catches the thief will be given 10,000 coins.

380
00:40:18,305 --> 00:40:23,130
The low-class people will have their social status improved?

381
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:27,088
Wow, so I can be part of the nobility too?

382
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:35,510
It's a good opportunity.

383
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,904
Make sure to catch him.

384
00:40:48,535 --> 00:40:54,731
Geez, good job. You're not doing business and you go frolicking around.

385
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:56,678
Yong!

386
00:40:56,678 --> 00:40:59,760
Good thing you're here. Where else besides here do they sell silk ribbons?

387
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,264
Silk ribbon? Is it for me? Over there, across the bridge.

388
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:07,804
Good. Thanks.

389
00:41:07,804 --> 00:41:09,225
What?

390
00:41:09,225 --> 00:41:11,874
How can I trust your taste? I'll have to choose one of my own.

391
00:41:11,874 --> 00:41:15,344
What? Leave! Leave!

392
00:41:15,344 --> 00:41:17,760
Go and earn your pay.

393
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,565
I'll feed him this eel

394
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,994
You eat some too.

395
00:41:31,994 --> 00:41:34,908
No, it's fine.

396
00:41:34,908 --> 00:41:37,195
Nobody's watching us. Just have one spoonful.

397
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:40,102
Well...

398
00:41:49,471 --> 00:41:52,233
Come again!

399
00:41:58,755 --> 00:42:02,139
Hey! The boss is back!

400
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:07,528
Here you go!

401
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:27,233
Is there something wrong?

402
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:32,281
Do you want some?

403
00:42:37,017 --> 00:42:39,563
Did you really mean it?

404
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:50,880
What a taste in men you have. He's weak, doesn't have all his teeth.

405
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,191
He has a good heart.

406
00:42:56,191 --> 00:42:59,995
He's wise, and is kind.

407
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:05,090
I'm also wise, and I'm also kind.

408
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:12,942
Sure. When those officials came and were making a mess

409
00:43:12,942 --> 00:43:15,035
you helped us. Thank you.

410
00:43:15,035 --> 00:43:22,195
Don't mention it. For a man, it's the strength that counts!

411
00:43:22,195 --> 00:43:26,844
Still, Swe Dol may be little,

412
00:43:26,844 --> 00:43:31,672
but he has some muscles here and there.

413
00:43:31,672 --> 00:43:37,613
Don't talk about muscles in front of me!

414
00:43:37,613 --> 00:43:41,635
Wow!

415
00:43:41,635 --> 00:43:46,737
Geez, you look really strong.

416
00:43:46,737 --> 00:43:49,505
Duki,

417
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:53,008
we're both bored and lonely. Shall we kiss?

418
00:44:35,927 --> 00:44:39,093
What are you doing? Pretending to be weak? Go!

419
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,812
Come with me.

420
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:42,706
What is wrong with you?

421
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:51,069
Here.

422
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:57,788
Don't be scared. I'm here. I'll protect you.

423
00:44:57,788 --> 00:45:00,587
I'll never let your hand go.

424
00:45:14,017 --> 00:45:17,481
Why are you so heavey? What did you eat this morning?

425
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,671
You pretend to be strong and all.

426
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:30,168
How does it look?

427
00:45:30,168 --> 00:45:35,841
Geez, nothing suits you, does it?

428
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,301
That one's pretty.

429
00:45:41,301 --> 00:45:44,779
Ma'am, give that one.

430
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:46,881
How much is it?

431
00:45:55,316 --> 00:45:58,864
Are you going to give it to me later? Just give it now!

432
00:45:58,864 --> 00:46:03,777
Did you go crazy on that bridge or what?

433
00:46:03,777 --> 00:46:07,288
Give me my ribbon!

434
00:46:07,288 --> 00:46:08,882
Give me!

435
00:46:08,882 --> 00:46:13,472
Ajussi! Where did he go instead of chopping wood?

436
00:46:13,472 --> 00:46:16,126
Ajussi!

437
00:46:16,126 --> 00:46:19,716
Ajussi!

438
00:46:19,716 --> 00:46:22,689
Oh my.

439
00:46:22,689 --> 00:46:25,425
No, it's not that.

440
00:46:25,425 --> 00:46:27,823
What? What isn't?

441
00:46:27,823 --> 00:46:30,349
There's nobody there.

442
00:46:33,279 --> 00:46:38,593
Why is this here? I sent him on an errand.

443
00:46:38,593 --> 00:46:43,620
Well, he did stay quiet for some time.

444
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,918
Get out of there!

445
00:46:45,918 --> 00:46:52,895
This is the lock that even Iljimae couldn't unlock! 
 I heard so. Give me one.

446
00:46:52,895 --> 00:46:54,598
Take care.

447
00:46:54,598 --> 00:46:58,602
Swe Dol!

448
00:46:58,602 --> 00:47:01,525
Be careful! What? Are you ok?

449
00:47:01,525 --> 00:47:02,985
I fell down.

450
00:47:02,985 --> 00:47:05,967
I know you fell.

451
00:47:05,967 --> 00:47:08,877
Lose some weight. You can't even handle your own body.

452
00:47:08,877 --> 00:47:14,158
No, not me, Shim Duk fell down.

453
00:47:14,158 --> 00:47:16,252
What? Shim Duk? Did she get hurt?

454
00:47:16,252 --> 00:47:20,720
No, not like that. She fell down... on Kong He.

455
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,145
What? Shim Duk? Kong He?

456
00:47:26,703 --> 00:47:30,028
Well, good for them.

457
00:47:30,028 --> 00:47:32,991
Are you upset? You're upset, right?

458
00:47:32,991 --> 00:47:36,717
Upset? No way! My eyes are only for Dan.

459
00:47:36,717 --> 00:47:40,130
Dani? Oh come on, you're upset!

460
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:45,738
Go and learn some tricks from Kong He! Make your woman fall down on you!

461
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,760
You rotten thing!

462
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,298
How dare you call Dan like that? Is she yours?

463
00:47:51,298 --> 00:47:52,849
I'm going to knock you down with this.

464
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:54,303
You're upset, and you're taking it on me.

465
00:47:54,303 --> 00:47:56,135
Upset? I'm not upset at all!

466
00:47:56,135 --> 00:47:56,850
Oh, come on, you so are!

467
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:59,054
How dare you!

468
00:48:54,618 --> 00:48:57,045
Who's there?

469
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:03,053
Wait.

470
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:09,362
Please don't go.

471
00:49:21,439 --> 00:49:26,276
I hear you take swings at the moon and fly around.

472
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:31,996
Not at all.

473
00:49:31,996 --> 00:49:36,142
Well then, why do people say you fly around?

474
00:49:36,142 --> 00:49:40,493
And you jump in the air too? Two? Three times?

475
00:49:45,052 --> 00:49:48,528
Would you like to see it on your own?

476
00:49:57,031 --> 00:49:58,774
Brother!

477
00:49:59,186 --> 00:50:01,528
Brother!

478
00:50:12,715 --> 00:50:15,572
Don't move or I'll kill you.

479
00:51:18,204 --> 00:51:20,543
Brother!

480
00:51:34,142 --> 00:51:37,023
Where are you going?

481
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:53,956
Why isn't he here yet? This tastes better when it's still tender.

482
00:53:00,084 --> 00:53:02,025
Yong!

483
00:53:10,861 --> 00:53:13,512
What's wrong?

484
00:53:18,286 --> 00:53:20,136
Yong!

485
00:53:20,385 --> 00:53:25,366
Let me go. He's hurt.

486
00:53:25,366 --> 00:53:27,144
What about me?

487
00:53:28,954 --> 00:53:31,650
What am I to you?

488
00:53:32,105 --> 00:53:35,058
You don't see me anymore, do you?

489
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,618
Wake up! I need to pay you back, remember?

490
00:53:49,618 --> 00:53:52,989
Wake up!

491
00:53:55,134 --> 00:54:01,156
Please don't die! Don't die!

492
00:54:01,156 --> 00:54:05,372
Don't die!

493
00:54:07,072 --> 00:54:10,658
Why is everyone dying?

494
00:54:11,473 --> 00:54:14,730
Why is everyone dying?

495
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,283
Mom...

496
00:54:18,801 --> 00:54:21,401
Father...

497
00:54:22,308 --> 00:54:25,931
Brother.

498
00:54:31,819 --> 00:54:37,527
Why is everyone dying?

499
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,846
Brother.

500
00:54:54,846 --> 00:54:58,367
Brother, are you all right?

501
00:54:58,367 --> 00:55:01,408
I'm coming in.

502
00:55:31,089 --> 00:55:34,931
This is amazing!

503
00:55:35,968 --> 00:55:37,787
Father!

504
00:55:39,762 --> 00:55:44,240
I just wanted a sip, that's all.

505
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,910
But this thing keeps pouring me alcohol on its own.

506
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:50,303
You damn thing!

507
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:55,553
Father.

508
00:55:57,651 --> 00:55:59,837
Father.

509
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:03,806
Miss, where are you going so late in the night?

510
00:56:03,806 --> 00:56:06,610
I'm telling you, I have somewhere to go.

511
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,719
Miss.

512
00:57:00,271 --> 00:57:02,481
Is he alive?

513
00:57:02,888 --> 00:57:07,541
He's going to suffer during the night. Go get some water.

514
00:57:07,997 --> 00:57:10,115
Yes.

515
00:57:17,027 --> 00:57:22,418
You pathetic thing. Who did you fight with?

516
00:58:00,255 --> 00:58:14,409


517
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:16,323
