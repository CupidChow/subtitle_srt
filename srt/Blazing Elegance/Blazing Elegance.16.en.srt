Grand Marshal,

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,240
we noticed someone's been

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,320
gathering evidence of Duan Chuanxian's corruption.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,360
It sounds like someone's going after the Duan family.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,680
It looks that way.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,560
Can you find out who it is?

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,120
It seems to be the Huo family from Gangcheng.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,640
The Huo family?

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,700
No wonder I heard

10

Eldest Miss Huo is in Hangcheng.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,200
It looks like she's planning to make a move here.

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,880
Regardless of her intentions,

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,440
the Duan family's enemy is our friend.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,360
What's wrong?

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,830
That deal we invested in—

20
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,470
the two cargo ships are stuck at sea

21

and can't dock.

22
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,440
Why?

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,000
The port is making trouble,

24
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,620
saying they need to report it for inspection.

25
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,770
The problem is, our shipment has opium mixed in.

26
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,750
If they find it,

27
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,420
we won't just lose money

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,560
but we'll also end up in jail.

29
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,680
The dock belongs to the Huo family.

our business has been getting harder and harder.

33

What should we do then?

34
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,340
I heard they

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,200

I'll go see her myself.

40
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,110

We're from the Duan family.

We have something important to talk to her.

Please let her know.

Go.

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,270
Eldest Miss Huo is really putting on airs.

52
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:01,210
We spent 100,000 just to be here,

I'm Duan Jinyao, the fourth daughter of the Duan family,

Yes.

Second Miss Huo,

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,360

You look kind of familiar.

Mr. Duan, are you trying to use the same tricks on me

00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,360

68
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,840

Chief Duan was corrupt

during his tenure.

may I have a word with you?

Could you make an exception

and let us know who we can turn to for help?

Miss Duan, I advise you not to waste effort.

This case

111
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,880
is personally being handled by the Huo family of Gangcheng.

Yi Qiuting, huh?

117
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,470
So, this case

118
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,760
being pressured by Yi Qiuting,

119
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,200
it's probably too late to turn things around.

120

123
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,360
you wouldn't need to fear someone reporting him.

124
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,240

The Duan family case is progressing so smoothly

130

because Yi Qiuting is pushing things along.

131
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,000
Why didn't he act sooner?

132
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,280
Duan Jinyao has kept a low profile for years,

133
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,800
and Yi Qiuting didn't know that

134
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,640
it was Duan Jinyao who tried to assassinate you back then,

135
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,800
so he never went after her.

136
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,040

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,440
Mr. Duan,

191
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,320
you're the head of the Duan family now,

192
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,240
and you can't even afford to lose this little bit?

193
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,400
Exactly.

194
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,040
That's right.

195
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,680
If you can't afford to play, just go home.

196
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,560
What do you mean?

197
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,440
Isn't that so?

198
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,120
Your pocket money

199
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,640
is less than that of some illegitimate child.

200
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,470
He has money.

201
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,430
Come on, let's continue.

202
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,980
See? That's right.

203
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,760
Keep playing.

204
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,980
Keep playing.

205
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:34,810
Keep your eyes on it.

206
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,480
Let's continue. Keep betting.

207
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,840
Place your bets, come on!

208
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,640
I'll bet three threes.

209
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,300
Good bet.

210
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,250
I want a triple this time.

211
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,350
Hurry up and open it!

212
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,240
Eldest Miss Huo,

213
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,080
he has already been left for you.

214
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,580
How big you want him to play

215
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,380
is up to you now.

216
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,680
Keep betting.

217
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,470
Come on, come on!

218
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,880
I'm still betting on small.

219
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,130
Bet on big.

220
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,950
As expected of Eldest Miss Huo.

221
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,720
You're so generous.

222
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,680
Pleasure doing business.

223
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,200
Miss Duan.

224
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,040
Guanglei.

225
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,680
What's wrong with Guanglei?

226
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,770
Your brother lost money at my casino.

227
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,780
This is the IOU.

228
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,400
Please pay it back immediately.

229
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,960
Also, this house has been mortgaged to me.

230
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,600
If the Duan family can't pay the money,

231
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,600
please move out immediately.

232
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,640
Sell all the unmarried daughters of the Duan family

233
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,710
to the brothels.

234
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,520
Okay.

235
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,440
Come here, let's go.

236
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,820
Please be more accommodating.

237
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,720
Go on!

238
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,640
-Let go of me!
-Let's go!

239
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,440
What do you think?

240
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,200
Not interested.

241
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,280
Guanglei!

242
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,220
Hurry up, go!

243
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,080
Quick!

244
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,520
Guanglei!

245
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,090
Let's go.

246
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,440
Guanglei!

247
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,320
-Let's go!
-Guanglei!

248
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,880
Guanglei!

249
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,120
Stop dawdling, go!

250
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,560
Duan Guanglei is dead,

251
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,200
and the family assets were seized by the casino.

252
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,240
Go!

253
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,770
The Duan family was crushed with overwhelming force.

254
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,640
Go!

255
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,360
Go.

256
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,240
Some say

257
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,030
Eldest Miss Huo went after them

258
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,620
because the Duan family once collaborated

259
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,060
with Second Master Huo.

260
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,570
A lot of people have collaborated with Second Master Huo,

261
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,000
so why did the Duan family end up so miserable?

262
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,350
I think

263
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,590
this has a bit of a personal vendetta behind it.

264
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,060
The Huo family heading north

265
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,760
will eventually affect us.

266
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,760
Wu,

267
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,880
gather as much information as possible,

268
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,280
especially about Eldest Miss Huo's movements.

269
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.

270
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,880
The Huo family's internal strife over the years

271
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,440
has drained a lot of resources.

272
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,160
That mysterious Eldest Miss Huo

273
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,760
has always been very low-key.

274
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,760
In just five short years,

275
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,840
she managed to bring down Second Master Huo.

276
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,000
She's quite something.

277
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,520
Ten silver dollars?

278
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,760
That's way too expensive!

279
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,000
That's all she's worth.

280
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,960
It seems like, aside from their noble background,

281
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,400
they're not much different from ordinary women.

282
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,960
Zhao... Zhao Xingrou?

283
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,760
You.. Are you human or a ghost?

284
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,880
How does it feel

285
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,240
to be framed?

286
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,080
You did all of this?

287
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,320
You made the Duan family's downfall?

288
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,960
Your father was indeed corrupt,

289
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,880
and your brother's bad behavior and vices

290
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,600
were his own fault.

291
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,520
As for why the Duan family

292
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,760
ended up like this,

293
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,720
wasn't it all because of your foresight in the first place?

294
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,240
My two younger sisters

295
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,840
have never wronged you

296
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,400
nor done anything wrong,

297
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,960
yet you want to force them into prostitution.

298
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,840
What kind of person are you?

299
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,520
That's why I've brought the ransom today.

300
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,400
I'll take these two.

301
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,320
How kind of you.

302
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,320
Fifty silver dollars each.

303
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,840
Here's a hundred.

304
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,040
Let's go.

305
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,450
Duan Jinyao!

306
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,080
Go!

307
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,840
What about this one?

308
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,080
I'll give you a discount. Do you want her?

309
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,040
I beg you.

310
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,600
Please redeem me too.

311
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,760
I was wrong.

312
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,580
I'm begging you.
