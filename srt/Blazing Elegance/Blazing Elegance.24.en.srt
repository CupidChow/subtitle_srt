188
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,680
We vow to fight to the death until victory.

189
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,880
Better to die in battle

190
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,080
than to live as a slave to a fallen nation.

191
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,840
Better to die in battle

192
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,240
than to live as a slave to a fallen nation.

193
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,680
Better to die in battle

194
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,280
than to live as a slave to a fallen nation.

195
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,400
Take care, Miss Huo.

196
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,720
The journey ahead is long,

197
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,240
but we shall meet again someday.

198
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,720
Take care, Mr. Wu.

199
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,600
Marshal Yi,

200
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,440
forgive me for not seeing you off.

201
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,360
I wish you a victorious return.

202
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:20,960
Good.

203
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,520
Let's drink together when I return.

204
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,320
Take care.

205
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:25,600
Okay.

206
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,120
Your life is not mine to control.

207
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,440
You can do anything you want

208
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,120
and go anywhere you wish.

209
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,320
But, Grand Marshal,

210
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,200
you're about to go fight the Japanese.

211
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,560
I'm worried about your safety.

212
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,440
I have other adjutants

213
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,240
besides you,

214
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,840
but some people

215
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,400
only have one.

216
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,320
Go.

217
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,080
I'll go with you.

218
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,000
You can't.

219
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:05,880
Why?

220
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,320
If you don't want to follow Yi Qiuting,

221
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,640
you can go wherever you want.

222
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,200
But you can't come with me.

223
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,280
I have my own things to do.

224
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,640
What's so important that you can't do it with me?

225
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,360
Whatever you do,

226
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,000
I can be by your side.

227
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,680
I'll never hold you back.

228
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,960
This time is different.

229
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,280
I care nothing for my life or reputation;

230
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,120
I only want to settle the affairs of the world.

231
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,000
You're insane.

232
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,520
I've always lived

233
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,000
with my life on the line.

234
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,360
What's different this time?

235
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,200
Those Japanese are not human.

236
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,120
Stop throwing childish tantrums.

237
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,240
Fine.

238
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,800
Then I'll follow the Grand Marshal to the front lines.

239
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,960
When all the Japanese are killed,

240
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,240
that's when you'll be safe.

241
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,680
That's my good boy.

242
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,200
Xingrou,

243
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,560
Mr. Wu has left.

244
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,880
I know.

245
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,840
Why didn't you keep him here?

246
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,000
Mr. Wu comes and goes freely.

247
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,320
I have no right to interfere.

248
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,040
He didn't even say a word of farewell.

249
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,360
What's wrong with Wu?

250
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,040
It's all Wu Chongmo's fault.

251
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,920
So you're Peng Wu?

252
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,400
What's going on with those two?

253
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,960
Just a girl's little thoughts.

254
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,000
Young Marshal,

255
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,600
I'll head back to the government office first.

256
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,360
Go ahead.

257
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,640
Xingrou,

258
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,240
why don't you take Nian back to Gangcheng first?

259
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,320
No,

260
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,200
I still have a lot to do.

261
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,360
I need to manage the military supply factory,

262
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,560
raise funds and supplies,

263
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,200
and take care of the military families.

264
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,760
Once I've settled everything at the rear,

265
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,480
you'll be able to focus on the battlefront with peace of mind.

266
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,240
But Wu Chongmo has left.

267
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,840
I'm worried about your safety.

268
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,330
Don't worry,

269
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,760
I'll take good care of myself.

270
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,440
I'll make sure everything at the rear is arranged,

271
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,560
and I'll wait for the day of victory,

272
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,440
for the day when our Nian

273
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,160
grows up.

274
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,920
Okay.

275
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,720
Let's work hard together.

276
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,200
Together.

277
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:48,770
[Government Office of Jiangsu and Zhejiang]

278
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,000
Brothers of the 62nd Division from Jiangsu and Zhejiang,

279
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,300
do you have confidence?

280
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,610
Yes!

281
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,960
Let's meet at the Loyal Martyrs' Shrine.

282
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,250
Go!

283
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,190
