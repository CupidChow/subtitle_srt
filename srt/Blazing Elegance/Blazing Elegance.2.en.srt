00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
all true?

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,720
Uncle, how dare I lie about this?

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,130
I put in a lot of effort

00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,750
just to find that Small Mansion.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,620
Qiuting has been hiding it quite well.

If I hadn't bribed Peng Wu's subordinate,

9
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,640
we'd still be in the dark.

This little brat

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,160
even dares to deceive you and me now.

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,390
It must be that little vixen clinging to Qiuting.

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,780
Don't worry. I'll deal with her.

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:37,980

Jinyao? Come in quickly.

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,930
Thank you, Mr. Yi.

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,510
Your mother is too kind.

feel free to speak.

How about...

28
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,820
we move up my engagement ceremony with Qiuting?

29
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,789
I believe after the engagement,

30
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,530
he will surely settle down and be responsible.

31
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,030
This way, both our parents will feel at ease.

00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,930
As expected of a daughter from a noble family.

33
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,710
How could an ordinary woman

compare to your breadth of mind and vision?

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,820
Alright.

36
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,430
I'll give Chief Duan a call right now

37
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,820

just agree to the Grand Marshal for now and hold the engagement ceremony?

Ever since you got together with Miss Zhao,

50
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,350
you've been trying all kinds of ways to become stronger

51

But the military power

For the past month,

76
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,960
Cao Town has cut off all communication with the outside world.

77
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,950

78
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,240

81
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,070

Stop, Qiuting.

99

100
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,660

What are you thinking?

102

Do you think that as long as you

103
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,890
ran off to some remote, desolate place,

104
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,680

send his lover out of the city.

109
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,440
It's probably because he was worried

110
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,560
she would make a scene

111
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,600
at the engagement ceremony.

112
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,710

00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,560
Why?

114
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,290
Isn't it better for you now that she's gone?

115
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,960
Do you think Yi Qiuting did this for my sake?

116
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,659
He was just afraid of making her angry. He's hiding it from her.

117
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,910
I just want her to know

118
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,770
that she has nothing to compare with me.

119
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,620

I'm going to a school in the town for volunteer teaching.

Don't you have any complaints?

124
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,560
It's the school's assignment. What complaints could I have?

125
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,980

At that time, I found he had an extraordinary presence.

Please make sure to guide him well.

Qiuting is a bit hot-headed in his youth.

185
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,280
It's none of your business.

186
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,790
Yi Qiuting!

187
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,800
Xingrou isn't at the Zhao residence or the school.

188
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,180
Tell me where she is!

189
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,060
Mr. Wu.

190
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,810
How is it going?

191
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,290
The pregnant woman asked me to return to the city to find a doctor for her.

192
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,790
You know medicine. How about you stay here for now?

193
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,760
Alright. Just go with peace of mind.

194
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,530
Okay.

195
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,090
-Stop.
-Miss Zhao.

196
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,230
Please set off immediately

197
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,560
and continue on to Cao Town.

198
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,520
Who are you guys?

199
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,680
What do you want?

200
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,600
The carriage to Cao Town has already been arranged.

201
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,780
Please set off.

202
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,780
Move aside.

203
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,840
Miss Zhao, please don't make things difficult for us.

204
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,140
She said move aside. Didn't you hear?

205
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,600
I advise you not to meddle in affairs that don't concern you.

206
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,970
Our Young Marshal is putting on a grand spectacle.

207
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,750
Indeed.

208
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,210
I heard the bride is the daughter of Chief Duan.

209
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,450
It's a powerful alliance.

210
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,120
Engagement?

211
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,550
Flowers!

212
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,850
Excuse me. Where is the Young Marshal getting engaged?

213
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,070
Right over there.

214
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,190
[Engagement ceremony between the Yi family and the Duan family]

215
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,380
Plum blossoms assist the bride in adorning her beauty,

216
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,980
the mirror reflects the moonlit night, shining upon hearts united.

217
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,030
Today, the Yi family and the Duan family are making a marriage arrangement,

218
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,890
binding their fates for eternity.

219
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,470
Two families are forming a marriage pact.

220
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,370
Witness this day, as peach blossoms bloom in radiant splendor—

221
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,880
an omen of a harmonious household.

222
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,220
May the coming years bring prosperity

223
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,840
and the flourishing of the family.

224
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,110
May the newlyweds,

225
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,730
under the witness of all present,

226
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,360
inscribe their vow

227
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,930
of lifelong devotion

228
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,220
onto the matrimonial record.

229
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,190
Now, let's invite the bride and groom to exchange their engagement letters.

230
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,260
Miss Zhao, why are you here?

231
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,220
So it's all true.

232
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,420
Miss Zhao, please leave now.

233
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,570
The Young Marshal...

234
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,200
Why is she holding a gun?

235
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,800
Who is she?

236
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,460
Exactly.

237
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,710
I don't know.

238
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,290
She fired!

239
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,280
What's going on?

240
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,780
Where did this girl come from?

241
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,430
Young Marshal, congratulations on your engagement.

242
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,640
Take her down!

243
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,780
Don't touch her!

244
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,210
Young Marshal!

245
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,720
Where are you going?

246
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,340
Xingrou?

247
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,090
Xingrou!

248
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,190
What are you waiting for?

249
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,280
Young Marshal.

250
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,350
Peng Wu.

251
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,780
You little brat, are you trying to rebel?

252
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,390
Yi Bingyao, don't you owe me an explanation?

253
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,470
Chief Duan, please calm down.

254
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,340
Don't worry. I'll send people to bring him back immediately.

255
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,020
Yes.

256
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,530
Take him away!

257
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,490
Get up!

258
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,520
Jinyao, why did he...

259
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,910
Remember, only by enduring what others cannot

260
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,820
can you accomplish great things.

261
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,340
Hurry!

262
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,640
What a lively day.

263
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,370
Indeed.

264
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,750
Miss.

265
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,560
Go.

266
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,410
Alright.

267
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,180
Captain, should we keep chasing?

268
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,530
Follow me.

269
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,600
You, go that way.

270
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,040
Yes!

271
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,860
You two, go over there.

272
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,410
Yes!

273
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,620
Even if we have to turn Hangcheng upside down,

274
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,550
we must find her!

275
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,300
Yes!
