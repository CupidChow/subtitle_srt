you're here.

Why are you so late today?

6
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,560
Don't ask about things you shouldn't.

I'm not hungry.

00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,560
Okay.

Let me give you a massage.

00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,320
I'll go wash up.

No need.

and swallow them whole.

70

I was supposed to obey you,

00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,640
to live without independent thought

72
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,840

What are you trying to do?

85
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,680
I represent Colonel Tanaka

Let's see how long you two can keep resisting.

96
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,000
You might as well surrender obediently

97
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,680
and I'll make sure you get promoted and rich.

Yu Junren,

101
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,200
you used to work for the Yi family,

102
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,040
and now you're serving the Japanese.

103
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,120
Do you think everyone is as spineless as you?

104
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,640
You were at least still a man before,

105
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,320
but now you're just a traitorous dog groveling for glory.

106
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,159
No,

107
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,720
calling you a dog

108
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,590
would be an insult to dogs.

109
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,880
I'll kill you all!

110
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,400

111

112
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,240
Commander Chen has betrayed us.

113
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,400
I'll go inform the Grand Marshal.

114
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,440
Leave this place to me.

115
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,470
Be careful.

116
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,490
Grand Marshal, Commander Chen has defected!

117
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,790
Yu Junren is trying to take over the government office for the Japanese.

118
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,880
I beg you to return and take charge of the situation!

119
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,240
Grand Marshal!

120
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:39,720
Miss Huo,

121
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,159
these days,

122
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,040
your people have helped secure the government office,

123
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,520
so Duan Jinyao hasn't dared make a reckless move for now.

124
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,360
But with Yi Qiuting absent for so long,

125
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,040
the military is in disarray.

126
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,240
Other divisions are also considering following in Chen Peng's footsteps.

127
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,560
If war does break out,

128
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,520
the remaining Zhejiang Army likely won't hold.

129
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,370
Is there any other way

130
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,880
to reinforce Hangcheng's defenses?

131
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,240
The regular army is stretched too thin

132
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,200
to count on,

133
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,560
but

134
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,680
there are still some armed groups among the people—

135
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,640
like those bandit militias in the mountains.

136
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,960
If they're willing to bring their men to defend Hangcheng,

137
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,560
I'll pay whatever it takes.

138
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,760
You're changing the dressing.

139
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,799
Let me do it.

140
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,440
Bite on this.

141
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,760
Thank you.

142
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,920
The wound.

143
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,800
Cheng Xun?

144
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,400
Xingrou.

145
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,160
-Hurry up and sit down.
-What brings you back?

146
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,680
Is there something you need from me this time?

147
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,420
I came back specifically to find Yi Qiuting

148
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,920
and discuss an alliance against the Japanese.

149
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,440
An alliance against the Japanese?

150
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,560
Now, the Japanese are aggressively recruiting soldiers and buying horses,

151
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,160
and many warlords have defected.

152
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,240
There are even similar tendencies within the Zhejiang Army.

153
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,960
This situation has made our side both anxious

154
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,960
and heartbroken.

155
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,930
That's why I took the initiative this time

156
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,080
to come and persuade Yi Qiuting,

157
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,240
hoping he can rally the troops

158
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,120
and unite against the enemy.

159
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,560
But I just saw him

160
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,100
looking completely lifeless.

161
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,980
I've talked until my mouth went dry,

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,320
but he didn't even blink.

163
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,560
I don't even know how much he actually heard.

164
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,510
Don't worry about this for now.

165
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,080
I'll try to persuade him.
