00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,840
Senior Brother has already avenged you.

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,000
Please forgive him.

What do you mean by that?

00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,240
As if I really did something wrong back then.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,240
It was clearly Third Madam's fault,

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,960
yet she turned the tables on me.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,240
Even Master was fooled

into believing her.

I'd rather not.

You're a grown man now—

you should have your own life.

00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,480
I won't disturb you anymore.

Someone like me, who might not see tomorrow,

19
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,480
Look at what you've become.

20

How could my father rest in peace seeing you like this?

21
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,400
Your father stopped caring about me long ago.

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,800
Have you forgotten?

23
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,640

Don't you think we're strange?

38
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,280
We fought fiercely,

39
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,640
yet we can sit down and drink together.

I was 16 that year.

43
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,480
After leaving the private school, I passed by an alley.

44
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,310
I saw a group of beggars

45
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,920
bullying a little boy,

46
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,320
so I chased them off.

47
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,280

54
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,960
I should have come back earlier.

55
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,800
Back then, I was just being stubborn with myself,

56
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,680
wanting to prove myself quickly.

57
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,120
If you hadn't saved him,

58
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,480
I'd have hated myself forever.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,600
