Darling, please don't be angry.

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,370
Qiuting has indeed done something wrong.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,810
But sooner or later, this family business

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,520
will be handed over to him, won't it?

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,340
Have some tea.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,600
How can I drink tea now?

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,510
It's a misfortune for our family.

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,100
Darling, then what do you think we should do?

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,010
In the future, won't we have to

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,400
live our lives at the mercy of that wretched woman?

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,690
Uncle, Auntie, please don't worry.

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,020
I have an idea.

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,540
I'm not sure if it will work.

Xingrou, do you remember

17
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,390
I proposed to you here?

18
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,980
For these three months,

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,480
I've been on the battlefield,

♫Don't let dark clouds hide in your eyes♫

You know what? I'm not afraid of death,

♫The past may hurt, but it's hard to let go♫

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,070

♫Who truly chooses indifference?♫

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,700
How have you been feeling lately?

50
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,440
Please, make yourself at home.

51
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,560
Good.

52
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,780
Your prestige hasn't diminished over the years.

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,480
Oh, you flatter me.

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,020

Thank you.

57
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,950
You've completely taken control of the Yi family's military power?

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,500
Exchanged with my life.

If you want to break free from the rules of the game,

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,300
you'll have to shed some skin even if you don't die.

61
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,800
You talk too much.

62
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,750
Qiuting, I've already persuaded my father

63
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,270
to invite Professor Frank back to Hangcheng

64
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,340
to continue overseeing the railway construction.

65
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,190
-No need.
-You...

66
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,030
I've already found a new expert.

67
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,120
Qiuting,

68
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,079
well, my father, he's getting old.

69
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,910
It's inevitable that he might be a bit confused at times.

70
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,030
I promise you,

71
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,320
as long as I become the head of the Duan family,

72
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,329
I'll be absolutely loyal to you.

73
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,280
That's nothing.

74
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,420
If it doesn't work out, you can always cut off another one.

75
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,900
Qiuting.

76
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,820
Shut up.

77
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,380
Look at how spineless you are,

78
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,090
eagerly offering yourself as his slave.

79
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,100
Madam, let's change your clothes.

80
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,730
I can change by myself.

81
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,750
You... you're pregnant?

82
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,340
What else can I use to compete with you?

83
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,500
I've never thought about competing with you.

84
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,550
The matters between you and Yi Qiuting

85
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,890
have nothing to do with me.

86
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,519
Nothing to do with you?

87
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,000
If it weren't for you,

88
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,940
with my background and looks,

89
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,209
why wouldn't he accept me?

90
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,030
Do you think men are such complicated creatures?

91
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,420
Their minds are filled with nothing but money,

92
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,560
status, and beauty.

93
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,830
I can give him all of these.

94
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,620
What exactly did you do?

95
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,180
One man's meat is another man's poison.

96
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,960
What you've been fighting for

97
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,500
isn't what I want at all.

98
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,950
Stop pretending to be so noble.

99
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,270
If you don't want it,

100
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,850
why are you pregnant with his child?

101
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,260
Oh no, I can't let her tell Yi Qiuting.

102
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,140
Yi Qiuting doesn't know about this child.

103
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,550
You didn't tell him?

104
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,970
Why should I tell him?

105
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,820
This is my child.

106
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,960
Is the child's father someone else?

107
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,550
Was it during the time Qiuting was away?

108
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,180
Since you want to marry into the Yi family so much,

109
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,110
how about we make a deal?

110
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,900
My pregnancy,

111
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,700
you can't let anyone know about it.

112
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,270
In return,

113
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,450
I'll take the child and leave far away.

114
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,990
Will you really leave him?

115
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,430
All you want is the position of Mrs. Yi,

116
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,960
while I can't wait to avoid it.

117
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,010
Then what exactly do you want?

118
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,159
What I want

119
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,570
is nothing more than the freedom and dignity a person

120
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,810
should have,

121
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,890
Please leave.

122
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,800
Cheers, cheers!

123
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,060
-You’re welcome, Mr. Wu.
-Thank you.

124
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,360
Please.

125
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,320
This way, please. This way, please.

126
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,180
Madam is here too.

127
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,700
I just ran into her at the entrance.

128
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,200
What are you doing?

129
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,270
Looking for anything valuable.

130
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,840
Mr. Wu doesn't write erotic novels anymore.

131
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,410
Now you've turned to breaking and entering?

132
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,390
I'm just a bit short on cash lately.

133
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,510
Cut the crap. Tell me the truth.

134
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,500
What exactly are you up to?

135
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,200
Wu, why are you being so uncivilized?

136
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,720
How did I, your senior, teach you when you were young?

137
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,990
It's all because Yi Qiuting has been a bad influence on you.

138
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,380
Don't give me that senior-junior brotherhood crap.

139
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,520
When I was homeless on the streets,

140
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,070
why didn't you, my senior, come to find me?

141
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,270
I'm... I'm sorry.

142
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,990
I'll make it up to you. I'll do anything.

143
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,380
I don't want your compensation.

144
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,740
I want to know who killed my entire family.

145
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,020
You don't need to know.

146
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,630
What did you say?

147
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,340
You don't need to avenge our master.

148
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,220
I will take care of the revenge.

149
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,280
I can't let you be in any danger again.

150
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,460
Just continue to be a lieutenant with peace of mind.

151
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,730
Leave everything else to me.

152
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,050
Do you really not hate my father?

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,920
I used to.

154
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,420
But after all, he was my master.

155
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,060
And...

156
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,590
Anyway,

157
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,720
don't get involved in this matter anymore.

158
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,590
I came to Hangcheng

159
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,880
firstly to investigate what happened to your family,

160
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,810
and secondly, I was entrusted to protect Zhao Xingrou.

161
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,690
As it happens, these two matters have intersected.

162
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,490
Once you leave this room,

163
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,790
forget about all of this.

164
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,930
Whatever I do from now on, don't interfere.

165
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,049
Dear friends and family,

166
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,919
I'm very grateful to you all

167
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,380
for taking the time to attend today's celebration banquet.

168
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,260
Today,

169
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,559
I have some wonderful news

170
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,880
to share with everyone.

171
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,000
The good news is that Qiuting's fiancée,

172
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,980
my future daughter-in-law, Miss Duan,

173
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,450
is already three months pregnant.

174
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
What joyous news! Congratulations!

175
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,080
Thank you, thank you.

176
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,820
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

177
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,820
Thank you, congratulations!

178
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,000
This is wonderful news!

179
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,400
Congratulations, Young Marshal!

180
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,680
Uncle, Auntie, please don't rush.

181
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,050
I have an idea.

182
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,170
Why don't we,

183
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,960
before Qiuting announces his engagement,

184
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,040
say that I'm already pregnant with his child?

185
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,320
Qiuting and I spent a night together,

186
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,940
he should believe it.

187
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,700
Only by temporarily delaying the wedding announcement

188
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,190
will we have time to plan our next move.

189
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,440
No matter what,

190
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,860
we can't let that wretched woman

191
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,970
enter our Yi family.

192
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,630
You are the daughter-in-law I want.

193
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,480
Now that this good news has been announced,

194
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,510
let's all continue to enjoy the banquet, shall we?

195
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,170
-Okay.
-What a double happiness!

196
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:34,930
Yes, indeed.

197
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,680
Qiuting.

198
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,440
Mother.

199
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,440
Why are you only telling half the story? What about the rest?

200
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,830
What rest?

201
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,580
Chief Duan's daughter,

202
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,840
Miss Duan Jinyao is pregnant.

203
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,110
What does that have to do with me?

204
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,760
Qiuting, what do you mean by this?

205
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,280
Duan Jinyao,

206
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,350
I never thought

207
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,000
you would bring your personal affairs

208
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,890
out in public like this.

209
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,030
The Duan family's style is truly uninhibited.

210
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,460
Enough.

211
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,620
Friends,

212
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,370
from here on,

213
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,230
this is a private matter for our Yi family.

214
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,110
Please, everyone, take your leave.

215
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,840
Please leave, please go.

216
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,800
Wait.

217
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,310
I'll decide when this is over.

218
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,370
Qiuting,

219
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,150
are you going to disregard the Yi family's reputation?

220
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,650
Who's disregarding the Yi family's reputation?

221
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,800
You even

222
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,580
took your son being taken advantage of while drunk

223
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,420
and treated it as good news to announce.

224
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,800
Yi Qiuting!

225
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,650
Darling.

226
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,530
Come quickly!

227
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
So Miss Duan is the one who climbed up the bed, huh?

228
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,770
Even if there's an engagement,

229
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,400
they're not even married yet and she's already in a man's bed.

230
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,890
She is way too eager.

231
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,150
What are you talking about?

232
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,850
My sister is Yi Qiuting's rightful fiancée.

233
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,360
Yi Qiuting,

234
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,200
even if you sent a telegram to break off the engagement before,

235
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,450
when you had relations with my sister,

236
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,840
it was still within the engagement period.

237
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,130
Duan Jinyao, I was indeed drunk that day,

238
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,010
and you did throw yourself at me,

239
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,300
but I pushed you away.

240
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,890
Do you want me to continue?

241
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,420
Yi Qiuting, you dare to do it...

242
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,410
But you don't dare to admit it?

243
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,720
I swear to heaven, I never touched Duan Jinyao.

244
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,800
Qiuting,

245
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,660
is this what you meant by taking responsibility for me?

246
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,110
I had anticipated this.

247
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,820
You would use this to blackmail me.

248
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,960
If I hadn't said this,

249
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,610
you wouldn't stop pestering me.

250
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,550
So I had to expose your true colors.

251
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,440
Yi Qiuting.

252
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,150
Why be so cruel to a woman?

253
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,220
You...

254
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,740
Allow me to formally introduce,

255
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,690
this is my lawful wife.

256
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,620
She is the love of my life,

257
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,970
Zhao Xingrou.

258
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,840
We have already completed our marriage registration.

259
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,550
We will be holding our wedding ceremony soon.

260
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,270
You are all welcome.

261
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,160
What a perfect couple you are.

262
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,600
Yi Qiuting,

263
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,750
do you think you've overcome all obstacles,

264
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,010
endured countless hardships, and finally achieved your wish

265
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,200
to marry the woman you love most?

266
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,830
But do you know

267
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,000
that in her belly,

268
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,160
she's carrying another man's child?

269
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,460
Another man?

270
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,250
She's really pregnant?

271
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,620
Neither of these children are his own.

272
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,330
This situation has become complicated.
