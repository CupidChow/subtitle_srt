no one shall violate the hierarchy.

185
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,040
Slap his face!

186
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,710
Who dares!

187
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,600
-Don't move!
-Don't move!

188
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,560
-Hands on your head!
-Kneel down!

189
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,450
Kneel properly!

190
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,220
Qiuting,

191
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,100
are you really

192
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,000
going to rebel for this bitch?

193
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,190
You bitch! It's all because of you

194
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,870
that my whole family is in turmoil!

195
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,560
Mom!

196
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,820
I brought her back today

197
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,560
to tell everyone

198
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,080
that she is my lawful wife.

199
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,040
From now on, she'll live here.

200
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,390
Stop right there!

201
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,890
Father,

202
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,040
it's time for a new head of the Yi family.

203
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,810
From now on,

204
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,300
I'll be the one in charge of the Yi family.
