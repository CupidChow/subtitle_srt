I'm single.

00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,710

What does the Young Marshal mean?

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,810
Why would he ask that?

Xingrou, Yi Qiuting is too dangerous.

31
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,450
Have you figured out how to get rid of him?

32
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,090
Do you want to study abroad?

Study abroad?

34
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,009
So you can further your education and get away from Yi Qiuting.

35
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,840
It's a win-win situation.

36
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,750
Don't worry, with your abilities,

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,210
you'll definitely get a scholarship.

38
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,200
We can apply to the same school.

39
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,630
I'll think about it.

40
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,330

54

Please stop this relentless pursuit.

As long as we join forces,

111
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,790
