in her belly,

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,160
she's carrying another man's child?

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,640
You're pregnant?

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,360
Why didn't you tell me?

00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,520
Why didn't you tell me? Say something.

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,920
Speak.

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,400
If she admits it,

9
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,120
wouldn't it be two lives lost?

10

Quick, quick, quick!

Wu Chongmo, what are you trying to do?

15
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,390
Miss Zhao, you need to come with me immediately.

16
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,739
Mr. Wu.

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,930
Do you want to go against Young Marshal?

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
I'm sorry, it's my duty.

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,600
Wu, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,810
Wu!

21
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,130
Do you also think I would kill her?

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,420
Wouldn't you?

23
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,020
If it were Peng Wu today,

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,210
would you kill him?

Let him go.

27
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,960
Let him go!

28
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,000
Put it down.

Xingrou,

30
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,880
why didn't you tell me you were pregnant?

31
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,760
You don't tell me anything.

32
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,760
You know you're going to drive me crazy, don't you?

33
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,400
Say something.

34
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,960
Speak up.

35
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,160
Okay.

If you're so capable, why don't you start pretending to be mute from today?

37

Don't say a single word.

38
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,760
Mr. Wu,

39
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,120
why do you keep helping me?

40
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,120
Qiuting,

41
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,800
even if you keep this woman,

42
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,520
if you want the clan to accept her,

43
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,640
don't even think about it.

44
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,079
Then let's not seek recognition.

45
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,240
I'll raise my own child myself.

46
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,920
That's right.

47
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,520
Raising a child is simple.

48
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,960
But if you want this child

49
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,400
to be added to our Yi family genealogy,

50
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,240
it's difficult.

51
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,440
But as you know,

52
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,600
my words carry weight in the family.

53
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,320
I can help you with this.

54
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,360
But I have a condition.

55
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,040
First, release Junren and Adjutant Yang for me.

56
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,440
Yes, at least release Junren first.

Did I allow you to come in? Get out.

61
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,960
Our family has completely severed ties with Yi Qiuting.

62
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
And your reputation is ruined.

63
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,870
In the future,

64
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,159
which good family would dare to marry you? Tell me.

65
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,600
Not getting married won't kill me.

66

I mean, that's not what I meant.

69
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,520
I'm saying, the way you are,

70
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,650

71
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,120
how can we maintain it?

As long as I become the head of the Duan family,

73

I'd like to see who dares to speak ill of me.

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,040
You?

Who else? You?

I want the future head of the Yi family.

77
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,560
Yi Qiuting won't do.

78

I know you have an injury in your lungs.

82
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,720

Yes.
