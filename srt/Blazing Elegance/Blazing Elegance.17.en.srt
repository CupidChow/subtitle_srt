She caused me to lose my child.

I'll never forgive her.

00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,360
However,

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,800
I don't want to force her into prostitution either.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,600
Don't worry.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,200
I've already told Ningshuang

00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,960
She must be the mother of that child.

Ms. Zeng, look.

This is the pocket watch my dad carries with him every day.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,680
I just took it out

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,360
while he was on the phone.

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,570
You shouldn't take your dad's things without permission.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,160
Open it and take a look.

Yes, she is.

My mother is an expert in German.

She's translated several books.

Your mom is very beautiful.

I have something to attend to.

Practice on your own.

38
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,760
I've investigated the hospital where you gave birth.

39
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,920
But the doctors and nurses who helped you deliver

40
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,280
have all disappeared.

The one capable of doing this

42
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,400
could be Yi Qiuting.

43
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,430
But back then, he was always very concerned

44
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,160
about who had hired me to protect you.

45
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,920
You were shot at the hospital,

46
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,480
and he knew someone wanted to harm you.

47
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,040
There was a reason for what he did.

48
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,000
No need to investigate further.

49
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,280

Mr. Wu,

53
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,440
you once said that Yi Bingyao was your enemy.

54
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,480
Do you still want him to die completely now?

55

But this time I'm back

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,600

Where's Ms. Zeng?

61
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,100
Ms. Zeng said she had an urgent matter to attend to

62
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,680
and left in a hurry.

63
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,280
She just left like that?

Your place was just sitting empty anyway.

What? Is Yi Qiuting so stingy

72
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,280
that he has never paid you?

73
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,410
You can't even afford to rent a place?

74
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,240
It's not like that.

00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,560

No.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,880
Why?

89
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,000
Why would I come back?

90
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,520
To wait for someone to get back at me?

91
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,000
He didn't die.

92
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,840
I know.

93
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,520
Then why didn't you come back to finish him off?

94
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,480
You kept him alive to lure me back?

95
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,040
Not entirely.

96
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,920

By the way,

99
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,440
what's the deal with that child of Yi Qiuting?

Where did he come from?

101
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,040
Why are you asking about this?

Five years ago, Zhao Xingrou gave birth to a child,

103

but the doctors and nurses who were involved at that time

104

As for why he protected Xingrou,

we have no answer.

110
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,200
Maybe Xingrou really had enemies.

So just in case,

112
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,440

115

Isn't Zhao Xingrou dead?

116
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,000
Can't I be curious?

117
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,080
I'm just curious.

to protect Zhao Xingrou?

I'm not telling you.

122
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,560
Then how did you explain Zhao Xingrou's suicide

123
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,480
to your employer?

124
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,200
At worst, I just wouldn't get paid.

125

If not...

I still need to look after the other children at school.

189
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,220
Candied haw!

190
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,800
How about I take you to buy some candied haws?

191
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,440
-Let's go.
-Give me one.

192
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,320
Alright.

193
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,320
Here you go.

194
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,040
Sir, give me the biggest one.

195
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,960
Thank you.

196
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,280
Yi Nian.

197
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,080
Daddy.

198
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,560
Daddy!

199
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,560
Nian.

200
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,320
Who bought you this candied haw?

201
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,520
This lady bought it for me.

202
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,560
♫Don't let dark clouds hide in your eyes♫

203
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,240
Which lady?

204
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,820
♫The past may hurt, but it's hard to let go♫

205
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,680
Peng Wu.

206
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,560
Go and investigate.

207
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,630
♫I have something to say for you♫

208
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,200
Find out who dares to abduct

209
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,240
even a child from the Yi family.
