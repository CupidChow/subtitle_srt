Why not?

00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,240
I don't necessarily need the Yi family's military power.

We can find a place where no one knows us.

7

Wouldn't it be nice to live a simple and peaceful life?

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,200
No.

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,360
What I want is power and status.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,120
If you're willing to help me, then stay.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,160

get out.

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,560
To bring down Yi Qiuting,

14
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,360
we can only do it through Zhao Xingrou.

15
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,440

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,600
why haven't you killed her yet?

21

Killing Zhao Xingrou

24
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,760
would bring me no benefit.

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,880
Keeping her alive is to use her against Yi Qiuting.

and give you an explanation.

107
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,680
This is covering up for a criminal.

as the commander of the three armies,

113
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,320
you're covering up for a suspect and obstructing the investigation.

No.

136
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,560
I need to rescue him first.

137
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,560
It's clean.

138
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,840
How is Qiuting?

139
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,040
They have detained Yi Qiuting

140
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,000
to find out where you're hiding.

141
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:51,840
What?

142
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,560
Miss Zhao being framed

143
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,680
is just a pretext.

144
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,800
Yi Bingyao and Yu Junren's ultimate target

145
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,200
is Yi Qiuting.

146
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,440
But even a tiger doesn't eat its own cubs.

147
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,440
Throughout history,

148
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,960
there have been many cases of emperors

149
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,400
and crown princes becoming enemies.

150
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,000
Qiuting took his power,

151
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,720
so he must hate him deeply.

152
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,680
How can there be any father-son affection?

153
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,560
Yi Bingyao

154
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,520
has always been a ruthless person.

155
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,600
Now that the Young Marshal is locked up,

156
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,400
isn't he in imminent danger?

157
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,160
Under the guise of interrogation,

158
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,320
there's a lot that can be done.

159
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,160
Even if they don't kill him,

160
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,120
as long as they incapacitate him,

161
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,240
the military power will naturally return to Yi Bingyao's hands.

162
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,920
Wu.

163
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,360
This matter started because of me.

164
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,960
If I let them catch me,

165
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,450
they will let Qiuting go.

166
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,200
No way.

167
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,800
Don't rush.

168
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,520
We need to come up with a foolproof plan

169
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,120
that can both clear Miss Zhao's suspicion

170
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,240
and rescue Yi Qiuting.

171
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,280
We must find Leng Mei.

172
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,280
She should be with Yu Junren now.

173
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,409
I'll send someone to find out where she is.

174
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,160
Okay.

175
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,400
Yu Junren's plan consists of three moves.

176
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,360
The first move is to use Leng Mei to frame me.

177
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,160
The second move is to lure Qiuting into defying military orders

178
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,240
to have him arrested.

179
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,360
The third move is to use extrajudicial means to harm him.

180
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,250
Go ahead. Scream out loud.

181
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,520
I might spare you if you do.

182
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,880
Leng Mei is just his first pawn.

183
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,760
She's of no use to him anymore.

184
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,680
He will kill Leng Mei.

185
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,360
So we must find her

186
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,560
and make her tell the truth.

187
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,480
Scream!

188
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,600
Come on, scream!

189
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,720
Why don't you beg me for mercy?

190
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,960
You don't deserve it!

191
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,760
Scream!

192
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,240
Scream!

193
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,280
Young Marshal, Young Marshal.

194
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,440
Wu,

195
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,640
Are you alright?

196
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,200
Still alive.

197
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,040
Why are you here?

198
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,840
The inspection team let me in.

199
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,120
I'm going to kill that bastard Yu Junren right now.

200
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,000
Xiao Wu,

201
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,760
don't make a big deal out of this.

202
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,120
How is Xingrou?

203
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,880
Madam is safe now.

204
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,960
We just need to find Leng Mei now

205
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,240
and make her tell the truth,

206
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,520
and the truth will be revealed.

207
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,720
Young Marshal, please wait a little longer.

208
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,200
She may not be willing to tell the truth.

209
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,960
Madam says she has a way.

210
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,640
Then leave finding Leng Mei

211
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,640
to Wu Chongmo.

212
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,440
You take care of Xingrou.

213
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:44,880
But...

214
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,200
Listen to your senior.

215
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,320
Wu Chongmo will surely find a way.

216
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,000
You can go now.

217
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:51,960
Young Marshal.

218
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,760
Go.

219
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,880
Peng Wu, this is an order.

220
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes, sir.

221
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,080
Are you alright?

222
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm fine.

223
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,600
In the Yi family,

224
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,080
Qiuting has treated you well.

225
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,120
How could you frame him for Yu Junren?

226
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,120
Do you know

227
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,840
that treason charges in a military court is deadly?

228
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,480
I didn't mean to frame the Young Marshal.

229
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,160
You're the one guilty of treason.

230
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,160
It's not safe here. Take her back for interrogation.

231
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,360
Zhao Xingrou.

232
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,280
How dare you show your face?

233
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,360
Junren,

234
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,200
I knew you would come to save me.

235
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,400
I didn't say anything.

236
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,960
Didn't you say

237
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,600
you'd take me to a safe place to wait for you?

238
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,320
You also said you would marry me after this is over,

239
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,000
and we would be together forever.

240
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,000
Captain Yu,

241
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,280
you're truly inhuman.

242
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,600
To achieve your own goals,

243
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,240
you even deceive a woman's heart.

244
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,840
Did you also sell your own charm?

245
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,700
Never mind what method,

246
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,400
as long as it can trap Yi Qiuting, it's a good one.

247
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,200
Look, this charge of treason is perfect.

248
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,070
Yi Qiuting, for the sake of a woman,

249
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,840
disregards the lives of his soldiers,

250
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,880
harbors a suspect, and undermines military discipline.

251
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,480
He's lost the soldiers' trust.

252
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,880
And it'll be natural for the Grand Marshal to take back military power.

253
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,200
All of this was planned by the Grand Marshal?

254
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,000
If it weren't for the Grand Marshal's order,

255
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,400
I wouldn't dare to touch him.

256
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,000
To frame Yi Qiuting,

257
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,240
you've really gone to great lengths.

258
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,640
Well, my cousin is such a lovesick fool.

259
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,720
If something happened to you, he would definitely step in.

260
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,590
Taking this opportunity,

261
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,080
I could catch him,

262
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,380
and he'd be like a fish on a chopping board,

263
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,760
at my mercy.

264
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,120
Even if the Grand Marshal wants to strip him of his power,

265
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,680
he wouldn't want to kill him.

266
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,080
If you dare to harm him,

267
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,520
the Grand Marshal won't let you off.

268
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,500
Yi Qiuting defied his father's authority

269
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,120
and seized the Grand Marshal's military power.

270
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,480
The Grand Marshal has long since given up on him as a son.

271
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,640
Anyway, it's using my hand to kill him.

272
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,160
Afterwards, the Grand Marshal can just pretend to punish me,

273
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,360
and the matter will be over.

274
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,320
What does it matter if I suffer a bit?

275
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,240
If I can get rid of Yi Qiuting,

276
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,160
it's worth it.

277
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,680
Why do you hate him so much?

278
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,810
I grew up with him, living under

279
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,360
the Yi's roofs since I was little.

280
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,220
The first thing I did when I entered the Yi family was to try to please him.

281
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,040
But what about him?

282
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,170
He never even looked at me properly.

283
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,920
Our Yu family may have fallen on hard times,

284
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,720
but our ancestors were once wealthy tooQ

285
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,480
I am more or less a young master.

286
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,600
He's always treated me like a dog.

287
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,640
Alright.

288
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,040
Now I finally have the chance.

289
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,880
I want him to take a good look at me

290
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,080
and see how I trample him under my feet.

291
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,360
Alright, everything's been made clear.

292
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,280
Let's get going then.

293
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,560
Look here, look here.

294
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,760
-Look here.
-Come on.

295
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,100
Look here.

296
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,610
Go.

297
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,210
Dear friends from the press,

298
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,200
did you all hear

299
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,580
what Yu Junren just said?

300
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,700
Yes, we heard it clearly.

301
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,340
We'll go back and broadcast it immediately.

302
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:24,810
That's right.

303
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,870
Yu Junren.

304
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,600
I never thought you could be so ruthless.

305
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,120
I was blind.

306
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,280
Madam,

307
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,480
I'm willing to testify in the military court

308
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,320
to prove that you were falsely accused.

309
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,400
Yu Junren, you plotted against the military commander.

310
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,920
Wait for the military court's trial.

311
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,440
Take him away.

312
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,510
Please announce your resignation, Grand Marshal.

313
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,360
Rest assured,

314
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,400
I will take care of you in your old age.
