do you still not know

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,580
what you did wrong?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,820
So it's all true.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,900
Unless I die,

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,620
I will never let you leave me.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,130
Whether you love me or not,

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,480
you are mine.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,630
I will never be your mistress.

Drive through.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,090
Did you move back to school for him?

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,890
She's at home!

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,920
But she doesn't have time to open the door for you right now.

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,390
You can get lost!

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,420

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,720
Don't come over!

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,590
Hide well.

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,730
I'm coming to find you.

23
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,020
Xingrou, this poem is so beautiful.

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,800
I'm going to share it with our classmates.

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,870

Xingrou,

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,850
something happened at home. Come back with me now.

28
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,980
What happened?

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,030
Stop asking. Just come back with me now!

31
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,270
Okay.

You're back?

34
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,670
How much does she owe you?

35
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,539
Skipping the small change, it's 1000 silver dollars.

36
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,250

37
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,530
Figure out a solution yourself.

38

Xingrou!

39
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,550
Your mother has no money to give you. She's already sold you to me.

40
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,520
What did you say?

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,200
So tell me, should I sell you to a pleasure house

42
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,230
and have you be a hooker,

43
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,100
or...

44
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,440
This one here is actually her real child.

Xingrou!

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,880
Whether you sell him to a pleasure house

47
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,020
or an opera troupe,

48
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,230
that's up to you.

49
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,980

If I hadn't picked you up by the roadside back then,

52
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,160
would you still be alive today?

53
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:25,190
Are you sure you picked me up,

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,990
not abducted me?

55
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,030
Since I was six,

56
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,510
I've been selling flowers on the street

57
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,530
to support your whole family.

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
Whatever I owe you,

59
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,870
I have long paid back.

60
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,760
You should understand your situation.

61
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,200
Stop.

62
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,530
I've already told you.

63
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,280
I have nothing to do with this family.

64
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,800
Cut the crap. Take her away.

65
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,030
Don't come any closer!

66
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,180
Oh, you've got a gun.

67
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,730
Do you even know how to use it?

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,830
Go ahead, take a shot.

69
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,290
You think you can lay a finger on her?

70
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,070
Don't move!

71
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,820
I didn't give you the gun

72
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,920
to use it as decoration.

73
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,950

Yu Junren, if you want to fight me,

77

come to me openly.

78
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,890
Have you thought about the consequences

79
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,950
of laying hands on my woman?

80
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,900
If someone owes money, it's only natural for them to pay it back.

81
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,340
No, don't shoot.

85
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,280

I'll help you.

What can such a woman bring you?

don't think that because you've won a few battles,

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,950
you can dominate the world.

Xingrou,

188
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,650
let's have a baby of our own, okay?

189
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,590
But...

190
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,500
I'm here.

191
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,150
I will take responsibility for your life.

192
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,500
This way.

193
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,590
Look over there.

194
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,650
Did you find him?

195
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,860
Is he there?

196
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,350
No.

197
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:04,900
No.

198
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,720
Sir, would you like to buy some flowers?

199
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,410
Get lost!

200
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,940
Are you looking for

201
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,040
a wounded man?

202
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,790
You saw him?

203
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,370
I saw him heading that way.

204
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,650
Come on, chase him!

205
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,030
Why did you save me?

206
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,910
Because you are Yi Qiuting.

207
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,920
I want to pave a way for my future.

208
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,590
What do you want?

209
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,940
I want to get into the normal school.

210
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,030
But I need a recommendation letter.

211
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,010
Do you like the book

212
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,620
or me?

213
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,980
I won't marry you.

214
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,730
If you don't marry me,

215
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,950
I'll keep you locked in my arms forever,

216
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,020
so you can't go anywhere.

217
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,320
Since you're so sincere,

218
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,720
I'll agree for now.

219
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,170
How long will it take to get pregnant after taking this medicine?

220
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,420
[Ward 2]

221
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,720
It's hard to say.

222
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,450
Everyone's constitution is different.

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,130
This medicine was specially formulated based on

224
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,110
Miss Zhao's constitution.

225
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,930
In this aspect, harmony between yin and yang

226
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,980
and following heaven's will are the most important.

227
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,300
Forcing it might lead to the opposite effect.

228
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,570
This is heaven's will.

229
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,660
Xingrou,

230
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,910
only if you're pregnant

231
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,340
can I convince my parents to let you into the Yi family.

232
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,840
Be a good girl

233
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,340
and get pregnant soon, alright?

234
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,570
Yi Qiuting!

235
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,520
You're acting recklessly and willfully!

236
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,060
Can you face the ancestors of the Yi family?

237
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,510
I'd like to see

238
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,580
whether you are tougher

239
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,510
or if the Yi family's punishing rod is tougher!

240
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,180
No one shall violate the hierarchy!

241
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,060
No one shall be disrespectful!

242
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,280
No one shall bully the weak!

243
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,630
No one shall collude with villains!
