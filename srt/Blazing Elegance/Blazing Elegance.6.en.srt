Don't touch it.

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,210
You're treating this like it's a treasure.

00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,110
Why don't you react at all?

With her making such a fuss,

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,730
Yi Qiuting's attention will be even more on her.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,820
Listen, you need to have a sense of crisis.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,320
Please leave.

Why did you do this?

Why are you being so foolish?

21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,610
Yes, I am foolish.

22
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,210
I attempted suicide because I couldn't get the love I wanted.

23
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,890
You want me to say I'm sorry?

24
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,570
No, the one who should say sorry is me.

I failed your love.

36

Now all I have is hatred.

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,430
No, you don't hate me.

You also said you would never leave me.

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,470
why you are wrong?

why should I report my whereabouts to you?

67

Who are you to me?

68
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,310
There's only one person in this world who can control me,

69
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,790
and that's my wife.

I don't need you to teach me.

103

Then who do you need to teach you? Your father?

104
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,800
He'll only teach you to be selfish and brutal,

We'll leave Hangcheng tonight,

189
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,560
first to southeast Asia, then to Europe,

190
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,960
and leave here forever.

191
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,320
Cheng Xun, thank you for rescuing me,

192
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,910
and thank you for your kindness.

193
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,880
But you have your own ideals and ambitions,

194
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,380
and I don't want to live

195
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,770
a life arranged by others anymore.

196
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,440
Wish you all the best abroad.

197
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:39,910
Take care.

198
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,210
I don't know where she went either.

199
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,820
Xingrou, you better hide well.

200
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,010
I'm coming to find you.
