1
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,040
Stop pretending.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,120
What are you doing?

3
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,720
Yi Qiuting has gone missing.

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:20,800
At a time like this?

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,720
And his subordinate, Division Commander Chen Peng,

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,000
has already defected to the Japanese army.

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,400
That old bastard Chen Peng.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,360
What did you say?

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,960
I said Chen Peng knows how to read the situation.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,280
Now is our best opportunity.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,160
Stop hiding here.

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,120
Get discharged from the hospital quickly.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,480
Why?

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,960
Haven't you always wanted the Yi family's military power?

15
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,280
I'll give it to you.

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,520
So what do you want to do?

17
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,880
Occupy the government office,

18
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,040
kill all the anti-Japanese leaders,

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,560
and incorporate the Zhejiang Army.

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,000
Jinyao,

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,510
can we stop doing things

22
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,700
for those Japanese?

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,319
Those Japanese are all beasts.

24
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:04,959
They...

25
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,600
You're beyond help.

26
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,800
I just not want it anymore.

[Episode 22]

29
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,600
I'll have to personally

30
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,960
transport your batch of medicine,

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,840
so I might be gone for a few days.

32
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,840
To Lianyungang?

33
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,320
No, I'm taking it directly to Datong.

34
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,880
Once I get there,

35
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,400
I can't continue by rail anymore.

36
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,479
I'll have to use a horse caravan to get it in.

37
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,640
There's a Huo family trading house in Taiyuan.

38
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,320
I can send someone to assist.

39
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,560
Alright.

40
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:41,039
I've already spoken to the Shanxi Army.

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,440
They'll at least do me this small favor.

42
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,640
Aren't you afraid of crossing the precinct?

43
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,680
Are you...

44
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,520
worried about me?

45
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,880
What are you thinking about?

46
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:09,919
Mom,

47
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,600
why hasn't Dad come for several days?

48
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,320
Dad's on a business trip.

49
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,440
He'll be back soon.

50
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,560
Nian,

51
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,480
if I take you to live in Gangcheng,

52
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,240
would you like that?

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,920
Will Dad come with us?

54
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,079
Just the two of us.

55
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,520
I don't know which to choose.

56
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,040
I love Dad,

57
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,640
and I love you too, Mom.

58
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,560
I like it when the three of us are together.

59
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,720
Come here.

60
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,120
It would be easier if Dad were a bad dad,

61
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,440
then I wouldn't miss him.

62
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,400
Yi Nian.

63
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,960
Mr. Wu, how is it going?

64
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,600
Yi Qiuting has already come back.

65
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,320
The Huo family's trading house in Taiyuan has received the goods.

66
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,600
They've switched to a horse caravan

67
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,160
and should be delivered soon.

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,720
We owe him a lot this time.

69
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,720
Are you planning to forgive him?

70
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,520
I can't do that yet.

71
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,040
What is Marshal Yi doing?

72
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,280
I don't know.

73
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,760
Why is he kneeling in front of the Huo Mansion?

74
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,000
He offended Eldest Miss Huo?

75
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:48,240
Who is this Eldest Miss Huo anyway

76
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,200
that she can make Marshal Yi kneel?

77
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,400
Dad.

78
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,880
Dad, why are you kneeling?

79
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,520
Isn't that the young master of the Yi family?

80
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,960
Why is he staying at the Huo Mansion?

81
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,520
Yes, indeed.

82
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,200
I miss your mom.

83
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,720
Mom, please let Dad come in.

84
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,320
Turns out they're a family.

85
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,680
The Yi family's young master's birth mother is always a mystery.

86
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,280
Turns out it's Eldest Miss Huo.

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,320
What exactly do you want?

88
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,120
I want to live with you and Nian.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,160
You've brought this upon yourself.

90
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Don't blame me.

91
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,880
Xingrou, where is this?

92
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,080
This is a room specially prepared for you.

93
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,040
For me?

94
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,080
I'm not used to you being so proactive

95
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,520
all of a sudden.

96
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't speak.

97
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,120
Xingrou, what are you--

98
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,160
Just wait here for me.

99
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,160
Xingrou.

100
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,800
Xingrou!

101
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,880
I want to see Zhao Xingrou.

102
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,080
I want to see Zhao Xingrou!

103
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,360
Have her come see me!

104
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,160
Madam.

105
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,440
No.

106
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,080
Miss Huo.

107
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,800
I understand

108
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,000
you have many personal grievances with the Grand Marshal,

109
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,960
but please understand the current situation.

110
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,440
If the Grand Marshal doesn't return soon,

111
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,160
the morale of the troops will be in chaos.

112
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,040
Alright.

113
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,159
I will let him go back tomorrow.

114
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,560
Thank you.

115
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,320
How does it feel to be imprisoned?

116
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,480
Xingrou,

117
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,480
you've finally come to see me.

118
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,000
When you imprisoned me in the Small Mansion,

119
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,320
you weren't as delicate as you are now.

120
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,640
As long as it makes you feel better,

121
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,160
you can imprison me

122
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,880
or torture me

123
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,400
as you like.

124
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,080
Really?

125
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,560
Really.

126
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,080
If you truly love me,

127
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,800
then try to preserve your chastity.

128
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,320
Xingrou,

129
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,360
what are you doing?

130
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,320
Make them leave.

131
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,200
Make them leave.

132
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,880
Xingrou!

133
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,400
Don't come near me.

134
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,120
Don't come any closer!

135
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,799

After all, he is the Governor.

You can't really hurt him.

You're awake.

Xingrou.

153
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,000
I have some bad news to tell you.

154
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,960
Your training has failed.

155
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,840
Impossible.

156
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't believe it.

157
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,880
Take a good look at yourself.

158
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,000
You didn't pass the test.

159
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,600
Leave.

160
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,840
Impossible.

161
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,120
How could this happen? No way.

162
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,720
No way.

163
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,760
Grand Marshal, stop drinking.

164
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,520
Get out!

165
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,360
Get out now!

166
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,880
Go get some hangover medicine.

Xingrou.

168
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,520
Who is he?

169
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,120
You go in first.

170
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,920
Who is he really?

171
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,240
He is my husband.

172
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,920
What did you say?

173
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,320
I forgot to tell you.

174
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,920
I got married in Gangcheng.

175
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,600
Impossible. I don't believe it.

176
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,320
Believe it or not.

177
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:38,840
Xingrou.

178
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,960
Let go.

179
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,000
Can you not treat me like this?

180
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,200
Who do you think you are to say such things?

181
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,760
Miss Huo,

182
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,320
dressed like this,

183
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,680
I hope I'm not causing you any trouble.

184
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,080
Of course not.

185
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,040
In fact, you've done me a favor.

186
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,120
What did you just say?

187
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,040
Grand Marshal looked very upset.

188
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,080
I said I got married in Gangcheng

189
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,480
and you're my husband.

190
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,200
Grand Marshal must hate me now.

191
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,840
But this way,

192
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,600
he should give up

193
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,280
and stop looking for me.

194
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,760
What about your child?

195
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,040
I'll take Nian back to Gangcheng.

196
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,640
Will he agree?

197
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,810
I'll see whether Yi Qiuting has the ability

198
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,440
to take Nian away from me.

199
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,040
By the way, Miss Huo,

200
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,880
the real reason

201
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,520
I came this time is to ask you

202
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,480
for a favor.

203
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,640
Go ahead.

204
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,720
Several professors from Central University

205
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,880
have some collections,

206
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,000
like antiques, rare books, and manuscripts.

207
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,640
They're worried these items will be destroyed in the war,

208
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,360
so they want to have them transported to Gangcheng for safekeeping.

209
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,400
Do you think you could help

210
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,040
transport these items out?

211
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:11,760
That's easy.

212
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,760
We've rescued a batch of cultural relics

213
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,160
in Beiping before,

214
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,960
so we have some experience.

215
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,240
That's great.

216
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,760
Don't worry.

217
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,920
Get in the car first.

218
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,040
It's rude to stare at my husband

219
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,640
like that.

220
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,320
The marriage of the Huo family's young lady is such a big event.

221
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,600
How could there be no news at all?

222
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,200
Our family was in chaos back then.

223
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,520
So we got married in secret.

224
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,080
But you're already married to me.

225
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,200
How could you remarry someone else?

226
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,160
The one who married you was Zhao Xingrou.

227
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,920
She's already dead.

228
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,960
And I am Huo Xingrou.

229
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,280
I'll do anything you say.

230
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,440
I'll take any beating or scolding.

231
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,200
I won't argue or make a fuss.

232
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,780
Just think of me as a little cat or dog

233
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,640
you keep.

234
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,400
Will you please consider it?

235
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:53,800
Okay.

236
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,360
I'll think about it.

237
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,000
Then please consider it quickly.

238
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,200
I can't wait.

239
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,160
Xingrou.

240
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,640
You can stay here.

241
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,000
But I don't want to see any servants.

242
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,480
I don't want others to know about our relationship.

243
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,040
Okay.

244
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,840
I want you to be here every day,

245
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,360
so I can see you whenever I come by.

246
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,800
Okay.

247
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,640
Lastly,

248
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,520
and most importantly,

249
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't want my husband

250
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,720
to know about our relationship.

251
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay.

252
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,960
Okay.
