No, you still have a chance to start over.

Do you trust me?

46
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,400
Miss Zhao,

47
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,640
do you know

48
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,880
why I've always been by your side?

49
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:11,880
Actually,

50
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,040
I was entrusted by your parents to protect you.

51
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,120
My parents?

52
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,520
Not the Zhao family,

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,680
but your biological parents.

54
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,000
Where are they?

55
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,960
Your original surname is Huo.

56
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,840
You were born into the Huo family in Gangcheng.

57
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,560
The Huo family?

58
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,800
The Huo family is a large clan.

59
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,050
After your grandfather passed away,

60
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,320
internal conflicts broke out.

61
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,079
You were still little at the time,

62
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,040
so your parents had no choice but to send a servant

63
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,040
to take you and your sister to Hangcheng for safety.

64
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,280
But along the way, the servant lost you

65
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,040
and only brought your sister back.

66
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,920
I have a younger sister?

67
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,760
Yes.

68
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,000
But the Huo family has been unstable,

69
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,920
so they couldn't bring you back just yet.

70
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,200
They could only send someone to protect you from the shadows.

71
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,720
So you're the one

72
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,480
who's been protecting me all this time.

73
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,200
Yes.

74
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,200

76
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,880

00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,080
Once he's grown up,

191
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,200
I'll come to be with you.

192
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,000
Xingrou.

193
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,760
Mr. Wu,

194
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,000
you've finally shown up.

195
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,480
Where have you been wandering these days?

196
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,440
The Northeast.

197
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,000
Things aren't exactly peaceful there.

198
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,720
Indeed.

199
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,280
Those damned Japanese…

200
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,040
They...

201
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,480
My apologies

202
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,120
for speaking so crudely in front of you.

203
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,040
It's fine.

204
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,790
I actually like someone like you—

205
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,880
straightforward and genuine.

206
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,330
I wish I could travel the world

207
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,400
as freely as you do,

208
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,520
but my parents and elder sister don't agree.

209
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,040
This is a chaotic time.

210
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,120
How could we be at ease with

211
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,400
a young lady like you out on your own?

212
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,200
Well,

213
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,240
I can go with Mr. Wu.

214
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,370
I have long been accustomed to

215
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,120
roaming the world alone.

216
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,560
I know

217
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,840
you just think I'm a burden.

218
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,440
Mr. Wu,

219
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,040
I've been assisting my parents in Gangcheng all these years

220
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,440
handling the Huo family's affairs.

221
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,360
I've long heard of

222
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,770
your reputation—meticulous in thought

223
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,880
and decisive in action.

224
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,040
Even someone like Second Master Huo

225
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,600
could be brought down by you.

226
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,960
You're truly impressive.

227
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,280
You're too kind.

228
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,480
Now that the Huo family has no more concerns,

229
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,680
I invited you here today

230
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,360
because there's something I wish to talk to you about.

231
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,600
I want to head north.

232
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,200
Head north?

233
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,960
I want to do my part in the fight against the Japanese.

234
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,040
I wonder if you'd be willing to go with me.

235
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,560
Where to?

236
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,800
The Huo family has factories and banks

237
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,400
in Hangcheng.

238
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,440
After much thought, that's where I need to go.

239
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,400
Xingrou,

240
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,320
I don't want you to go there.

241
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,400
When we were little, I lost you there.

242
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,720
It separated us for so many years.

243
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,000
You were taken away

244
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,480
and had to endure so much suffering.

245
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,400
I...

246
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,520
I hate Hangcheng.

247
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,880
Silly girl,

248
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,840
you didn't lose me.

249
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,280
Besides, it's all in the past now.

250
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,560
How about this?

251
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,080
You come with me;

252
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,640
maybe it'll help you let go of the guilt.

253
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,000
Okay.

254
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,520
I'll go with you.

255
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,610
But right now, Hangcheng...

256
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,400
I know.

257
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,560
Yi Qiuting has absolute control over the city,

258
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,520
but this time, I'm not afraid of him.

259
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,860
Grandma, I'm sorry.

260
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,720
I'm not your grandmother.

261
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,600
Whether you even belong to the Yi family is still in question.

262
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,470
Don't think you're anything special.

263
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,120
You're just an illegitimate child.

264
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,480
You're talking nonsense.

265
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,190
I have a dad! I have a mom!

266
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,520
It's just that my mom passed away.

267
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,800
The adults in our family said that

268
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,920
your dad isn't really your father.

269
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,640
That's nonsense!

270
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,040
If you bully him again,

271
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,520
I'll have you all thrown in jail.

272
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,440
Here I come.

273
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,360
How are you? Are you hurt anywhere?

274
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,400
No.

275
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Auntie, have we met before?

276
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,080
Of course not.

277
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,000
Alright.

278
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,360
What's your name?

279
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,760
My name is Yi Nian.

280
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,960
Will I be able to see you again?

281
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,360
What's your name?

282
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,400
Nian.

283
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,800
Uncle Wu.

284
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,560
Dad.

285
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,680
You got into a fight again?

286
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,560
Dad, I just saw a

287
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,440
really pretty auntie.

288
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,800
What auntie?

289
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,800
She's gone now.

290
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
I think

291
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,440
you're afraid I'll beat you up,

292
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,790
so you're trying to change the subject.

293
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,560
I don't want to fight either.

294
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,440
They insulted me first.

295
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,840
What did they say about you?

296
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,000
They called me a bastard.

297
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,600
They also said I'm not your biological child.

298
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,440
Come here, Nian.

299
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,280
Don't listen to their nonsense.

300
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,680
Let your Uncle Wu teach you a few moves.

301
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,800
If they say it again, beat them up.

302
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,680
Okay.

303
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,920
Let's go.

304
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,560
That child called Yi Qiuting "Dad."

305
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,600
No, it can't be my child.

306
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,000
My child is already dead.

307
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,920
[The Huo family in Hangcheng]

308
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,390
Eldest Miss Huo, what happened?

309
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,840
Let's get down to business first.

310
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,040
How's the investigation I asked you to do?

311
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,320
Just as I suspected, my Second Uncle colluded with Duan Jinyao to get rid of me.

312
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,840
Over the years, the Duan family may have looked like Duan Guanglei was in charge,

313
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,920
but in reality, it was Duan Jinyao pulling the strings.

314
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,280
She's had her time in the spotlight.

315
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,800
Back then, she took my child from me.

316
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,160
I'll make sure she pays for it.
