The foreign expert left Hangcheng overnight.

We chased after him to the train station

18
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,460
but were stopped by the Duan family's people.

19
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,280
What?

20
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,000
Grand Marshal, bad news!

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,300
Why are you panicking?Speak slowly.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,350
Jiangxi Province has assembled its forces at Jiujiang,

23
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,850
and Fujian Province has gathered its troops at Ningde,

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,700
forming a pincer movement against us.

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,930
Jiangxi Province and Fujian Province have long been dissatisfied with us

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,789
over the railway construction issue,

27
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,920
and Chief Duan has always been the one mediating.

28
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,140
This time, Young Marshal has offended Chief Duan severely,

29
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,080
and Chief Duan's washed his hands of the matter.

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,640
Qiuting,

33
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,710
you're finally here.

34
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,050
Do you know how much trouble

35
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,440

00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,170
Qiuting,

39
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,800
he is your father-in-law anyway.

40
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,840
What's the harm in yielding a little?

41
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,710
I've already decided to break off the engagement.

42
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,990
If Chief Duan insists on forcing me,

43
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:43,930
then he is making himself my enemy.

44
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,850
What exactly do you want to do?

45
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,740
Never forget your own identity.

46

Identity?

47

I've long ceased to want to be a pawn of the Yi family.

48
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,930
From now on, I am the master of my own life.

49
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,580
Grand Marshal,

50
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,800
you are old.

51
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,220
What you fear, I do not.

52
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,579

I... I support you.

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,100
You are a true hero, a real man.

57
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,410
I truly admire you.

58
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:35,530
Then come with me to the front lines.

My martial skills are poor.

00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,160
I'll definitely provide support for you from the rear.

67
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,630
Yi Qiuting sent a telegram saying he wants to call off the engagement.

68
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,150
I knew it.

69
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,260
With his personality,

70
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,810
there was no way Father could keep him under control.

71
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,230
And yet, for such a big matter,

72
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,180
all he did was send a telegram.

73
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,000
He really doesn't take us seriously.

74
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,180
Does Dad know?

75
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,190
No.

76
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,440
I intercepted

77
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,540
that telegram.

78
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,160
That's good then.

79

The reason we've ended up like this

82
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,750
is all because of that woman.

83
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,640
As long as she's dead,

84
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,470
what reason would Yi Qiuting have to refuse marrying me?

85
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:34,090
You mean you want to...

86
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,790
No, no, no!

87
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,390
If Yi Qiuting finds out, he won't let it go...

88
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,140
Look at how spineless you are.

89
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,740

See how you've spoiled our son.

94
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,480

95

96
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,130

104

will go back to being our obedient boy.

105

106

If you don't want to eat anything else,

112

at least have this medicinal meal.

116

Yi Qiuting, you've really gone mad.

190
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,660
Congratulations, Young Marshal. Congratulations, Madam.

191
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,900
May you have a happy marriage.

192
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,490
[Marriage Certificate]

193
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,370
We should drink the nuptial wine together.

194
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,800
[Happiness]

195
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,950
I think I haven't had my period for two months.

196
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,550
The bed is only so big—

197
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,020
where can you hide?

198
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,300
But I don't want to...

199
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,950
We are already legally married.

200
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,840
Yi Qiu...

201
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,800
Do you know how much I love you?

202
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,280
But your love is suffocating me.

203
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,770
Then let yourself suffocate.

204
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,580
Whether I'm pregnant or not,

205
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,250
Madam,

206
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,890
-just drop the matter.
-you are definitely pregnant.

207
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,700
And the fetus is very stable.

208
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,200
It's a healthy baby.

209
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,020
I want an abortion.

210
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,510
Well…

211
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,510
There is a way,

212
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,800
but if it's not done properly,

213
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,810
it could seriously harm your health,

214
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,900
maybe

215
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,220
even affect future pregnancies.

216
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,160
You need to think it through carefully.
