1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,080
You seriously injured my father.

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,600
I didn't kill you.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,080
You should be grateful for that.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,920
What if I say your father deserved to die?

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,040
My Master ran an escort agency.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,200
That year, he took on an escort job.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,200
It was for a wealthy merchant from Hangcheng.

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,360
to transport a shipment of silk to the south.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,160
But my master knew

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,759
transporting silk was just a cover.

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,640
What they were really transporting

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,040
was gold hidden in the silk.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,000
Before setting out,

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,600
someone approached my master,

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,790
persuaded him to cooperate from the inside

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,280
and embezzle this batch of gold.

17
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,480
My master was momentarily blinded by greed.

18
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,080
This one misstep

19
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,040
brought disaster upon his entire family.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,800
A double-cross.

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,360
So now you know

22
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,560
who that person was who came to him back then, right?

23
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,720
My father.

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,760
Yi Bingyao, in order to keep all that gold for himself,

25
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,280
wiped out my master's entire family.

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,360
Your father was already a brigade commander at that time.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,680
He used that gold to recruit and expand his team.

28
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,680
He eventually became an all-powerful military governor.

29
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,640
How come in your story,

30
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,000
there's not a single good person?

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,520
Yes,

32
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,800
my Master did make a mistake in this matter.

33
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,160
But

34
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't want Wu

35
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,080
to get involved in this revenge business.

36
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,120
Yi Bingyao killed my master's entire family.

37
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,800
I only want his old life in return.

38
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,479
That's not too much to ask, is it?

39
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,800
I understand you,

40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,120
but as a son,

41
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,800
protecting my parents is my natural duty.

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,960
So, may the best man win.

43
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,600
Alright, may the best man win.

44
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,039
You've finished telling your story.

45
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,040
Now it's my turn.

46
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,240
I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you, Grand Marshal.

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,600
The martial arts world has its own rules.

48
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,160
I can't disclose

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,520
any information about my employer.

50
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,640
I won't keep pressing

51
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,800
on the same issue.

52
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,960
However, I suspect

53
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,079
that Xingrou is not dead.

54
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,160
If Miss Zhao is not dead,

55
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,360
then I've lost a payment for nothing.

56
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,720
I...

57
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,380
I'm usually busy with military affairs

58
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
and can't be in two places at once.

59
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,000
I can't investigate personally,

60
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,520
so I want to hire you.

61
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,880
I know the rules of yours.

62
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,280
Trust comes first.

63
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,400
Once you accept a client's job,

64
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,040
you must be loyal and responsible,

65
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,600
never deceiving.

66
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm honored by your favor.

67
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,610
However...

68
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,310
Of course.

69
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,360
You can also refuse me,

70
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,470
but I need to hear your reason.

71
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,610
The reason is simple.

72
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,280
Because I have already retired from the business.

73
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,320
Perhaps I've been overworked these years.

74
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,840

marry a few virtuous wives and beautiful concubines,

77
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,120
and enjoy family life.

78
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,640
What?

79
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,560
Do you not allow it?

80
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,940
It seems you

81
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,360
are completely disregarding our past relationship.

82
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,120
Fine.

83
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,440
Then I won't insist.

84
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,050
Farewell.

85
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,920
Grand Marshal, you're a respectable person.

86
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Don't use Wu to manipulate me.

87
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,600

Grand Marshal,

90
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,279
why do you have to be so persistent?

91
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,240
Zhao Xingrou hasn't been around these years,

92
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,520
haven't you been doing quite well?

93
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,440
Have I been doing well?

94
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,000
If possible,

95
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,560
I'd like to harden my heart

96
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,120

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,000
I spent five years in prison.

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,120
Only after I got out did I learn

102
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,000
that the Duan family had fallen.

103
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,390
It was Zhao Xingrou and Yi Qiuting

104
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,920
who ruined me like this.

105
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,520
I never thought Zhao Xingrou would be from the Huo family.

106
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,360
She really did climb the social ladder.

I don't want to entertain that Japanese man anymore.

Isn't that good enough?

136

What's wrong with the Japanese?

No matter how much we Chinese fight among ourselves,

it's still our own business.

But you getting involved with the Japanese,

150
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,670
that makes you a traitor, a collaborator.

As long as I have the Japanese backing me up,

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,780

Once we're out of your territory,

That's right,

185
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,440

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,960
carrying my clearance documents,

188
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,560
you can't say it has nothing to do with me, can you?

189
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,560
Moreover, Miss Huo,

190
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,080
collaborating with bandits is a capital offense.

191
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,280
Then, Marshal Yi, please consider that we were never here today.

192
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,360
Let's go.

193
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,320
Wait.

194
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,080
I can't accept payment for no work done.

195
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,640
Take it back.

196
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,560
Are you alright?

197
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,270
Auntie, why are you covering your face?

198
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,800
Nian, that's impolite.

199
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,300
Is everything okay?

200
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,050
Dad.

201
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,430
The fragrance on her,

202
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,640
it smells like the perfume of that auntie from before.

203
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,420
Which auntie?

204
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,720
The one who bought me candied haws last time.

205
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,720
I'll look into it right away.

206
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,480
Don't alert them.

207
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,560
Yes.

208
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,040
Dad, are there enemies?

209
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,240
There are no enemies.

210
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,340
Dad, give it to me quickly.

211
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,920
This is what the auntie gave me.

212
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,200
Give it to me quickly.

213
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,750
You have candied haws.

214
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,960
I'll have the handkerchief.

215
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,080
Give it to me.

216
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,800
Dad is a big meanie.

217
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,520
Miss, get down quickly!

218
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,470
It's Peng Wu.

219
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,440
Retreat!

220
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,840
Yu Junren.

221
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,080
Madam, it really is you.

222
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,840
Wu, I'm sorry.

223
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,440
Take him away.

224
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,400
Speak.

225
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,400
Has Yi Qiuting started to suspect me?

226
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,840
Please let me go back.

227
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,960
Yu Junren was among that group just now.

228
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,960
Yu Junren?

229
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,740
He has defected to the Japanese?

230
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,560
What?

231
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,080
That group just now was sent by the Japanese?

232
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,520
Miss Huo's resistance activities in Hangcheng

233
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,960
have already angered the Japanese.

234
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,760
That's why Tanaka sent someone to assassinate her.

235
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,440
Then I must go back even more urgently.

236
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,520
I need to go back and tell the Grand Marshal.

237
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,200
The Grand Marshal will protect you, madam.

238
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,600
I don't need his protection.

239
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,600
Madam, Senior.

240
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,920
Don't worry, Yi Qiuting will find you soon.

241
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,480
I can't believe you failed.

242
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,000
What use are you to me?

243
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,640
I didn't expect

244
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,420
Peng Wu would suddenly...

245
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,040
I don't want to hear any excuses.

246
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,480
Don't go.

247
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,440
Let go.

248
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,580
Don't think I don't know

249
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,360
what that Tanaka did to you.

250
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,360
Duan Jinyao, is revenge really that important?

251
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,080
Is it worth sacrificing so much?

252
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,600
Jinyao,

253
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,440
come in.

254
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,920
There's no turning back for me now.

255
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,640
If you really care about me,

256
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,720
then go kill Zhao Xingrou and Yi Qiuting.

257
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,200
Wu.

258
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,540
Grand Marshal.

259
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,800
Did they hurt you?

260
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,920
I'm fine.

261
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,800
Grand Marshal.

262
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,160
Miss Huo is Madam.

263
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,080
I know.

264
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,920
Where is she?

265
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,120
She's already left.

266
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,920
She's with Mr. Wu.

267
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,320
Wu Chongmo?

268
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,560
Grand Marshal.

269
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,400
When Madam was returning today,

270
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,000
she encountered an ambush.

271
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,400
It was done by the Japanese.

272
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,800
Yu Junren was also involved.

273
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,960
Yu Junren?

274
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,600
He has become a traitor?

275
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,280
Yes.

276
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,640
That bastard Yu Junren.

277
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,800
If the Japanese want to harm Xingrou,

278
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,280
then Xingrou is in danger.

279
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,240
Let's go.

280
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,960
Darling!

281
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,000
Help! Someone come quickly!
