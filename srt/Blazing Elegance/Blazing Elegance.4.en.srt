How's your reflection been going these past couple of days?

Do you know why these chess pieces are round?

You were born into a powerful family.

That's why I've come here today to apologize to you.

46
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,690
I hope you can be magnanimous and let bygones be bygones.

My daughter from the Duan family has been so humiliated,

I won't marry anyone but him.

A pair of large hands...

186
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,440
Shut up.

187
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,920
If I could further pry into his life,

188
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,490
I should be able to uncover his true identity.

189
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,620
Let me think about it.

190
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:30,730
Young Marshal.

191
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,720
Qiuting, have a seat.

192
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,800
Mom.

193
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,600
Miss Duan, do you have any business at my home?

194
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,030
Listen to yourself.

195
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,350
Jinyao missed you.

196
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,790
Is it not okay for her to come and see you?

197
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,310
Qiuting, this is Dr. Frank.

198
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,620
Dr. Frank

199
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,540
is Germany's most renowned railway expert.

200
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,710
This time, thanks to Miss Jinyao,

201
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,170
we were able to invite this great master.

202
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,500
Dr. Frank

203
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,160
and the principal of August Middle School

204
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,110
are old acquaintances.

205
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,530
I want to visit him tomorrow

206
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,650
and give a lecture while I'm there.

207
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,650
I came to invite you to accompany me.

208
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,920
August Middle School?

209
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,090
Is it inconvenient?

210
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,190
It's convenient.

211
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,760
This is official business. Qiuting will definitely attend.

212
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,310
Right?

00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,130

Here comes Dr. Frank.

216
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,590
Dr. Frank, it's been a long time.

218
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,260
Long time no see.

219
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,800
This is Miss Zhao from our school.

220
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,920
She has translated your work before.

221
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,330
It's truly my honor.

222
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,190
Thank you very much.

223
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,170
So Miss Zhao is a teacher at this school.

224
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,740
Nice to meet you.

Please.

This is a school. Please behave yourself, Young Marshal.

231
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,480
Let's go.

232
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,480
What are you doing?

233
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,490
I'm helping you.

234
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,180
Miss Zhao and I are getting along peacefully.

235
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,840
Isn't that good for you?

236
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,150
Miss Duan, aren't you being a bit too clever for your own good?

237
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,710
If you do this again,

238
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,440
I won't be so lenient.

239
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,170
I really like this school.

245
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,040
Thank you very much, Dr. Frank,

246
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,590
for delivering this lecture to us.

247
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,800
And many thanks to Miss Zhao for her translation.

248
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,820
Of course,

249
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,540
we are also very grateful to the daughter of Chief Duan,

250
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,900
Miss Duan Jinyao,

251
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,650
for making this lecture possible.

252
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,470
Please, Miss Duan, come up and say a few words.

253
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:08,630
[Self-improvement] [Heaven rewards diligence]

254
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,150
I am honored

255
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,300
to be able to contribute to the cause of education.

256
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,420
I am also pleased that our country has women like Miss Zhao,

257
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,230
who are such outstanding career women.

258
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,000
I believe

259
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,920
that women should break free from the constraints of traditional thinking

260
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:26,230
and not limit their lives to being wives and mothers.

261
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,040
Miss Zhao, do you agree?

262
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,940
I agree.

263
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,370
Then may I ask, are you single now?

264
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,540
I am single.
