We'll leave the city when we find an opportunity.

Thank you for your trouble, Miss Ningshuang.

It's no trouble.

This Yu Junren has actually become a traitor.

We must eliminate him.

14

The one who truly sided with the Japanese is Duan Jinyao.

She's now Tanaka's special assistant.

16

Yu Junren is nothing but her pawn.

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,520
I really regret not eliminating her earlier.

18

It's a troubled time.

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,360
It's not appropriate to hold a grand funeral.

Yes.

25
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,560
Should we pursue the killer then?

Why don't you stay here and rest for a few more days before leaving?

165
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,000
The Huo Mansion is no worse than here.

166
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,920
I know.

167
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,590
If you want to take Yi Nian back to stay for a few days,

168
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,440
that's fine too.

169
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,320
But...

00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,870

171
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,960

174
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,560
What?

175
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,240

Yes.

177
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,760
She was originally a child of the Huo family.

178
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,840
She was just taken away by the Zhao family when she was young.

179

00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,660
wasn't a political struggle at all.

182
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,480
It was Zhao Xingrou's revenge!

183
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,640
Was your father also killed by her?

184
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,800
No.

185
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,520
My father was killed by someone else seeking revenge.

186
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,200
No, Qiuting.

187
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,560
Help me make some arrangements.

188
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,650
She must hold a grudge against me.

189
