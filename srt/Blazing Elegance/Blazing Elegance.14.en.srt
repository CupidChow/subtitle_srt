[Delivery Room]

194
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,220
This poor child.

195
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,200
So beautiful, yet didn't live for even a day.

196
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,650
Young Marshal's wife was shot in the chest

197
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,760
and lost so much blood.

198
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,600
It's a miracle she survived.

199
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,600
The baby...

200
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,960
Baby.

201
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,620
My baby.

[Operating]

204
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,190
The baby's awake. The baby's alive!

205
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,400
Young Marshal, it's a miracle!

206
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,920
My whole life

207
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,200
has been like a joke.

208
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,720
No parents,

209
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,680
hurt by my lover,

210
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,720
even lost my child.

211
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,560
This poor child.

212
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,400
So beautiful, yet didn't live for even a day.

213
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,360
Should I resent the unfairness of fate?

214
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,080
Or blame someone?

215
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,160
If I hadn't been with Yi Qiuting,

216
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,810
would I not be so miserable?

217
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,080
Yi Qiuting,

218
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,560
don't make me hate you!

219
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,640
Qiuting.

220
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,760
Then hate me.

221
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,560
He did make some mistakes.

222
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,400
You insisted on giving her fertility drugs back then,

223
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,440
forcibly altering the imbalance of yin and yang in her body,

224
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,770
resulting in damage to her internal organs

225
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,880
and a disruption of her vital energy.

226
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,800
She probably won't be able to get pregnant again.

227
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,320
But he has already done enough for me.

228
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,040
It's this world that can't tolerate us.

229
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,640
If I continue to stay by his side,

230
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,080
neither of us will be happy for the rest of our lives.

231
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
It's better...

232
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
to be free.

233
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,390
Oh no! Someone jumped into the river!

234
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,840
Hurry. Go save her!

235
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,240
Young Marshal.
