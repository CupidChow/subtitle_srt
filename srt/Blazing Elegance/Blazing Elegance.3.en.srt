Miss Duan, someone has delivered this letter.

They said it's for the Young Marshal.

156
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,720
I can help you obtain military power in the Yi family.

157
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,670
I know you're eager to gain control.

158
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,220
You want to break free from your family's control.

159
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,640
But you're not strong enough yet.

160
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,040
And your family is pressuring you.

161
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,970
You're getting impatient, aren't you?

162
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,840
What can you do?

163
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,560
Although my father doesn't have military power,

164
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,240
he has the authority to allocate resources.

165
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,400
I'm asking about you. What do you want in return?

166
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
My father's health is failing.

167
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,160
I want to help my brother become the head of the family.

168
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,280
I know you already have someone in your heart.

169
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,600
I just want to take advantage of your influence.

170
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,640
But I'm not after you personally.

171
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,840
Once it's done, I'll naturally keep my promise

172
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,360
and break off our engagement.

173
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,920
But if you insist on going your own way,

174
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,440
I'm afraid I'll have to save face for the Duan family.

175
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,640
That Duan girl

176
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,520
actually harbors such intentions.

177
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,160
None of them are easy to deal with.

178
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,680

181
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,720

00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,360
It's delicious.

183
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,800
You should eat too.

185
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,880
I'm not following him.

186
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,240
I just happened to be passing by that alley.

187
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,080
And was inexplicably brought back by you guys.

188
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,440
You'd better confess honestly.

189
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,840
Otherwise, I'll cut your throat.

190
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,280
Be careful!

191
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,280
I'll talk.

192
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,760
Because

193
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,000
I admire him.

194
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,560
You better be honest with me.

195
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,840
I'm telling the truth.

196
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,200
Well,

197
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,080
were you the one who ambushed in the warehouse?

198
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,120
It was me.

199
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
I saved him.

200
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,000
Is this how you treat

201
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,080
his savior?

202
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,800
Do you really have no other intentions?

203
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,720
I want

204
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,200
to be his lover.

205
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,240
Young Marshal doesn't like men.

206
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,400
You're not allowed to follow him anymore.

207
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,480
Do you understand?

208
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,560
I understand.

209
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,440
How about untying me first?

210
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,390
Yes.

211
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,160
Really.

212
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,440
Stay away from me.

213
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,480
Do you really

214
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,520
not remember me?

215
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,440
You asked me whether I don't really remember you just now.

216
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,960
What do you mean?

217
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,520
Lieutenant Peng, be careful not to let things get out of hand.

218
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,920
If that happens,

219
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,800
there are some things you'll never know.

220
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,080
Wu Chongmo, I'll be watching you.

221
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,400
You're most welcome.

222
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:29,890
I'm leaving.

223
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,640
Leng Mei, Leng Mei.

224
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,160
Leng Mei.

225
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,520
-Miss Zhao.
-My stomach hurts so much.

226
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,680
Miss Zhao, what's wrong?

227
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,240
Please call a doctor for me quickly.

228
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,880
It's terrible, Miss Zhao is sick.

229
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,720
Hurry and get a doctor.

230
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,400
But...

231
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,000
There are so many people guarding inside and out.

232
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,720
What are you afraid of?

233
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,240
Is this the Young Marshal's residence?

234
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,640
Who are you?

235
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,680
I was sent by the Young Marshal

236
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,000
to examine Miss Zhao.

237
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,970
It's appendicitis. We must operate immediately.

238
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,320
Then I'll inform the Young Marshal right away.

239
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,960
There's no time. I'll take Miss Zhao to the hospital first.

240
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,590
Please tell Young Marshal

241
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,920
we're going to the emergency department of Ren'ai Hospital.

242
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,400
Alright.

243
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,590
Open the door!

244
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,050
Stop the car!

245
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,620
Zhao Xingrou.

246
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,640
Has he gone mad?

247
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,420
Rush over there.

248
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,280
He will dodge it.
