00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,560
Why do you ask?

189
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,880
I can hear a bit of

190
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,520
the Hangcheng accent in your speech.

191
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,040
My nanny is from Hangcheng.

192
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,280
I grew up with her,

193
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,320
so I picked up some of the accent.

194
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,160
I see.

195
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,560
Sorry for interrupting you, Miss Huo.

196
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,640
It's just that hearing you speak

197
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,640
reminded me of an old friend.

198
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,600
To be precise,

199
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,680
it reminded me of my late wife.

200
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,080
It's a business meeting,

201
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,400
but I unintentionally started talking about personal matters.

202
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,800
Miss Huo, what you mentioned

203
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,200
about building a military supply factory

204
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,310
is a great thing

205
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,920
for the country and the people.

206
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,000
I will naturally give my full support.

207
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,280
That's good.

208
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,600
But there's one more thing that requires your decision.

209
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,800
Please, go ahead.

210
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,320
The war is in a critical state,

211
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,950
and there aren't many available places.

212
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,480
So,

213
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,740
the location we are considering for the factory

214
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,280
overlaps with the Yi family's ancestral burial ground.

215
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,600
What do you mean?

216
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,800
Are you planning to dig up my Yi family's ancestral graves?

217
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,960
If I wanted to,

218
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,290
I would have done it long ago.

219
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,440
Miss Huo,

220
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,880
you have quite the bold tone.

221
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,160
I don't wish to fall out with you either.

222
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,840
Why don't you take the initiative to relocate the graves

223
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,160
and make things easier for everyone?

224
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,880
Make things easier for everyone?

225
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:14,040
It seems more like you're taking advantage of the situation to force me.

226
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,360
Marshal Yi, don't be hasty.

227
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,040
You can take some more time to think about it.

228
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
But the war won't wait.

229
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,240
The sooner the military supply factory is built,

230
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,240
the sooner it can serve the soldiers.

231
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,520
I've never heard that

232
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,360
the factory site would take over the Yi family's ancestral burial ground.

233
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,280
I made it up.

234
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,200
He kept bringing up the past.

235
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,320
Grand Marshal.

236
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,640
Did the negotiations not go well?

237
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,480
This Eldest Miss Huo

238
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,480
certainly lives up to her reputation.

239
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,600
Grand Marshal, are you praising her?

240
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,480
Praise her?

241
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,100
She's about to dig up my Yi family's ancestral graves.

242
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
Am I supposed to praise her?

243
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,840
This Eldest Miss Huo

244
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,520
was truly aggressive.

245
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,120
But we've never had any dealings with her.

246
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,840
Why did she force you like this?

247
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,440
Maybe she wants me to prove my sincerity.

248
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,880
Or maybe she just has a peculiar temperament

249
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,000
and was using me for amusement.

250
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,200
What should we do then?

251
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,400
What else can we do?

252
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,160
Relocate the graves.

253
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,120
Wouldn't that be giving in to her?

254
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,960
The military supply factory

255
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,560
is a matter of national importance.

256
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,680
My personal pride is insignificant in comparison.

257
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,120
Let's go.

258
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,630
I never expected Yi Qiuting

259
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,200
would actually relocate his ancestral graves so obediently.

260
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,640
But to be fair,

261
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,530
although Yi Qiuting has done many things

262
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,760
that wronged you,

263
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,320
he's competent in his official duties.

264
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,800
I know what I'm doing.

265
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,040
That's good.

266
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,600
Oh, by the way,

267
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,440
I'll be leaving Hangcheng in a while.

268
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,080
The world is in such chaos now.

269
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,960
Where are you going?

270
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,360
Abroad again?

271
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,520
No.

272
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,920
No. I'm going to Northern Shaanxi.

273
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,080
Northern Shaanxi?

274
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,240
I've made up my mind.

275
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,480
"A man should take up his weapon

276
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,440
and reclaim the lost land of his homeland."

277
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,680
I believe only there

278
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,240
lies the hope for the future.

279
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,480
When are you leaving?

280
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,460
I can prepare several carts of medicine

281
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,640
and go with you.

282
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,800
That would be great.

283
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,920
But right now, the checkpoints are strict.

284
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,680
It may not be easy to get the medicine out of the city.

285
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,520
I can talk to Yi Qiuting.

286
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,760
Well...

287
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,280
Wouldn't that be too risky?

288
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,400
Isn't that the Grand Marshal?

289
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,490
The Grand Marshal has never been interested in women.

290
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,200
Why did he come to a pleasure house today?

291
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,620
He's been single for too long.

292
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,960
I guess he couldn't bear the loneliness anymore.

293
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,440
Young Marshal?

294
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,040
Oh, right. Grand Marshal.

295
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,400
I apologize for not welcoming you from afar.

296
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,120
I didn't expect you would really come here to find me.

297
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,520
What's wrong with this place?

298
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,680
You've been saving yourself all these years.

299
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,040
Now, you suddenly stepped into this place of pleasure.

300
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,760
I'm sure the gossip outside is spreading like wildfire.

301
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,000
Isn't this exactly what you want?

302
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,960
Please forgive me, Grand Marshal.

303
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,400
Life is long,

304
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,520
and I'm bored.

305
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,200
So I had to

306
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,680
find some entertainment

307
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,400
to pass the time.

308
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,120
You're treating me as entertainment?

309
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,360
You really aren't afraid of dying.

310
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,280
That's because I know

311
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,000
you have a reason that you must see me.
