4
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,409
You didn't have to.

5
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,747
But it's pouring.

6
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,216
It feels like winter rain.

7
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,761
It'll get colder soon.

8
00:02:59,054 --> 00:02:59,888
I hate it.

9
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,227
At least it snows in the winter.

10
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,689
I guess you like snow.

11
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,652
Don't you like it?

12
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,367
It's pretty to watch,
but useless otherwise.

13
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,790
Doesn't it make you feel happy
since it's so pretty?

14
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,670
I guess you like pretty things.

15
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,801
Doesn't everyone?

16
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:50,856
Did you see us?

17
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,982
A little while ago.

18
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,323
Did you two break up?

19
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,166
Why do you keep coming to me?

20
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,137
Do you think it'll work out between us?

21
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,437
I can handle anything that comes my way.

22
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,356
No matter what it is.

23
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,122
I think the rain…

24
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,129
will stop soon.

KCU BANK

28
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,200
Hey, how many of them are there this year?

29
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:29,246
We have 10,000 big calendars
and 20 boxes of the small ones.

30
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,667
Jeez. We'll be spending all night
rolling calendars again.

31
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,086
Are we working
at a calendar factory or what?

32
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,629
Go inside. We'll do it.

33
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,089
What do you mean?

34
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,508
You know I'm not the type of person

35
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,718
who tries to get out
of doing physical labor.

36
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,387
You're going to hurt your back.

37
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,930
I hike a lot.

38
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,268
So I have a strong core
and great lower body strength.

39
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,686
Gosh.

40
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,773
-Where do I put this?
-Let me.

41
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,191
Okay, thanks.

42
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,735
You guys can take over. Good luck.

43
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,445
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

44
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,663
What's up with you two?

45
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,709
You used to be joined at the hip.
Why the awkwardness?

46
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,918
Lover's quarrel?

47
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,879
I guess he fell out of love with me.

48
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,800
That's how I feel about you,
you troublemaker.

49
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,761
I'll head to the subbranch
after moving this last batch.

50
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,472
<i>And once again, it's the end of the year.</i>

51
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,224
It's time to roll up calendars.

52
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,561
I don't even eat <i>gimbap</i>
because I hate rolling things now.

53
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,230
Do banks really have to provide
this perk to clients?

54
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:41,234
What do calendars have to do with money?
Gosh, my shoulders are sore.

55
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,862
Yet you always take two calendars home.

56
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,754
The end of the year is around the corner.

57
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,342
For those who negatively impacted
our branch's performance,

58
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,887
this is your last chance
to raise your individual performance.

59
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,682
And don't just
randomly give out those calendars.

60
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,895
Hand them out to our VIP customers,
who will help our performance.

61
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,151
How are preparations going
for the Youngpo Market sharing event?

62
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,446
I assigned that task to the employee
who is closest to the vendors.

63
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,656
Mr. Yang is…

64
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:36,331
Since Mr. So
isn't here either, let me see…

65
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,128
I'll get their consent
while handing out calendars this morning.

66
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,839
Mr. Ha has been in charge of it.

67
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,217
Right.

68
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,471
Ms. Ahn took the day off,
so someone needs to sub for her.

69
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,765
That'll be all.

70
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,688
Who'll go to the subbranch?

71
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,359
-How come every time--
-I'll go.

72
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,028
Really? Good.

73
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:20,417
I can't believe Su-yeong
took another day off without notice.

74
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,710
She must be mortified.

75
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,754
She may have pretended to be fine,
but she was humiliated at her workplace.

76
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,425
But that wasn't her fault.
She was the victim.

77
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,218
Of course, it was her fault.

78
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,763
Mr. Jeong was such a gentle soul.
You could tell by his innocent eyes.

79
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,433
But she made him see red--

80
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,186
I'm off to get consent forms signed.

81
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,858
What's with him?

82
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,694
He's moody like a teenager.

83
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,369
I could've just walked.

84
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,080
Then should I pull over?

85
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,665
Zipping it.

86
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,675
It's noisy. I want some quiet.

87
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,015
PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE

88
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,477
Are you sick?

89
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,687
So what if I am?
It's none of your business.

90
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,192
It can't be any worse than that time.

91
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,033
Were you in pain back then?

92
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,747
I don't remember.

93
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,020
-Thank you.
-Come by again.

94
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:46,938
Hello.

95
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,481
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

96
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,484
This is the consent form
for the year-end sharing event.

97
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,987
Could you sign it, please?

98
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,697
-Hello.
-Hey.

99
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,741
-What's this?
-Here's a calendar for you.

100
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,034
Oh, really?

101
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,954
Do you have a bigger one?

102
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:07,000
They came in today. I'll give you
a big one when you come by next week.

103
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,293
-All right.
-And this…

104
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,252
Yes?

105
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,212
It's the year-end
sharing event consent form.

106
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,381
Could you sign it, please?

107
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,425
-I just need to sign it?
-Yes.

108
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,722
The pen doesn't work.

109
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,433
Gosh. You're right.

110
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,060
Hold on. I'm sure I have a pen.

111
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:26,978
Thank you.

112
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,351
AHN SU-YEONG

113
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,900
<i>You took the day off.</i>

114
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,653
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

115
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,587
I'm sorry for calling you
when you're busy.

116
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,588
That's fine.

117
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:37,966
Whose house is this?

118
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,926
And why is your car smashed?

119
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,932
You're quite a handful, aren't you?

120
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,978
It's Sang-su's home address.

121
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,732
I don't think I should go there, so…

122
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,907
Where should I drop it off
after fixing it?

123
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,368
My house. Thanks, Hyeok-jin.

KCU BANK

<i>Your cousin is outside.</i>

126
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,099
-How did you know?
-Know what?

127
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,272
How do you know his face
when I've never introduced you two?

128
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,616
Hyeok-jin. Do you know who that is?

129
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,512
<i>Your father found out</i>

130
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,475
<i>that Mr. So's father</i>
<i>had been in prison for fraud.</i>

131
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,775
He was your first boyfriend,
so your father was concerned.

132
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,277
He said the one thing

133
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,780
he'd never condone was
you dating the son of an ex-convict.

134
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,864
So?

135
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,034
So what did you do?

136
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,000
I met with Mr. So…

137
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,296
and told him to break up with you.

138
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,970
Did he say nothing about this?

139
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,555
Wake up and eat this.

140
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,933
I brought you some food
from a wedding reception.

141
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,898
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

142
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,401
A breakup is nothing special.

143
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,862
Everyone has their share
of ups and downs when they date.

144
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,782
You're only hurting yourself.

145
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,660
I can guarantee you
that she's doing just fine.

146
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,243
Do people know that we work our fingers
to the bone at the end of the year

147
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,078
just to roll these calendars?

148
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,373
It's not just my fingers.

149
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:44,337
I suffer from several herniated discs
in my neck and back.

150
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,380
And my hip joints are killing me too.

151
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,634
Can we just roll ten more
and call it a day?

152
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,595
This isn't enough.
We'll run out before noon.

153
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,680
Let's roll 30 more before we leave.

154
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,184
We're overworking ourselves.

155
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,812
Why can't these come
rolled up in the first place?

156
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,816
I can't believe I'm doing this
instead of going home.

157
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:10,863
I'm sure we'll reminisce
about these moments when we look back.

158
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,407
I've made enough memories already.

159
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,660
It's the worst timing ever.

160
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,621
Mr. Yang and Mr. So aren't here.

161
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,041
Ms. Park is away,
and Ms. Ahn took the day off.

162
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,295
Had I known this would happen,
I would've taken the day off too.

SECTION CHIEF
HA SANG-SU

165
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,203
Can I see you for a minute?
I have something to give you.

166
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,626
What's wrong with your voice?

167
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,937
Are you sick?

168
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,775
No, I'm fine.

169
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,158
Can I come inside for a bit?

170

172
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,630
Excuse me.

173
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,425
My friend was in the rain yesterday.

174
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,179
She needs a fever reducer
and some cold medicine.

175
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,732
<i>Each of us</i>
<i>was in pain for different reasons.</i>

176
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,405
<i>It was such a long night for all of us.</i>

177
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,913
<i>We may have looked back on our past.</i>

178
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,209
Here you go.

179
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,756
<i>We may have been afraid</i>
<i>of what was to come.</i>

180
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,058
<i>That night, we may have</i>
<i>swallowed everything…</i>

181
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,436
<i>silently.</i>

182
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,537
<i>I quietly told myself…</i>

183
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,548
<i>"It's nothing special."</i>

184
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,929
<i>"It's just love."</i>

185
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,436
<i>"The most common thing of all."</i>

186
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,274
<i>"Love."</i>

187
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,622
<i>It probably won't taste good.</i>

COLD MEDICINE

189
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,156
<i>The veranda looked empty.</i>

190
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,648
How was the subbranch?

191
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,444
It felt nice to visit my university again.

192
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,321
But it made me feel old.

193
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,449
Oh, okay.

194
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,136
You can at least say hi to me.

195
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,476
Did you see the announcement
about personnel appointments?

196
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,105
So?

197
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,149
Are you finally leaving?

198
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,693
No, not me.

199
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,777
But Mr. Ma…

200
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:31,905
and Ms. Ahn are.

201
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,372
It's not a joke.

GENERAL CONSULTATION TEAM
SINDO BRANCH

204
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,218
No way.

205
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,847
Ms. Ahn's going to the Sindo branch
as a General Consultation Team member.

206
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,140
Gosh, you're right.

207
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,643
Su-yeong! Congratulations!

208
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,229
Thank you.

209
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,732
The position transfer
is worth celebrating,

210
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,027
but they want her to start next week.

211
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,280
They want her to transfer
before the year ends.

212
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,994
By the way, where's Mr. Ma?

213
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,926
I mean, why me of all people?

214
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,470
It should be Seok-hyeon
or Gyeong-pil, the troublemakers.

215
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,846
Why did it have to be me?

216
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:43,060
A branch transfer is something
that's bound to happen to any of us.

217
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,771
Don't cry over it.

218
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,565
Aren't you sad
that I won't be here anymore?

219
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,526
Do you even love me?

220
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:54,613
I think we could get married.

221
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:58,784
Really?

222
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,372
And I also think we could break up.

223
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:10,128
Where we work doesn't play a part
in either of those outcomes.

224
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,382
Let's go.

225
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,510
By the way, that wasn't a proposal.

226
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,763
Yes, it was.

227
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,150
Are you feeling better?

228
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,530
Yes.

229
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,372
Congratulations on the position transfer.

230
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:49,710
Thank you.

231
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,052
And thank you for yesterday.

232
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,066
Are you free this weekend?

233
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,658
I'll treat you to a meal.

234
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:28,665
For taking care of me yesterday
and to celebrate my position transfer.

235
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:45,599
Have you checked the savings product
that the vice president proposed?

236
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,018
Suggest it to those
looking into savings products

237
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,978
and fill your quota.

238
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,607
Also, there's been a few
sudden personnel transfers,

239
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,025
so stay focused.

240
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,861
As for the people leaving…

241
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,409
Goodbye. That'll be all.

242
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,170
Wait. Was that it?

243
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,091
How could he be so cold
when they've worked here for years?

244
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:26,056
Then should we have a get-together today?
A farewell party for Mr. Ma and Ms. Ahn?

245
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,269
What's with the reaction?

246
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,480
Was that silly to suggest
because you're all so busy?

247
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,776
I'm off to the subbranch.

248
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,069
Okay.

249
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,530
Let's get ready for work.

250
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,573
Let's go, Du-sik and Sang-su.

251
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,033
All right.

252
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,451
Jeez.

253
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,537
Gosh, you're all so cold-hearted.

254
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:54,126
Then should we have
our own farewell party for Su-yeong?

255
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,004
Ji-yun, where was that restaurant?

256
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,506
That expensive place with small portions.

257
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,174
Reserve a table. Dinner's on me.

258
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:02,551
-Okay?
-Okay.

259
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,096
Su-yeong. You can make it, right?

260
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,890
Yes.

261
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,575
SENIOR CLERK
AHN SU-YEONG

262

GENERAL CONSULTATION TEAM
SINDO BRANCH

263
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,752
-We're done.
-We're done.

264
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,919
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

265
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,722
My face doesn't look radiant.

266
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,768
I always have radiant skin
when Ms. Han takes care of me.

267
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:57,022
Why didn't you go there, then?
That was your go-to spa.

268
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,357
I won't go there anymore.

269
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,276
I can't.

270
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,111
Why not? Did you cause a scene?

271
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,198
Do I look like the type who'd do that?

272
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,787
This is what happens
when you have a daughter.

273
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,165
I lost a friend…

274
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,877
and my radiant skin.

275
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,427
How could Ji-yun not show up

276
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,639
when she was the one
who booked this place?

277
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:34,976
I guess it was too last-minute
for them to attend.

278
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,020
That's okay.

279
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,690
All right, Su-yeong.
What do you want to eat?

280
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:45,278
Order anything you want.
I'm free tonight. I can go home late.

281
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,796
So why did you do it?

282
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,927
I mean, it's as if you wanted
everyone to bad-mouth you.

283
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:20,063
There's something going on
between you and Sang-su, right?

284
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,986
Well, none of that matters now.

285
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,988
It's all in the past.

286
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,490
Why did it have to be
the Sindo branch, though?

287
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,035
That guy who recorded you works there.

288
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,204
Do you both work on the same team?

289
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,292
It's okay.

290
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,044
Really?

291
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:51,344
I'm used to people gossiping
and bad-mouthing me.

292
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,682
So that doesn't bother me.

293
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,942
Then what was difficult for you?

294
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,326
Su-yeong.

295
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,164
Don't repeat what you did here.

296
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:25,504
Nothing is worth protecting
at the expense of harming yourself.

297
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,967
That's what I've learned in life.

298
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,345
If you put yourself first,

299
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,140
then people won't look down on you.

300
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:51,238
Come on. Raise your glass.
Drink up and start fresh.

301
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,448
In any case,
you got the position transfer.

302
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,910
Good for you, Su-yeong.
I'm so proud of you.

303
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,370
Cheers.

304
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,964
Thank you for everything.

305
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,388
I did have a tough time at our bank.

306
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,268
But thanks to you…

307
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,230
there were moments of comfort.

308
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,989
That's enough.

309
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,410
I cry a lot when I'm drunk.

310
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:39,911
Stop it.

311
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,644
I wasn't going to come.

312
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,649
I don't understand you.

313
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,194
And I don't think I ever will.

314
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,781
But I still came

315
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:19,743
because this could be…

316
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,915
our last time seeing each other.

317
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,010
I really don't like you.

318
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,105
Thank you for everything.

319
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,029
And I'm sorry, Mi-gyeong.

320
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:22,847
MY PERSON

321
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,980
HYEOK-JIN

322
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,318
Hey, Hyeok-jin.

323
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:38,905
<i>Your car has been repaired.</i>
<i>Should I call the dealer myself?</i>

324
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,866
No.

325
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,577
I'll take care of it.

326
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,082
I should be the one to take care of it.

327
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,170
TONGYEONG

328
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,604
FOR LEASE

329
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,069
What's that sign?

330
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,118
We had the place listed.

331
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,662
Why all of a sudden?

332
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,544
Your mom said you wanted
to go back to Tongyeong.

333
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,049
You're closing the store
because of what I said?

334
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,134
I didn't really mean it.

335
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,219
I know.

336
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,181
But we're still leaving.

337
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,934
We already spoke with the landlord.

338
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,524
Why?

339
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,490
You didn't listen
when I told you to leave before.

340
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,163
Seoul is…

341
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,541
too cold for us, Su-yeong.

342
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,587
Do you want to eat?

343
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,166
AHN SU-YEONG

344
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,211
<i>Let's meet here at 7:00 p.m.</i>

345
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,817
I told you he stopped coming here.

346
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,822
He's not answering his phone.

347
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,007
Jong-hyeon, someone's here to see you.

348
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,550
She's really pretty.

349
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,654
You're obviously disappointed.

350
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,406
I told you not to come here.

351
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,659
I only came to give you this.

352
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,748
Is it over between you two?

353
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,710
She even gave back your stuff.

354
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,550
It's all for the best.

355
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,763
How did she look?

356
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,563
Did she look okay?

357
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,192
She looked totally fine.

358
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,571
And she looked totally happy.

359
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:04,582
POLICE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

360
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:42,203
<i>I think I'll do better on the exam</i>
<i>if you take the photo.</i>

361
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,040
I'm going to take it now.

362
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,510
Can you promise me one thing?

363
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,976
No matter what happens…

364
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:10,690
promise me
that you won't give up on the exam.

365
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,902
What's going to happen?

366
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,618
Nothing specific. I'm just saying.

367
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,294
<i>Promise me you won't give up.</i>

368
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,239
I don't care about the price.
Please sell it right away.

369
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,742
It's a new car with low mileage.

370
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,495
If you give me some time,
I could sell it for higher.

371
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:52,208
I just want to get rid of it
as soon as possible.

372
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:53,960
Yes, ma'am.

373
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,384
MY PERSON

374
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,142
Sang-su. Can I see you right now?

375
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,982
Just for a minute. It won't take long.

376
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,859
It's just that…

377
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,572
I'm here to see your father.

378
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,162
Why don't you join me?

379
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,248
No, thank you.

380
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:36,293
Mr. Yuk called me
and asked that I deliver this form.

381
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:42,967
Do you really think I called
your branch manager on a weekend

382
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,136
just for that form?

383
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,978
I'll take out a loan in the first quarter
to help you with your performance.

384
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:58,774
And I'd like to meet your mother
around that time as well.

385
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,047
I heard you didn't make the cut
for HQ transfer last time.

386
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,132
It'll work out next time.

387
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,217
Right.

388
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,261
Where do you want
your newlywed home to be?

389
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,889
Mi-gyeong's current place isn't bad.

390
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,351
-I--
-We're not…

391
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,816
getting married.

392
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,279
Then how long
is this dating nonsense going to last?

393
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,530
I told you before.

394
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,076
I'll decide when to get married.

395
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,787
-You…
-So don't call him like this ever again.

396
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,292
Do you feel the same way?

397
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:03,214
I'm sorry, sir.

398
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,351
I slept well last night.

399
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,190
To be honest, I didn't sleep well…

400
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,151
when we were dating.

401
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,158
I was afraid that we'd break up.

402
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:40,960
It wasn't like breaking up
would be the end of the world.

403
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,297
But I had foolish thoughts like that.

404
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:58,185
But yesterday, I slept well
without taking any sleeping pills.

405
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,969
Let's decide with this coin.

406
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,556
Do you remember this?

407
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,850
I picked it up around here.

408
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:47,193
I took it from your house a long time ago,
but you didn't even notice, did you?

409
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,115
Here. Look.

410
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:56,577
If it's heads…

411
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,500
then…

412
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,181
let's break up.

413
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:28,901
But if it's tails,
then let's do as my dad said.

414
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:33,697
Our parents will meet next year,
and we'll get married.

415
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,458
Heads.

416
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,593
Let's break up.

417
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,945
Say whatever you want to me.

418
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,658
You deserve that much.

419
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:02,661
You're wrong.

420
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,918
In a relationship, the one who has
the right to do anything they want

421
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,255
is the one who's being loved.

422
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,385
My name is pretty common.

423
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,221
And 500-won coins are even more common.

424
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:31,732
From now on,
whenever you hear the name "Mi-gyeong"

425
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,651
or see a 500-won coin…

426
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,614
you'll feel bad for me.

427
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,870
Are you hypnotizing me?

428
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:48,624
No, I'm cursing you.

429
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:59,468
That'll be your punishment.

430
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:10,938
Despite all that…

431
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,403
I was happy.

432
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,616
I felt hurt and went through a rough time.

433
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:30,916
But I still liked it.

434
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,633
Thank you, Sang-su.

435
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,689
Goodbye.

436
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,359
Why did you want to meet here?

437
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,029
Just because.

438
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:36,453
I was curious
since I always left without eating.

439
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:49,257
But this place doesn't seem special.
They just have expensive food.

440
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,314
That day…

441
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:13,156
The first time you wanted us to meet here…

442
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,957
What did you want to tell me?

443
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,605
That I liked you.

444
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,823
That I wanted to ask you out.

445
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:09,504
That I want to be your lover.

446
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,180
<i>I've never been here before.</i>

447
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:07,187
I come here
when I'm going through a rough patch.

448
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,064
Why?

449
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:16,279
This place is centuries old.

450
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,994
It shows that everything will
work out in time if you stay strong.

451
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,041
It lets me know
that everything will eventually pass.

452
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,131
When was the last time you came here?

453
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:42,347
I don't remember.

454
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,077
I wonder if the people
who built that wall…

455
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:07,289
also dated and fell in love

456
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:09,374
and lived like us?

457
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:15,046
Those people
probably fought wars over love.

458
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,136
It's just love.

459
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,697
It's snowing.

460
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:44,993
It's the first snow.

461
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,580
It's pretty.

462
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,919
I thought you didn't like snow.

463
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,632
I guess I did.

464
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,979
What kind of happiness
do you wish for in the future?

465
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,408
That plant you left on my veranda…

466
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,703
Its flower meaning is "future happiness."

467
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:35,919
Jeez. You didn't know?

468
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,675
I just picked
the prettiest one at the flower shop.

469
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,724
I'm not sure.

470
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:54,020
A stable, constant life.

471
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,650
I used to think that was true happiness.

472
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:03,613
I was content

473
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,908
if today was better than yesterday.

474
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,206
Just like your name?

475
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,506
What about you?

476
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:39,399
I think it's the word "happiness"
that makes people feel miserable.

477
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:44,529
I mean…

478
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,327
don't we all live like this?

479
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,372
Bearing our own misfortunes.

480
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,884
But I'm going to pursue
my future happiness from now on.

481
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,224
I'm going to put my feelings…

482
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,354
and happiness first.

483
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,273
Are you starting work
at the Sindo branch on Monday?

484
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:04,943
Of course.

485
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:11,825
Get home safely.

486
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,828
Can I still call you?

487
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:22,085
You always call,
even when I tell you not to.

488
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:26,923
You always come to see me too.

489
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:40,437
Don't get out. I'll see you off today.

490
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,682
-Hello.
-Hey.

491
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:55,530
Why did she…

492
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:04,831
Sang-su, why don't you answer your phone?
I wanted you to pick up some coffee.

493
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,585
I didn't know my phone was off.

494
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,545
Make sure to charge your phone.

495
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,423
Now that Mr. Ma is gone,
you need to answer my calls.

496
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:14,382
Yes, sir.

497
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:16,175
I'll buy some later.

498
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:29,314
Hello?

499
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:31,482
Sorry?

500
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:35,612
I see.

501
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:44,954
Ms. Ahn didn't show up
at the Sindo branch.

502
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,126
Ms. Seo.

503
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:54,714
The new senior clerk
found this in Ms. Ahn's locker.

504
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,052
What is that?

505
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:01,471
She resigned?

506
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,598
Why?

507
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,851
She finally got to transfer.
Why would she do this?

508
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,564
Are you serious, Su-yeong?

509
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:15,318
I knew it. Something felt off.

510
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:18,154
Good morning.

511
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,323
It's only a good morning for you.

512
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,699
What is that?

513
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:27,997
The oyster <i>gukbap</i> place has been replaced
by a chicken soup restaurant.

514
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,332
So they gave us rice cakes.

515
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,845
I'm going to put my feelings…

516
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,183
and happiness first.

517
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:51,896
Don't get out. I'll see you off today.

518
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,496
-Is this it?
-Yes. Close it.

519
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:40,588
AHN SU-YEONG

520
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:50,223
<i>You have reached a number</i>
<i>that is no longer in service.</i>

521
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:37,895
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

522
01:12:57,582 --> 01:13:02,587
