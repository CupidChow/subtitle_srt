1
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:49,925
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

2
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:03,855
It feels nice…

3
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,818
to be here with you.

4
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,826
Stop drinking.

5
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,037
You had soju, beer, and wine.
You have work tomorrow.

6
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,291
Sang-su.

7
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,168
Tell me more about yourself.

8
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,170
Like what?

9
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,049
Just anything related to you.

10
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,553
It could even be
about your military service.

11
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,930
That's ridiculous.

12
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,100
Why? I'm curious.

13
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,062
I want to know about your childhood.

14
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,816
I also want to know what you liked
and what your dreams were.

15
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,486
Are you a kid? Who talks about dreams?

16
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,158
Why do you sound like you're done living?

17
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,702
I wonder whom you take after.

18
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,790
My mom.

19
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:05,959
Your mother?

20
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,214
I'm curious about
what kind of person she is.

21
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,719
My mom is…

22
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,222
a strong woman.

23
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,355
She's as solid as a rock.

24
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,943
Sometimes, my mom
feels like a daughter to me.

25
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:36,114
As I got older, she became younger.

26
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,786
You're lucky to have such a strong mother.

27
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,164
That's why I worried about her.

28
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,461
I had no idea when she was struggling

29
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,672
or when she was in pain.

30
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,552
Even when my father passed away,

31
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,098
she never cried in front of me.

32
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,853
She kept it all to herself.

33
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,107
She's like you.

34
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,276
You're like that too, you know.

35
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,405
Am I?

36
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:26,623
I wish you could act
like a seven-year-old in front of me.

37
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,668
Someone who throws tantrums…

38
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,797
and can be honest with me
about everything.

39
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,968
Unlike what you think,

40
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,098
I'm not that nice of a person.

41
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,732
Unlike what you think,

42
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,152
I'm not that nice either.

43
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,370
EPISODE 8

44
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,798
Hurry up.

45
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,301
Su-yeong.

46
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,679
I don't think this is right.

47
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,891
-I'll just--
-You spent your security deposit.

48
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,936
My house will be better
than a tiny studio room.

49
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,357
Or am I the issue?

50
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,820
Come on.

51
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,089
It's 1031.

52
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,841
What?

53
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,968
The passcode.

54
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,637
Right.

55
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,522
Come on in.

56
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,875
Sit on the sofa for a minute.

57
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:35,961
Okay.

58
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,024
Let me help.

59
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,651
It's not heavy. Just stay put.

60
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:09,911
Here. Let me.

61
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:12,914
Thanks.

62
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,709
Can you take it to the veranda?

63
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,751
Sure.

64
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,925
-What about this?
-Give it to me.

65
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,429
Let me.

66
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,639
Can you take it to the bedroom?

67
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,959
The room is pretty small, isn't it?

68
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,711
Not at all.

69
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,299
Those…

70
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,681
I brought them from your old place.

71
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,392
I thought you'd forgotten them.

72
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,687
Thank you.

73
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,570
I'm going to wash up.
Take your time unpacking.

74
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,435
Hey, why are you awake?

75
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,187
When did you go home?

76
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,773
<i>I just got in.</i>

77
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,484
Did you put a security camera in my house?

78
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,029
How did you know?

79
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,907
You should be asleep.

80
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,077
I can't sleep, now that you're gone.

81
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,873
Don't expect a lullaby from me.

82
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,670
What am I going to do?

83
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,714
-I have a problem.
<i>-What is it?</i>

84
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,387
Sang-su, I miss you.

85
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,479
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

86
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,817
Forget it.

87
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,197
Take a hangover cure before going to bed.

88
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,284
Okay. Good night. See you tomorrow.

89
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,785
Bye.

90
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,656
Did I take too long?

91
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,700
No.

92
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,037
You must be tired. Go wash up.

93
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,372
Okay.

94
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,754
I'm going to bed then.

95
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,298
Okay. Good night.

96
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,863
<i>INTRODUCTION TO POLICE STUDIES</i>

97
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,298
Sang-su.

98
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,759
I missed you too much.

99
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,512
Hey. You…

100
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:54,691
I'm not…

101
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,528
going home tonight.

102
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,364
You're up.

103
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,296
Why did you get up so early?

104
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,216
What?

105
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,261
Well, you were snoring.

106
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,973
Come on. I don't snore!

107
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,099
Let's eat.

108
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,643
Did I really snore?

109
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,937
What are you doing?

110
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,606
I'm making breakfast. I'm almost done.

111
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,370
I want to listen to some music.

112
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,872
Wait, why isn't it working?

113
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,543
This happens sometimes.

114
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:23,381
Your car engine stalled last time.
Maybe it's time you get a new car.

115
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,609
I'm going to join a study group.

116
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,446
Wouldn't an academy be more helpful?

117
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,449
I already learned everything
from the academy.

118
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,828
I want to plan out a schedule
and interact with other test takers too.

119
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,374
Su-yeong.

120
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,501
You should go in first.

121
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,795
Why?

122
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:07,175
It'll be uncomfortable if people see us.

123
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,514
Okay, then. I'll go in first.

124
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:23,774
Hello.

125
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,443
-Hello.
-Hello.

126
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,611
Goodness.

127
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,740
Youngpo branch's
first official couple has arrived.

128
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,368
Thank you. We'll be good to each other.

129
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,703
Congratulations.

130
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,081
Congratulations.

131
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,082
Please stop.

132
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,001
-How could I?
-Please.

133
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,753
Congratulations.

134
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:48,591
What if you two get married
before Mr. Yang does?

135
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,093
Don't make me go
to two weddings in one day.

136
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,387
Let me know your dates in advance.

137
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,389
Stop teasing us.

138
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,017
Mr. Ma, I thought
you were interested in Ms. Park.

139
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,811
Gosh. You're so nonchalant about this.

140
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,230
You really are.

141
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,273
When did I ever say--

142
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,569
Why would you say that?
I'm just trying to congratulate these two.

143
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,656
Everyone, clear your schedules
for this evening.

144
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,117
Mr. Yang wants to treat us
to a meal before he gets married.

145
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,455
I know you're all busy, but please come.

146
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,414
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

147
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,833
-Thanks in advance for dinner!
-It's his treat.

148
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,877
I can't wait to have some beef tonight.

149
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,587
Good morning.

150
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,464
-My gosh.
-It's been a long time.

151
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,300
Look who it is.

152
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,885
How was your vacation?

153
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,639
Did you go somewhere amazing?

154
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,599
Yes. I'm sorry
I was away longer than expected.

155
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,142
Don't be sorry.

156
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:44,272
While you were gone,
I replaced the ticket paper,

157
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,816
made coffee for our customers,

158
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,403
and fixed the ATM machine
every time it malfunctioned.

159
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,488
You don't have to feel sorry about that.

160
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,823
Mr. Ma.

161
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,200
About the meeting materials…

162
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,370
Mr. Jeong.

163
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,873
Next time, just tell me
if you'll be away for this long again.

164
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:03,958
I will, sir.

165
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,461
Good morning, sir.

166
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,090
How was your leave, Mr. Yuk?

167
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,883
Mr. Ma, Mr. Yuk is here.

168
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,889
Let's start our monthly meeting
in half an hour.

169
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,613
Are you going to make coffee?

170
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:36,490
I'll do it for you.

171
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,410
-No, I can do it.
-Let me.

172
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,891
Congratulations…

173
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,228
on your new relationship.

174
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,149
Right.

175
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,735
Thank you.

176
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,365
It seems like everyone knows about it.

177
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,870
Yes, it just kind of happened that way.

178
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,587
Here you go.

179
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,551
Okay. Thank you.

180
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,564
Is Mr. Jeong not here either?

181
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,817
What is this about?

182
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,444
He was supposed to get my shoes repaired.

183
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,530
Here. Let me.

184
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,532
I'll take them.

185
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,744
Fine. Do as you please.

186
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,752
And, Mr. Ha?
I heard you're dating Ms. Park.

187
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:15,297
Since you went
out of your way to help Ms. Ahn,

188
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,718
I thought maybe
you were interested in her.

189
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,636
But I guess I was wrong.

190
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,555
Good luck.

191
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,100
We should play a round of golf
with President Park sometime.

192
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,946
What did he mean by that just now?

193
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,533
How did you go out of your way to help me?

194
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,621
I'm not sure what he meant either.

195
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,999
I'll take the shoes.

196
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,543
It's okay. I was going out anyway.

197
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,088
Thank you for the coffee.

198
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,024
Mr. So.

199
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,693
Yes, Ms. Ahn?

200
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,988
SEOK-HYEON AND JI-EUN

201
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,490
My gosh.

202
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,992
I can't believe you're getting married.

203
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:33,000
Why does the groom-to-be look so glum?

204
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,378
I called her Jeong-eun by mistake.

205
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,422
-Three times.
-You lunatic.

206
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,216
Jeez.

207
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,095
It's difficult to break a four-year habit.

208
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:51,143
I know I should marry Ji-eun,
but why do I still miss Jeong-eun?

209
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,978
Is it even right to get married?

210
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,732
Why is life so tough?

211
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:01,153
How is life tough for you?
You got a house without taking out a loan.

212
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,238
Darn it.

213
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,115
Auntie, can we get some more side dishes?

214
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,158
Sure.

215
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,287
Go on ahead.

216
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,789
What about you?

217
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,291
I need to get Mr. Yuk's shoes repaired.

218
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,669
He hasn't learned his lesson, has he?

219
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,587
-We'll go ahead.
-Bye.

220
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,588
Bye.

221
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,218
What a relief.
Sang-su, are you free right now?

222
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,387
-What?
-Watch my shop while I'm gone.

223
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,596
-Hurry up.
-What?

224
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,348
-Gosh.
-But ma'am…

225
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,307
Hey.

226
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,768
-Here. Take this.
-Ma'am?

227
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,103
I'm in a hurry.

228
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,730
You don't need to sell anything.
Just keep watch.

229
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:37,690
-Okay?
-But I--

230
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,983
-Thanks!
-But ma'am…

231
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,025
Goodness!

232
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,028
But…

233
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,782
What am I…

234
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,837
How much is this?

235
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,299
Do you mean the mackerel?

236
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,137
That'd be 5,000 won.

237
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,015
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

238
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,773
I'll take two of these.

239
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,443
Okay. That'll be 10,000 won.

240
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,819
Okay, I'll take them.

241
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,412
No, please clean and gut them first.

242
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,416
Then would you mind waiting about an hour?

243
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,169
The owner is away at the moment.

244
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,795
It doesn't have to be perfect.

245
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,590
Well…

246
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:53,140
<i>Mr. Ha is the reason why</i>
<i>Mr. Yuk got disciplined.</i>

247
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,479
Mr. Yuk probably feels betrayed by him.

248
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,440
He trusted Mr. Ha
to manage General Affairs,

249
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,777
but who knew he'd go that far to help you?

250
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:14,078
I hope you don't feel
uncomfortable about this.

251
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,455
Well…

252
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,376
He would have done the same for anyone.

253
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,130
After all, he's just that kind of a guy.

254
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,397
My gosh.

255
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,815
I'll do it for you.

256
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,552
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

257
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,684
I didn't know you could do that.

258
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,728
I learned as a kid.

259
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,607
Thank you.

260
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:33,449
Mr. So told me
about how Mr. Yuk got disciplined.

261
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,373
It was all thanks to you.

262
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,254
Please don't feel uncomfortable.

263
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,216
I would've done the same for anyone.

264
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,052
I know.

265
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,849
You're a good man, Mr. Ha.

266
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,400
Here she comes.

267
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,069
Thanks so much, Sang-su.

268
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,947
Ma'am, I sold two mackerels.

269
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,283
Did you? I'm so proud of you.

270
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,619
Here, go get yourselves
some iced Americanos.

271
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,162
-No, it's okay.
-My gosh.

272
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,121
No, really.

273
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,957
Just take it and buy some coffee.

274
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,931
Get married
instead of working for chump change.

275
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,392
I don't want to.

276
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,438
Your mom was your age when she had you.

277
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,232
Exactly.

278
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,734
Does she look happy to you?

279
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,613
My goodness. Who says I'm not happy?

280
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,033
I have a boyfriend.

281
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,661
You do?

282
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:03,497
Did you hear that? She's dating.

283
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,710
Who is he? Is he good enough?

284
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:18,470
You've never acknowledged me,
and I get that you don't trust me.

285
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,306
But I decide whom I date.

286
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,562
I have somewhere to be.

287
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,197
Look into it.

288
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,284
Into what?

289
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,996
We should at least know
what he does for a living.

290
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,963
Miss, I need more cold water here.

291
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,217
-Gosh!
-Goodness!

292
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,011
-Goodness!
-They're here!

293
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,265
This is my fiancée, Choi Ji-eun.

294
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,101
-You guys look good together.
-Nice to meet you, Ji-eun.

295
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,770
-Sit down.
-Please sit.

296
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,242
Look for a charging station.

297
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,745
LOOK FOR A CHARGING STATION

298
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,081
FIRST GARDEN PARKING LOT
EV CHARGING STATION

299
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,232
I wonder what I should get her.

300
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,194
MY PERSON

301
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,460
<i>Enjoy your dinner. I'll be studying hard.</i>

302
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,047
<i>I'll make dinner for you.</i>

303
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,945
Why are you out here?

304
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:41,863
Because I'm too full.

305
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,158
What about you?

306
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,203
It's too noisy in there.

307
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,039
I agree. It's pretty noisy.

308
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,589
Did something happen yesterday?

309
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,596
You suddenly got out of the car,

310
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,974
so I was worried.

311
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,019
Ms. Park as well.

312
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,326
I heard Mr. Yang
has been with her for a long time.

313
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,911
But they still look lovey-dovey.

314
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,205
I heard they dated for over four years.

315
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,625
That's actually a different woman.

316
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,254
Then who is this woman?

317
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,634
They met through their parents,
who know each other well.

318
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,138
Their parents, I see.

319
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,102
I guess that's marriage.

320
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:01,193
You need to marry someone
similar to you if you want to be happy.

321
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,323
That's why I understand.

322
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,368
Mr. Yang?

323
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,453
No, you.

324
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,503
So you don't have to feel sorry anymore.

325
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,550
And don't worry about me even
if I suddenly leave again like yesterday.

326
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:30,305
And don't get on Mr. Yuk's bad side.

327
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:36,853
There she is.

328
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,439
The person you should worry about.

329
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,782
I'll go inside first.
You should come in with her.

330
00:31:58,792 --> 00:31:59,709
Sang-su.

331
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,629
I thought you couldn't come.

332
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,258
I had to charge my car,

333
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,386
so I wanted to see you
and get recharged myself.

334
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,097
Is something going on?

335
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,352
My dad wants me to find
a prospective partner.

336
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,693
Speaking of which, let's--

337
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,611
Mi-gyeong.

338
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:28,697
I'm not sure…

339
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:30,907
Do you not want to?

340
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,745
It's just too sudden.

341
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:36,705
Sang-su.

342
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,042
Let's…

343
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,089
SANG-SU, YOU FOOL

344
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,844
Let's go play golf, silly.

345
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,019
Did I scare you?

346
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,312
SANG-SU, YOU FOOL

347
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,236
Are you sulking?

348
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,155
Why would I sulk?

349
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,117
What is it?
Did you think I was proposing to you?

350
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,077
You got ahead of yourself.

351
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,705
I don't feel that strongly about you yet.

352
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,248
I didn't say anything.

353
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,169
But did you have to invite me
to play golf in that way?

354
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,046
It was fun.

355
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,925
Would you like me to propose to you?

356
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,843
No, thanks.

357
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:39,100
The loser pays for the membership here.
If you're not confident, go take a lesson.

358
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,636
-Jong-hyeon.
-Yes?

359
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,472
I'm stuck on number two.

360
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,521
Hold on.

361
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,524
Let's see.

362
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,027
Take a look here.

363
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:34,447
It'll be easier if you understand
the concept first.

364
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,451
You're incredible.

365
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,411
No, I'm not.

366
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,371
You know all the answers.

367
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,959
-Can I ask you another question?
-Sure.

368
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,170
Do you have a girlfriend?

369
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,966
Yes, I do.

370
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,303
Is she pretty?

371
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,680
Yes. Totally.

372
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,100
I knew it.

373
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:12,527
<i>Will you be done soon?</i>
<i>I'm making something tasty.</i>

374
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,708
Why did you run?
You could've taken your time.

375
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,960
Why are you out here?

376
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,505
No reason.

377
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,550
Are you hungry? I made something tasty.

378
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,595
But you already had dinner.

379
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,305
I could fix myself a simple meal.

380
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:26,101
I guess you didn't know,
but I love cooking.

381
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,580
Look who's here.

382
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,958
It's Mr. Ha,
whom I beat at golf yesterday.

383
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,377
I didn't lose to you.

384
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,463
You only won because
I took that bunker shot for you.

385
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,840
I never asked you to.

386
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,844
Are you free today?

387
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,554
Today? Why?

388
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,223
It's important. Come with me.

389
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,071
Su-yeong.

390
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,198
Are you free today?

391
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:23,742
What is it?

392
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,661
The tufting workshop
said we could pick up our projects.

393
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,122
I can't go today,

394
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,208
so could you pick it up
and drop by my house this evening?

395
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,671
Why? Do you have plans?

396
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:39,924
No, I can go.

397
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:40,967
Thanks.

398
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:49,434
<i>Su-yeong, I made some seaweed soup.</i>

399
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,144
<i>Do you want to stop by for lunch?</i>

400
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,245
Go see a doctor.

401
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,581
I'm okay.

402
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,249
It's bothering me.

403
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,126
Eat up.

404
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,089
I didn't prepare a cake
because I didn't want to go overboard.

405
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,766
Thank you for the meal.

406
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,978
Happy birthday, Su-yeong.

407
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,708
Do you like it?

408
00:38:56,668 --> 00:39:00,547
Yes. It's so pretty
that I could hang it on a wall.

409
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,059
<i>Hey, Su-yeong.</i>

410
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,896
Jong-hyeon, will you be
coming home late today?

411
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,316
<i>Yes, I'm afraid I'm a bit busy today.</i>

412
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,902
<i>Why? Is something going on?</i>

413
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,075
Never mind.

414
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:32,412
I'm stopping by Ms. Park's house,
so I'll be late too.

415
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,054
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

416
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,518
Did you think I didn't know?

417
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:56,895
We planned this together.

418
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,772
Happy birthday, Ms. Ahn.

419
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,733
Sang-su is here too.

420
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,944
Since we're both couples,
let's celebrate together.

421
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:06,779
Come in.

422
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,533
Right. Here you go.

423
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:18,082
Welcome, everyone. Come in.

424
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,011
-Thank you.
-No problem.

425
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,272
Ta-da.

426
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,024
It's your birthday gift.

427
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:47,487
I ordered all the food,
but Sang-su and I handpicked this.

428
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,117
What's going on?
How did you know it was my birthday?

429
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,995
I even know
Mr. Yuk and Mr. Noh's birthdays.

430
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,290
I don't like it, but I know many things.

431
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,919
Is this why you said you were busy today?

432
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,421
I'm sorry. I had to keep it a secret.

433
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:10,468
I told him to be careful
and not get caught.

434
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,303
Thank you, everyone.

435
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,473
You too, Mr. Ha.

436
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,059
Don't mention it. I didn't do much.

437
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,062
Why don't you go change clothes
if you're uncomfortable?

438
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,855
Your clothes are in the drawer.

439
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,191
No, I'm okay.

440
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,404
I need to go to the bathroom.

441
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,740
Mr. Jeong, eat up.

442
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:33,783
Okay.

443
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,852
Su-yeong. What are you doing here?

444
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,481
How intriguing.

445
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:20,872
Here.

446
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,499
-Thank you.
-No problem.

447
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,878
Who asked whom out first?

448
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,381
I did. I tried hard to win her heart.

449
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,717
Gosh, that's so brave of you
as a younger man.

450
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,595
What do you like so much about her?

451
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,638
Everything.

452
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:41,142
I'm impressed, Mr. Jeong.

453
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:46,022
Sang-su, you could learn
a few things from him.

454
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,039
Su-yeong, isn't this your favorite wine?

455
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,084
Yes, it is.

456
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,379
The painting in the bathroom--

457
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,631
Did you notice?

458
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:15,426
I couldn't get it off my mind
ever since we saw it.

459
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,096
I thought it'd look nice there,
so I bought it.

460
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,681
It blends in well, right?

461
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,562
Yes. It does.

462
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:34,737
Mr. Jeong, I bet
you were popular in college.

463
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:35,863
Am I right?

464
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:39,242
No, there weren't many people
my age in my class.

465
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,577
Why not? What was your major?

466
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:42,870
Industrial Agriculture.

467
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,873
I operated cultivators
and tractors during class.

468
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:46,874
I also farmed.

469
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,043
Gosh, that's so interesting.

470
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,590
It was so difficult to stay awake
during our classes.

471
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:59,137
Theories of Business Management,
Accounting, and Organizational Behavior.

472
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,640
What was the other one? The hardest class.

473
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,143
Commercial Law.

474
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:09,063
I really hated that class.

475
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:12,441
I don't think I can ever go back
and study in college again.

476
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,653
Then why do you want
to become a police officer?

477
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,114
It's not related to your major.

478
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,659
I went to a nearby school
because of my grades, but my dream…

479
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,329
-My dream was to be a police officer.
-I see.

480
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:27,665
Right.

481
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,001
How did you do on the exam?

482
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,128
I've been rooting for you.

483
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,220
I didn't pass.

484
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:44,849
Goodness.

485
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,770
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

486
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,192
He was just short of a few points.

487
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,485
He'll make it next time.

488
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,072
Right. I definitely will, next time.

489
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,119
Mr. Jeong, have some of this.

490
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,747
It's from the best restaurant
in this neighborhood.

491
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:09,957
Okay. Thank you.

492
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:13,628
Su-yeong, have some.

493
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,756
You should have some too.

494
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,054
You seem awfully quiet today.

495
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:25,014
What?

496
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:29,185
That's not true.
You know I'm not much of a talker.

497
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:34,607
See? He's so different from Mr. Jeong.

498
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,400
Imagine how bored I am.

499
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,323
You should have some too.

500
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,245
Seeing you two together like this,

501
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:53,042
I finally get why our elders talk about
having babies to good-looking couples.

502
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,835
You guys look great together.

503
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:56,754
Don't you agree?

504
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,383
Yes. You're right.

505
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:04,136
You too.

506
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,180
You suit each other.

507
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:08,599
Really?

508
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,656
I packed this earlier.
Have it as a late-night snack.

509
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,741
Happy birthday once again.

510
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,660
Thank you for today.

511
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,955
-Let me carry that.
-It's okay. It's not heavy.

512
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,499
You have a lot to carry.

513
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:38,671
Don't you live in the same neighborhood?
Sang-su, why don't you drop them off?

514
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,048
Okay, I will.

515
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,385
That's okay. We can just go by ourselves.

516
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,054
It'll be faster than taking a bus.
Let him drive you.

517
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:49,473
-Here's the car key.
-Thanks.

518
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,644
Let's do this every now and then.
I had so much fun today.

519
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,938
Thank you for dinner tonight.

520
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,023
My pleasure.

521
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:06,991
Here. Let me.

522
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,579
-I'm fine, really.
-But I'm not.

523
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,008
We can go home on our own.

524
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,762
You have a lot to carry. Let me drive you.

525
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,640
We have something to discuss
on our way home anyway.

526
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,519
All right, then.

527
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,649
Thank you for today. I'll see you at work.

528
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:43,360
Okay. Goodbye.

529
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,447
-See you.
-Let's go.

530
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,366
<i>You guys look great together.</i>

531
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:35,454
-Don't you agree?
-Yes. You're right.

532
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,526
Su-yeong, are you done washing up?

533
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,069
Yes, I am.

534
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:09,780
Come over here for a minute.

535
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:28,424
It feels so warm.

536
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,098
I'm not a kid.

537
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,976
I can dry my own hair.

538
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:41,645
Su-yeong.

539
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,273
Can you take tomorrow afternoon off?

540
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,233
Why?

541
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,570
It was your birthday today,
but we couldn't go on a date.

542
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,824
That's okay. We had a party.

543
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,544
What is this?

544
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:08,380
Your birthday gift.

545
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,144
I'll get you something nicer next year.

546
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,356
So let's go on a date tomorrow. Okay?

547
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,705
<i>You too.</i>

548
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,291
You suit each other.

549
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,690
Does it suit me?

550
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,942
Yes. It's pretty.

551
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,027
I know.

552
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,739
Go inside first.

553
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:22,121
Should we just tell everyone?

554
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:31,755
Should we tell them
like Ms. Park and Mr. Ha did?

555
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:33,924
No.

556
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,052
Why not?

557
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,849
We're not like Mr. Ha and Ms. Park.

558
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,563
What do you mean?

559
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:57,114
I don't want people
to talk behind our backs.

560
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,457
Should I give one to Mr. Jeong too?

561
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,292
That's a bit tricky.

562
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,419
Technically, he's not really one of us.

563
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,713
Come on. Who cares about that?

564
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,883
Hey. The more, the merrier.
What's the problem?

565
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,343
But it's a hotel wedding.

566
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:19,553
He might give you
some congratulatory money,

567
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,181
-but the meal cost will be higher.
-Jeez.

568
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,141
I'll just invite him.

569
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:31,690
Mr. Jeong.

570
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,235
Feel free to come.

571
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:36,487
Congratulations.

572
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,072
-Hello.
-Hello.

573
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,410
-Mr. Jeong.
-Yes, sir?

574
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,997
I'll clean it up.

575
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:52,002
Your job entails cleaning as well.
Always, before the customers arrive.

576
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,546
Yes, sir.

577
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,285
This is my workplace, Mom.
You can't just come here whenever.

578
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,580
Goodness. Don't get the wrong idea.

579
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:30,916
I'm here as your customer.

580
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,628
Okay, ma'am. How may I help you?

581
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,048
My daughter has a boyfriend.

582
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,175
Could you look into it?

583
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,386
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

584
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:46,473
That would be a breach of privacy,
so I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

585
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,933
Just tell me already!

586
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,769
Mom, do you really think I will?

587
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,357
No. Not at all.

588
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,317
Exactly.

589
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,153
Unbelievable.

590
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,614
Do you really even have one?

591
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:06,285
By any chance…

592
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,498
Does he work here?

593
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,960
Is he a colleague?

594
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,464
You know I'd never date a bank clerk.

595
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,007
Who is it, then?

596
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,343
Mom, try to maintain the dignity
that you're so fond of.

597
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,095
And respect my privacy, please.

598
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,572
Let's go. What do you want to do?

599
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,411
Let's go shopping.

600
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,413
Okay.

601
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,007
I don't need any clothes.

602
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:07,387
I just want to buy you one.
I didn't even get you a birthday gift.

603
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,640
But that was before we started dating.

604
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:12,768
And this shop is too expensive.

605
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,311
But still…

606
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:16,271
How about this?

607
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,401
Su-yeong, I'm really fine.

608
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,160
Are you mad?

609
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:31,787
Yes.

610
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,250
You can get me a gift next year.

611
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,210
No, I'm not getting you one.

612
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,547
Do you need a new fridge?

613
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,424
We're giving newlyweds a discount.

614
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,510
-Come take a look.
-We're not--

615
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,887
Goodness, are you not newlyweds?

616
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,517
Yes, we are. Please show us.

617
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,633
DISCOUNTED PRICE: 9,913,000 WON

618
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,844
Gosh, this is a lot of money.

619
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:31,972
Does it usually
cost this much to get married?

620
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,057
This is nothing.

621
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:37,144
This is only the price of electronics.

622
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,897
You need a house
and furniture to go with it.

623
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,692
And don't forget the wedding rings.

624
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,237
Getting married costs a lot.

625
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,825
I'm going to get a wedding ring
with a rock this big.

626
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,036
Does that even exist?

627
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,539
I'll have to tell my fiancé to find one.

628
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,088
Can you give me your hand?

629
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:23,148
What is this?

630
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,943
-A ring needs to sparkle.
-Hold on.

631
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:47,130
This is the biggest
and most radiant ring in the world.

632
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:51,718
Jeez.

633
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:01,353
I just came out.

634
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,653
I'll find out who he is at all costs.

635
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,240
Okay. I'll see you there.

636
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,533
Bye.

637
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,373
What's taking the driver
so long in the restroom?

638
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,001
He must be doing a number two.

639
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,299
Goodness, what should I do?

640
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,185
Oh, dear. What should I do?

641
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:45,564
Darn it.

642
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:48,525
Wait.

643
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,152
KCU BANK

644
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,824
Hey, can you follow that car?

645
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,660
-This car belongs to the bank.
-I'm your VIP customer.

646
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,662
I'm in a rush. Go, now!

647
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,205
That white car.

648
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:03,749
-Go!
-Yes, ma'am.

649
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,713
Can you go faster?

650
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:10,797
Stick close to it.

651
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,883
Gosh, I'm going to lose her.

652
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:18,346
Ma'am, may I ask
why you're tailing that car?

653
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,224
That's my daughter's car.

654
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,310
I'm her mom.

655
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,521
You know Ms. Park Mi-gyeong, right?

656
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:28,899
Yes, I do.

657
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,276
Are you two close at all?

658
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,987
Yes, we are.

659
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:38,533
Then do you know
who my daughter is dating?

660
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:43,580
Do you or don't you?

661
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:00,639
I'm sorry. I'm normally not this rude.

662
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,516
I apologize for my behavior.

663
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,600
It's okay, ma'am.

664
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:08,563
PARK MI-GYEONG

665
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:18,198
<i>Sang-su, I'm here. Hurry up. I miss you.</i>

666
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,744
<i>Hello?</i>

667
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,294
Okay.

668
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,714
What do your parents do for a living?

669
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,174
Mom?

670
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,388
My mom runs a small shop.

671
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,809
And my father passed away.

672
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:51,648
So she's a widow.

673
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,072
How did you two meet?

674
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:01,324
She just transferred to your branch.

675
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,410
We went to the same university.

676
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:07,664
You must be smart,
seeing how you attended that school.

677
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,333
Not at all, ma'am.

678
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,425
What are you good at?

679
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:21,178
Mom, this isn't an interview.

680
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:26,474
I believe that you can tell a lot
about a person by their hobbies.

681
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:31,521
Their hobbies tell you
how well-off and sophisticated they are.

682
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:35,233
He's good at everything.
Golfing, hiking, you name it.

683
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,736
He excels at all sports.

684
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,988
I wasn't asking you.

685
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,450
I enjoy playing ice hockey.

686
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,120
That's a great hobby.

687
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,540
That must mean you two skated together.

688
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:54,878
She was an amateur figure skater.

689
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,591
Oh, my gosh! Wait!

690
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:08,600
I didn't know she was a good skater.

691
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:10,227
So tell me.

692
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,520
Are you planning to get married?

693
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,279
Given your age,

694
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:25,116
I want to know how serious
you are about this relationship.

695
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,542
We just started dating, ma'am.

696
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,798
See? Now stop asking questions.

697
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:40,966
However,

698
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,928
I'm not taking this relationship lightly.

699
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:50,058
So you're the sincere type.

700
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,774
As of now, your approval rating is at 20%.

701
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:00,360
I'll keep this a secret
from your dad for now.

702
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,238
You know I'm tight-lipped, right?

703
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:28,972
Yes.

704
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,101
I'll explain it in person.
Make a note of it for now.

705
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,060
Bye.

706
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,564
Sorry, did I interrupt you?

707
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:41,151
Not at all. Someone in our study group
was asking me a few questions.

708
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:43,862
How is it going?

709
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,407
You didn't have
to bring me this. Thank you.

710
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,829
The room is too small, isn't it?

711
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:57,125
Not at all. You didn't wash off the ring.

712
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:02,005
It wouldn't wash off
because it was inked on too well.

713
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,175
I'll buy you a real one next time.

714
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,220
Will you stay with me
even if you become successful?

715
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,599
You stayed by my side despite everything.

716
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,480
Jong-hyeon.

717
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:25,862
Would you have still lived with me here
even if you had a lot of money?

718
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,872
Had I been that wealthy,

719
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:38,958
it would've been different.

720
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:42,796
In that case,

721
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:47,258
<i>I'd have made you a nicer breakfast.</i>

722
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:52,013
<i>I would've filled the veranda</i>
<i>with your favorite plants.</i>

723
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:57,936
<i>And we would've watched</i>
<i>your favorite movies every night.</i>

724
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:07,695
I'm happy with what we have right now.

725
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:09,572
Not me.

726
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:13,118
I want to succeed as soon as possible
and make you happier.

727
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,748
What else? What else do you want to do?

728
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:24,003
I want us to have

729
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,590
your favorite wine
while admiring the Han River.

730
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:30,301
That's nice.

731
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:48,319
Were you caught off guard today?

732
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,280
I'm sorry.

733
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:53,575
That's okay.

734
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:57,120
Your mother was cute.

735
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:02,917
She may seem childish,
but she's always on my side.

736
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,964
Let's say it all worked out for the best.

737
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:19,726
-Hello.
-Thank you.

738
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:23,688
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

739
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:56,304
<i>That person is in front of me.</i>

740
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,732
<i>The one I could have had.</i>

741
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:16,157
<i>But I lost.</i>

742
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:24,541
<i>I won't look.</i>

743
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,632
<i>I won't think.</i>

744
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:39,806
<i>To protect the one that chose me.</i>

745
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:47,146
<i>To honor the choice I made.</i>

746
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,986
<i>I won't hope for anything.</i>

747
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,784
<i>In case I might desire her again.</i>

748
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:11,629
<i>In case…</i>

749
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,425
<i>I can't deceive my own heart.</i>

750
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,084
I have a reservation.

751
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,711
Can I get your name, please?

752
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,005
-Ahn Su-yeong.
-One minute, please.

753
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:06,536
JEONG JONG-HYEON

754
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:11,207
Hi, Jong-hyeon.

755
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:23,177
I'm sleeping over
at my friend's place tonight.

756
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:21,087
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

757
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:42,567
<i>I'm very happy these days.</i>
<i>Things are going great with Sang-su.</i>

758
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,361
I never should've
come here from the start.

759
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,532
Do you think I've forgotten
what you've done?

760
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:54,370
<i>Gyeong-pil and Mi-gyeong?</i>
<i>Those two are working in the same office?</i>

761
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:56,831
Sang-su. What's on your mind?

762
01:12:56,914 --> 01:13:00,418
What was he like?
Was he really single all those years?

763
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:01,544
AHN SU-YEONG

764
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:04,130
<i>Did he at least like someone?</i>
<i>Or maybe flirt a bit?</i>

765
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,716
<i>It's my first time</i>
<i>seeing you smile like that.</i>

766
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,927
Are you happy?

767
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:19,562
