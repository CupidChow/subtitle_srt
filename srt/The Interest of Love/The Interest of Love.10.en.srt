THE INTEREST OF LOVE

2
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,653
Do you know how to play the piano?

3
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,823
Just a bit. I taught myself.

4
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,159
Let me see you play.

5
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:18,537
No, it's okay.

6
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,873
What's stopping you? No one's here.

7
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,808
JEONGDONGJIN STATION

8
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,221
<i>That day,</i>

9
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,851
<i>we were just two travelers</i>
<i>on a train platform.</i>

10
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:26,772
<i>Like an unspoken agreement…</i>

11
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,735
<i>neither of us opened up…</i>

12
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,530
<i>about our personal matters.</i>

13
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,743
<i>Like two strangers…</i>

14
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,289
<i>we only shared that very moment.</i>

15
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,711
That was a classical piece, right?

16
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,635
Chopin once loved a woman.

17
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,721
He wrote that piece for her.

18
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,519
Musicians are romantic

19
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,063
even when they're in love.

20
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,528
He must've loved her a lot.

21
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,617
But they broke up.

22
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,787
Why?

23
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,250
They came face-to-face with reality.

24
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,837
Social status differences,

25
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,048
family disapproval issues,
and other such things.

26
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,347
That's why it's called
"The Farewell Waltz."

27
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,895
I didn't know it was a sad piece.

28
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,657
Thank you for today.

29
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,535
For what?

30
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,498
Just everything.

31
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,920
I had a good laugh
for the first time in ages, thanks to you.

32
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,015
Are you happy?

33
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,146
Sorry?

34
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:37,444
Earlier today,
you said that you're trying your best.

35
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,122
So are you happy?

36
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,553
There's our train.

37
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,269
Should I break up?

38
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,535
Should I break up with Jong-hyeon?

39

EPISODE 10

41
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,650
What…

42
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,738
What did you mean…

43
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,242
back there?

44
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,795
Then what did you mean by that?

45
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,014
Why did you ask if I was happy?

46
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,113
What about you?

47
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,163
Are you happy?

48
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,970
Bye.

49
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,184
<i>Su-yeong, will you be coming home late?</i>

50
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,977
<i>We need to talk.</i>

51
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,627
Why are you outside?

52
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,257
Good to see you.

53
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,093
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

54
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,598
It's been ages
since we last saw each other.

55
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:59,062
Sang-su told me a few months ago
that you all work at the same branch.

56
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,190
Right. I didn't know you met with him.

57
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,109
Yes, I ran into him at your bank.

58
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,736
But why didn't he come today?

59
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,948
-A VIP client suddenly passed away.
-I see.

60
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,741
He went to offer his condolences.

61
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,535
Hey.

62
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,121
You guys are really laid-back.

63
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,415
When I heard you guys
were all working there,

64
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,335
I was a bit surprised.

65
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,260
Wait, did you…

66
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,141
say anything to Sang-su?

67
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:41,813
What?

68
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,825
-Move.
-Come on.

69
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,452
Why are you so upset?

70
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,078
Sang-su knows about us.

71
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,913
Yes. So what?

72
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,623
We dated in college, briefly.

73
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,542
We weren't even serious.

74
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:04,919
There is no "we."

75
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,630
I'm dating Sang-su now.

76
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,050
Okay. I get it.

77
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,053
So, what? Are you going to see him now?

78
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,429
Are you going to confess?

79
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:16,806
What's it to you?

80
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,977
He hasn't confronted you about it
even though he found out months ago.

81
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,150
For whatever reason,
he's pretending not to know.

82
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,905
Isn't this a good thing for you?

83
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,551
I'm sorry.

84
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,265
I shouldn't have acted like that.

85
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,229
I thought about what I did and regretted.

86
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,691
The fact that you saw
such an ugly side of me…

87
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,321
was hard for me.

88
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,325
That's why…

89
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,620
I'm going to move out, Su-yeong.

90
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,165
I've saved up some money.

91
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,210
So I'll be able to move back

92
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,546
to the old rooftop
by the end of this month.

93
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,048
-Jong-hyeon--
-Thank you for your hospitality.

94
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,342
It must've been
uncomfortable living with me.

95
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,477
What about your exam?

96
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,691
I won't give up. Don't worry.

97
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:55,029
I'm going to keep the promise
I made to you at all costs.

98
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,537
So can we start over?

99
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,698
Should I break up with Jong-hyeon?

100
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,833
PARK MI-GYEONG

101
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,795
Hey.

102
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,006
<i>Hey, did you get home?</i>

103
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,841
Yes, just now.

104
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,801
<i>Then can you open the door?</i>

105
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,646
-Here you go.
-Okay.

106
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,606
Thanks.

107
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,525
That's Chopin.

108
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:17,779
Right.

109
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,240
Why didn't you leave it on?

110
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,326
I like that piece too.

111
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,994
Do you?

112
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,623
It sounds warm and beautiful.

113
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,878
Not the title, though.
"The Farewell Waltz."

114
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,675
That's the title
that Chopin's ex-lover made

115
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,052
after breaking up with him.

116
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,057
He dedicated this song
to the woman he loved.

117
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:51,187
But in the end,
it became "The Farewell Waltz."

118
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,861
By the way,
why listen to Chopin out of the blue?

119
00:12:58,945 --> 00:12:59,988
What?

120
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,284
You were never interested
in classical music.

121
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,790
No particular reason.

122
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,387
Sang-su, I heard
you found out about everything.

123
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,433
About my relationship…

124
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,770
with Gyeong-pil.

125
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,233
Right.

126
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,031
Why didn't you say anything?

127
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,326
Because it was all in the past.

128
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,539
And it wasn't like you did anything wrong.

129
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,045
But I didn't open up to you about it.

130
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,172
I wasn't honest with you.

131
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,927
Not telling me about it
doesn't mean you were dishonest.

132
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,728
It's really okay. I mean it.

133
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,320
That's it?

134
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,157
What do you mean?

135
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,534
It's strange.

136
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,540
You say that you're fine,
but why do I feel hurt?

137
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,131
Then should I get upset?

138
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,433
Do you also have something like this?

139
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,185
Like what?

140
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,563
Something you haven't told me about.

141
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,579
Never mind.

142
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,917
Goodness, I'm exhausted.

143
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,189
<i>Are you happy?</i>

144
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:49,782
I love you.

145
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:18,478
To show our respect
for your individuality and creativity,

146
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,981
KCU Bank will
no longer require a dress code.

147
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,319
There's a box out in the hallway
to return your uniforms.

148
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,572
Does this mean we can wear
whatever we want to work?

149
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,032
Unbelievable.

150
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,160
Uniforms are fine.
It's a hassle to choose outfits every day.

151
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,453
What's the matter?

152
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,705
Now we can wear
all sorts of pretty clothes.

153
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,927
-Thank you.
-No problem.

154
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,931
And thank you
for dropping off Su-yeong yesterday.

155
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,769
I saw your car in front of her house.

156
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,402
Here, let me. It's my job.

157
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,698
I'll take it from here.

158
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,836
-Hey there.
-Hey.

159
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,714
Sang-su.

160
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:34,845
Why did you do that?

161
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,725
About Mi-gyeong and me.

162
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,436
Why didn't you say anything?

163
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,986
What was I supposed to do?
Get mad and ask why you did that to her?

164
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,948
So you even knew what I did.

165
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,244
It's all in the past.

166
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,626
What's so strange to you?

167
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,004
It's not necessarily strange.

168
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,673
I just don't get it.

169
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,219
How could you be completely fine with it?

170
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,729
Are you sure you even like her?

171
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,069
Well, I guess it's none of my business.

172
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,123
I guess she's returning her uniform.

173
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,542
Why?

174
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,670
Why else would she not need her uniform?

175
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,967
Right. You missed this morning's meeting.

176
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,220
I guess it just kind of happened.

177
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,276
Why did you bring this out?

178
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,321
-To return it.
-Why?

179
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,241
Because I don't need it anymore.

180
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,746
Are you really quitting?

181
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,333
-What?
-Are you leaving the bank?

182
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,755
You didn't tell me about this yesterday.

183
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,424
-Mr. Ha, this is--
-So why all of a sudden…

184
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,052
Hey, Sang-su.

185
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,430
Sang-su.

186
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,433
We get to show off our fashion sense now.

187
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:49,772
Gosh.

188
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,693
-Hey.
-Go return your uniform.

189
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,972
Are you really quitting?

190
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,974
So why all of a sudden…

191
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,460
LOCKER ROOM

192
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,880
Sang-su, have some coffee.

193
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,548
Okay.

194
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,514
Thanks.

195
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,683
Don't mention it.

196
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,564
Mi-gyeong.

197
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,649
Yes?

198
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,403
Are you free later today?

199
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,579
Why did you want to come here?

200
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,083
Because we haven't really
gone out for dates.

201
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,421
I was also curious about this place
since you came here often.

202
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,179
CHA SEON-JAE

203
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,725
Why won't you answer?

204
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,936
It's not important.

205
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,941
Isn't Seon-jae the friend
you've been hanging out with?

206
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,778
Seon-jae's still young, so a bit immature.

207
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,949
All the answers are in the textbook,
but Seon-jae still asks me.

208
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,119
But you still answer his questions.
You're a good friend.

209
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,834
This is where you wanted to come?

210
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,796
How did you know I was a member here?

211
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,302
-I booked you for next week.
-Okay.

212
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,846
Thank you.

213
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,723
Hello--

214
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,726
Goodness.

215
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,436
Hello.

216
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,772
Mom, what are you doing there?

217
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,190
Did you ask her to come?

218
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,901
Ms. Han is the new friend that I made.

219
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,071
She stepped outside for a bit,
so I'm watching the shop.

220
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,284
Are you here for a couple's massage?

221
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,369
That's great.

222
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,998
This place may look rundown,
but they offer excellent service.

223
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,708
Actually--

224
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,502
Goodness. You're back.

225
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,047
Say hello.

226
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,009
I told you my daughter
had a boyfriend, right?

227
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,886
Doesn't he look dependable?

228
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,769
-Ma'am--
-He looks wonderful to me.

229
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,733
And I'm incredibly proud of him.

230
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:25,279
Goodness. Why are you talking like that?

231
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,907
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you're bragging about your son.

232
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,367
She's my mother.

233
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,540
My mom is the owner of this shop.

234
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,293
What?

235
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,012
No.

236
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,890
What do you mean, no?

237
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,268
You can't date Ha Sang-su.

238
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:00,230
I tried my best to keep an open mind.

239
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,819
I mean, he's calm and cautious.

240
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,239
He's warm and friendly too. I like him.

241
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,202
But the owner
of that building is my friend.

242
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,914
Why did he have to be the son
of my friend's tenant?

243
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,540
-Mom--
-No.

244
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,419
This is more than I can handle.

245
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,088
My pride has been hurt.

246
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,218
Goodness.

247
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,762
Why did it have to be him of all--

248
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,639
I like him more than he likes me.

249
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,934
I like him more.

250
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,812
So put your pride aside.

251
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,106
I won't break up with him.

252
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,029
What was that all of a sudden?
Why did you bring her here?

253
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,406
She seemed pretty shaken.

254
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,909
I just thought it was time.

255
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,496
Do you like her a lot?

256
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,499
What?

257
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,042
Think about it.

258
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,712
Given your personality,
you must like her a lot

259
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,672
if you decided to introduce her to me.

260
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,341
Why do you like her?

261
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,430
I feel comfortable.

262
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:18,892
We went to the same college,
and we get each other.

263
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:23,272
She's easy to get along with,
so we never argue.

264
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,735
She's also acknowledged
and respected at the bank.

265
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:33,574
What is it?

266
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,580
Well, it just sounds
like you're complimenting a colleague.

267
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,915
Not your girlfriend.

268
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,348
Are you really quitting?

269
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,269
-What?
-Are you leaving the bank?

270
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,199
Yes?

271
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,076
You should've given me a heads-up.

272
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,412
I was so flustered today.

273
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,499
I didn't want you to be nervous.

274
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:28,629
There's nothing bad about being nervous
when meeting my boyfriend's mother.

275
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,218
Anyway, thank you.

276
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,347
To be honest, I was touched today.

277
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,521
You took a step
toward me for the first time.

278
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,949
Do you want me to come over right now?

279
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,452
Right now?

280
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:01,995
Yes.

281
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,254
It's too late. I'll see you tomorrow.

282
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,592
Right.

283
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,928
I wasn't being serious.

284
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,098
You must be tired too. Get some rest.

285
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,601
Okay. Good night.

286
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,592
Are you happy?

287
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,969
-What?
-Are you that happy?

288
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,472
-About what?
-You're living together now

289
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,057
yet still have so much to say.

290
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,229
Well, yes. I'm happy.

291
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,732
Fine. I guess that's how newlyweds are.

292
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,569
Hello?

293
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,530
Yes, I can talk.

294
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,160
Hey, newlywed. Don't be late.

295
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,747
He's happy as a clam. You're here early.

296
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,833
What was that yesterday?

297
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:12,793
What was what?

298
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,878
You gave me the wrong idea.

299
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,214
Wrong idea? What do you mean?

300
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,635
Hey.

301
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,346
Were you shocked
because you thought she was quitting?

302
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,225
I hate how sneaky you are sometimes.

303
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,187
Quit trying to feel me out like that.

304
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,773
It's offensive, no matter what.

305
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,067
All right.

306
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:04,511
<i>I'm here.</i>

307
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,054
I'LL BE DOWN SOON

308
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,931
Your cousin is outside.

309
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,353
-How did you know?
-Know what?

310
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,067
How do you know his face
when I've never introduced you two?

311
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,281
Well, that's obvious.
You introduced us before.

312
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,867
Maybe you don't remember
because it's been so long.

313
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,707
Thank you for your support last quarter.

314
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,501
Thanks to you,
our branch improved its performance.

315
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,295
And I was able to save face.

316
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:43,300
You should thank him instead.
I only did it because of him.

317
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,180
By the way, what brings you here today?

318
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,807
Even Deputy Manager Park from HQ is here.

319
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,642
I came to discuss the workforce assignment

320
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,436
for the subbranch in Seogwang University.

321
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,355
I came…

322
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,611
to take a better look.

323
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,620
At what, sir?

324
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,213
I brought some coffee.

325
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,507
Please serve President Park first.

326
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,656
I heard he's my daughter's boyfriend.

327
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,242
Are you talking about Mr. Ha?

328
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,663
That's true. He's dating Ms. Park, sir.

329
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:59,084
Mr. Ha is an excellent employee.

330
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,211
Of course, he's not as good as Ms. Park.

331
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,296
But he's a man
of conviction and principle.

332
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,882
His performance is outstanding as well.

333
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,643
There she comes.

334
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,811
Su-yeong.

335
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,188
Is Ms. Park's father
the head of Daeseong Construction?

336
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,733
And is her cousin
the deputy manager of Strategic Planning?

337
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:27,070
I knew her family was rich,
but this is on a whole other level.

338
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,823
I used to be jealous of her
for dating Mr. Ha.

339
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,659
But now, I'm jealous of him.

340
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,203
He's the male version of Cinderella.

341
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,373
Seeing how they're here,
maybe they'll get married.

342
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,000
You're probably right.

343
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,753
Getting married is easy
when you're that wealthy.

344
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,881
Ms. Bae, can you come here for a minute?

345
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,467
-Me?
-Yes.

346
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,229
I haven't approved of him yet.

347
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,774
I only came
because you asked for the first time.

348
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:06,985
I know.

349
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,280
But what's gotten into you?

350
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:14,284
You used to avoid me
whenever I came around your workplace.

351
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,122
Wait. Are you the one chasing him?

352
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:20,874
You should go.

353
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,920
You need to learn how to get
what I can't buy for you.

354
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,964
I want a formal introduction.

355
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,008
Okay.

356
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,185
Did he leave?

357
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,311
Yes.

358
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,271
Did he surprise you?

359
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,524
That's just how my dad is.

360
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,778
He must have heard from Mom
and got curious.

361
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:51,738
Were you uncomfortable?

362
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,574
No.

363
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,827
I'm glad, though.

364
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,914
We're meeting each other's parents now.

365
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,749
We'll become a family soon.

366
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:11,466
I'd like to have lunch together,
but I have to work outside of the office.

367
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,552
I'll be clocking out from there too.

368
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:14,886
I have a site inspection.

369
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,931
Then how about
some wine at my place later?

370
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,560
We'll see. I'll call you later.

371
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,938
Okay. Call me later.

372
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,532
Isn't she the owner of the <i>gukbap</i> place?

373
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,743
She's delivering food despite her leg.

374
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,123
You're right.
Her husband always did the deliveries.

375
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,460
-Hello.
-Hello.

376
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:17,824
Mom!

377
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,038
Did she just call that woman mom?

378
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:23,955
Yes.

379
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,248
-Mom!
-Are you all right?

380
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,083
Mom, are you okay?

381
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,544
-Oh, no.
-Are you all right, ma'am?

382
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,629
-Oh, no.
-Are you hurt?

383
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,297
Let me see, Mom.

384
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,465
I'm okay.

385
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,759
You're not okay. You're bleeding!

386
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,387
The oyster <i>gukbap</i> place at the market?

387
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,597
Yes.

388
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,017
I can't believe
she didn't tell us this whole time.

389
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,811
I had no idea and even talked about

390
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:51,232
how the owner had trouble walking
because of her leg.

391
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,319
I feel terrible now.

392
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,987
I'm sure she had her reasons.

393
00:35:57,197 --> 00:36:00,533
So please keep this a secret
from our colleagues.

394
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,118
Of course.

395
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:06,122
Ms. Seo, Mr. Ha, and I
all know how to keep a secret.

396
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:09,959
Right.

397
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,253
Mr. Ha took the lady to the hospital.

RESTRICTED ACCESS
EMERGENCY ROOM

399
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:30,939
Is she okay?

400
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,693
Why are you still here?

401
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,613
I was worried.

402
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,952
You should go.
I heard you had an inspection.

403
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,662
I'll wait for you.

404
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,416
But it's still working hours,
and I have a reason to be here.

405
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,585
I can do it some other time.

406
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,757
She needs to receive a few tests,
so it'll take some time.

407
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,722
Thank you.

408
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,221
What should we do?

409
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:50,059
I think your colleagues
heard you calling me mom.

410
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,313
You are my mom.

411
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,570
Get your leg checked out.
You should get it treated.

412
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:01,988
I'm fine.

413
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,823
But I'm not.

414
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,204
I'm not fine.

Hey, Sang-su.

00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,432
Are you still at the hospital?

419
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,727
What? Yes.

420
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,395
<i>Ms. Bae told me.</i>

421
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,898
I heard Su-yeong's mother was injured.

422
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,359
It's not that serious.

423
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:44,280
Could you keep this a secret
from the other--

424
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,449
What do you take me for?

425
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,703
Don't worry.
I said the same thing to Ms. Bae.

426
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,165
I see. Thanks.

427
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,837
Why are you thanking me?

428
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,592
I'm not sure. That came out wrong.

429
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,596
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Goodbye.

What about your mom? Is she okay?

00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,383
How bad is it?

Where did she get hurt?

440
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,600
Did you know?

441
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,940
That she feels
psychogenic pain in her leg.

442
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,653
Her nerves are fine,
but she's refusing to get treatment.

443
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,909
She was fine when I left Tongyeong.

444
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,452
So what happened?

445
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,461
Is there something else
I don't know about?

446
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,882
Other than how you had an affair?

447
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,887
Or how Su-hyeok saw that woman
and died in an accident that day?

448
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,222
Is there anything else
that I need to know?

449
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,231
You ruined everything for us.

No.

452
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,019
I'm fine.

00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:25,650

Thank you for today.

456
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,198
Is your mother okay?

457
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:17,910
Yes.

Aren't you getting on a bus?

459
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,234
Well, I…

460
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,244
Would you like to go for a walk?

461
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,506
Why did you act that way…

462
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,009
when I returned my uniform yesterday?

463
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,682
Gyeong-pil pulled a prank on me.

464
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,770
He talked as if you were quitting.

465
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,484
Is that how shocked
you're going to be if I quit?

466
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,114
Are you going to quit?

467
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,785
If I can't tolerate it
any longer, then yes.

468
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,663
But not anytime soon.

469
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:49,836
Are you tired?

470
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,713
It feels like you tricked me.

471
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,217
You never said anything about hiking.

472
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,593
But that's what we're doing.

473
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,347
This is my college campus.

474
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,308
I know you graduated from here.

475
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,604
You must be very proud,
seeing how you brought me here.

476
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:09,772
Of course, I am.

477
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:14,110
It's the first time
I achieved something through hard work.

478
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:21,159
The students here must be healthy,
thanks to hiking every day.

479
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,413
We used to call this place
the Hill of Oblivion.

480
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:26,998
Why?

481
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,042
Because once we reached the top,

482
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,920
we were utterly exhausted
and couldn't focus.

483
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:34,672
That's nice.

484
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:39,302
You could forget everything
and start fresh.

485
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,472
You can do the same too.

486
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:48,811
What would you like me to forget?

487
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:54,901
This exhausting day.

488
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,121
Hurry up.

489
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,167
Whoever gets there last has to buy dinner.

490
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:29,185
<i>This number is not available right now.</i>
<i>At the tone, please record your message.</i>

491
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,853
MY PERSON

492
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:50,706
AHN SU-YEONG

493
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,330
I think they're closed.

494
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,833
They serve a mean pork cutlet here.

495
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:37,336
But all pork cutlets are delicious.

496
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,006
This place is exceptionally good.

497
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,136
This feels like boot camp.

498
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,430
Grueling training, no food…

499
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:50,266
Should we go somewhere else, then?

500
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,144
You mean down that hill?

501
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,605
The back gate leads to the main street.

502
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:01,986
Then we could've just come here
through the back gate.

503
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,946
Why did we take the hill?

504
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,075
You're right.

505
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:12,705
Did you really go here?

506
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,165
Of course.

507
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,207
I don't believe it.

508
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,876
But I really did.

509
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,796
If you don't believe me,
ask Gyeong-pil and Mi-gyeong.

510
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:29,847
Let's go.

511
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,152
You can drop me off there.

512
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,238
I'll go into the alley.

513
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,574
That's okay. I can just get off here.

514
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,877
Thank you.

515
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,464
Wait, so…

516
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:06,425
When can we have a meal together?

517
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,720
Is there a reason why we should?

518
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:17,269
Is there a reason why we shouldn't?
What's wrong with having a meal?

519
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,607
You're right.

520
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,153
How about tomorrow then?

521
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,451
Does the weekend not work for you?

522
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,664
No, that's fine.

523
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,418
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

524
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,730
MISSED CALLS
PARK MI-GYEONG

525
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,585
Sang-su, where are you?

526
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,297
I've been calling you.

527
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:29,383
I see.

528
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,343
Okay.

529
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,307
I came out to see someone.

530
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,559
I'll come over later.

531
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,978
Bye.

532
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:44,899
Su-yeong.

533
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,862
What brings you here?

534
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,489
I have something for you.

535
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,992
Can I come in for a minute?

536
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,353
Come in.

537
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:29,777
Sorry for barging in.

538
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,905
I called, but you didn't answer.

539
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,492
Why did you want to see me?

540
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,664
To give you these. We don't need
to wear uniforms anymore, so…

541
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,541
They're brand-new.
I wanted to give them to you.

542
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,422
That's not necessary.

543
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,591
I hope you'll wear them.

544
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,135
Thank you.

545
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,057
How is your mother?

546
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,811
-Sorry?
-Ms. Bae told me.

547
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,982
I told her not to tell the others,
so don't worry.

548
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,320
Yes, she's fine.

549
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:14,989
That's a relief.

550
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,662
Are you coming from the hospital?

551
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,336
Yes.

552
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:38,846
I see.

553
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,190
Here's your coffee.

554
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,149
Thanks.

555
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,078
How's it going with Mr. Jeong?

556
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:49,124
Is something wrong?

557
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,462
No, we're doing fine.

558
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,262
You don't have any plans
to get married yet, do you?

559
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,600
I get it.

560
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:11,605
He's still young, and so are you.

561
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,317
Once you become my age,

562
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:18,028
your parents
will pressure you to get married.

563
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:20,614
Look at how my dad visited the bank.

564
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,617
He must've been curious about Sang-su.

565
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:36,338
I met his mother yesterday.

566
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:43,470
They think marriage is on the table
given how we've been dating for a while.

567
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,849
But Sang-su and I haven't discussed it.

568
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:57,860
When we get married later,
will you catch my bouquet?

569
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,574
It'd be great if you could.

570
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:33,604
Are you home?

571
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:45,616
Did you drink?

572
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,409
Yes. A bit.

573
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,875
Why did you drink so much?

574
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,056
It's late.
You should've stayed home and rested.

575
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,976
I just wanted to see you.

576
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,902
I parked your car in the parking lot.

577
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,915
Mi-gyeong.

578
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,668
That car doesn't belong to me.

579
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,673
I know.

580
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,300
I understand how you feel.

581
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,762
But I bought it already.

582
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,767
I didn't want to watch it collect dust

583
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,937
in the parking lot for months.

584
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,985
We already talked about this.
Why bring this up again?

585
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,491
Then why are you studying
to get certified?

586
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:12,869
Why do you want to move to HQ?

587
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:17,541
Isn't it because you want
to live in a better house

588
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,793
and have a better car and clothes?

589
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,588
Why can't I give them to you first

590
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:26,008
-if you're going to get them anyway?
-That's ridiculous, Mi-gyeong.

591
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,691
Are you still going to play golf tomorrow?

592
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,736
Yes.

593
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:50,073
All right. I'll get going, then.

594
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:52,659
Mi-gyeong.

595
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:56,913
Take the car back.

596
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:00,626
Sang-su.

597
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,886
Drive it or throw it away.
Do what you want with it.

598
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:17,517
I just hated seeing it
in the parking lot every day…

599
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:22,898
because it felt like…

600
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,276
a rejection.

601
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,155
I'm sorry.

602
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:03,271
CHA SEON-JAE

603
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,273
MOM

604
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:10,195
<i>Thanks, Jong-hyeon. And I'm sorry.</i>

605
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:15,200
<i>I'll pay off the rest of</i>
<i>the hospital bills. Don't worry.</i>

606
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,255
DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE THE ACCOUNT?

607
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,383
YES

608
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:58,762
Su-yeong, what is this?

609
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,681
I didn't mean to look at it.

610
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:06,520
But I read your mom's text yesterday.

611
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:08,188
And?

612
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:12,776
Please give this to her.

613
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:18,156
I'm not rich,
and I didn't take out a loan.

614
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,955
I happened to get hold of some cash.

615
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:27,833
It wasn't meant for me, anyway.

616
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,334
That's ridiculous.

617
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,753
Jong-hyeon, you see…

618
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,342
it makes me mad
that we struggle with things…

619
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:41,680
that others find to be simple.

620
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:49,938
And that we're desperate over things
that seem trivial to others.

621
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,445
This is my way of venting.

622
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,876
I'm going to take a nap.

623
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,297
I'll leave the money here.

624
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:18,842
I'd like you to have it.

625
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,597
But if you don't want it,
just leave it here.

626
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,057
Are you sure about this?

627
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:36,526
If I take this money, I'll feel bad again.

628
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:44,743
And then we'll go through…

629
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,663
the same problem again.

630
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,344
You can decide what to do with it.

631
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:24,950
Your father passed away at an early age?

632
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,371
-Yes, sir.
-Mine too.

633
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:34,834
Because of that,
I became the breadwinner when I was 15.

634
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:37,212
That's when I decided

635
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:41,925
to become a useful father
instead of a kind one.

636
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,595
Being affectionate serves no purpose,

637
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,723
so I chose to be a father
who could provide for his child.

638
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,852
That's how I've been living my life
and will continue to do so.

639
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:58,316
I don't care whether I like
my daughter's boyfriend,

640
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,278
or if he comes from a good background

641
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,863
because I can make up for what he lacks.

642
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,534
As long as his family
didn't commit any crimes, that is.

643
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,037
I don't care how you feel either.

644
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:17,794
I'll give her anything
and everything she wishes to have.

645
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,194
What did you and my dad talk about?

646
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:29,866
I think he loves you a lot.

647
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:32,452
I beg to differ.

648
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:39,584
He only shows his affection through money.
He's never been the warm-hearted type.

649
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:53,098
Let's have dinner together.

650
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:00,939
What is it? Do you have plans?

651
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:19,749
JEONG JONG-HYEON

652
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:23,169
<i>I'm sorry, Su-yeong.</i>
<i>I promise to pay you back.</i>

653
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,512
YOUR MONEY HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED

654
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,384
<i>I'm here.</i>

655
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,470
SECTION CHIEF
HA SANG-SU

656
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,493
I'm sorry.
I forgot I had plans with Jong-hyeon.

657
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,916
Yes, I'm with him right now.

658
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:11,004
You don't need to treat me to a meal.

659
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:12,714
I'm hanging up now.

660
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,358
What are you looking at?

661
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,361
This.

662
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:18,946
The bus route.

663
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:28,414
This is exactly what life is like.

664
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,088
A circle.

665
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:41,636
You fool yourself into thinking
that you're going somewhere…

666
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,516
but then you're back to square one.

667
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:55,066
You're just going in circles.

668
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:01,823
Our entire life
is just one big, never-ending circle.

669
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:13,626
Why aren't you saying anything?

670
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:18,005
You caught me lying to you.

671
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:32,019
Can you help me with something?

672
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:44,615
Last time, it was hiking.
Is it cold-weather training this time?

673
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:53,583
I'm close with the manager here.

674
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:58,337
In return for coming here whenever I want,
I clean the rink every now and then.

675
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:01,841
But why do I need to take part
in your secret deal?

676
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:04,594
It's nice and cool here.

677
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,596
Can't you see that my cheeks are cold?

678
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:13,352
That's not how you do it.

679
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:18,483
This is a bit different
from regular sweeping.

680
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:22,361
You need a delicate touch
when smoothing out the surface.

681
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:25,114
Be gentle. Treat it as if it's a baby.

682
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,741
Like this.

683
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:31,871
You're showing off
over something so trivial.

684
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,500
You must be good at everything.

685
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:42,465
Despite being good at everything,
it looks like you don't know how to skate.

686
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,467
Does that make you happy?

687
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:49,555
Shall I teach you?

688
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:03,486
You're a quick study.

689
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:07,114
I'm a natural.
I just never got the chance to learn it.

690
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:09,325
This is a piece of cake.

691
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:18,751
Let's race to that end of the rink.

692
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:23,381
You played hockey for over a decade,
but you want to beat me in a race?

693
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:24,882
That's right.

694
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:28,886
Fine.

695
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:33,140
I'll just use one leg. You can use both.

696
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,227
I want a ten-second head start.

697
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:38,771
Sure.

698
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:42,817
All right.

699
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:45,194
Get ready.

700
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,489
Get set. Go!

701
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,617
Don't go yet.

702
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,037
It hasn't been ten seconds.

703
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:20,104
Why aren't you coming?

704
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:24,650
I lost.

705
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,292
But you didn't even try.

706
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:49,884
I'll just… let you win.

707
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:07,693
<i>A circle.</i>

708
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:14,075
<i>You fool yourself into thinking</i>
<i>that you're going somewhere…</i>

709
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:19,246
<i>but then you're back to square one.</i>

710
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:26,337
<i>I fooled myself into thinking</i>
<i>I was going somewhere.</i>

711
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,510
<i>But here I am.</i>

712
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,346
<i>In the end…</i>

713
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:39,976
<i>I'm back to square one…</i>

714
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:45,356
<i>once again.</i>

715
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,567
I skate pretty well, right?

716
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:56,367
Thank you.

717
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:17,972
I don't think…

718
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:21,434
I can do this anymore.

719
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:10,858
<i>Once again…</i>

720
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:14,779
<i>I'm back to Su-yeong.</i>

721
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:38,886
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

722
01:16:56,946 --> 01:17:01,784
I'm done thinking now.
Ahn Su-yeong, I like you.

723
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:05,788
I like you too, Mr. Ha.
I liked you from the moment I saw you.

724
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:08,916
<i>They're seeing each other, right?</i>

725
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:09,834
PARK MI-GYEONG

726
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:13,504
<i>When I'm with you,</i>
<i>I forget about my troubles.</i>

727
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:17,049
Su-yeong. I have a question.

728
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:20,052
Is it because of me you're going?
And what I said yesterday?

729
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:22,930
Are you okay?

730
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:26,183
<i>Are you free today?</i>
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

731
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:30,354
<i>Will you break up with Mi-gyeong?</i>

732
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:37,486
