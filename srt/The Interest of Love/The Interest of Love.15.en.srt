Is this it?

00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,892
-Yes.
-Close the tailgate.

15
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,190
I told people
that you were working off-site.

16
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,656
You went to look for Su-yeong, right?
Did you get in touch with her?

17
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,784
No.

18
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,955
I guess you didn't know
about her resignation, either.

19
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,335
I knew something was off.

20
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,755
It didn't feel like she was transferring.

21
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,007
It felt more like
she was leaving for good.

22
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,517
Ms. Seo. I have a favor to ask.

23
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,522
Could you tell Mr. Noh
that Su-yeong called?

24
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,526
Then Mr. Noh can tell them…

25
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,154
If she uses her vacation time,
that'll buy her ten days.

26
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,450
Right, but it'll seem weird
if I mention it to Mr. Noh,

27
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,077
so can you tell him instead?

28
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,457
Even so, do you think she'll return?

29
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,459
I think she was determined to leave.

30
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,926
Regarding the changes in conditions
for bank loan products,

31
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,470
General Consultation members
must get familiar with them.

32
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,348
Deposits Team,
do not forget to text clients

33
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,268
whose accounts are about to expire.

34
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,396
And every single team
should remember to bring in new clients.

35
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,233
What about tomorrow's event?

36
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,070
Under my leadership,
preparation is now complete.

37
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,905
We've already texted our clients

38
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,033
about tomorrow's event
after business hours.

39
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,534
Good.

40
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:53,038
Let's wrap up early today
and have a company dinner together

41
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,665
at the BBQ place near the intersection.

42
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,418
What's the occasion
of tonight's get-together?

43
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,631
A welcoming party
for Mr. Hwang and Ms. Shin

44
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,966
and a farewell for Ms. Park.

45
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,975
It happened that way.

46
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,396
She'll be transferred
to our Washington branch.

47
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,276
The decision was made per her request,
so I hope everyone will attend tonight.

48
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,015
What's this? Were you waiting for me?

49
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,060
Why?

50
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,105
Do you think I'm leaving because of you?

51
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,402
Is that the reason?

52
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,990
No.

53
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,660
Everyone wants to work abroad.

54
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,286
I got lucky.

55
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,503
What happened to Su-yeong?

56
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,509
Did you know?

57
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,597
No, I didn't.

58
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,017
It's strange.

59
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:45,025
Now that all this has happened,
it's not as satisfying as I'd thought.

60
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,160
We worked overtime a lot
recently, so eat up.

61
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,828
Yes, sir.

62
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,128
So who invited Mr. Ma Du-sik?

63
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,592
Well, I never got a farewell party,

64
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,760
so I invited myself.

65
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,554
Don't act so petty over food.

66
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,307
Then why did he come to our branch dinner?

67
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,684
You ignored all of my calls
as soon as you left.

68
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:25,398
Hey, can't you tell?
He obviously likes someone at our branch.

69
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,739
You miss me now
that you're over there, right?

70
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,701
-Sorry?
-I'm the best boss you've ever had, right?

71
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,788
Right. Of course.

72
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,997
Here.

73
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,463
This is a bit too sudden, though.
Why didn't you tell us before?

74
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,218
-I'm sorry.
-When did you apply?

75
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,265
It's been a while.

76
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,352
I didn't think I'd really get to go.

77
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,814
So that's the reason
behind Sang-su's long face.

78
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,398
Ms. Park will be far away.

79
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:11,444
Once you go to Washington,
will it be a long-distance relationship?

80
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,449
I hear long-distance is really tough.

81
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,701
We broke up.

82
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,041
I'd have to be there
for at least three years,

83
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,335
and I don't think I can do long-distance.

84
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,175
So please look after Mr. Ha for me.

85
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,888
-Sure.
-Okay.

86
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,182
-Let's have a drink.
-Here.

87
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,520
-Drink up, Sang-su.
-Drink up.

88
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,856
Life isn't bad as a single.

89
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,618
Is it good riddance…

90
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,378
now that Su-yeong and I are both gone?

91
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,050
That's not my fault.

92
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,683
Sang-su and I will
never see each other again.

93
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,728
Once I go to Washington,
that'll be the end of us.

94
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,980
So tell me.

95
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,741
Why did you do that with Su-yeong?

96
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,331
Why should I tell you?

97
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,419
What happened between her and me
has nothing to do with you.

98
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,186
Then back then…

99
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,570
why did you do that to me?

100
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,705
Why did you flinch?

101
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,668
I didn't flinch.

102
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,752
You just did.

103
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,007
You always flinch more than I do
whenever that comes up.

104
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,602
Whatever you do is your call…

105
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:56,025
but I was in pain for a long time
because of what you did.

106
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,201
I'm not asking
because I still have feelings.

107
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,287
I just…

108
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,834
I've always wondered…

109
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,131
what the reason was…

110
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,717
for what you did.

111
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,321
Because I liked you.

112
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,577
But…

113
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,415
they said I wasn't supposed to like you.

114
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,762
My pride was crushed,

115
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,515
but I wasn't brave enough
to stay with you.

116
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,895
I thought it'd be better
to ruin everything instead.

117
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,356
That's all.

118
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,115
That's all?

119
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,080
You were young, but so was I.

120
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,840
It seems like you're still young.

121
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,806
Your behavior is the same
as it was back then.

122
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,235
Gyeong-pil.

123
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,780
Do you enjoy living like that?

124
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,873
Stop pretending like you don't care.

125
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,427
It makes you look desperate.

126
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,643
In the end, that desperation will show.

127
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,505
<i>Look right at me</i>

128
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,259
<i>I don't want to see you crying</i>

129
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,971
<i>It tortures me to see you in pain</i>

130
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,975
<i>Whenever I see you like that</i>

131
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,686
<i>Be mine</i>

132
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,687
Mine!

133
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,355
<i>I'm in love with you</i>

134
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,024
<i>-Yes</i>
<i>-Yes</i>

135
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:23,983
<i>I'm…</i>

136
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,622
Hey. Be mine!

137
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,341
-What's going on?
-My gosh!

138
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,593
Good for you two!

139
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,220
Yeah!

140
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,682
What?

141
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,101
-Congratulations!
-Great job.

142
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,478
-My gosh.
-Hey!

143
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,397
-Mr. Ma, congrats!
-Congratulations!

144
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,777
Get a room!

145
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,779
Since when did this happen?

146
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,741
-That bastard!
-No, it's alright.

147
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:15,803
I can't give you a better discount.
It was originally more expensive…

148
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,223
All proceeds will be donated,
so you're shopping for a good cause.

149
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,601
This is for clients
with fixed deposit accounts,

150
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,227
but it's on me.

151
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,937
Thank you. Goodbye.

152
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,530
-Start with these first.
-Nice.

153
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,906
Careful. It's hot.

154
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,872
We provide free consultations.

155
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,922
5 MILLION WON DONATION

156
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,299
Just one more picture.

157
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,010
Please, look here.

158
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,137
Smile.

159
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,892
What are you doing afterward?

160
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,394
Why?

161
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,146
Let's have dinner.

You have a good appetite.

164
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,422
We're here to eat.

165
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,137
Do you blame me?

166
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:47,103
Do you think this is all my fault?

167
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,199
About what happened
between Su-yeong and me--

168
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,784
I don't think it's your fault.

169
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,539
But I don't want…

170
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,167
to hear you say that name.

171
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,172
Or mention that incident.

172
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,557
If you're done, let's leave.

173
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,069
-We'd like to pay.
-Sure.

174
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,032
-Here.
-Thanks for dinner.

Sure.

176
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,662
Auntie, the soup here is so good.

177
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,789
-I almost drank it all in one go.
-Really?

178
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,040
It's great, Auntie.

179
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,752
May I call you Auntie?

180
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,212
-I'll be a regular here now.
-Of course.

181
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,759
But do you know
what happened to the previous owners?

182
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,638
I think they went back to Tongyeong
or wherever they came from.

183
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,307
I don't know the details.

184
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,893
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

185
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,519
-Sure. Come again.
-Yes.

186
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:13,647

I…

broke up with Sang-su.

I got you a place
near the Washington branch.

You can rent a car for a while.

Thank you.

250
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:14,229
Come to think of it,
I don't think I've ever thanked you.

251
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,864
Whenever you tried to give me something,

252
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,908
I hated how it felt like

253
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,371
you were trying to make up
for your lack of affection.

254
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,960
But it seems like…

255
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,173
that was your way of showing love.

256
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,137
I thought maybe you…

257
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,433
needed to hear this.

258
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,771

She resigned.

280
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,312
Go get your car fixed. Or get a new one.

282

00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,292
The woman who had an affair
with my husband.

326
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,630
And that woman's husband.

327
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,512
Back then, I lost it
and sued her for adultery.

328
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,474
But then her husband came to see me,
not that woman.

329
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,102
He asked to settle.

330
00:39:56,185 --> 00:40:00,690
Please. I'm begging you on her behalf.

331
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,401
I'm away for months at a time
as a forklift driver.

332
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,529
It's all my fault.

333
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,033
My children are still young.

334
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,076
One of them just became
a senior in high school.

335
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,996
Both of my children are sweet and kind.

336
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,497
I beg you.

337
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,334
Please forgive her just this once.

338
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,085
Please, I beg you.

339
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,383
Come inside.
I'll sign the settlement agreement.

340
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,057
<i>So…</i>

341
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,936
<i>the one who had an affair…</i>

342
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,690
was my mom and not my dad?

343
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:47,612
Your mom sold him an insurance plan
when they fell for each other.

344
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,327
She insisted nothing happened,
but who would believe that?

345
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,624
Your father tried so hard
to shield you two from this,

346
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,918
but you found out anyway.

347
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,547
Nothing stays a secret forever.

348
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,814
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

349
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,988
So why did you do that to her?

350
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,534
<i>Is there something else</i>
<i>I don't know about?</i>

351
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,953
Other than how you had an affair?

352
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:42,250
Or how Su-hyeok saw that woman
and died in an accident that day?

353
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,544
Is there anything else
that I need to know?

354
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,426
<i>Why here?</i>

355
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,428
You could've gone anywhere else.

356
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,805
Why did you have to come here
of all places?

357
00:41:55,888 --> 00:42:01,436
Go. Get out of here, Dad!
This is all your fault! Get out!

358
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,272
I said get out!

359
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,233
It's all your fault, Dad.

360
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,140
Are you really going to…

361
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,810
quit your job at the bank?

362
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,986
I mean, it's not that
I'm trying to stop you.

363
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:57,575
I was worried
if you had a tough time there.

364
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,168
Dad.

365
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,890
Weren't you upset
that I said those things to you…

366
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,644
when you didn't deserve it?

367
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:37,990
How…

368
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,660
How did you know?

369
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,846
I don't get it.

370
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,899
I don't get it, either.

371
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,159
If I hated her, then I hated her.

372
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,579
If things got tough, then I dealt with it.

373
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,790
Even when I didn't get it,

374
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,751
I just stayed with her.

375
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,089
I thought that was more important.

376
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,886
I figured I'd learn
to understand as time went by.

377
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,523
But now,
the most important thing to me is…

378
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:01,073
for you to be happy.

379
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,870
That's all.

380
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:53,501
I'm pretty open-minded
like most young people these days.

381
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,964
What I'm saying is that there's no need
for us to act like strangers.

382
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,591
It's not like we broke up or anything,

383
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:04,261
so there's no need
to act like complete strangers.

384
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,058
Do you hate me, Ms. Han?

385
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:10,935
No.

386
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,104
I think you're cute.

387
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:15,815
Me?

388
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:20,695
I'm cute?

389
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:22,738
Yes.

390
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,451
I'm staying for a session too.

391
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:31,288
Not coming here has made me
look like I'm in my fifties.

392
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:32,748
But isn't that true?

393
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:36,043
Everyone used to think
I was Mi-gyeong's older sister.

394
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:44,468
Mi-gyeong got transferred
to the Washington branch and left today.

395
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,639
How's Sang-su…

396
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,852
I mean, how's your son?

397
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:04,822
Sang-su.

398
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,617
Ha Sang-su.

399
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,788
I have…

400
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,001
nowhere to go.

401
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,546
That house is still listed.

402
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:25,259
When I sleep there, I keep having dreams.

403
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,761
Really strange ones.

404
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,026
Who are you calling?

405
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:46,113
You're not saying a word,
so I'm calling Gyeong-pil.

406
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,034
-Don't.
-Why not?

407
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,038
I hate that bastard.

408
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,166
Are you drunk?

409
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,753
I'm completely sober.

410
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:04,632
You're completely drunk.

411
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,426
As always, you're wasted,
yet you look fine.

412
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,056
Why is life like this?

413
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,141
And what's love, anyway?

414
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,061
"Why is life like this?"

415
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:19,980
"What's love, anyway?"

416
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,694
Who am I to blame anyone?
It's all my fault.

417
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:32,326
"Who am I to blame anyone?
It's all my fault."

418
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,499
How are you doing these days?

419
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,175
MR. SO-NOSY

420
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,885
I THINK YOU NEED TO HEAR THIS

421
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:55,141
NEW VOICE RECORDING 4

422
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,907

AHN SU-YEONG

424

<i>You have reached a number</i>
<i>that is no longer in service.</i>

425
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,941
How could you do this to me?

426
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:52,615
Where are you, Su-yeong?

427
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,409
Sang-su, it's okay.

428
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,453
Sang-su, stay the night.

429
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,413
Sang-su, wait.

430
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,207
Sang-su.

431
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,917
Come and sleep over at my place.

432
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,668
-Please go.
-Hey. Come over, okay?

433
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,337
Hey. Sang-su. Wait!

434
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,838
Sang-su, I'm so lonely!

435
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,006
Sang-su!

436
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,507
Sang-su!

437
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,346
Where are you headed today?

438
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,600
Sir? Where are you headed?

439
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:40,704
Did I wake you?

440
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,625
Why are you leaving so early?

441
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,710
I need to get ready for business.

442
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,004
The ships come in today,
so I have to go early.

443
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,340
Sleep some more.

444
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,385
Okay.

445
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,178
I made breakfast, so eat it later.

446
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,158
Mom!

447
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:27,626
Mom!

448
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,755
You're going to fall!

449
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,677
Why did you run after me?
You could've fallen.

450
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,687
Do you remember?

451
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,275
Su-hyeok and I
used to fall often right on this hill.

452
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:57,740
Actually,

453
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,370
I wasn't that afraid of falling.

454
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,920
Whenever we fell,
you ran over to help us up.

455
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:19,386
So…

456
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,396
let's get your leg treated.

457
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,535
That way, if I fall again,
you can help me up.

458
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,800
You'll get it treated, right?

459
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,140
You made a nice sand castle.

460
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,060
I made them a lot as a kid.

461
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:27,806
Are you going to run again?

462
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,562
Why did you disappear?

463
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:36,940
Why did you do that?

464
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,781
-How did you find me?
-Is that so important right now?

465
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,432
Is Mr. Ha still not here?

466
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:17,022
Did he take a leave without notice?

467
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,317
He called me this morning, but I forgot.

468
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,736
He's in the emergency room.

469
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:25,489
Why?

470
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:33,705
He didn't look too well since yesterday.

471
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,625
I think he came down with the flu.

472
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,377
He sounded awful.

473
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,560
What about work?

474
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:58,480
I skipped.

475
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,947
How did you know I was here?

476
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,285
I really didn't expect to see you.

477
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,248
To be honest, I was drunk.

478
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:21,920
Now that I'm here,

479
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:24,923
it feels like a dream.

480
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,929
I can still smell alcohol on you.

481
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:34,933
I'm sober now.

482
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,529
Why did you come?

483
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,661
I got something for you.

484

00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:34,076
I really wanted this ID card
with a blue lanyard.

487
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,252
But it's not a big deal at all.

488
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:51,051
Your resignation letter
hasn't been processed.

489
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:55,555
Ms. Seo talked it out so that
you're considered to be on vacation.

490
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:02,729
It's not too late.

491
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,569
Nothing is ever too late.

492
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:18,662
I throw it out before it's too late.

493
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,292
Things in the past…

494
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,006
can't be recovered.

495
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:02,664
Mr. Ha! What are you doing?

496
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,294
What do you think you're doing?

497
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,524
I found it.

498
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,660
I found it!

499
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:33,839
TEST ID SLIP
JEONG JONG-HYEON

500
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:10,041
PUBLIC BATHS

501
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,227
I'm sorry it took so long.

502
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:31,688
It's okay.

503
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,026
Are your clothes dry?

504
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,152
Yes.

505
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,739
The owner put them in the dry sauna, so…

506
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,994
And you're sober now?

507
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:49,915
Yes.

508
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,670
I've never met anyone
who could look so normal while wasted.

509
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,132
I wasn't totally wasted.

510
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:06,473
Don't do that from now on.
Don't go into the ocean while drunk.

511
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:09,768
Okay.

512
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,609
This is mine, right?

513
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:19,736
Yes.

514
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,747
When I was a kid,
my mom always bought me this after a bath.

515
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,124
Me too.

516
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:37,587
This was enough to make me happy.

517
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:48,348
But now, it seems like
I need much more to be happy.

518
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,569
Should we go now?

519
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,247
Time for a hangover remedy.

520
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:23,383
SEOPIRANG PORK CUTLETS

521
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,725
Why aren't you eating?
Shall I cut it for you?

522
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,476
No, I'll eat.

523
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:45,655
Which one is better?

524
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,327
You said Seogwang University
has excellent pork cutlets.

525
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:52,120
But isn't this better?

526
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:57,125
No, Seogwang University
has better pork cutlets.

527
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:04,299
So come with me next time and try some.

528
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:21,149
Did you go to school nearby here?

529
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:24,319
Yes.

530
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:42,504
It looks similar to the school I went to.

531
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,258
All elementary schools look similar.

532
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:48,760
Right.

533
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,054
Ready or not, here I come!

534
01:04:56,935 --> 01:05:00,397
Those kids look so happy.

535
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:06,361
A game of hide-and-seek
was enough to make us happy.

536
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:13,410
I was always the last one to survive.

537
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:20,875
I was never caught.

538
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,755
I always made sure to do
a good job at whatever I did.

539
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:33,388
I always found everyone in hiding.

540
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:43,606
I never gave up
and waited until they all came out.

541
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:57,704
What do visitors do in Tongyeong?

542
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:03,543
Seeing that I'm here,
I'm a little curious.

543
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,506
They all do the same thing.

544
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,676
They go to the beach,

545
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:13,178
eat seafood,

546
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,014
then take photos at the observatory.

547
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,683
Every tourist cliché.

548
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,943
-It's glass.
-Just come over here.

549
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:08,334
GUEST HOUSE

550
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:19,596
Thank you for everything today.

551
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,644
You should've gone home on the last bus.
There's nothing special here.

552
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,025
The things that aren't special…

553
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:34,527
All those things that everyone does…

554
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:37,614
is what I wanted to do.

555
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,380
I'm going now.

556
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:56,966
I can walk you home.

557
01:08:58,509 --> 01:08:59,802
It's all right.

558
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:04,265
Why? You don't want me
to know where you live?

559
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:12,482
See you tomorrow.

560
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:14,252
Yes?

561
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:22,635
Do you…

562
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:26,013
Do you want to drink with me?

563
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,454
Drinking soju without food is bad for you.

564
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,335
I drink soju like this all the time.

565
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:05,970
But…

566
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:09,515
are you sure you don't have to go home?

567
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,022
Do you want me to go, then?

568
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:22,028
No.

569
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:50,139
Why don't we play a game?

570
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:58,648
Instead of the Lying Game,
let's play the Truth Game.

571
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:04,695
I'll go first.

572
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:09,951
Why…

573
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:14,747
Why did you run away like that?

574
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,300
Back then, you said that…

575
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,056
you never asked me anything…

576
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:35,101
because you were afraid.

577
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,105
That you were scared.

578
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,736
I felt the same way.

579
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,951
I was afraid and scared.

580
01:12:56,914 --> 01:13:00,793
I kept pushing you away,
but you kept coming.

581
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:12,805
I'd run away,
but you always found me like this.

582
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,190
It felt like things might really work out.

583
01:13:28,446 --> 01:13:29,989
Why don't you let it happen, then?

584
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,004
Hating you when I wanted to hate you.

585
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,717
Dealing with things when it got tough.

586
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:55,640
And staying together…

587
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:00,937
even when I didn't get you.

588
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,112
I didn't have the confidence to do that.

589
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,751
Let me ask you a question too.

590
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:29,256
Why did you hesitate?

591
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:31,509
Back then, at the hotel.

592
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,975
Come to think of it,
you never gave me a reason.

593
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,403
It was for a short moment…

594
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,491
but I think I lacked the confidence too.

595
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:01,622
It wasn't for the reasons you said,

596
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:06,877
such as being a high school graduate
or just a service rep.

597
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:18,180
I wondered if I could
really be responsible for another person.

598
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:23,853
That's where my thoughts ended up.

599
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,361
Who said we were getting married?

600
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:44,415
I think I've always thought way ahead.

601
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:49,920
That way, I could be prepared
for any misfortunes…

602
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:53,674
that might come my way.

603
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,642
Was I…

604
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,065
a misfortune to you?

605
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:19,617
No.

606
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:25,498
Just a variable.

607
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:21,011
Something like this
is a real variable, right?

608
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,391
-Seoul, please.
-How many tickets?

609
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:34,019
Just one.

610
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:35,479
Put your credit card in.

611
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:48,742
This is honey bread.
A Tongyeong specialty.

612
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,003
The bus is here. Let's go.

613
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,255
Okay.

614
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:15,144
I'm sorry for leaving like that.

615
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:26,113
And thank you for coming like this.

616
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:38,292
About the bank…

617
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,007
I'll give it another thought.

618
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:58,645
Next week, let's go eat pork cutlets.

619
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,487
I'll call you once I'm in Seoul.

620
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:19,541
It's about to leave. You should get on.

621
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:26,131
You promise to call, right?

622
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:33,097
I will.

623
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:47,403
I don't have to see you off, right?

624
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:10,360
<i>That was…</i>

625
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:14,823
<i>my last moment with Su-yeong.</i>

626
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:28,212
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

627
