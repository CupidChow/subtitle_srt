THE INTEREST OF LOVE

2
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,735
<i>Perhaps it all began…</i>

3
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,575
<i>with me.</i>

4
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,841
<i>I shouldn't have made it obvious.</i>

5
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:37,723
<i>My pounding heart.</i>

6
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,773
<i>My hesitance.</i>

7
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,234
<i>Should I break up?</i>

8
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,034
Should I break up with Jong-hyeon?

9
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,203
<i>And my regret.</i>

10
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,879
<i>Because in the end…</i>

11
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,594
<i>I was the one who made him…</i>

12
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:21,850
<i>have second thoughts.</i>

CHEONGYEON ICE RINK

15
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,319
Why are you leaving?

16
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,243
I'm giving you a chance
to pretend like it didn't happen.

17
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,578
I don't want that.

18
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,081
It wasn't a mistake,
and I don't regret it.

19
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,376
I like you.

20
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,340
I know I'll sound like a jerk
for saying this right now,

21
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,551
but I'll take that risk.

22
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,513
I like you.

23
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,892
-Mr. Ha, our situation--
-I know it's too late.

24
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,064
I'm the one to blame for this situation.

25
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,234
I thought about it again and again…

26
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,697
but I'm done thinking now.

27
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,408
I can't do it anymore.

28
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:06,955
Ahn Su-yeong,

29
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,708
I like you.

30
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,134
I can't believe
Sang-su didn't show up tonight.

31
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:23,013
I had to ask our maid
to make all these dishes

32
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:23,930
EPISODE 11

33
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,432
especially delicious for him.

34
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,352
Something important came up.

35
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,607
He seemed well-mannered
and honest in person.

36
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,775
I did some digging

37
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,694
and found he has
a great reputation and a bright future.

38
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,112
That's to be expected.

39
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,865
How long will you work at the bank?

40
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,117
I think you've done enough.

41
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,330
What do you mean by "how long"?

42
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,290
It's a job I got on my own.

43
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,712
You're so proud
of what you've achieved in life,

44
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,340
but don't you think I had a hand in it?

45
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,432
You truly believe you deserved
that early promotion, don't you?

46
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,394
What do you mean?

47
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,819
Why do you look so surprised?

48
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,947
It was going to be yours anyway.
I just made it happen sooner.

49
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,490
What's bad about that?

50
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,578
Why can't I give them to you first
if you're going to get them anyway?

51
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,345
MY PERSON

52
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,361
You can drop me off here.

53
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,738
Okay.

54
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,845
Mr. Ha.

55
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,763
Yes?

56
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,769
Do you want to grab a drink with me?

57
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,399
Do you want to play a game?

58
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,571
The Lying Game.

59
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,661
The only catch is that
everything you say has to be a lie.

60
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,122
What?

61
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,794
Actually, I'm…

62
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,678
the daughter of Samjeon Group's chairman.

63
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,232
I never did any chores growing up,
so I'm pretty spoiled.

64
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,946
My hobby is spending money.

65
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,739
I see.

66
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,035
I work at the bank for fun.

67
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,622
And I let Mr. Yuk off the hook
because I felt bad for him.

68
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,962
I knew it. The way you put on airs

69
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,673
made me think you were
the youngest of a rich family.

70
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,593
I'm not the youngest, though.

71
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,391
I have a younger brother.

72
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,564
He's studying abroad.

73
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,451
Last week, I went fishing with my father.

74
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,247
We caught a carp this big.

75
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,375
No, wait. It was about this big.

76
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,424
And yesterday,

77
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,010
I won the lottery.

78
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:16,014
So I'll pay the bill tonight.

79
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,766
That's ridiculous.

80
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,209
I like you too, Mr. Ha.

81
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,593
I might have liked you first, actually.

82
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,811
I liked you from the moment I saw you.

83
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,690
When I'm with you,

84
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,112
I forget about my troubles.

85
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,075
And I forget about your troubles too.

86
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,249
I thought about what it would be like…

87
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,002
to quit my job at the bank…

88
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,385
and just hold hands with you.

89
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,068
And that's the end of the game.

90
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,300
<i>Like you said,</i>

91
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,219
I'm not 100% ready yet.

92
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,181
Are you okay with that?

93
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,815
No.

94
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,776
I'm not okay with that.

95
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,009
PARK MI-GYEONG

96
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,555
Did you call for a driver?

97
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,973
Yes.

98
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,108
MY PERSON

99
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,110
RECENT CALLS

100
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,984
PARK MI-GYEONG

101
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,987
POWER OFF

102
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,162
<i>The person you've reached is unavailable.</i>

103
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,172
You should go.

104
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,050
Okay.

105
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:37,979
You're home.

106
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,149
Yes, well…

107
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,817
You're home early.

108
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,069
I actually came in late.

109
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,741
Did you stop by somewhere after work?

110
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,328
Yes, for a bit.

111
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,997
Did you drink?

112
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,209
A little.

113
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,592
Then I guess you're probably not hungry.

114
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,902
Thanks to you,

115
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,447
my father was able to get surgery.

116
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,161
He just needs rehab now.

117
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,041
That's great. It really is.

118
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,752
And…

119
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:45,838
about the money…

120
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,675
As soon as I save up enough,
I'll pay you back immediately.

121
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,432
You don't have to pay…

122
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,817
You can take your time to pay me back.

123
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,534
Also…

124
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,498
May I stay here just a little longer?

125
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,796
I'm sorry.

126
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,266
Me too.

127
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,229
I'm sorry too.

128
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,401
Why are you sorry, Su-yeong?

129
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,070
Just because.

130
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,033
You can take your time moving out.

131
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,080
Thank you.

132
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,629
The food's getting cold. Let's eat.

133
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,394
<i>I like you too, Mr. Ha.</i>

134
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,065
I liked you from the moment I saw you.

135
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,251
<i>Thank you for the lies you told me today.</i>

136
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,337
THANK YOU FOR THE LIES YOU TOLD ME TODAY

137
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,650
KOREA CREDIT UNION

138
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,701
-Hello.
-Good morning.

139
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,536
-Hello.
-Hello.

140
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,204
-Hello.
-Hey.

141
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,832
Ms. Park, you must be tired.

142
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,875
I've never seen you look worn out before.

143
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,585
Is that so?

144
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,880
Were you on a date until late last night?

145
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,466
Sang-su, you know
that you get criticized twice as much

146
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,844
if your performance dips
while dating at work, right?

147
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,766
Don't you become twice as productive
when you date at work?

148
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,394
I see. Are you taking his side?

149
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,981
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think you were dating at work too.

150
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,149
Come on.

151
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,610
Make sure this doesn't cause
any problems at work.

152
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,530
You aren't in your twenties anymore.
Get to bed early.

153
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,532
Or else you'll be tired at work.

154
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,286
I feel more energetic
after a date, actually.

155
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,080
I'm sure it's the same for Mr. Ha.

156
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,461
Fine. I give up.

157
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,838
I hope you two will live
happily ever after.

158
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,968
Hello.

159
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,691
Did you all check
the announcement from HQ?

160
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,737
The Seogwang University branch is closing

161
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,864
and will turn into a subbranch.

162
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,159
The Youngpo district office has asked
that we take turns supporting it.

163
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,996
Our branch is up first
because we excel in many ways.

164
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,707
Any volunteers to work there
for three months?

165
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,174
Anyone?

166
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,014
I guess I'll have to choose then.

167
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:49,934
I'll go.

168
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,856
I need one more volunteer.

169
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,706
I'll go.

170
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:18,212
Seogwang University is my alma mater,
so it'll be good to volunteer there.

171
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,256
I'll go.

172
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,634
You're happy that you won't have to
report to anyone there, right?

173
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,552
Come on.

174
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:28,764
Then General Affairs can assume
Mr. So and Ms. Ahn's duties.

175
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,058
You two, come to my office
after the meeting.

176
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,435
All right, then.

177
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,645
Let's begin.

178
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,961
Can we talk for a minute?

179
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,259
Why are you going to the subbranch?

180
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,930
-Mr. Ha--
-Is it because of me?

181
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:11,890
And what I said yesterday?

182
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,602
I was bound to go anyway.

183
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,524
The General Consultation Team
has to focus on performance,

184
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,694
and Ms. Seo and Ms. Bae
aren't service reps.

185
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:29,241
Ji-yun isn't experienced yet,
so the only one left is me.

186
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:35,497
So you really aren't going because of me?

187
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,844
You wanted to volunteer, right?

188
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,054
Me? No.

189
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,347
Why would I?

190
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:55,184
I already know
that you used to like Su-yeong.

191
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,436
I'm sure you wanted to go.

192
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,063
What are you talking about?

193
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:03,192
All other women looked like ugly trolls
to me since the day I met you.

194
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:07,863
Really? Then what about Su-yeong?
Was she some pretty, little troll then?

195
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,248
Did you hear that?

196
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:19,625
I did.

197
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,878
That was the sound of me getting offended.

198
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,964
-Wait, do you doubt my love for you?
-Yes, I do.

199
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,550
And I'll keep doubting you,
so you'd better behave.

200
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,594
Okay. All right.

201
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:34,181
So can I get a hug now?
Just for a few seconds?

202
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,100
Just three seconds.

203
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,729
Go on now.

204
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,000
Why did you start laughing?

205
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:07,339
I mean, she called you a pretty troll.

206
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:13,178
Well, isn't it good to be called pretty,
even if you're a troll?

207
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,727
I'll get going.

208
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,822
Hello.

209
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,158
-How may I help you?
-Loans, please.

210
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,328
-This way, please.
-Thank you.

211
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,751
Mr. Lee, I need your approval.

212
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,502
-For that previous matter?
-Yes.

213
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,936
Thank you.

214
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,364
Number 357, please.

215
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,617
Number 357, present.

216
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:18,911
Mom?

217
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,497
I'm not here as Mom today.

218
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,666
Number 357 needs a loan.

219
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,293
A loan? Why?

220
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,587
The security deposit increased.

221
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,965
Hello, Ms. Han.

222
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,968
Hello. Thank you.

223
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,808
How much do you need?

224
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,313
I'll give it to you.
Don't take out a loan.

225
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,731
It's fine.

226
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,943
You moved out on your own,
so I'll plan my retirement on my own.

227
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,778
Let's each try our best in life.

228
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,072
Go inside. I'm taking the bus.

229
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,574
Grab a cab. You can afford that much.

230
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,496
Hey, Sang-su.

231
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:11,547
Never mind.

232
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,925
You should manage your own feelings too.

233
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,643
Then Mr. Ha, please grant me
the maximum amount for the loan.

234
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,105
-Bye.
-Bye.

235
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,276
Go back inside.

236
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,653
-Goodbye, then.
-Bye.

237
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,465
Has she left already?

238
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,342
Yes, just now.

239
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:15,944
Mi-gyeong.

240
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:20,741
What's wrong?

241
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,538
Nothing.

242
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,259
It's nothing.

243
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,273
Mi-gyeong.

244
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,985
Are you free today?

245
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,531
I have something to tell you.

246
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,039
I'm sorry. I have
a really important meeting today.

247
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,960
Then what about tomorrow?

248
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,088
I have to be somewhere tomorrow too.

249
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,682
You can just tell me now, Sang-su.

250
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,442
Let me know when you're free.
I'll make time for you.

251
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,239
Okay. I will.

252
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,495
What a shame.

253
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,999
We can't eat lunch together anymore.

254
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,377
I'll stop by every morning
for document approvals.

255
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,965
So why did you volunteer?

256
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:06,138
It's at a university, so you can
probably take it easy there, right?

257
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,768
I wanted a change of environment.

258
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,355
And I worked
at the Youngpo branch the longest.

259
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,150
Right, it's not like
we won't see you again.

260
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,736
Three months will fly by.

261
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,955
Who is it?

262
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,749
Sorry?

263
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,585
The one who made you volunteer
to work at the subbranch.

264
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,714
It's not like that.

265
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,092
Of course, it is.
Don't you know how perceptive I am?

266
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,261
I see everything.

267
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:49,181
You and Mr. Jeong. You and Ms. Park.

268
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,140
You and…

269
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,517
Mr. Ha.

270
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,857
Things seem strange these days.

271
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,612
Something is going on, right?

272
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,661
I'll see you later.

273
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:13,497
Okay.

274
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,216
I'm sorry. We should've talked first.

275
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:28,428
It's okay.
And it's only for three months, right?

276
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,473
It's all right.

277
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,977
It's not like I could've helped you
even if we had talked about it.

278
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,024
I'm not a boyfriend you can depend on,

279
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,610
so I feel bad about that.

280
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,155
It's not like that.

281
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,585
Thank you, ma'am. This way, please.

282
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,818
Is something going on
with your girlfriend today?

283
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,906
LOCKER ROOM

284
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,616
See you tomorrow.

285
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,118
Bye.

286
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,621
It's been a while,
so why don't we grab a drink?

287
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,541
He's right. It's been too long
since we had one. Let's go.

288
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,835
I found this awesome place.

289
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,800
-It's so good.
-I prepared your favorite.

290
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,677
You're the best.

291
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,346
Oh, my.

292
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,725
What brings you here?
You never come home on your own.

293
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,727
I thought I'd stop by.

294
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,938
-Hello, aunties.
-Hey.

295
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:04,733
You always ignore me
when I ask you to come by.

296
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,610
Why? Is she dating someone?

297
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,362
What's his family like?

298
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,363
Tell me.

299
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,450
Why do you want to know about his family?

300
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,327
Gosh, you and that tone of yours.

301
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,746
We finally made up today,
so don't pick a fight.

302
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,290
Both of you need to stop.
Today is a great day.

303
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,834
-Gosh.
-You're the only one feeling good today.

304
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,503
If you increase the rent

305
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,130
for all three buildings,
it'll amount to a lot.

306
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,427
Hello.

307
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,638
-How may I help you?
-Loans, please.

308
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,351
-So?
-A lot, actually.

309
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,145
-Gosh, good for you.
-Don't say that.

310
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,607
-Are you showing off again?
-Oh, my.

311
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,859
Stop it.

312
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,487
-This is good.
-I love the smell.

313
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:57,077
<i>Jong-hyeon,</i>
<i>I'm in front of the study café.</i>

314
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,528
Jong-hyeon, you left this behind.

315
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,323
The <i>yuja</i> tea was great.
Bring it again next time.

316
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,617
-Okay?
-Su-yeong.

317
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,705
Do you know this person?

318
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,292
Yes. She's my girlfriend.

319
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,587
I'm sorry for dropping by unexpectedly.

320
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,553
She's in my study group.

321
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,555
Hello.

322
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,725
Hello. I'm Cha Seon-jae.

323
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,605
CHA SEON-JAE

324
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,233
But you still answer his questions.
You're a good friend.

325
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:18,325
He says all kinds
of great things about you.

326
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,869
Gosh, you really are pretty.

327
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,016
She's cute. And bubbly.

328
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,812
Your friend, Seon-jae.

329
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,776
She's not cute. She's really annoying.

330
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,618
Su-yeong, please sit.

331
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,953
It's fine. You can sit.

332
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,121
Come on.

333
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,514
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

334
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,643
Is Ms. Park still not here?

335
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,020
I can't believe she's late.

336
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,439
Right? She's never late.

337
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,442
Sang-su, why is your girlfriend late?

338
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:36,986
Did you two have a fight?

339
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,448
Are you two finally breaking up?

340
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,784
-What a jerk!
-What a jerk!

341
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,869
What now?

342
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,329
-Who? Me?
-Yes.

343
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:48,915
-What?
-No, I mean…

344
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,000
There's a post on the online community.

345
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,294
This complete lunatic

346
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,881
had an affair with his ex of four years
as soon as he got married.

347
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:00,218
Why bother getting married
to the other woman then?

348
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,387
-That ex is now pregnant.
-What?

349
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,515
His wife caught them
walking into an OB-GYN clinic.

350
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,434
There's a photo too? Let me see.

351
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,857
His wife is something else, isn't she?

352
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:17,819
This is why you should
never make your wife angry.

353
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,489
It's a warning.

354
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:26,828
"You'd better get on your knees
and beg for mercy before I end you."

355
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,332
Which branch does he work at?
He's making all men look bad.

356
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,794
The worst person in this situation
is the lunatic

357
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,130
who got into an affair
after he got married.

358
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,632
I wonder who it is.
I'd love to see his face.

359
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,469
Let me see. I can guess.

360
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,429
<i>Yes, it's me.</i>

361
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,265
My wife tailed me.

362
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,645
I knew she took them,
but not that she'd upload them.

363
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:57,317
So you've been talking
to Jeong-eun this whole time?

364
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,694
Yes.

365
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,280
You even registered your marriage.

366
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,865
Luckily, we haven't done that.

367
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,994
What's with the OB-GYN?

368
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,455
Well, she really isn't pregnant.

369
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,248
Jeong-eun has bad PMS.

370
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,250
What's that?

371
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,212
Premenstrual syndrome.
We went for a prescription, really.

372
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,300
What now?

373
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,177
I should end it, right?

374
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,262
With whom?

375
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,056
My wife.

376
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,434
So that's your decision.

377
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,438
I finally realized it.

378
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,483
I can live without my wife,
but not Jeong-eun.

379
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,986
I don't care if the whole bank finds out.

380
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,490
You don't care?

381
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,910
They'll know when we're divorced,
and I'm already scum.

382
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:54,749
I wouldn't say you're scum.
It's not like you committed a felony.

383
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:58,670
Who cares about what happens
between a man and a woman?

384
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,381
People's feelings can change overnight.

385
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,635
I'm actually a little scared, guys.

386
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,095
Are people trash-talking me?

387
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,263
Yes.

388
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,516
They'll find out soon enough
that I'm Mr. Affair, right?

389
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,642
Yes.

390
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:18,857
You shouldn't have let her catch you.
You should've been careful, you idiot.

391
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,193
Someone as clumsy as you
shouldn't have affairs.

392
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:29,701
Goodness, never mind.
It's not a big deal, okay?

393
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,786
There are worse things in life.

394
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,372
And your life won't end
because of some criticism.

395
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,999
Hey, keep your chin up.

396
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,464
Mr. So.

397
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,592
We have to leave now.

398
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,347
I'm off to the subbranch, then.

399

400
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,701
You're all set.

401
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,660
Thank you.

402
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,871
Do you usually eat in the cafeteria?

403
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,122
Yes, mostly.

404
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,917
I can help the next person here.

405
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,718
What is it? Worried about Ms. Park?

406
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,887
Has she called yet?

407
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,222
No.

408
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,017
Why don't you go to lunch early?

409
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,064
Go find out what's going on.

410
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,445
Gosh, being too considerate
has always been a weakness of mine.

411
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,072
I'm so cool.

<i>Why are you calling at this hour?</i>

420
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,698
Were you asleep?

421
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,743
It's almost noon, Mi-gyeong.

422
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,205
What?

423
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,251
My gosh. I must be insane.

424
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,211
I just woke up.

425
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,174
I'll get ready and go.

426

Do you want to join me?

431
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,880
I'll eat on my own.

432
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,381
Okay. Enjoy your lunch.

433
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,816
Do you go here? Where's the main building?

434
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,987
It's up that way.

435
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,363
Thank you.

436

<i>This is SGBS broadcasting.</i>

437

<i>The seasons have changed,</i>
<i>and the temperature has dropped too.</i>

438
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,733
<i>There's a movie</i>
<i>that I'm reminded of around this time.</i>

439
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:38,991
<i>Let's begin today's episode</i>
<i>with lines from this movie.</i>

440
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,579
<i>"It's an awkward moment."</i>

441
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:49,752
<i>"The woman lowers her head</i>
<i>and gives the man an opportunity."</i>

442
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,754
<i>It's an awkward moment.</i>

443
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,633
Hey.

444
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:00,721
Can we…

445
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,476
Can we do this again?

446
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,730
I don't like undefined relationships.

447
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,984
<i>The woman gives the man an opportunity.</i>

448
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,991
<i>But the man doesn't have</i>
<i>the courage to approach her.</i>

449
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,038
<i>The woman turns around.</i>

450
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,837
<i>Those days have passed…</i>

451
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,343
<i>and everything since then has disappeared.</i>

452
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:47,268
<i>The time that has passed</i>
<i>is like a dusty window.</i>

453
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,396
<i>You can see through it,</i>

454

<i>If I can break the window…</i>

457
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,665
<i>I might be able to go back to that time.</i>

458
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:18,466
<i>These are lines from</i> In the Mood for Love.

459
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,887
<i>I share this with my fellow students</i>
<i>who hesitate for reasons</i>

<i>Do not hesitate.</i>

462
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,520
<i>Because this moment of hesitation may be…</i>

<i>when you're in the mood for love.</i>

464
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,407
What were you like as a student here?

465
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,538
All I ever did was study.

466
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,250
I never went on blind dates
or group blind dates.

467
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,253
Are you sure it wasn't
because you weren't popular?

468
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:45,261
Su-yeong, you would've been popular.

469
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:48,806
I think so too.

470
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:56,856
Have you had lunch?

471
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,152
I hear
the pork cutlets are excellent here.

472
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:08,826
I have to head back. I only came out
for a bit during my lunch break.

473
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,083
Let's eat pork cutlets next time.

474
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:43,819
I'm sorry.

475
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,202
I'm sorry.

Ms. Park Mi-gyeong.

477
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,041
I had the wrong idea about you.

478
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,126
I'm sorry.

479
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:03,297
I thought you were perfect at everything.

480
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,509
But you're just human like the rest of us.

481
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:10,179
I feel closer to you now.

482
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,222
Right, Mr. Lee?

483
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,307
-Sure.
-Yes.

484
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,017
It won't happen again.

485
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,477
No, it's fine.

486
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,312
-Go sit at your desk now.
-Yes, sir.

487
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,159
I sent Sang-su your way.

488
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,411
Sorry?

489
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:38,624
Just letting you know that I'm the one
who told Sang-su to pick you up.

490
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,128
Where is he?

491
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:48,926
What's going on?

492
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,137
I thought he left to pick you up.

493
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,180
He did.

494
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,808
He had to stop by somewhere
before returning here.

495
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,269
Okay, then.

496
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,871
<i>Su-yeong.</i>

497
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,707
<i>I have my study group today,</i>
<i>so I'll be late.</i>

498
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,627
Ms. Ahn, do you want to come too?

499
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,212
Sorry?

500
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:29,133
I'm having a drink with people
from the Youngpo district office.

501
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,760
I thought it might be nice
to go together as a team.

502
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:37,808
Okay, then.

503
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,271
I'll go.

504
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:47,735
Okay.

505
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:14,261
Can we talk for a minute?

506
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:20,601
Is it really something
that will only take a minute?

507
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,110
Next time.

508
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,571
I told you I have somewhere to be.

509
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,282
Right. Okay.

510
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:38,535
I'll get going then.

511
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,258
-It's nice to meet everyone!
-Nice to meet you!

512
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:58,097
-That's nice.
-Gosh.

513
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,391
We should do this more often.

514
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,060
Then make it happen, okay?

515
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,436
-Okay.
-Pour me another.

516
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:09,400
No, I'm very grateful.
But why the sudden change of heart?

517
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:16,073
I see. Thank you. Goodbye, ma'am.

518
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,660
LANDLADY

519
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,919
Have you been well, Ms. Han?

520
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:29,878
Yes.

521
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,631
It's just me today.

522
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:36,385
I didn't get to greet you properly
at the bank last time, so…

523
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,242
<i>I'm having a drink with Su-yeong.</i>

524
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,374
SO GYEONG-PIL

525
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:15,007
It's been a while since that brief time
at the training institute.

526
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,216
Have you been well?

527
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,427
Yes.

528
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,138
He wanted to have a drink with you before,

529
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,766
so he had asked Mr. Ha
to set him up and everything.

530
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:27,811
I'm just glad
to finally grab a drink with you.

531
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,150
Still cool as ever, isn't she?

532
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,276
She's quite charming.

533
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:39,990
Anyway, I heard the story on Blind is
about Yang Seok-hyeon at your branch.

534
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,702
Really? I don't know. I have no idea.

535
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,871
You don't have to watch what you say.

536
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,332
Everyone knows everything at the bank.

537
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,542
The man has been identified as Seok-hyeon,

538
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,337
and even his mistress's address
has been leaked.

539
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,756
I heard the mistress is really pretty.

540
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,050
You know her, right?

541
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:01,428
How pretty is she?

542
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,890
Is she as pretty as Ms. Ahn here?

543
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:09,144
Gosh, it looks like you've had
one too many drinks already.

544
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,063
You're talking all sorts of nonsense.

545
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,858
Ms. Ahn, do you know who the mistress is?

546
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,697
-No.
-Come on.

547
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,200
Rumors say
that she works at the same branch.

548
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,538
Is it…

549
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:31,041
-Hey.
-What? I was just asking.

550
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,794
I mean, I heard the mistress
is unbelievably pretty.

551
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:37,131
So at the very least,
she has to be as pretty as Ms. Ahn

552
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,967
for him to leave the daughter
of the vice president of FSS.

553
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,888
You're right. I'm the mistress.

554
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:50,185
I'm the mistress who hit on Mr. Yang
and made him get a divorce.

555
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:53,647
I'm the one who might be
pregnant right now.

556
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,942
We know it's not you.
Why would you say that?

557
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,236
If you knew, then why did you ask?

558
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:04,491
If you knew it wasn't me,
why did you make those absurd remarks?

559
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,162
Do I seem like a joke to you?

560
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,039
Gosh, she's sensitive.

561
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,626
It was a harmless joke over drinks.

562
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,253
A joke?

563
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,632
Gosh, why are you so mad?

564
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:23,093
It's as if you really got caught
in an affair.

565
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,929
If you're innocent, then there's no reason

566
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,514
to get so mad, right?

567
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,057
Let's be honest.

568
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:33,061
I'm sure you already know
you're caught up in all kinds of rumors.

569
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:38,400
If you don't want that, then make it clear
that you either like someone or you don't.

570
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:40,360
Stop confusing people by smiling.

571
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,613
Come on. Stop right there.

572
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,532
See this?

573
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:52,122
I think I've recorded more than enough
of your problematic comments.

574
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,000
Stop it, Mr. So.

575
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,335
You can't be serious.

576
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:04,635
Are you okay?

577
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,389
I should be asking you that.

578
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:10,974
He's your friend.

579
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:16,438
Well, I'm friends with some people,
but not others, so it's fine.

580
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:21,068
If he does that again,
just record him like I did.

581
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,320
He'll apologize easily then.

582
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,456
Goodbye, then.

583
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,084
Bye.

584
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,514
Does it taste okay?

585
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,974
By any chance…

586
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:59,022
Did you have something to do
with the security deposit?

587
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:11,493
Please keep it a secret
from Sang-su, Ms. Han.

588
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,961
I don't want to keep
any secrets from Sang-su.

589
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,547
I never did much for him as a mother,

590
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:27,384
but having a clear conscience
matters the most when it comes to him.

591
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:35,350
I'll talk to the landlady again.
Let's pretend this never happened.

592
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:47,738
Sang-su must take after you.

593
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,700
I'm sorry if I overstepped.

594
00:56:56,330 --> 00:57:02,085
Ms. Han, I forgot
that I had to do something important.

595
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,921
If you don't mind, may I leave?

596
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,760
Of course. Come with Sang-su next time.

597
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,011
Okay.

598
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:18,185
Sang-su.

599
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:26,818
I'm sorry. I have to leave now.
Please eat with your mother for me.

600
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,614
I look forward to seeing you again.

601
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,664
Just stay. I'm going to leave now.

602
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:05,440
You're here.

603
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,948
They all know about Seok-hyeon.

604
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,201
I met with the district office employees.

605
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,453
They're dying to find out

606
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:21,081
who his mistress is,
and how the story goes.

607
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:26,003
Poor Su-yeong.
She was humiliated for just being there.

608
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,172
What do you mean?

609
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:33,635
They got drunk and asked
if Su-yeong was that mistress.

610
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:43,020
But you know,
reality isn't too far-fetched from that.

611
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,442
Depending on what you do,
what happened to her

612
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:51,445
-might become her reality.
-So Gyeong-pil.

613
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,488
You know, I don't care

614
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:57,826
if you date one woman or two.
I don't even care if it's a whole group.

615
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:01,788
There are certain people
who can handle situations like that.

616
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,208
But you're not one of them.

617
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:14,259
Also, there are feelings
that you have to give up…

618
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,471
in order to protect them.

619
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,062
How much do you know?

620
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,610
How much do you know,
to where you keep pushing my buttons

621
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,445
as if it's some joke to you?

622
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,909
Is this funny to you?

623
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:39,868
No.

624
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,370
It's not funny at all.

625
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,588
Will you break up?

626
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,093
Will you break up…

627
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,637
with Mi-gyeong?

628
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,686
I don't have to answer that.

629
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:11,066
Okay.

630
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,319
It's your business. Right.

631
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:17,989
Best of luck to you.

632
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:23,161
It's up to you to make sure that
Su-yeong and Mi-gyeong get less hurt.

633
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:41,990
PARK MI-GYEONG

634
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:42,949
CALL

635
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,698
<i>Mi-gyeong, we need to talk.</i>

636
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:37,963
<i>Let's meet after work tomorrow.</i>

637
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:40,215
<i>I'll tell you where later.</i>

638
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,830
Are you just now coming in?

639
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:12,831
Yes.

640
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,334
How are your studies going?

641
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:20,839
I'm just doing my best.

642
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,301
Good luck.

643
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,637
I'm rooting for you.

644
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,597
I really am.

645
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,564
KCU BANK
SEOGWANG UNIVERSITY SUBBRANCH

646
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:51,995
JEONG JONG-HYEON

647
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:59,502
Yes. I'll see you there then.
Okay. I'll call you later.

648
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,008
-Hello.
-Hello.

649
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,635
-I'd like to look at some bouquets.
-Sure.

650
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,306
Sang-su, you're here.

651
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,894
They wanted to celebrate my birthday too.

652
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:44,691
Take a seat.

653
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:54,284
Isn't this pretty?

654
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:56,786
They gave it to me as a birthday gift.

655
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,456
But why are you empty-handed?

656
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:02,375
You'd better sing
my birthday song well then.

657
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,505
Okay, I will.

658
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:30,653
Look at you two.

659
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,156
You still act as if
you just started dating.

660
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:35,617
Are you two that happy?

661
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,995
No, it's just that I eat a lot.

662
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:48,046
Sang-su. You see it, too, right?
That they're really into each other.

663
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,679
Su-yeong, how are things at the subbranch?

664
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,392
It's easier, and it's not
as busy as the Youngpo branch.

665
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:06,731
That's a relief.
You deserve to take it easy, Su-yeong.

666
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:11,611
Isn't our school pretty?
It's a great place to take walks.

667
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:16,741
Maybe Sang-su and I
should've volunteered to go instead.

668
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:26,751
It must be sad for you, though, Mr. Jeong.
Doesn't it feel empty without her?

669
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:33,049
It's all right.
We see each other often outside of work.

670
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,594
Right.

671
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:40,390
I guess we're the ones
who don't get to see her often.

672
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,984
Don't you feel empty, Sang-su?

673
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,365
I mean, you've worked with her
for a long time.

674
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:03,121
You two have worked together
for three to four years, right?

675
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,081
That sounds about right.

676
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,713
If you suddenly don't see her
after all that time,

677
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:13,881
wouldn't you feel empty?

678
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:32,483
I'm sorry, you two. Can we be excused?

679
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,114
Sure. That's fine with us.

680
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,578
Let's go.

681
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:57,216
I'm sorry. Excuse us.

682
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:11,147
Stop the car. We need to talk.

683
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,774
We'll talk later.

684
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:14,734
Mi-gyeong.

685
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,528
I said we'll talk later.

686
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:25,078
-We have to do it today.
-Today is my birthday!

687
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:49,811
I told you I wanted to talk later!

688
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,066
Do you really think that I don't know?

689
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:03,408
Do you think I have no idea
where your true feelings lie?

690
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:21,592
Su-yeong.

691
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,475
I have a question.

692
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:39,026
<i>They're living together.</i>

693
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:44,240
Su-yeong and Mr. Jeong
are living together!

694
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:54,417
I'm sorry.

695
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,425
Let's break up.

696
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:25,531
Do you really like me?

697
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:38,878
Do you love me?

698
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,718
<i>Who is she anyway?</i>

699
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:51,474
What on earth does she mean to you?!

700
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:24,173
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

701
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:47,738
If you break up with me,
will she leave Mr. Jeong and come to you?

702
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:49,323
I have something to give you.

703
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:52,702
I don't want you to feel better.
Think twice about him.

704
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:55,663
<i>I'm going to keep liking you.</i>

705
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,748
Have you thought this through?

706
01:12:57,832 --> 01:13:00,167
No. I'm done thinking.
I decided that a while ago.

707
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:03,588
Mi-gyeong and I have decided to break up.

708
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:07,884
<i>-Why did you do that?</i>
<i>-I want to feel comfortable for a change.</i>

709
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:09,927
<i>So go ahead and hate me.</i>

710
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:16,517
