I'll transfer that client
to the credit guarantee foundation.

The guarantee fund has a higher limit,

Yes, sir. I'll go back and wrap it up.

Yes, all right.

It just ended. He'll come and wrap it up.

60
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,174
Sang-su can't afford to go out
and act cool right now.

61
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,969
He should be at work
trying to improve his performance.

00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,305
The in-house broadcasting team as well.

Where are their manners? Good grief.

64
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,019
Because both you and those people
want to rest on the weekend.

65
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,028
Mr. Ha's interview is up
on the bank's social media.

66
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:03,655
Let me see.

67
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,534
My gosh. What is that?

68
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,870
He seems different in this light.

69
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,124
Right? He looks like
a real athlete in this uniform.

70
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,001
If you like him, ask him out.

71
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,086
Even if I did, he'd probably say no.

72
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,797
Men are more particular these days.

73
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,551
I'm just a service rep
who went to college outside of Seoul.

74
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,053
So what? We're all bank clerks.

75
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,348
Actually, we're not all the same.

76
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:34,394
Service reps are people
with unlimited contracts.

77
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,063
But people with regular positions
are formally recruited.

78
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,609
So you need to transfer positions
while you're still young.

79
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,695
If you don't, you'll end up like Su-yeong.

80
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,280
Goodness.

81
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:49,993
You always manage to say things
that rub people the wrong way.

82
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,080
Speaking of Su-yeong, where is she?

83
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,878
She always eats lunch alone.
Who knows where she goes off to?

84
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,827
Hey, Auntie.
You got your hair permed. You look great!

85
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,621
-Can I get married now?
-Of course!

86
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,705
-Goodness.
-You're pretty!

87
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,540
Hey, you're here already?

88
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,625
-Hey.
-My gosh.

89
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,293
You just had knee surgery!

90
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,711
-Goodness.
-I'm fine.

91
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,712
No.

92
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,631
Take it easy, and don't get hurt again.

93
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,257
I'm fine.

94
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,385
Auntie, you don't look well.

95
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,636
Are you ill?

96
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,305
Your investment savings matured.
Come by sometime.

97
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,683
-Okay, I will.
-Good.

98
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,309
Hey, Mr. So-Nosy. You're good at this.

99
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,938
Hello, Auntie!

100
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,440
Auntie! Two <i><font color="white">gukbaps,</font></i> please.

101
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,692
Okay, sure.

102
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,068
-Hi, Auntie.
-Come on in.

103
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,284
You look great on camera.

104
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,870
I can picture your value skyrocketing.

105
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,039
What good is all that?

106
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,042
It's good for dating, that's what.
Don't play innocent.

107
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,629
Wait, do you like someone in particular?

108
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:25,797
Like Ahn Su-yeong?

109
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,299
What are you talking about?

110
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,468
I saw you two in the morning

111
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,805
-blinking like this.
-When did I do that?

112
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,640
I thought you had an eye infection.

113
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,476
Here we go.

114
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,895
Help yourself to more side dishes later.

115
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,105
Okay.

116
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,774
-Auntie, it's time you came by the bank.
-Okay, sure.

117
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,234
-Stop by, okay?
-Got it.

118
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,278
-I love you!
-Goodness.

119
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,365
Gosh, you're so considerate.

120
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,783
I might fall for you.

121
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,326
And I'll turn you down.

122
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:01,207
She was your immediate supervisor
when you were a rookie, right?

123
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,669
Was she? So what?

124
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,755
That was already three years ago.

125
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,175
You had plenty of time
to have started something with her.

126
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,801
Be quiet and wipe your hands.

127
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,763
Well, I suppose

128
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,557
that it's wiser just to work
and move up to the head office.

129
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,603
I hear human resources
always spot office romances first, anyway.

130
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,248
I told you not to call.

131
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,043
Please just leave me alone.

132
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,941
Do you want this?

133
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,502
Hey, what about this?

134
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,629
Come on. That's your style.

135

00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:49,500
<i><font color="white">Please make sure to take</font></i>
<i><font color="white">all your belongings. Thank you.</font></i>

152
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,420
Ma'am, I think this
is all you've received so far.

153
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,672
Please get some ramyeon
and water with this,

154
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,841
and then talk to your son again, okay?

155
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,468
-I will.
-Okay.

156
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,636
Thank you. Goodbye.

157
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,138
-Goodbye.
-Thank you again.

158
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:07,769
Have you had lunch yet?

159
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,479
I'm about to head out.

160
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,900
Here. Take this.
It's surplus money from this month.

161
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,443
You don't have to do this.

162
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,570
Go eat something good.

163
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,824
I'm sorry, but no.

164
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,660
-Everyone is waiting.
-But I'm busy.

165
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,120
No, please take a number first.

166
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,081
We're not supposed to do this,

167
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,084
but we'll make it happen.

168
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,293
I'll process it now.

169
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,963
You said you were moving.
Did you find a nice place?

170
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,381
I brought the paperwork.

171
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,466
You're here for a refund and not a loan?

172
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,427
Mr. Ha here will help you with the refund.

173
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,470
-Mr. Ha.
-But…

174
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,430
Thanks a lot.

175
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,226
Yes, how may I help you?

176
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,936
-A refund.
-A refund?

177
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,563
Can I see your ID, please?

178
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,607
Do you have any more questions?

179
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,900
No, thank you. I'm fine.

180
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,777
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

181
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,407
SECTION CHIEF
HA SANG-SU

182
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,788
Mr. Lee, I need these approved.

183
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,499
How much longer do I have to wait?

184
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,751
Please wait, and you'll be called in time.

185
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:14,877
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,754
Jeez, I already read an entire magazine.

187
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,675
-You're all set. Thank you.
-Thank you.

188
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,677
Should I take a few?

189
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,471
Yes, thank you.

190
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,350
Next, please.

191
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,062
How may I help you?

192
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,525
Number 418, I can help you at window two.

193
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,819
Hello.

194
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,530
Hello. How may I help you?

195
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,948
I came for my credit card.

196
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,950
Can I see your ID, please?

197
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,079
Your shirt looks great, sir.

198
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,665
I'm heading to the airport
for Jeju Island.

199
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,250
It's an alumni trip.

200
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,295
-Gosh, you're so lucky.
-Yes.

201
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,173
-Mr. Kim Seong-hun.
-Yes.

202
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,801
One second, please.

203
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,598
What kind of nonsense is this?

204
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,146
The highest amount of interest
I can get is 300,000 won,

205
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,316
but I can lose up to
3.5 million won in the end.

206
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,028
That's true, but as I told you,
the US index rarely falls--

207
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,529
Will you take responsibility, then?

208
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,866
It's written right here.
"There is a risk of principal loss."

209
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,577
Would you take up something
to make a mere 300,000 won

210
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,038
at the risk of losing 3.5 million won?

211
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,706
KIM SEONG-HUN

212
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,751
…because you wanted higher interest
than regular savings.

213
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,710
-I--
-Wait!

214
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,670
So you're saying…

215
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,048
-Your card, sir.
-I didn't know any better…

216
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,842
-Enjoy your trip.
-so you wanted to deceive me?

217
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:46,928
SENIOR CLERK
AHN SU-YEONG

218
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,262
I'm sorry for the confusion.

219
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,140
Do you think I'm some kind of an idiot?

220
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,561
I can't believe this!

221
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,314
I'm sorry. Let me show you
another product--

222
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,732
Forget it!

223
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,403
Take this yourself
and do whatever you want!

224
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,157
Who are you?

225
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,844
Here.

226
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,095
Thank you.

227
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,351
You need to perform well
to transfer positions, right?

228
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,397
I'm totally on your side.

229
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,984
But you need to know your clients
before you offer them products.

230
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,029
No matter how well you perform,
if you keep getting complaints,

231
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,073
you'll end up losing in the end.

232
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,284
You're right.

233
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,621
Gosh.

234
00:15:55,705 --> 00:16:00,460
I think it's ridiculous to differentiate
between service reps and regular clerks.

235
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:05,089
One Ahn Su-yeong is way better
than a truck full of university graduates.

236
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,138
Su-yeong, where's the credit card
for Mr. Kim Seong-hun?

237
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,098
He came to collect it,

238
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,143
but this card is
for Mr. Kim Seong-hun, the VIP.

239
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,489
-Mr. Ha.
-Yes, sir.

240
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,782
Mr. Ha Sang-su.

241
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,869
Is there trouble at home?

242
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,080
Or do you have something against me?

243
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:43,461
How can a bank clerk give out a card
without checking the numbers first?

244
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,673
And why did you make
this ridiculous mistake…

245
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:52,136
How can you give
someone else's card to a VIP client?

246
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:56,766
Have you gone…
Look at this guy. Have you lost your mind?

247
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,850
I'm sorry.

248
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,061
I was busy, so I asked him
to do it for me.

249
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,315
What kind of nonsense is this?

250
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,902
The highest amount of interest
I can get is 300,000 won,

251
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,655
but I can lose up to
3.5 million won in the end.

252
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,698
KIM SEONG-HUN
DANGSONG DISTRICT

253
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,742
KIM SEONG-HUN
JANGCHUNG DISTRICT

254
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,577
What?

255
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,164
Is that so, Ms. Ahn?
You asked him to do that?

256
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,833
All right, then.

257
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,920
Since Kim Seong-hun
is a one-of-a-kind name,

258
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,298
and there couldn't possibly be
two clients with the same name,

259
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,176
you asked him to do a quick, sloppy job?

260
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,136
-I'm sorry.
-On top of that,

261
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,682
you told him to give
a lower-tier card to the VIP,

262
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:43,229
and a VIP card to a lower-tier customer
in a noble effort to redistribute wealth?

263
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,399
I see.
What a great thought. Very nicely done.

264
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,699
Why are you just standing there?
Go to Jeju Island now!

265
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,742
Hey, Ms. Ahn. You go with him.

266
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,203
You've known this client
for some time, right?

267
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,456
What if he gets offended
and changes his primary bank?

268
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,418
If he says that,
then I'm seriously going to…

269
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,134
-Over there.
-Okay. Are we late?

270
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,761
We'll see when we get there.

271
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,144
Thank you.

272
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,902
-We're here.
-I see.

273
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,029
I'm sorry.

274
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,638
That's better, right?

275
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,224
Yes.

276
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,148
I can't believe we're on a plane
to Jeju Island right now.

277
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,318
I feel the same way.

278
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,155
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

279
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:17,782
Not at all.

280
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,117
I was the one who made a mistake.

281
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,620
I'm sorry.

282
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,250
Okay, then.

283
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,961
Let's agree this is your fault, Mr. Ha.

284
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,759
Why are you smiling?

285
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:42,473
This reminds me of the old days
when you first came to our branch.

286
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,894
I see.

287
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,690
Two rookies have arrived at our branch.

288
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,318
They're first and last place
in their trainee class.

289
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,362
Ha Sang-su and So Gyeong-pil.

290
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,155
Give them a hand.

291
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,911
Just to let you know,
I came in last place.

292
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,082
But you're first place
when it comes to humor.

293
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,877
Also, Ms. Seo Min-hui
will return next month

294
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,713
from maternity leave.

295
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,465
So, for now, the Goddess
of our Youngpo branch,

296
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,468
Ms. Ahn Su-yeong,
can train him in deposit duties.

297
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,720
Yes, sir.

298
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,680
<i><font color="white">When I first came here as a rookie,</font></i>

299
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,474
<i><font color="white">Su-yeong was</font></i>
<i><font color="white">the Goddess of Youngpo branch.</font></i>

300
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,440
A withdrawal mistake?
A withdrawal mistake on your first day?

301
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,235
-Senior Clerk Ha Sang-su.
-Yes?

302
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,154
Weren't you the top of the trainees?

303
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,865
I thought that
we finally got a solid rookie,

304
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,284
but how did we end up with this idiot?

305
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:47,163
Hey, how can a bank clerk
withdraw money twice?

306
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,041
Is that your own money?
Is it? Say something!

307
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,251
I'm sorry.

308
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,128
Mr. So, get over here.

309
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,380
<i><font color="white">-My first day…</font></i>
-How in the world was he trained?

310
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:59,049
<i><font color="white">I made a mistake</font></i>
<i><font color="white">withdrawing money before the goddess.</font></i>

311
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,176
What are you going to do?

312
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,427
I'll train him, sir.

313
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,053
-Get over here!
<i><font color="white">-This was the moment…</font></i>

314
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,765
-All of you!
<i><font color="white">-I went from top trainee to idiot.</font></i>

315
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,893
You two trained together.
What should I do with him?

316
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,104
-You learned this in training, right?
-Yes.

317
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:16,650
Secure this right here
between your left middle and ring fingers.

318
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,696
Fold it. Good.

319
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,409
Move your right thumb up and down.
Then count the cash with your ring finger.

320
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:35,002
Wait, move this finger.
Like this. One by one.

321
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,754
I see.

322
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,842
I can't move my ring finger well.

323
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,805
Even if you use a money counter,
you have to double-check it.

324
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:49,475
Lastly, put the clean bills
in the front and back.

325
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,771
-Then hold it with your index finger.
-I see. Like this?

326
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,233
And secure it like this.

327
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,199
Then stamp the stack
to show who counted the bills.

328
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,331
-Give it a try.
-Okay.

329
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,005
-Wrap it tightly.
-Line it up…

330
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,521
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

331
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,982
Goodness, you came all this way for this?

332
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,066
It's all right, sir.

333
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,152
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

334
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:46,365
Yes, we gave him the right card.
Thankfully, Mr. Kim was understanding…

335
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,454
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

336
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,084
Yes, I'll return right away.

337
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,169
Yes, sir.

338
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,914
Do you have someone to send them to?

339
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,212
I mean, you seemed
invested in taking pictures.

340
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,506
So…

341
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,217
Are they for your boyfriend?

342
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,306
I don't have a boyfriend.

343
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,727
I took pictures because it's pretty here.

344
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,276
I see.

345
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,632
It must have fallen from up there.

346
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,719
Just leave it alone.

347
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,351
If humans touch the eggs,
mother birds push them out of the nest.

348
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,186
Can it survive like this?

349
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,022
It'll end up broken anyway.

350
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,235
But there's a chance it won't.

351
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,780
It might be fine
if I cover it with this and put it back.

352
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,534
Let's help it first
and let the mother bird decide later.

353
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:58,122
It doesn't matter if it breaks.
I'd feel bad if we didn't try.

354
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:11,844
I think…

355
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,014
it might be faster if I climb up.

356
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,567
Should I get on my knees, then?

357
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,193
Sorry?

358
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,070
I'll get down, and you can step up.

359
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,451
-Are you sure?
-Yes, it's fine.

360
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,047
Thank you.

361
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,513
-The egg, please.
-Okay.

362
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,322
-Did you get up?
-Can you hand me the egg?

363
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,406
Sure.

364
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,116
Here.

365
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,672
Be safe.

366
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,175
Are you done?

367
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:34,843
Yes.

368
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:47,898
What should I…

369
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,255
Thank you.

370
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,892
See? I was right.

371
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,144
Yes.

372
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,980
I was wrong.

373
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,858
I'm glad we helped.

374
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,741
Ms. Ahn?
We have some time left until our flight.

375
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,787
Do you want to go somewhere nearby?

376
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,126
We should probably wait at the airport.

377
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,506
Right. Okay.

378
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,263
Can you take a photo for me?
I'd like to remember today.

379
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,306
Sure.

380
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,064
One, two, three.

381
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,069
One more time. One, two, three.

382
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,036
Thank you.

383
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,892
The balance is correct.

384
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,187
Let's call it a day.

385
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,606
-Good job.
-Great job today.

386
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,192
-Good work.
-Goodbye.

387
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,401
See you tomorrow.

388
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,237
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

389
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,321
Goodbye.

390
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,824
Let's grab a drink.

391
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,036
A drink, my foot.

392
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,164
Seok-hyeon is about to break up
with his girlfriend.

393
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,669
Okay, let's go.

394
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:18,757
Are you headed out to get wasted?
A consolation party for Sang-su's mistake?

395
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,093
Yesterday, it was Seok-hyeon.
Today, it was Sang-su.

396
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,887
Is it Gyeong-pil's turn tomorrow?

397
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,806
Stop messing around together.

398
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,768
You three keep hanging out together
and make people call you that thing.

399
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,770
What was it? I can't remember.

400
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,188
Mr. Ma, what was it again?

401
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,690
The Three Idiots of Youngpo.

402
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,025
Right. The Three Idiots of Youngpo.

403
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,819
-Sang-su.
-Yes?

404
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,738
You're different.
You need to maintain your image.

405
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,533
Let's go. I'll make you feel better.

406
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,538
Do you have time in your busy day
to boost the morale of your associate?

407
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,623
Why do you think I like being single?

408
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,668
I have no wife or children to look after,
so I'm free after work!

409
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,920
You have my respect, sir. Let's go.

410
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,258
-You were great today.
-You too.

411
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,759
Ms. Ahn, you should join us.

412
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,469
Mr. Lee is going too.

413
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,805
I have another engagement.
See you tomorrow.

414
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,266
You have a lot of those.

415
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,728
Ms. Seo, go home right away.

416
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,739
<i><font color="white">She definitely has a boyfriend.</font></i>

417
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:28,201
She's obviously the type
that guys would line up for.

418
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,632
<i><font color="white">She might have more than one.</font></i>

419
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,427
Some say she sees
a different guy every day.

420
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:49,681
Have you seen her
with a different guy every day, Mr. Ma?

421
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:51,808
Come on.

422
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:55,145
Why else would she refuse to come out?
It's all because of men.

423
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,482
She's the type who lives up to her looks--

424
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,566
-Hey.
-My gosh.

425
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,859
What are you doing?

426
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,653
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

427
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,073
Why did you pour beer on my pants?

428
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,242
I just got these dry-cleaned.

429
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,202
Darn it.

430
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:12,829
Where's Seok-hyeon?

431
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,040
On the phone with his girlfriend.

432
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:19,086
Jeez, why do you all
go through the trouble of dating?

433
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,504
What's he doing?

434
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,609
CONTACTS

435

MISSED CALLS: MOM

Watch where you're going.

449
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,470
Why are you so self-centered?

450
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,804
Whatever.

451
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,682
Who wants to go out on the street?

452

Move. Excuse me.

Will you?

459
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:02,535
I wonder which one of you
should take the street shift today.

460
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:05,538
-It's Mr. Ma's turn.
-I'll go.

461
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,207
Really?

462
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:11,461
I had a bit too much to eat,
so it'll be good for my digestion.

463
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,130
I see. That's good of you.

464
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,342
Don't let me stop you.

465
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,097
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

466
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,808
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

467
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,018
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

468
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,230
Let me take some of these for you.

469
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,107
No, it's okay.

470
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,109
It's not a lot, anyway.

471
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,861
You should go sit and take a break.

472
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,488
I'll be done in no time.

473
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,281
Right. Take this.

474
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,243
Have some and wait just a moment.

475
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,332
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

476
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,252
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

477
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,130
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

478
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,216
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

479
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,937
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

480
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,984
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

481
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,319
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

482
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,504
Hello, please come by KCU Bank.

483
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,934
Ms. Ahn?

484
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,438
What do you usually do on weekends?

485
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,274
What about you, Mr. Ha?

486
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:02,655
This weekend,
I'd like to meet with you, Ms. Ahn.

487
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,285
Why?

488
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,207
There's no special reason
behind my asking.

489
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,628
We've worked together for a while
but haven't shared a meal,

490
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,381
and I felt grateful
that you came to Jeju Island with me.

491
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,176
Okay, then.

492
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:26,429
What?

493
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:28,932
I mean, I'd like that.

494
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,910
MOVIE THEATER

495
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:19,399
Mom, I told you to ring the doorbell.
I'm changing the passcode.

496
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:23,027
You don't ring the bell at my place.
You punch in the passcode too.

497
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,200
The place I ordered from last time
was a bit too salty.

498
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,286
It's better to eat bland food.

499
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,665
Then go ahead and find
a store that sells bland side dishes.

500
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,835
We're both single, so it's nice to share.
What's the big deal?

501
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,170
-I sent you half the money. Are we good?
-Yes.

502
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:44,632
And let this ripen for a day
before putting it in the fridge.

503
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,926
-Okay?
-What happened to your hand?

504
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,803
A group came in.

505
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:52,599
What kind of director
massages clients herself?

506
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:56,853
They've been coming to me from the start,
and I need the money to expand.

507
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,062
I need to work hard.

508
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,648
I told you not to overdo it
with the expansion.

509
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:01,816
Who's the woman?

510
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,569
What do you mean?

511
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,905
I gave you that facial pack
over a year ago,

512
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,656
but you refused to use it until now.

513
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,866
-Are you dating?
-Gosh.

514
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,911
No, it's not that.
I used it because it was about to expire.

515
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,329
-Whatever.
-Jeez.

516
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,414
Mom, why do you keep doing this?

517
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,459
Go on now. Leave.

518
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,668
-Go.
-What does she do?

519
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,004
-Let's go.
-Parents? Which university did she go to?

520
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,423
That kind of information
is important, you know.

521
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:29,260
Let's go, Mom.
It's not like that. What's with you?

522
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,211
<i><font color="white">Where are you?</font></i>

523
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,421
<i><font color="white">I'm already here.</font></i>

524
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,397
<i><font color="white">I'm sorry. I don't think I can go today.</font></i>

525
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,547
<i><font color="white">I'm just kidding. Just count to ten.</font></i>

526
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,307
Am I late?

527
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,733
Shall we?

528
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:58,761
Mr. Ha, you seem different
from when I see you at the bank.

529
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,184
Just a little.

530
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,857
You seem different, too, Su-yeong.

531
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,360
May I call you Su-yeong?

532
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,989
Sure.

533
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,118
Where's your hometown?

534
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:25,288
-Tongyeong.
-Tongyeong? I see.

535
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,875
I really love Tongyeong oysters.

536
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,752
I like them raw,
and I like oyster <i><font color="white">gukbap</font></i> too.

537
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,254
And oyster <i><font color="white">jeon.</font></i>

538
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:37,466
Oyster <i><font color="white">jeon</font></i> and <i><font color="white">makgeolli</font></i> together
just taste amazing.

539
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,261
I actually hate oysters.

540
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,098
You hate oysters. I see.

541
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,937
What's your family like?

542
00:44:55,026 --> 00:45:00,865
It's just me and Mom in my case.
My father passed away when I was young.

543
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,246
My parents are back in Tongyeong.

544
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,205
And…

545
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:11,709
I have a younger brother.

546
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:16,255
So you're an older sister.

547
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,300
How old is your brother?

548
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:24,055
Twenty-seven.

549
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,139
I see.

550
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:26,891
That's a fun age.

551
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,773
Why did you jump into
the workforce right away?

552
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,484
It seems like you would've
done well in college.

553
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,990
I enjoyed drawing more.

554
00:45:59,090 --> 00:45:59,966
Guess who?

555
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,717
What?

556
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:02,843
Hey!

557
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,638
Why are you so late?

558
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,352
<i><font color="white">It was all too pretty for me to study.</font></i>

559
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:14,480
Everything.

560
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:17,817
What about art school?

561
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,027
My family couldn't afford art school.

562
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:22,905
I'm sorry.

563
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,866
There's no need to apologize.

564
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,955
Who cares about college anyway?

565
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:35,626
You may not have gone to college,
but you're the best clerk at our bank.

566
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,296
I mean, look at me.
I made that huge mistake last time.

567
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,508
College isn't important at all.

568
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:56,856
This is it for me.

569
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,573
Your place has a great view.

570
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:13,080
I had fun today. Get home safely.

571
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,125
Okay.

572
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,091
Hey.

573
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,346
Can we…

574
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:34,060
Can we do this again?

575
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,981
And what if we do?

576
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,780
I just thought it'd be nice
to see you again.

577
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,037
I don't like undefined relationships.

578
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,926
I feel the same way.

579
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,011
Clear and defined.

580
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,391
Then let's meet again next week.

581
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:18,771
Mondays are hectic, so how about Tuesday?

582
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,774
That's my day off.

583
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,275
Then let's have dinner.

584
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,945
I'll treat you to something good.

585
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:29,156
Something that's clearly good.

586
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:34,245
Okay.

587
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:32,219
YOUNGPO CENTRAL TRADITIONAL MARKET

588
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:48,152
Kim Min-seok at Dangsang branch is
getting married. Did you see his invite?

589
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,404
Why do people insist on getting married?

590
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:54,241
This invite just looks like
a utility bill to me now.

591
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,995
Was that your attitude
when you came to my wedding?

592
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,373
I didn't go.
I sent you money the way I pay my bills.

593
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:02,583
You and your mouth.

594
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,920
But they're an office couple,
so they'll see each other often.

595
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,171
What? Are you jealous?

596
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,632
It'll be awful if they get divorced.

597
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:13,802
I've seen a lot of people lose everything
after dating someone at work.

598
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,890
Living a glamorous, single life like me
is the trend these days.

599
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:18,849
Jeez.

600
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,684
I agree. Just working is the best.

601
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:21,852
Who can we date, then?

602
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,188
We get off work too late to date.

603
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,149
Do you all want
to date at work that badly?

604
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,902
Ms. Ahn, are you interested
in an office romance too?

605
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,907
It depends on the person.

606
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,005
Let's see here.

607
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,592
Did you all receive the director's email

608
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:57,012
about the vice president's
Ready-Go Card event?

609
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,223
Twelve from the Deposits Team.

610
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,392
Five from the General Consultation Team.

611
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,603
And the General Affairs Team
can manage three, right?

612
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,941
We get department store vouchers
if we reach our goal.

613
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,859
Let's beat the Dangsang branch again!

614
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,403
We can do this!

615
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,280
-We can do this!
-We can do this!

616
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,039
What's going on with you?

617
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,002
You've been in
a suspiciously good mood lately.

618
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:34,008
Stop being so nosy.
Do you really have to know everything?

619
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,050
Goodness gracious.

620
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,845
Are you drawing a line between us?
That makes me sad.

621
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,346
My gosh.

622
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,018
Hey, you're not the sad one. He is.

623
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,690
He broke up with his girlfriend.

624
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,985
Have you lost your mind?
You're on the clock.

625
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,945
Do you want Mr. Noh to go off on you?

626
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:57,489
It's non-alcoholic.

627
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,701
Gosh.

628
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,413
Why did you two break up?
Didn't you want to marry her?

629
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,752
Have you ever seen a squat toilet?

630
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,008
I did. The toilet in her home
was that ancient.

631
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:24,600
My heart raced, and I fell for her.
I asked her out, and we dated.

632
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,395
Then I found out
that her family was far below mine.

633
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:32,024
But I didn't care
because my family is rich.

634
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,527
But after a while,
I started feeling self-conscious.

635
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:39,365
Whenever we went on dates or trips
and even when we talked about marriage,

636
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:43,452
her situation always came to mind first.

637
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,247
Do you know what's worse?

638
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,416
I began thinking

639
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,211
that the food she eats comes
from my parents' money and mine.

640
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,422
When I went to meet her family,

641
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:59,218
I ate boiled chicken
at her home and thought to myself,

642
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,638
"From now on, the money I make
will no longer be mine."

643
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,182
"I'm going to lose money by the second."

644
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,060
You should've thought it through
before dating her, then.

645
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,020
You said you loved her.

646
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:11,980
-If you didn't think you could--
-Hey.

647
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,483
Hey! Who knew it would be like this?

648
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,819
That my love was shallow?

649
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,114
Am I the only piece of trash around here?

650
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,907
No. Of course not.

651
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,450
Come on.

652
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,661
Why add insult to injury to Seok-hyeon?

653
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,830
Why did we meet? Why did I fall in love?

654
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,458
Only Romeo and Juliet
can love in a world like this.

655
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:35,254
But their families were
equally well-off, right?

656
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,569
Here is your ID.

657
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,611
Thank you.

658
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,823
You must like accessories too.

659
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:03,907
Yes.

660
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,869
My gosh. I love that ring.

661
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,120
Where did you get it?

662
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,831
I got it with my credit card points.

663
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,500
Credit card points? What do you mean?

664
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,836
I like to shop, so…

665
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,006
Would you like to check out
this card, then?

666
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,757
It just came out.

667
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:25,888
If you like to shop or go to cafés,
there are lots of perks and discounts.

668
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,931
This sounds nice.

669
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,933
Let me know if you're interested.

670
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:32,603
I think Su-yeong is going
to win the vouchers again.

671
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,480
You have to be tough like her

672
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:37,691
to become a permanent clerk
after starting as a part-timer.

673
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,775
So what?

674
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:42,154
If she can't transfer positions,
she'll have to stay at the window.

675
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,573
And even if she does,
it's still a problem.

676
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,743
If she transfers to a regular position,
she'll have to start from the bottom

677
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,412
and end up suffering as a senior clerk
for many more years.

678
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:53,457
But she's performing well,
so I think she still wants to.

679
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,876
Do you think
she'll get through the competition?

680
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,377
I don't think so.

681
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,257
Hey.

682
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:06,136
Ms. Ahn, you met our quota.

683
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,890
I knew you could do it.

684
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,560
Keep up the good work.

685
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:16,522
-Okay.
-Good. Keep it up.

686
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:26,657
But Mr. Ma. Didn't you like
Su-yeong, too, at first?

687
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:31,411
-Did she turn you down?
-No. Turned down? Me?

688
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:33,205
What? Of course not.

689
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:37,918
So what if Su-yeong is pretty?
Does that help her résumé?

690
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,338
No. She needs actual skills
to fill her résumé.

691
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,715
Let's be honest.
She's a high school graduate.

692
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:46,760
And she's just a service rep.
Her family isn't much, either.

693
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,262
Turned down by her? No way.

694
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,888
-Sounds like you were.
-I agree.

695
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,266
No way. Excuse me, but who told you that?

696
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,268
-I won't tell anyone you told me.
-You so did.

Sitting right next to each other!

Sang-su, are you going through puberty?

711
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,841
Is this your rebellious stage?

712
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,344
You were doing so well. What happened?

713
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,511
I'm sorry, sir.

714

Thank you, Ms. Seo!

What? Come on.

LOCKER ROOM

Hey.

733
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:28,226
I had problems yesterday

734
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:33,190
because of the balance,
and then my phone broke.

735

I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

736
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,030
Did you wait a long time?

737
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,130
What do you mean?

738
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,258
Does it have to be like that?

739
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,761
It was my mistake.

740
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:06,181
-Just do it like before.
-Okay, I get it.

741
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,766
No, I don't think so.

742

-What?
-Isn't this a team leader's job?

-Yes.

-No, you can do it.
-Did you get a poodle?

-This one?
-Yes, that one.

-Great work.

754

01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,354
I've lost it.

768
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,523
I've gone crazy.

769
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:27,322
I've lost it! I've gone crazy!

770
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,287
Eun-jeong, I borrowed your pen yesterday.

771
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:35,413
-Thank you.
-Sure.

772
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,920
-Hey.
-Hello.

773
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,020
Outside.

774
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,483
That doesn't mean they're dating.

775
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:04,901
Come on.

776
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:09,322
Ms. Ahn and the security guard,
Mr. Jeong, went to a park far from here

777
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,783
and sat across each other
while having lunch.

778
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:14,661
They're at least flirting or dating.

779
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:15,870
Jeez.

780
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:18,248
That snobby Ahn Su-yeong
turns everyone down,

781
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,792
but packs lunch boxes for Mr. Jeong?

782
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,754
But we don't know
if Ms. Ahn made it herself.

783
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,924
Then do you think Mr. Jeong did?

784
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,261
She turns down section chiefs
and assistant managers

785
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:32,887
for a rookie security guard?

786
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:35,432
I don't think she's in her right mind.

787
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:37,725
That's taking it a bit far,
don't you think?

788
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,936
And so what? They look great together.

789
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,480
Like attracts like, you know.

790
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:45,900
I know what I saw.
It wasn't just any kind of lunch.

791
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:48,027
Mr. Jeong kept blushing and smiling.

792
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,904
There was a really weird vibe.

793
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:53,324
I could tell something was up.
I'm certain of it.

794
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,077
Please excuse me.

795
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,037
Where are you going?

796
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,415
I have to get some cigarettes.

797
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:22,395
-Gosh.
-That's nice.

798
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,440
-Have another one.
-Thank you.

799
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,150
Right here.

800
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,653
-Have a drink.
-Thank you.

801
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:34,199
-Eat up.
-Thank you. This is great.

802
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:35,366
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

803
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,744
-What a relief.
-It's great.

804
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,245
Try this one too.

805
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,414
All right, attention, please.

806
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:46,836
Now then.

807
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,589
We settled the accounts
for the first quarter.

808
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,008
We didn't reach our target performance,

809
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:55,637
but let's work as a team
and work harder in the next quarter.

810
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,224
You've all done a great job,
so I prepared this event today.

811
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,351
Everyone, clap!

812
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,645
Clap!

813
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,064
-All right!
-Event!

814
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:07,649
-Yes!
-Great!

815
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,571
What do you think about office romances?

816
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:15,782
Have another drink.

817
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,033
What about me?

818
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,201
Mr. Ma.

819
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:23,748
Well…

820
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:28,503
I feel like this team dinner
is especially great.

821
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:31,256
Is it thanks to our hot Mr. Jeong?

822
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:34,175
Yes, Mr. Jeong is quite handsome.

823
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:36,052
He kind of looks like me.

824
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,221
What are you talking about?

825
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:41,516
Your looks are just…
Gosh, I don't feel good all of a sudden.

826
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:42,976
I'll get you for that.

827
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,185
Wait.

828
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:48,022
Mr. Jeong looks like
an idol star, don't you think?

829
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:49,315
-Yes.
-No, not at all.

830
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:52,110
But Mr. Ha looks more manly.

831
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:55,822
You know, like Humphrey Bogart
in classical films.

832
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,282
-Don't you think?
-Hey.

833
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,951
Which type do you prefer, Ms. Ahn?

834
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,745
Do you like idol-star looks?

835
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,331
Or classical-movie-star looks?

836
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:10,003
I don't like classical films.

837
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,130
I see.

838
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:16,884
So Mr. Jeong is more your type
than Mr. Ha, right?

839
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:18,928
-I see.
-Okay.

840
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,514
Then what's your type, Mr. Jeong?

841
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,768
I also don't like classical films.

842
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,187
-See?
-Okay.

843
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,189
-Is this a coincidence?
-Hey.

844
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,693
Wait, Mr. Jeong and Ms. Ahn? Really?

845
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,362
-No way.
-Wait a second.

846
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:38,323
Really?

847
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,158
No way. Are you dating?

848
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:42,493
Stop that.

849
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:45,872
What's wrong with two young people dating?

850
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:46,914
Right?

851
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:48,583
If you two are dating,

852
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,669
then I think Mr. Lee here,
just wants to congratulate you.

853
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:53,046
It's not like that.

854
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:57,800
Are you sure?

855
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,563
Are you two really not dating?

856
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,487
No, we're really not.

857
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:18,446
Come on.

858
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:21,741
Stop denying it. We all know.

859
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:24,077
So nothing happened between you?

860
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,120
Be honest.

861
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,206
You're dating, right?

862
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,958
Right, just be honest with us.

863
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:36,422
Do you think we'll say you two are a joke
because you're dating a complete rookie?

864
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,383
Goodness, please stop.

865
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:42,345
Why are you turning
our fun dinner into a hearing?

866
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:45,473
So what if they're dating?
Will you give them matching rings?

867
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:49,519
When your superior is talking,
you need to be quiet.

868
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:50,812
Jeez.

869
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:52,271
So is that a no, Ms. Ahn?

870
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:55,942
That's right.

871
01:09:58,111 --> 01:09:59,862
Mr. Jeong, you too?

872
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:02,990
We aren't dating.

873
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:07,787
If you say it's not true,
then that's that.

874
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,163
Okay, then.

875
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:12,709
If things work out between you two,
then let us know.

876
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,169
It's not like I'm a dumb cop or something.

877
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:18,923
I'm just a team leader
who wants to celebrate a great occasion.

878
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:21,968
What other motive could I possibly have?

879
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,136
-Mr. Lee.
-What?

880
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,264
You really shouldn't say "dumb cop."

881
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:31,602
What if Mr. Jeong passes the police exam,
becomes a detective, and then returns?

882
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:34,313
Do you think it's easy
to become a detective?

883
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:37,567
Even if he does,
he wouldn't do anything to me.

884
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:41,904
Mr. Jeong isn't the type
who would hold a grudge or hurt me.

885
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:44,949
Please excuse me. I need to go.

886
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:45,908
-Come on.
-Why?

887
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:47,243
-I had fun.
-Wait!

888
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,413
-Is it because I said dumb cop?
-No.

889
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,123
-We were having fun!
-Stay!

890
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,916
-Wait a second.
-Goodbye.

891
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,460
-You can't leave.
-Mr. Jeong.

892
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:56,627
-Don't go!
-Hey!

893
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:59,714
-Goodness.
-They never know when to stop.

894
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:01,340
-Darn it.
-He just left.

895
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,843
I'm sick and tired of this.

896
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:07,180
-I need to watch what I say.
-It was just a question.

897
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:09,432
Mr. Ha.

898
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:12,185
Why did you stop me back there?

899
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,314
What were you going to say if I hadn't?

900
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,485
Look, it doesn't matter
if Su-yeong dates Mr. Jeong or not.

901
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,488
They didn't deserve to be interrogated.

902
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:24,864
What was all that anyway?

903
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,075
Jeez. Mr. Lee and Mr. Ma.

904
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,077
Have they gone insane?

905
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:32,079
It's not the first time.

906
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:34,499
A love scandal
is their source of entertainment.

907
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:35,792
What about you?

908
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:40,004
You seem pretty pleased
with what Mr. Lee did.

909
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:41,422
Was it fun?

910
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:47,220
If you and Mr. Ma hadn't said anything,
this would've never happened.

911
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:50,014
I'm not the one who gave it away.

912
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:53,351
It was Mr. Ma,
who has the loosest tongue in this world.

913
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,857
And what would've happened
if you had intervened?

914
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,026
If you had stepped in and done something,

915
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,946
would she have felt
grateful, happy, or comforted?

916
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,531
I like her.

917
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:15,164
I like Su-yeong.

918
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:40,940
-Do you feel okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

919
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,525
-What about you?
-I'm good.

920
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,113
-Why you still here?
-This way.

921
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,072
See you.

922
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:50,324
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

923
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:51,909
-I'm going this way.
-Let's go.

924
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:53,077
Let's go.

925
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:56,247
-Let's go.
-I'm fine.

926
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,941
Are you okay?

927
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:27,695
What do you mean?

928
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:33,993
I mean, Mr. Ma and Mr. Lee
caused a scene in front of everyone.

929
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,078
It was as if they were insane.

930
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:44,045
But why are you asking me that, Mr. Ha?

931
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:48,591
-I--
-If you know it's offensive,

932
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,092
why bring it up again?

933
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:55,306
What made you think
that I'd want to talk about this with you?

934
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,142
If you think

935
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:00,561
that Mr. Lee was at fault,
then go tell him off.

936
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:04,982
He acted insane. So what?
Good for me for staying quiet?

937
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,902
Or are you asking
why I just sat and smiled like an idiot?

938
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:13,449
No, it's not that.

939
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,953
I was worried,
so I wondered if you were okay.

940
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:19,705
Of course, I'm fine.
What other choice do I have?

941
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:22,541
Should I report him to the head office?

942
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,172
It's more annoying
to see you acting like you're different.

943
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:33,552
You acted like everyone else back there,

944
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:37,974
so you should
keep quiet like them as well.

945
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:41,310
Hey. Ms. Ahn.

946
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,732
I'm sorry for not keeping my promise,

947
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:52,071
but don't you think
you've been too harsh on me?

948
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:57,576
I told you that I couldn't make it
because I couldn't verify the balance.

949
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:00,746
Is that why you think I'm upset with you?

950
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:03,124
Then why are you acting this way?

951
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,423
You know how I feel about you.

952
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,467
I don't want to know.

953
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:18,472
<i><font color="white">My feelings for Su-yeong were like…</font></i>

955
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:26,230
Anything else to say?

I like you.

959
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:47,501
I said I like you.

960
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:56,010
I mean it.

961
01:15:58,554 --> 01:15:59,680
I like you.

962
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:07,813
I know I didn't keep my promise that day.

963
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,067
I'm sorry. I truly am.

964
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:15,112
But I like you.

968
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:30,377
I'm afraid I have bad news.

969
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,301
They were right. I'm dating Mr. Jeong.

970

974
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:33,732
Then what will happen to us?

01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:37,736
<i><font color="white">What's the matter with you?</font></i>

It's nice to meet everyone.

Sang-su. Don't you remember me?

981
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,418
Is there a reason why
you can't go on a blind date?

982

Are you really going on that blind date?
