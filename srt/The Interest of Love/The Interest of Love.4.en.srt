00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,967
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

2
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,183
I can't believe it's the new year already.

3
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:01,645
I've had nightmares since October
about these calendars.

4
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,148
Even if we roll 5,000 of them,
they're gone in a couple of days.

5
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,527
People always demand calendars
as if they're entitled to them.

6
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,614
News stations need to make it clear

7
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,909
that hanging a bank calendar at home
doesn't make you rich.

8
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,954
Darn it. I tore another one.

9
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,374
Come on, Mr. Ha.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,210
I could roll <i><font color="white">gimbap</font></i>
more quickly than that.

11
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,297
Darn it. I'm going to call it a day.

12
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,631
I'm clocking out first.

13
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,468
I'm done too. Wait up.

14
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,720
Good luck, you guys.

15
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,388
Let's grab a drink soon.

16
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,598
-See you.
-Goodbye.

17
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:15,385
Sang-su. I have a memorial service.

18
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,098
You never go to those.
Be more creative, will you?

19
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,558
You always use that excuse.

20
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:25,145
I'm serious this time.
It's for my great-grandmother's cousin's--

21
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,605
Just go.

22
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,066
I love you.

23
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,073
I want to become rich too.

24
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,634
Here.

25
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,094
Use this.

26
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,432
Thank you, Ms. Ahn.

27
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,069
Patch up your finger,
or else we'll be here all night.

28
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:16,988
Okay.

29
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,396
Do you want to be rich too?

30
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,316
No, I just want to be average.

31
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,612
That's a rather humble wish, isn't it?

32
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,657
I hear you come from a wealthy family.

33
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,954
Because I graduated
from an elite school in Gangnam

34
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,539
and live in that district?

35
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,466
Being average means
you don't stand out from the crowd.

36
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,469
It means you're just like everyone else.

37
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,599
But growing up,
I felt like the ugly duckling

38
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,560
among all the others around me.

39
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,273
Not that anyone ever said it to my face.

40
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,441
I realized that…

41
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,361
what some people considered average

42
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,617
was hard for people like me to have.
Almost impossible to reach on my own.

43
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,913
When they talk about being average,

44
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,626
it was just their way
of bragging that they're actually not.

45
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,715
I'm surprised to hear you say that.

46
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,972
I didn't bother correcting
any of the exaggerated rumors

47
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,100
because it would prevent me
from being average.

48
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,944
Take two, then.
And become twice as average.

49
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,711
EPISODE 4

50
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,966
I'm sorry you had to work
all night because of me.

51
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,303
It's the weekend anyway,
so I can sleep in.

52
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,181
Good work, senior clerk.

53
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,686
Wait, you're a section chief now.
I'm sorry that I keep forgetting that.

54
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,815
You worked harder than I did
despite being my senior.

55
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,320
Don't say that.

56
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,490
You're in a higher position than I am.

57
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:12,289
Other people don't consider
service reps as their seniors

58
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,999
even if the latter teaches them.

59
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,088
It's because they know
they'll get promoted more quickly.

60
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,177
You taught me everything
during my probation period.

61
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,558
If it wasn't for you,
I'd still be making mistakes.

62
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,729
My position doesn't matter.

63
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,817
You'll always be my senior and mentor,
no matter what they say.

64
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,831
Do you think the subways are running now?

65
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,292
Yes.

66
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,796
I should've taken another calendar.

67
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,637
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

68
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,808
Is it fun?
Toying with my emotions, that is.

69
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,812
I could say the same thing to you.

70
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,899
You still can't
bring yourself to be honest.

71
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,901
Tell me so that I can understand.

72
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,655
Then explain what happened that day.

73
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,365
I've already told you.

74
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,618
-It was because of the balance--
-It wasn't that you couldn't come.

75
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,915
You chose not to come.

76
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:57,852
<i><font color="white">I saw you.</font></i>

77
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,358
I saw everything.

78
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:20,602
You were an hour late,
but you didn't bother to hurry.

79
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,275
<i><font color="white">"Why is he leaving?"</font></i>

80
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,029
<i><font color="white">At first, I didn't understand.</font></i>

81
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,197
<i><font color="white">But then…</font></i>

82
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,240
Hey.

83
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,039
Can we do this again?

84
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,003
I don't like undefined relationships.

85
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,716
<i><font color="white">"Was it because of what I said?"</font></i>

86
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,398
<i><font color="white">I didn't want to believe that.</font></i>

87
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,651
<i><font color="white">But the next day, you said…</font></i>

88
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,194
I had problems yesterday…

89
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,075
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

90
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,077
Did you wait a long time?

91
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,666
<i><font color="white">"Why did he lie?"</font></i>

92
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,711
<i><font color="white">"Why did he hide the fact</font></i>
<i><font color="white">that he had arrived there?"</font></i>

93
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,217
You didn't want me to know.

94
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,347
You didn't want me to know
that you hesitated.

95
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,267
Am I right?

96
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:45,770
Why?

97
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,107
Why did you hesitate?

98
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,068
I thought my background
didn't matter to you.

99
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,571
I didn't go to college.

100
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm just a teller, and my family is poor.

101
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,491
Was that why you left?

102
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,413
Or was it because you were going to HQ
and didn't want rumors floating about?

103
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,291
Then you shouldn't have
acted like you were different.

104
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,251
-Was I a joke to you?
-It was the opposite.

105
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,009
I took you seriously.

106
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,097
You weren't someone…

107
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,935
whom I wanted to date on a whim.

108
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,358
I even thought about marrying you.

109
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,615
Then why did you do that?

110
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,492
-Why did you hesitate?
-I don't know.

111
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,494
It wasn't intentional.

112
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,204
<i><font color="white">It just happened.</font></i>

113
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,668
<i><font color="white">But I didn't hesitate for long</font></i>
<i><font color="white">and went straight back to you.</font></i>

114
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,588
<i><font color="white">But you weren't there.</font></i>

115
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,468
<i><font color="white">Exactly.</font></i>

116
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,511
So I was right.

117
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,221
But I eventually went back.

118
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,557
I might've had some doubts,

119
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,018
-but I still went back.
-You still hesitated.

120
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,394
I didn't mean much to you.

121
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,688
Then why did you act that way?

122
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,025
You saw me heading to the hotel that day.

123
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,779
Why didn't you say anything?
Why give me the cold shoulder?

124
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,784
Why didn't you give me a chance
to explain myself?

125
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,287
-I didn't owe you anything.
-You could've just asked.

126
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,041
You could've confronted me then and there.

127
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,250
We could've talked it out.

128
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,211
What was I supposed to say?

129
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,755
That I deserved to know
exactly why you hesitated?

130
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,636
Being average.

131
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,600
"Did you hesitate…

132
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,564
because dating me would make it
harder for you to become average?"

133
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,609
Is that what you wanted to hear?

134
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,626
Let me ask you one question.

135
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,213
Su-yeong.

136
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,427
Did you feel anything for me?

137
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,349
Was I just…

138
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,978
imagining things?

139
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,737
Yes.

140
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,035
I thought you and I…

141
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,041
were similar.

142
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,085
That's all.

143
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,632
You won't regret this?

144
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,470
No.

145
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,263
And you're not sad…

146
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,266
about anything?

147
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,483
No.

148
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,731
-Mr. Noh.
-Yes, sir.

149
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,738
Will we be able to reach
this year's KPI at this rate?

150
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,365
I'm concerned as well.

151
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:13,287
If our branch receives a D rating,
that'll put you in a tighter spot than me.

152
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,373
You must like your current position.

153
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:21,921
That's why we're currently preparing

154
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,800
an original and innovative spot promotion.

155
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,677
Right, everyone?

156
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:29,720
We are?

157
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:31,931
Yes, sir.

158
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,811
Our team promises to raise
our performance for the second quarter.

159
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,522
Once we sort out the companies
that have requested loans,

160
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,066
you'll have nothing to worry about, sir.

161
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,489
Ms. Ahn.

162
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,326
Please stand up.

163
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,294
Applause, please.

164
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,847
She sold every Winner's Plan
for season one.

165
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,809
While others failed
to live up to expectations,

166
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,271
others like Ms. Ahn worked diligently.

167
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,273
That's how our bank

168
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,277
has been able to maintain
this level of performance.

169
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,821
Another round of applause, please.

170
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,791
Now, Ms. Park and Mr. Ha.

171
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,293
Please stand up.

172
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,760
The Youngpo branch
is known for being competitive,

173
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,638
yet their presentation came out on top.

174
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,308
Here's to hoping that they'll be
the final winners of the contest.

175
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,518
Applause, please.

176
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,830
What are you looking for?

177
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,832
Where's the calculator?

178
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,504
I think I saw it on Mr. Ha's desk.

179
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,463
Hey, I'm borrowing this.

180
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,993
This client is coming by later today.

181
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,037
Wait.

182
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,626
The font size is wrong.
It should be 15, not 11.

183
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,753
This client is farsighted

184
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,464
and complains
if the font size is too small.

185
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,343
I thought I told you this multiple times.

186
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,098
The client received
LASIK surgery last month.

187
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,349
I thought you knew.

188
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,693
I see you didn't dispose of
these gift certificates.

189
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,946
I'll get to it after work.

190
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:01,158
It's important to deal with
old gift certificates immediately.

191
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,203
I told you this multiple times
during your probation period.

192
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,080
It inconveniences others.

193
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,333
I'll make sure it doesn't
interfere with your duties,

194
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,626
so don't worry about it.

195
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,135
What's going on?

196
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,722
Gosh. Why are they so cold to each other?

197
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,726
I didn't know Mr. Ha could be so immature.

198
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,651
Ms. Ahn.

199
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,656
These are either snacks
or some kind of candy.

200
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,242
It's a gift from a Winner's Plan client.

201
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,787
They signed up today, thanks to you.

202
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,789
Thank you, sir.

203
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:52,042
Ms. Ahn, I know how hard you're working.

204
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,171
Are you already preparing for season two?

205
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,133
It doesn't hurt to plan ahead.

206
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,553
Yes, sir. I'll get it ready.

207
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,055
All right. Good luck, then.

208
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,484
It feels nice to get some fresh air.

209
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,903
It really does. I'm famished.

210
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,489
I'm starving too.

211
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,656
Hello, Mr. Jeong!

212
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,367
-Did you enjoy your meal?
-Yes.

213
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,619
Are you on your way to lunch?

214
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,038
Please have this for later.

215
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,122
It's dessert.

216
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,124
Goodness, this is my favorite.

217
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,710
But I'm on a diet.

218
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,297
Thank you.

219
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,508
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

220
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,510
EATING SWEETS WILL CHEER YOU UP

221
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,976
-What do you want?
-How about oyster <i><font color="white">gukbap?</font></i>

222
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,936
-Oyster <i><font color="white">gukbap?</font></i>
-Yes.

223
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,564
Mr. So told me
that it's the best hangover meal ever.

224
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,983
Are you talking about that new restaurant?

225
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,069
-The owner gave us rice cakes.
-Let's go there.

226
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,570
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

227
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,115
I thought they had just opened.

228
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,953
<i><font color="white">To me…</font></i>

229
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,665
No, to us. You were already dead to us.

230
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,125
Stop hovering around me.

231
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,879
Let's go somewhere else.

232
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,422
Okay. Let's do that.

233
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,590
-Let's go.
-Okay.

234
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,133
Let's eat something else.

235
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,301
What's around here?

236
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,803
-Fish?
<i><font color="white">-Jjamppong?</font></i>

237
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,096
Or maybe…

238
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,891
-Hey.
-What?

239
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,020
How are things
with the FSS vice-president's daughter?

240
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,355
It's going smoothly.

241
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,983
Your face says otherwise.

242
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,280
Hey.

243
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,409
Do you know the lifespan of this bill?

244
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,661
Sixty-one months.

245
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,163
That's five years and a month.

246
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,209
Jeong-eun and I
didn't even last that long.

247
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,588
What does that mean?
Are you happy now or what?

248
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,800
I gave up on any romantic feelings,
so everything is going well.

249
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,302
Our parents are happy too.

250
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,514
Thanks to this woman,

251
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:13,142
I realized how tiring it was
to be considerate.

252
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,562
My relationship with Jeong-eun
was uncomfortable.

253
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,607
It's really uncomfortable
to be mindful of others.

254
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,152
Hold on a second.

255
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,780
Hello, Ji-eun. Yes, I'm eating right now.

256
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,325
Yes. A ballet performance?

257
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,618
That sounds great.

258
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,244
Sure.

259
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,538
Yes, of course.

260
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,581
Jeez.

261
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,834
What about you?

262
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:43,922
Has your relationship
with Ms. Ahn evolved?

263
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:47,176
Have you and Ms. Ahn
turned into archenemies?

264
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,637
Jeez.

265
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,474
Whatever it is, just cut it out.
It's getting awkward.

266
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,688
I've always been curious.

267
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,358
Why do you like her?

268
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:05,861
I don't like her.

269
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,949
Let me rephrase. Why did you like her?

270
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,580
Should we drink today?

271
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:19,541
-Let's burn through our paychecks.
-I'm taking a half day.

272
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,542
Why?

273
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,672
I have a memorial service.

274
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,675
You jerk. That's my go-to excuse.

275
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,651
Su-yeong.

276
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,778
What are you doing here?

277
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:53,701
How intriguing.

278
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,953
Right?

279
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,499
What are you doing after work today?

280
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,709
Care to have a drink?

281
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,570
FATHER OF HA SANG-SU,
HA DONG-SIK

282
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,769
I didn't know you smoked.

283
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,648
This was one of your dad's belongings.

284
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,777
He didn't get to smoke much
before passing away.

285
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,698
I smoke once a year
on the anniversary of his death.

286
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,368
I told myself I'd only resent him
until I finished this pack.

287
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,038
And now, I'm done.

288
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,666
I don't have an excuse
to resent him anymore.

289
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:31,173
You didn't have to come for this,
especially with that long face.

290
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,011
You were different even as a young boy.

291
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,723
Other kids would whine
and beg their parents

292
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,392
to buy them video games or shoes.

293
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,521
But you carried the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

294
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,731
You never asked for anything.

295
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,110
You never once let on
that you were struggling or in pain.

296
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,405
When you had a high fever,
you went to the hospital alone.

297
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,699
I only found out after you had recovered.

298
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,788
And then, for the first time,

299
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,666
you wanted to do something,
and it was ice hockey.

300
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:09,795
To be honest,

301
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,673
I wanted to keep playing.

302
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,216
But I lied

303
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,718
and said it was boring.

304
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,887
I knew that, of course.

305
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,265
I knew about it then,

306
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,809
and I also know
that you still play for fun.

307
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,941
Your eyes lit up whenever you saw
a hockey uniform, even at that age.

308
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,734
You were lying through your teeth.

309
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,279
I just feigned ignorance.

310
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,656
You weren't planning on going pro,

311
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,118
and I thought it was a way
for you to make friends.

312
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,209
I have nothing to be sorry for.

313
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,963
I really did my best to raise you well.

314
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,465
I'm proud of myself.

315
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,095
I agree. I'm proud of you too.

Try acting out or being immature for once.

318
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,273
Go on dates,
get into relationships, and get married.

319
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,192
Get divorced, too, if you want.

320
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,031
Don't take things so seriously.

321
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,160
Let's go.

322
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,288
I won't be coming back here from now on.

323
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,707
I won't visit your dad anymore.

324
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,002
That's okay. You deserve that right.

325
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,754
Sang-su.

326
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,008
You're happy, right?

00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,362
Now I just need yours.

I know a place that has that wine.

How about we pair this wine with jamón?

Anything is fine.

Here. Let me help.

Forget it.

Opening wine bottles

00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,793
Just look around in the meantime.

367
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,632
Those are my failed <i><font color="white">marquage</font></i> projects.

368
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:49,968
I see.

369
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,280
Just work on a new bag.
That one's a lost cause.

370
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,740
I'll give it a try.

371
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,542
You're pretty good, Su-yeong.
Did you study art?

372
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,504
I'm not that good.

373
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,885
What's going on with you and Sang-su?

374
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,179
Things have been weird with you two.

375
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,856
Do you like Mr. Ha?

376
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:46,983
What?

377
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,198
Yes. Is it that obvious?

378
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,408
A little.

379
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,495
I just can't hide my feelings.

380
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:03,959
Can I ask why you like him?

381
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,341
I wonder what you see in him.

382
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,474
Because he's a constant.

383
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,520
He's not a variable
that's affected by a given situation.

384
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,439
He always maintains the same value.

385
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,108
Like a constant.

386
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,986
He was always careful
when it came to dating

387
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,529
ever since college.

388
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:38,952
He knows the gravity of one's feelings,
so he takes it very seriously.

389
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,162
And he's always thoughtful.

390
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,834
<i><font color="white">So I was right.</font></i>

391
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,794
But I eventually went back.

392
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,921
I might've had some doubts,

393
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,673
but I still went back.

394
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,050
Once he makes up his mind
about dating someone,

395
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,471
I think he'll absolutely cherish her.

396
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:06,563
When we go somewhere to eat,
he casually sets the cutlery for me.

397
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,899
If my glass is empty,
he fills it up before I know it.

398
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,988
But isn't that just an act of kindness?

399
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,782
He notices which side dishes I eat

400
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,744
and doesn't have any himself
so that I can have it all.

401
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,497
I consider that innate talent.

402
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,376
His thoughtfulness puts me at ease.

403
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,838
It's not something
you can force yourself to learn.

404
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,673
I know this for a fact.

405
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,802
Sang-su is a good-hearted man.

406
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,267
You two look good together.

407
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,529
Su-yeong, take this.

408
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,408
No, I can't. It's too expensive.

409
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,120
I changed my mind
about throwing this one away.

410
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,206
So instead, I'll give you this one.

411
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,292
But still…

412

Yes.

I got all the medicine.
I didn't forget any.

Gosh, stop worrying.
Seriously, I eat just fine.

That's how they normally taste.

Why won't you listen to me

I'll teach you how to use it.

You speak in dialect.

432
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,928
Only when I'm talking to my dad.
You can't tell otherwise, right?

433
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,055
No, I can totally tell.

434
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:47,807
Really?

435
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,020
So what? I'm from Tongyeong,
so I speak in dialect too.

436
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,564
Really? Let me hear it. I'm curious.

437
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,198
What are you looking at?

438
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,632
CONTACTLESS PARCEL

You didn't need to help.
Thank you, though.

440
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,396
It'd be more convenient
if they used internet banking.

441
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:39,067
They don't have smartphones
and can't order things online.

442
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:40,902
But still…

443
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,989
Aren't you worried
that the cash could get stolen?

444
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,493
They wait outside all day long
whenever I send a parcel.

445
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:56,709
Isn't it difficult for you
to send them your paycheck?

446
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:01,422
It is. But that's why I like it.

447
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,971
If I work hard, I'll be able to take
cabs instead of buses one day.

448
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,890
I'll be able to go to a hospital
instead of a pharmacy.

449
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:15,103
And I'll also be able to order
more expensive meals as well.

450
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,610
You have such a big heart, Mr. Jeong,

451
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,320
unlike me.

452
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,240
I don't want to regret it later on.

453
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,076
The worst punishment for kids
who don't tend to their parents

454
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,536
is having to look in the mirror.

455
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,746
It's because as time goes by,

456
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,249
we realize how much
we resemble our parents.

457
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,461
If anything, I'm doing this for myself.

458
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,682
Just a second.

459
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,320
Do you want to take a walk?
I'll carry your groceries.

460
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,615
That's okay. I can carry my own.

461
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,911
You said you hadn't eaten yet.
You should go home and eat.

462
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,496
I can have a light dinner. Hold on.

00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,220
Do you mean Mr. Yuk?
Do you have an appointment?

472
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:57,890
Ma'am?

473
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,642
Hello, ma'am. This way, please.

474
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:07,859
Hey.

475
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,737
I can't believe you didn't recognize her.

476
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,572
Who is she?

477
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,034
You'll never climb up the ladder now,
that's for sure.

478
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,620
That's Mr. Yuk's wife.

479
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,055
Would you like some coffee?

480
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,181
-Sure.
-Okay.

481
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,351
<i><font color="white">He's my role model.</font></i>

482
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:46,272
As men, we need to marry the right woman.

483
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,485
I wonder what your future wife did
that was so wrong

484
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,196
to end up getting married
to someone like you, Mr. Ma.

485
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,907
Would you like
to find out yourself? Really?

486
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,534
They say the more money you have,
the more elegant you become.

487
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,119
She sure sets an example.

488
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:03,081
I think that applies to Ms. Park as well.

489
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,418
There's an AI finance
training session this week.

490
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,421
One person from each team will go.

491
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,507
I went last time.

492
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,971
I have a workshop to attend
at my kid's international school.

493
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,141
I'll go.

494
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:23,810
Really?

495
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:29,398
Sang-su, you went last time,
so Mr. Ma will attend this session.

496
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:30,983
Yes, sir.

497
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,823
Sang-su, would you like
to go instead of me?

498
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,535
I'm sorry, but I have plans this week.

499
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,836
Here's some chamomile tea.

500
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,379
Thank you.

501
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:55,133
Didn't you say your son
works at a bank as well?

502
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,426
Yes. He's a section chief.

503
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,428
My daughter is an assistant manager.

504
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,764
Which bank?

505
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,516
KCU Bank.

506
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,726
Goodness. Which branch?

507
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:10,231
My daughter works there too
over at the Youngpo branch.

508
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,696
My son's branch
is in a province down south.

509
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,157
I see.

510
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,075
What a coincidence.

511
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,682
Just a little something.

512
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,978
-Thank you.
-How's it going?

513
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,438
You seem to have a lot to do.

514
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:54,567
This isn't my specialty,
so I'm struggling a bit.

515
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,862
That's what makes you impressive.
You're challenging yourself.

516
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,072
Thanks for the encouragement.

517
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:03,367
I should study hard too
if I want to succeed like you.

518
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,037
I know you'll pass your exam.

519
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,337
Are you going to eat?

520
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,172
No, I'm fine.

521
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,050
I told you not to overdo it,
but here you are.

522
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,344
I want to do this. It's fun.

523
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,680
Su-yeong, I want to take you somewhere.

524
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,602
So you'll give us a call
and book your next appointment?

525
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,646
-Yes. I'll call you.
-Okay.

526
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,856
Hello.

527
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,317
Goodness. Why are you here at this hour?

528
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,611
Did the bank close early today?

529
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,030
No, I just made some time to stop by.

530
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,824
Aqua care service for two, please.

531
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,993
Okay. I'll get the room ready.

532
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,495
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.

533
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,746
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

534
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,917
Did you say two? Who's the other person?

535
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,502
Just go, Mom.

536
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,504
Is it a guy?

537
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,715
Do you seriously think
I'd bring a guy to a place you frequent?

538
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,133
Why not?

539
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:04,011
Just go home. Go on.

540
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,889
Goodness, you're so mean.

541
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,182
See you.

542
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:17,900
Here, let me.

543
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,110
I can do it.

544
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,487
That'll leave marks in your hair.

545
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,656
This hair tie is much better.

546
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,917
Before working at KCU, I thought
my friends were the worst type of people.

547
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,462
All they did was spend
their parents' money

548
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,506
and did whatever they wanted.

549
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,259
I got a job because I didn't
want to live like that.

550
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,263
But I've met just as many at the bank.

551
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,099
You two must be colleagues.

552
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,893
Yes, I recently transferred
to this branch.

553
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:57,690
You're both so lovely.
You must be very popular.

554
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,026
She's the most popular one.

555
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,654
That must be nice.

556
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,449
Not at all.

557
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:09,660
Yeon-ju.

558
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,579
-Begin the cleansing process.
-Okay.

559
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,247
LOCKER ROOM

560
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:19,170
Don't you feel better now?

561
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,380
I do.

562
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,513
Let's get going, Sang-su.

563
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:30,639
Mi-gyeong.

564
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:33,142
Can we do dinner next time?

565
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,227
No.

566
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,481
I have something to tell you. It's urgent.

567
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,279
I like you, Sang-su.

568
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:56,082
I know you take what I say seriously,
so I'll give you some time to think.

569
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,377
One.

570
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,004
Two.

571
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:03,964
Three.

572
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,844
So did you give it some thought?

573
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,891
Just kidding.

574
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,355
But really, though.
Please think about what I said.

575
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,867
Why?

576
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,497
Why do you like me?

577
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,843
<i><font color="white">You're someone I want to have.</font></i>

578
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:59,019
You're different from other men I know.

579
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,400
Then you shouldn't have
acted like you were different.

580
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,651
Was I a joke to you?

581
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,826
You don't have to be
completely sure about how you feel.

582
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:15,786
At least for now.

583
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,249
<i><font color="white">You still hesitated.</font></i>

584
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,501
I didn't mean much to you.

585
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,339
<i><font color="white">I thought you and I…</font></i>

586
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:32,386
were similar.

587
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,557
After all, we're similar to each other.

588
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,362
<i><font color="white">Let me ask you one question.</font></i>

589
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:53,449
Su-yeong.

590
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,621
Did you feel anything for me?

591
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,084
No.

592
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,237
INNOVATIVE APP CONTEST
AWARD CEREMONY

593
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,863
One, two, three.

594
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,949
MOBILE APP IDEA CONTEST
KCU BANK PRESIDENT AWARD

595
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,163
Where's my compliment?

596
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,791
I really did my best.

597
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,379
Good job, Mi-gyeong.

598
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,474
What? It's just
a congratulatory handshake.

599
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,187
Your hand is warm.

600
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,657
Let's give them another round of applause.

601
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,455
In my 20 years of working in this field,
this is the first time

602
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,874
I've seen anyone
whom I know win this contest.

603
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,711
Sang-su, you'll be headed to HQ soon.

604
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,797
This is all thanks to Ms. Park.

605
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,133
Not at all. Mr. Ha did all the work.

606
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,303
Do I smell love in the air?

607
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:41,223
Can we expect a wedding invite
by the end of the year?

608
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,562
And Ms. Ahn, please come to my office.

609
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,106
Well done.

610
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,858
Let's wrap up here.

611
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,991
Maybe he's going to let you
take over the next product.

612
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,951
Congratulations.

613
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:02,661
Nothing has been set yet.

614
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,502
Su-yeong.

615
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,546
Yes, Ms. Park?

616
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,966
Never mind. Carry on.

617
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:17,968
Okay.

618
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,853
I don't understand.

619
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:35,361
I want you to hand over
the Winner's Plan project to Ms. Park.

620
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,990
I thought I was to prepare for season two.

621
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,161
That, of course, goes to Ms. Park.

622
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:48,540
It was her job to begin with,
and she's far better at it than you.

623
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,585
You've been a huge help to us.

624
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,254
Thanks to the solid groundwork
you laid out,

625
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,672
we felt secure about the project.

626
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,341
In that case,

627
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,096
what duties will I be given next?

628
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,224
You'll do what you've always been doing.

629
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,601

Hello, sir.

633
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,116
Yes, of course.

634
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,076
I see.

Su-yeong.

636
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:55,649
Mr. Yuk wants me to hand over
the Winner's Plan project material to you.

637
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:01,613
I was going to give it to you later,
but can I hand it over now?

638
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:10,998
I did my best,
but it may look a bit unpolished.

639
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,586
I learned a lot from you. Thank you.

640
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:20,757
I'm sorry, Su-yeong.
I know how much effort you put into this.

641
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,429
That's okay. It's not your fault anyway.

642
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:28,140
Don't worry about it.

643
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,734
Gosh.

644
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,278
How could he make such a fool out of her?

645
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,447
He shouldn't have led her on

646
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,782
and said she'd take over
the next new product.

647
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:49,244
Why did he have to give her false hope?

648
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,664
The poor thing
was barking up the wrong tree.

649
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,958
There's only so far
she could go in her position.

650
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,793
She got too greedy.

651
00:54:56,877 --> 00:55:00,380
Exactly. She should've just
focused on being a teller like Ji-yun.

I wish you would stop drinking soju
whenever you're upset.

654
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:52,558
I thought I was well-aware
that not everyone in this world is given

655
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:59,106
equal shares of time, opportunities,
happiness, and love.

656
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,190
But I was wrong.

657
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:08,115
This life is like a zero-sum game.
One's happiness is another's misfortune.

658
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:13,370
No matter how hard I try,
it's just out of my reach.

659
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,794
It's pretty foolish of me
to have such false hope, right?

660
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,843
Do I look like a fool to you?

661
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,890
I work at a bank,
but I'm not affiliated with it.

I grew up in an area
that doesn't even show up on the map.

Five years ago,
I thought I'd become a farmer like my dad.

00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:24,441
But look at me now.
I work at a reputable bank in Seoul.

In five years,
you'll shine even more brightly than now.

It'll be unimaginable.

I'm Mr. Kang from the Dangsang branch.

You're so good at your job.
