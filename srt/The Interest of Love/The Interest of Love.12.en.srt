THE INTEREST OF LOVE

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,133
THE CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS, COMPANIES,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,619
What's on your mind?

4
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:36,544
{\an8}EPISODE 12

5
00:01:37,754 --> 00:01:39,522
{\an8}Why call if you don't want to talk?

6
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:41,440
{\an8}Those two…

7
00:01:42,457 --> 00:01:44,100
{\an8}They're dating, right?

8
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:49,689
{\an8}Sang-su and Su-yeong.

9
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:53,443
{\an8}Did you know?

10
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:59,157
{\an8}I know everything you know, Gyeong-pil.

11
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,159
{\an8}Hold on.

12
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:05,830
{\an8}Then why haven't you
said anything this whole time?

13
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:12,087
You're not some naive 20-year-old.
Why would you be so foolish?

14
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:16,257
Is that being foolish?

15
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:22,931
Does giving your entire heart
to someone make you foolish?

16
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:26,226
I turned a blind eye to protect our love.

17
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:29,896
Was it foolish of me
to expect him to give up on her?

18
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:36,277
Then you shouldn't have
gotten hurt in the process.

19
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,281
I thought he'd be different.

20
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:43,118
<i>Love…</i>

21
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:46,037
<i>makes you feel anxious.</i>

22
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,914
Good luck.

23
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:51,334
I'm rooting for you.

24
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:53,294
I really am.

25
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:01,720
What about Su-yeong?

26
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,267
Sorry?

27
00:03:07,793 --> 00:03:09,394
How is your relationship…

28
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:12,605
these days?

29
00:03:18,053 --> 00:03:19,530
<i>Love sways your heart.</i>

30
00:03:19,554 --> 00:03:24,617
It must be sad for you, though, Mr. Jeong.
Doesn't it feel empty without her?

31
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:32,125
Don't you feel empty, Sang-su?

32
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:34,377
<i>And in the end…</i>

33
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:43,386
<i>you get caught because of love.</i>

34
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,872
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

35
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:08,558
Stop the car. We need to talk.

36
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,853
We'll talk later.

37
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:13,771
Mi-gyeong.

38
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,566
I said we'll talk later.

39
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:24,073
-We have to do it today.
-Today is my birthday!

40
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:28,161
I have feelings for someone.

41
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:31,747
And it's not you.

42
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,431
I told you I wanted to talk later!

43
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:53,644
Do you really think that I don't know?

44
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:01,986
Do you think I have no idea
where your true feelings lie?

45
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:08,826
They're living together.

46
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:13,456
Su-yeong and Mr. Jeong
are living together!

47
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,633
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:31,891
Let's break up.

49
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:44,487
Who is she anyway?

50
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:49,244
What on earth does she mean to you?!

51
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:51,704
This isn't about her.

52
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:53,998
It's about how I feel.

53
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:58,294
This is only happening
because you have feelings for her.

54
00:05:58,318 --> 00:05:59,877
Mi-gyeong.

55
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:02,192
It's not like that.

56
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:04,776
Then why do you want to break up?

57
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:09,698
Is it because you don't love me anymore?

58
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:14,786
Sang-su.

59
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:19,166
Don't act like…

60
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:23,378
you fell out of love with me.

61
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:27,883
You never loved me in the first place.

62
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:31,553
We didn't get together
because you loved me.

63
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,535
That part hasn't changed.

64
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:39,644
So that's not a valid reason to break up.

65
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:44,649
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:56,328
I'm so sorry.

67
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:04,535
You gave me your word.

68
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:07,121
You said you'd try.

69
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:10,750
So I need you to try again
from the beginning.

70
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:35,649
Do you really like me?

71
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:42,615
Why would you ask me that?

72
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:45,588
I'm just curious.

73
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:51,040
Are your feelings for me…

74
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,838
out of love…

75
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,635
Or compassion?

76
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:13,514
Do you think I don't feel any love

77
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,101
for you?

78
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:24,407
What about you?

79
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,065
Is love the only emotion…

80
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,918
you feel toward me?

81
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:11,120
<i>Did you get home safely?</i>

82
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:50,784
<i>Hello?</i>

83
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:53,955
Can you talk?

84
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:55,415
<i>Yes.</i>

85
00:09:57,859 --> 00:09:59,169
Are you okay?

86
00:10:02,072 --> 00:10:05,425
No. I'm not okay.

87
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:10,346
Where are you right now?

88
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:16,394
I'm home.

89
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:14,077
Is Ms. Park okay?

90
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:27,257
You're here
to tell me something, aren't you?

91
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:36,224
I just wanted to walk with you.

92
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:40,325
That's why I came.

93
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:46,776
It looks like you're in pain.

94
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,864
Yes, but that's okay.

95
00:12:22,253 --> 00:12:23,896
You haven't left yet?

96
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:28,526
I'm waiting
for Mr. Yuk's approval on something.

97
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:31,946
Can I drink this?

98
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:39,120
I'm sorry for how we left last night.

99
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:42,749
Sang-su wanted to spend time with me
since it was my birthday.

100
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:47,420
We chatted until late last night,
so I'm a bit tired.

101
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:54,218
Let's set up another date
and have something tasty.

102
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,222
Please tell Mr. Jeong that I'm sorry.

103
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,232
Mr. Yang, are you out of your mind?

104
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:11,027
How could you taint
our reputation like this?

105
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,574
This branch
is just full of dating couples.

106
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:18,701
Men and women matters
are the root of all problems here.

107
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:24,166
So tell me.
Whom has Seok-hyeon decided to live with?

108
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,627
His ex?
Or the FSS vice president's daughter?

109
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:29,003
How would I know?

110
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,089
People are scary these days.

111
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:34,427
Now everyone knows Mr. Yang
and his ex's private information.

112
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:36,594
Where they went to school, their families…

113
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:41,224
See? This is how scary relationships are.

114
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,267
Just don't date anyone.

115
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:47,106
I'm more scared
of this month's credit card bill.

116
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,066
Stop gossiping, will you?

117
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,486
Mr. Yang is the talk of the town
at all the other branches.

118
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,573
We should support him
since he's one of us.

119
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:56,931
BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE

120
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:03,079
Wash my car!

121
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,940
Hey.

122
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:31,566
Hey, leave him alone.

123
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,320
Gosh, he's done for.

124
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:38,072
What do you mean?

125
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:41,868
Mr. Yang has been suspended.

126
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:47,790
HQ found out about the scandal.
He's been suspended for two months.

127
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:52,628
So this is the outcome.

128
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,007
Banks are too conservative.

129
00:14:57,409 --> 00:14:59,470
One scandal here could ruin your career.

130
00:14:59,494 --> 00:15:00,971
He would've been promoted

131
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:04,183
and received financial support
from his in-laws.

132
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:06,977
I don't get why he did that.

133
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:10,813
Me neither. He knew he'd regret it.

134
00:15:16,302 --> 00:15:18,488
-Please fill that out.
-Okay.

135
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:27,622
Ms. Ahn.

136
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:31,000
Ms. Ahn?

137
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:33,336
Yes?

138
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,260
I'm sorry. Could you fill this out?

139
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:52,647
Sang-su, what are you doing?
You should sit on that side.

140
00:15:54,424 --> 00:15:57,109
Jeez. You're so dense.

141
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,991
Goodness.

142
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:03,033
Okay.

143
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:06,912
Seok-hyeon, what do you want?
Order anything you want. It's on me.

144
00:16:06,936 --> 00:16:11,834
What's done is done.
You should stay strong.

145
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:14,712
I'm sorry.

146
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:17,423
I'm not trying
to criticize you or anything.

147
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:20,049
I'm just curious.

148
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:26,140
You're crazy, aren't you?
How could you do something like that?

149
00:16:26,164 --> 00:16:30,019
If you liked her that much,
you should've just stayed with her.

150
00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:33,022
Can you please shut up?

151
00:16:33,046 --> 00:16:37,026
Just think about it.
You were set for life.

152
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,444
Did you like her that much?

153
00:16:40,762 --> 00:16:46,701
What were you thinking?
Are you a fool for love? Is that it?

154
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:49,704
I didn't want to regret it.

155
00:16:52,398 --> 00:16:54,292
I didn't want…

156
00:16:55,944 --> 00:16:58,629
I didn't want to lose her.
That's why I did it.

157
00:17:00,365 --> 00:17:01,841
I'm sorry.

158
00:17:15,023 --> 00:17:18,585
Have you given it some thought?

159
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:27,992
You're the one who should think about it.
I already gave you my answer.

160
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:37,376
My dad seems to be waiting for your call.

161
00:17:38,736 --> 00:17:40,254
When is a good time for you?

162
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:44,050
Mi-gyeong.

163
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:53,225
You know as well as I do.
It's over for us.

164
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:01,692
How can you say that
after seeing what happened to Mr. Yang?

165
00:18:02,677 --> 00:18:05,071
What if you end up like him?

166
00:18:10,143 --> 00:18:11,494
I don't care.

167
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:22,296
Then what about Su-yeong?

168
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:27,591
Are you okay with her getting hurt?

169
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,308
Didn't you see how people
bad-mouthed Mr. Yang's ex?

170
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:38,270
And she didn't even work at the bank.

171
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:43,192
Because she didn't have an affair
with a married man,

172
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:46,425
do you think she'll be okay?

173
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:52,328
If we break up and you start dating her,

174
00:18:52,352 --> 00:18:55,205
you'll go through
what Mr. Yang went through.

175
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:57,915
Don't you want
to keep working at the bank?

176
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:05,381
You could lose…

177
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,677
a lot more than you might expect.

178
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:12,972
So think this through more carefully.

179
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:19,770
Then what about you?

180
00:19:21,673 --> 00:19:23,482
Are you okay?

181
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:28,988
Are you really okay with dating me…

182
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:33,034
when you already know how I feel?

183
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,337
Anything is better
than breaking up with you.

184
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:02,229
We haven't seen each other in a while.

185
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:06,108
That's true.

186
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:11,405
I was so shocked that day
that I just left in a hurry.

187
00:20:11,806 --> 00:20:12,908
Yes.

188
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:14,366
You seemed like it.

189
00:20:18,187 --> 00:20:20,706
As you already know, our family is…

190
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:24,001
Compared to yours, we're…

191
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:26,712
We're…

192
00:20:27,155 --> 00:20:29,090
You know.

193
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:34,470
So…

194
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:37,725
I came here today to ask

195
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:39,642
what you plan to do.

196
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,561
What do you mean?

197
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:47,776
Our adult children are dating.

198
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,362
As parents, we can't help
but consider their future.

199
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:56,617
They're still young.
We don't need to think that far ahead.

200
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:00,287
Goodness. Ms. Han.

201
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:02,495
Are you drawing a line?

202
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,331
No, not at all.

203
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,713
I think we're being hasty
when they haven't been dating for long.

204
00:21:07,737 --> 00:21:10,340
They've been together for some time now.

205
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:12,424
I found out a long time ago.

206
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,510
I see.

207
00:21:16,245 --> 00:21:17,596
Hold on.

208
00:21:18,623 --> 00:21:20,808
Don't you approve of Mi-gyeong?

209
00:21:23,628 --> 00:21:26,981
Goodness. This is unbelievable.

210
00:21:29,217 --> 00:21:31,515
Aren't you against them getting married?

211
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:35,476
Yes, but it's a different story
when you're against it too.

212
00:21:35,556 --> 00:21:40,494
When you think about it,
shouldn't I be the one who's against it?

213
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:46,876
What is it?

214
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:52,339
You have a pimple.

215
00:21:58,162 --> 00:21:59,555
Oh, no.

216
00:22:00,758 --> 00:22:03,068
I must've been really stressed.

217
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:05,103
It's so big.

218
00:22:05,127 --> 00:22:07,129
KCU BANK

219
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,276
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

220
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:17,324
-Hey, Jong-hyeon.
<i>-Hello.</i>

221
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:18,951
<i>-Hey.</i>
<i>-Come on. Hold on.</i>

222
00:22:18,975 --> 00:22:20,953
-Jong-hyeon has told us a lot about you.
-Stop.

223
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:22,704
If you're free, please stop by!

224
00:22:22,728 --> 00:22:23,914
-Please come!
-Come!

225
00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:25,249
-Su-yeong?
-Why did you do that?

226
00:22:25,273 --> 00:22:27,207
I'm sorry, Su-yeong.

227
00:22:28,205 --> 00:22:29,205
Oh.

228
00:22:31,988 --> 00:22:34,506
I'll come there. Where are you?

229
00:22:55,577 --> 00:22:58,251
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

230
00:23:02,518 --> 00:23:04,705
Once again, it's nice to meet you.

231
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:07,748
By the way, is today a special occasion?

232
00:23:08,524 --> 00:23:10,000
It's our 50-day celebration.

233
00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:15,215
Didn't you know?

234
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:17,216
We have 50 days until the exam.

235
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:21,597
So how long…

236
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:24,640
-have you two been going out?
-How did you meet?

237
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,436
-Stop asking her.
-Why?

238
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,604
We met at the bank.
We work at the same place.

239
00:23:31,213 --> 00:23:32,190
No way.

240
00:23:32,214 --> 00:23:34,151
-Unbelievable.
-Jong-hyeon has skills.

241
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:35,277
He has everything.

242
00:23:35,301 --> 00:23:37,778
Well, I'm more envious of her.

243
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:43,450
She's pretty, works at a bank,
and also dates Jong-hyeon.

244
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:45,412
I'm so jealous.

245
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:47,873
-Hey, stop drinking.
-Why?

246
00:23:47,897 --> 00:23:50,250
Thanks to you,
my mock exam scores have shot up,

247
00:23:50,274 --> 00:23:51,583
so I'm in a great mood.

248
00:23:52,136 --> 00:23:55,406
You were laughing at my jokes
up until a while ago.

249
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:01,532
Su-yeong, it's okay
to make him laugh, right?

250
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:05,390
Sorry?

251
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:09,728
He told me
that he was the most grateful to you.

252
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:12,688
But he said he had the most fun with me.

253
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:15,774
He laughs a lot when I'm around.

254
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:18,612
Hey, what's gotten into you?

255
00:24:18,636 --> 00:24:22,448
-What?
-Su-yeong, I'm sorry.

256
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:35,794
I'm sorry about today.

257
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:38,005
What for?

258
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:43,010
I shouldn't have let you come.
You ended up paying for everything.

259
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:45,721
It's not a big deal.

260
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:08,436
PERMANENTLY CLOSED DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

261
00:25:12,898 --> 00:25:14,750
Do you live around here?

262
00:25:18,404 --> 00:25:21,256
I live nearby too. Up there.

263
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,409
Su-yeong.

264
00:25:50,186 --> 00:25:52,621
Do you want to go on a date tomorrow?

265
00:25:53,647 --> 00:25:55,999
But your exam is around the corner.

266
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:57,793
Exactly.

267
00:25:58,235 --> 00:26:01,547
Let's go on a date before I get too busy.

268
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:05,968
All right.

269
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:08,595
Let's do that.

270
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:38,417
Your palm is sweaty.

271
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:49,808
Let's go in.

272
00:26:50,246 --> 00:26:51,597
Okay.

273
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,331
<i>They're living together.</i>

274
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:15,871
Su-yeong and Mr. Jeong
are living together!

275
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:37,892
What's this?

276
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:41,271
Oh, they're tarts. You can have them.

277
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:44,900
Did you get them for me?

278
00:27:45,384 --> 00:27:48,278
They looked good, so I bought some.

279
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:55,410
Stop what you're doing and sit down.

280
00:28:06,488 --> 00:28:10,300
Today, Mi-gyeong's mom came for a visit.

281
00:28:10,784 --> 00:28:13,971
They seem to think
marriage is on the table.

282
00:28:14,246 --> 00:28:15,556
Am I right?

283
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:23,063
I just want to know
what your thoughts are about this.

284
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,403
We're going to break up.

285
00:28:30,846 --> 00:28:32,656
It's already over on my part.

286
00:28:35,684 --> 00:28:40,414
But Mi-gyeong isn't ready yet,
so I'm giving her some time.

287
00:28:42,274 --> 00:28:44,251
What kind of person is she?

288
00:28:45,945 --> 00:28:47,254
What?

289
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:50,966
The person whom you truly like.

290
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:53,885
What kind of woman is she?

291
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:09,359
I don't know when it started,

292
00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:12,821
but I'd run simulations in my head.

293
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:20,370
No matter what the issue is,
I'd always imagine the end result first.

294
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:25,542
I'd imagine the worst possible scenario

295
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:29,921
and worry about whether or not
I could handle it.

296
00:29:32,283 --> 00:29:36,136
I only feel at ease
once I come up with a solution.

297
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,431
But with her…

298
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:43,143
that's not possible.

299
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:48,982
<i>I feel anxious…</i>

300
00:29:50,426 --> 00:29:52,194
<i>and uncomfortable…</i>

301
00:29:54,054 --> 00:29:55,697
<i>about this situation…</i>

302
00:29:57,391 --> 00:29:58,992
<i>and my feelings.</i>

303
00:30:01,395 --> 00:30:02,871
<i>And yet…</i>

304
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:09,252
<i>none of that matters when I'm with her.</i>

305
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:19,638
End of confession.

306
00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:24,393
Can I get back to that?

307
00:30:40,392 --> 00:30:41,993
Shall we?

308
00:30:43,187 --> 00:30:44,454
Yes.

309
00:30:54,948 --> 00:30:56,383
Excuse me.

310
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:10,063
<i>Back up!</i>

311
00:31:25,896 --> 00:31:28,498
-You should eat too.
-I will.

312
00:31:33,362 --> 00:31:34,629
Su-yeong--

313
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,634
-Why did you hit him?
-Oh, dear.

314
00:31:37,658 --> 00:31:38,885
Stop that.

315
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:41,012
Hush. There are other customers here.

316
00:31:41,036 --> 00:31:42,847
Apologize to your brother.

317
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:45,016
-Give me the phone.
-You were saying?

318
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,643
Never mind. Enjoy the food.

319
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,395
He apologized. Now be quiet.

320
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,146
-It's over.
-Be quiet. We're in public.

321
00:32:01,515 --> 00:32:02,699
What is it?

322
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:07,579
I have something to give you.

323
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:29,434
Do you not like it?

324
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:35,065
No, I like it.

325
00:32:56,904 --> 00:32:58,171
Does it not fit?

326
00:32:59,114 --> 00:33:02,342
I think my finger is a little swollen.

327
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:05,720
I'll try it on again later.

328
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:08,390
Okay.

329
00:33:15,714 --> 00:33:17,065
Thank you.

330
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:53,226
Hello?

331
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:55,522
Oh.

332
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:56,771
Hello, ma'am.

333
00:33:57,881 --> 00:34:00,692
Should I apologize
for calling you out on the weekend?

334
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:03,361
That's okay.

335
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:07,190
By the way, what did you want to tell me?

336
00:34:07,222 --> 00:34:09,494
Oh, it's nothing serious.

337
00:34:09,518 --> 00:34:12,288
First, let me check off
a few things from my bucket list.

338
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:15,166
I'd sometimes get jealous
of my friends who have sons.

339
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,417
They go on shopping dates, you see.

340
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:20,003
I see.

341
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:23,423
Goodness, Sang-su. Follow me.

342
00:34:32,624 --> 00:34:34,477
-It's okay.
-Right?

343
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:36,186
Isn't it just perfect?

344
00:34:38,338 --> 00:34:40,565
Your son is very handsome, ma'am.

345
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:44,569
Oh, is he not your son?

346
00:34:44,845 --> 00:34:46,321
Yes, he is.

347
00:34:47,222 --> 00:34:49,449
Sang-su, go try this on.

348
00:34:51,184 --> 00:34:52,786
Ma'am.

349
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:55,330
I have something to tell you.

350
00:34:56,815 --> 00:34:58,166
What is it?

351
00:35:09,213 --> 00:35:10,981
Hey, you're here.

352
00:35:19,921 --> 00:35:22,023
We went shopping together.

353
00:35:24,718 --> 00:35:26,821
Why didn't you invite me?

354
00:35:26,845 --> 00:35:30,657
We stopped midway
because he had something to tell me.

355
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:34,245
You shouldn't call him when he's busy.

356
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:35,955
He should be with me instead.

357
00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:38,289
I had something to say too.

358
00:35:39,441 --> 00:35:40,875
What is it?

359
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,212
To be honest,

360
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:46,923
I liked you from the moment
I first laid my eyes on you.

361
00:35:49,117 --> 00:35:53,972
So I've decided
to fully support your marriage.

362
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:03,857
Are you moved by what I said?

363
00:36:04,383 --> 00:36:05,817
Did I startle you?

364
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:08,613
They say parents
always give in to their kids.

365
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:10,739
And I agree.

366
00:36:11,306 --> 00:36:12,866
Mom.

367
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:16,077
I'm sorry.

368
00:36:17,423 --> 00:36:18,423
Oh?

369
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:20,457
For what?

370
00:36:20,899 --> 00:36:22,792
Don't do it.

371
00:36:23,652 --> 00:36:28,048
Don't cut him off. That's rude.

372
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:30,675
I'm listening, Sang-su.

373
00:36:32,475 --> 00:36:34,661
-I--
-Don't.

374
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:41,227
Mi-gyeong and I…

375
00:36:45,974 --> 00:36:47,825
have decided to break up.

376
00:36:57,394 --> 00:36:58,787
I'm sorry.

377
00:37:18,331 --> 00:37:20,308
We need to talk.

378
00:37:29,217 --> 00:37:31,027
How could you do this?

379
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:36,117
My mom liked you so much
that she wanted us to get married.

380
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:37,700
Did you have to…

381
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:41,414
let her know like this?

382
00:37:41,438 --> 00:37:46,167
Pretending like everything was fine
would've been more dishonest.

383
00:37:47,861 --> 00:37:49,963
I'm truly sorry.

384
00:37:50,864 --> 00:37:52,633
I'm aware of how much I hurt you.

385
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:54,008
But…

386
00:37:56,328 --> 00:37:58,139
I can't keep going like this.

387
00:37:58,163 --> 00:37:59,347
Why…

388
00:38:03,168 --> 00:38:04,727
Why can't you…

389
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:09,023
just love me?

390
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,280
Even though you want to break up,

391
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:19,075
and you're in love with someone else,
I still love you.

392
00:38:20,268 --> 00:38:22,745
So why don't you love me back?

393
00:38:23,522 --> 00:38:25,625
What did I do that was so wrong?

394
00:38:25,649 --> 00:38:29,544
It's not your fault
that I feel this way, Mi-gyeong.

395
00:38:36,493 --> 00:38:40,305
What about Su-yeong?
Is she going to break up too?

396
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:49,981
If you break up with me,
will she leave Mr. Jeong and come to you?

397
00:38:57,138 --> 00:38:58,615
Sang-su, I…

398
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:01,993
I really tried my best.

399
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,748
I wanted to be a good person
because that was easier to do.

400
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,752
But I won't be like that anymore.

401
00:39:12,737 --> 00:39:14,756
I'll do whatever it takes…

402
00:39:17,784 --> 00:39:20,011
to get the love I deserve.

403
00:39:41,189 --> 00:39:43,534
Oh, I won't be out long.

404
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:47,471
And I couldn't tell you earlier,

405
00:39:49,774 --> 00:39:53,544
but I'm going
to look for a place again soon.

406
00:39:55,238 --> 00:39:59,634
Maybe not as big as my old house,
but I could find a smaller place.

407
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:06,724
I'll also pay you back soon.

408
00:40:12,547 --> 00:40:13,898
All right.

409
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,342
Su-yeong.

410
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:28,746
Can I ask you for a favor?

411
00:40:30,815 --> 00:40:32,875
Move a bit more to the side.

412
00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:37,922
To your left.

413
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:43,845
This is an important photo, though.
Going to a photo studio might be better.

414
00:40:43,995 --> 00:40:45,221
This is fine.

415
00:40:46,164 --> 00:40:50,018
I think I'll do better on the exam
if you take the photo.

416
00:41:02,847 --> 00:41:04,532
I'm going to take it now.

417
00:41:17,237 --> 00:41:24,385
<i>Do you really like me?</i>

418
00:41:26,413 --> 00:41:30,767
<i>Do you love me?</i>

419
00:41:35,588 --> 00:41:37,106
<i>I won't give up.</i>

420
00:41:39,926 --> 00:41:42,904
<i>So can we start over?</i>

421
00:41:53,273 --> 00:41:54,707
I love you.

422
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,575
<i>Good night.</i>

423
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,309
SECTION CHIEF

KCU BANK

425
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:55,768
How's Seok-hyeon doing these days?

426
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:57,772
Oh, he's going on a trip.

427
00:42:57,796 --> 00:43:00,189
More like going into exile if you ask me.

428
00:43:02,008 --> 00:43:04,652
I don't have to worry
about you, Sang-su, do I?

429
00:43:05,428 --> 00:43:06,779
Hey.

430
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,949
Don't follow Seok-hyeon's footsteps.

431
00:43:10,183 --> 00:43:12,328
You might not suffer as much as he did,

432
00:43:12,352 --> 00:43:15,997
but you'll be done for if you offend
anyone in Ms. Park's family.

433
00:43:17,982 --> 00:43:20,920
What's with the long face?
Did you guys argue?

434
00:43:20,944 --> 00:43:24,507
About the Yeongmin Group's loan deal,
have you read the documents?

435
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:28,843
Yes, I started.
I'll finish up before lunchtime.

NEW NOTIFICATION: KCU HQ ANNOUNCEMENT

437

KCU BANK ANNOUNCEMENT
FOR 4TH QUARTER POSITION TRANSFER

438
00:44:09,367 --> 00:44:10,868
Are you busy?

439
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:18,334
I came to apologize.

440
00:44:19,627 --> 00:44:21,128
Sorry?

441
00:44:23,715 --> 00:44:26,467
I found out you were living
with Jong-hyeon…

442
00:44:29,512 --> 00:44:32,473
when I visited your house the last time.

443
00:44:35,226 --> 00:44:37,978
I told Sang-su about it.

444
00:44:45,403 --> 00:44:48,155
You know why I did that, right?

445
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,827
But still, I'm sorry.

446
00:44:55,371 --> 00:44:58,082
It was a personal matter.

447
00:44:59,834 --> 00:45:02,002
But I used it to my advantage.

448
00:45:07,317 --> 00:45:09,473
I tried to resent you.

449
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:14,014
And I did a bit.

450
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,975
That's okay.

451
00:45:19,604 --> 00:45:23,649
You can resent and despise me.

452
00:45:27,862 --> 00:45:29,548
That would make me feel better.

453
00:45:29,572 --> 00:45:30,990
That's exactly why…

454
00:45:33,493 --> 00:45:35,578
I don't want you to feel better.

455
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:40,583
I want you to feel bad,
knowing that I like you.

456
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:47,089
Let that be a reason
to think twice about him.

457
00:45:51,886 --> 00:45:54,680
I want you to continue feeling guilty.

458
00:45:56,391 --> 00:45:57,892
So…

459
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:02,271
I'm going to keep liking you.

460
00:46:55,528 --> 00:46:59,906
When I was in college,
there was a girl whom I liked.

461
00:47:01,242 --> 00:47:03,035
First love for both of us.

462
00:47:05,204 --> 00:47:08,665
I knew she was from a wealthy family.

463
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:12,294
But one day, her cousin visited me.

464
00:47:12,878 --> 00:47:16,256
That was when I found out
how incredibly rich they were.

465
00:47:19,301 --> 00:47:21,762
Well, the rest of the story is obvious.

466
00:47:23,097 --> 00:47:25,265
"You're not good enough for her."

467
00:47:25,808 --> 00:47:27,684
He told me to break up.

468
00:47:30,688 --> 00:47:36,902
But I didn't listen, and I think it was
the third time he visited me.

469
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,926
I've never told this to anyone before.

470
00:48:03,721 --> 00:48:05,931
Then why did you tell me?

471
00:48:16,775 --> 00:48:18,360
Because I'm so bored.

472
00:48:19,236 --> 00:48:22,757
Gosh, why don't we ever see
any students come to the bank?

473
00:48:22,781 --> 00:48:24,134
Do I need to reach out to them?

474
00:48:24,158 --> 00:48:26,952
Gosh, this is a problem.

475
00:48:41,786 --> 00:48:44,872
AHN SU-YEONG

476
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,184
You haven't left yet.

477
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,686
No.

478
00:49:09,522 --> 00:49:11,899
You didn't have to hang up.

479
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:19,531
Goodbye.

480
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:21,116
By the way…

481
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:24,995
whom were you calling?

482
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:35,714
I was wondering if it was Ms. Park
because she'll be out soon.

483
00:49:47,143 --> 00:49:49,937
I'm going to see Su-yeong now.

484
00:50:32,688 --> 00:50:34,314
<i>Then what about Su-yeong?</i>

485
00:50:35,553 --> 00:50:37,888
<i>Are you okay with her getting hurt?</i>

486
00:50:39,528 --> 00:50:43,073
Because she didn't have an affair
with a married man,

487
00:50:44,158 --> 00:50:46,451
do you think she'll be okay?

488
00:50:48,037 --> 00:50:49,913
<i>Is Su-yeong going to break up too?</i>

489
00:50:51,374 --> 00:50:58,130
<i>If you break up with me,</i>
<i>will she leave Mr. Jeong and come to you?</i>

490
00:52:12,872 --> 00:52:16,917
<i>I'm near your house.</i>
<i>Can we meet for a minute?</i>

491
00:53:03,172 --> 00:53:04,589
Sang-su.

492
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:07,092
Can you go to the subbranch?

493
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:08,261
Sorry?

494
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:11,031
Ms. Ahn suddenly took the day off,

495
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:14,868
so I asked if anyone
would be willing to sub for her.

496
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:18,455
But then everyone
became busy all of a sudden.

497
00:53:18,479 --> 00:53:20,290
Look how busy they are.

498
00:53:20,314 --> 00:53:22,899
So how could I ask them…

499
00:53:24,151 --> 00:53:25,212
What is it?

500
00:53:25,236 --> 00:53:27,863
Are you suddenly busy too?
Should I go instead?

501
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:31,324
No, I'll go.

502
00:53:31,617 --> 00:53:33,493
Okay. Thanks.

503
00:53:40,668 --> 00:53:43,104
Please fill in the blanks I checked.

504
00:53:43,128 --> 00:53:44,629
Okay.

505
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,402
Why are you here?

506
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,344
I'm subbing for her.

507
00:54:33,387 --> 00:54:35,514
<i>I have a question.</i>

508
00:54:36,515 --> 00:54:43,688
Do you really like me?

509
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:49,421
<i>Do you love me?</i>

510
00:54:49,445 --> 00:54:50,904
<i>I like you.</i>

511
00:54:52,448 --> 00:54:54,991
It wasn't a mistake,
and I don't regret it.

512
00:55:00,414 --> 00:55:02,976
<i>Don't follow Seok-hyeon's footsteps.</i>

513
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,795
You'll be done for if you offend
anyone in Ms. Park's family.

514
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:10,549
<i>Banks are too conservative.</i>

515
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,694
<i>One scandal here could ruin your career.</i>

516
00:55:12,718 --> 00:55:13,987
<i>He would've been promoted</i>

517
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:17,639
<i>and received financial support from</i>
<i>his in-laws. I don't get why he did that.</i>

518
00:55:17,806 --> 00:55:21,017
<i>Me neither. He knew he'd regret it.</i>

519
00:55:21,393 --> 00:55:22,853
<i>That's exactly why…</i>

520
00:55:23,479 --> 00:55:25,313
<i>I don't want you to feel better.</i>

521
00:55:27,816 --> 00:55:29,693
Think twice about him.

522
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:32,839
<i>I want you to continue feeling guilty.</i>

523
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,406
<i>So…</i>

524
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:37,617
<i>I'm going to keep liking you.</i>

525
00:55:38,243 --> 00:55:40,162
It looks like you're in pain.

526
00:55:43,248 --> 00:55:44,791
Yes, but that's okay.

527
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:19,368
"THE FAREWELL WALTZ"

528
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:53,844
It's me.

529
00:56:56,405 --> 00:56:57,848
I know.

530
00:57:00,534 --> 00:57:03,311
Where are you?

531
00:57:28,437 --> 00:57:30,040
Where are you going?

532
00:57:30,064 --> 00:57:31,291
Can you close up alone?

533
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:33,216
Have you thought this through?

534
00:57:35,903 --> 00:57:39,139
No. I'm done thinking.
I decided that a while ago.

535
00:57:57,867 --> 00:57:59,685
<i>Did you take the day off?</i>

536
00:57:59,953 --> 00:58:01,663
JEONG JONG-HYEON

537
00:58:01,746 --> 00:58:03,356
<i>I miss you.</i>

538
00:58:03,744 --> 00:58:05,854
<i>You know I love you, right?</i>

539
00:58:11,506 --> 00:58:15,301
SLIDE TO POWER OFF

540
00:58:44,497 --> 00:58:46,315
You came to the right place.

541
00:58:48,418 --> 00:58:51,696
Of course. You're here.

542
00:58:57,635 --> 00:58:59,787
Do you want some steamed silkworms?

543
00:59:00,481 --> 00:59:02,132
There's some over there.

544
00:59:03,308 --> 00:59:07,670
It's okay. I'm full. I had a heavy lunch.

545
00:59:12,275 --> 00:59:15,428
I was sick of the ocean
when I lived in Tongyeong.

546
00:59:19,258 --> 00:59:23,412
But I always think of it
when I'm struggling.

547
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:30,497
Are you struggling?

548
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:47,084
You made a nice sand castle.

549
00:59:48,436 --> 00:59:51,255
I made them a lot as a kid.

550
00:59:52,183 --> 00:59:54,127
Sand is free, after all.

551
00:59:58,683 --> 01:00:01,836
Do you know what I realized…

552
01:00:03,154 --> 01:00:05,305
while making a sand castle?

553
01:00:10,228 --> 01:00:12,630
That one day,
it will eventually get washed away.

554
01:00:18,007 --> 01:00:20,075
Despite knowing all that…

555
01:00:21,886 --> 01:00:25,331
I was always worried
after carefully building one.

556
01:00:27,475 --> 01:00:31,378
"What if someone destroys it
once I return home?"

557
01:00:33,898 --> 01:00:36,717
"What if it gets swept away by the waves?"

558
01:00:38,903 --> 01:00:41,096
I was worried sick all night long.

559
01:00:45,451 --> 01:00:47,603
So guess what I did?

560
01:00:49,984 --> 01:00:51,594
What did you do?

561
01:00:56,087 --> 01:00:58,364
I destroyed it myself.

562
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:06,831
That way, I wouldn't have to worry.

563
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,420
If I destroyed it myself…

564
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,660
You could be wrong.

565
01:01:24,219 --> 01:01:26,037
The sand castle…

566
01:01:27,702 --> 01:01:30,104
could remain there for a very long time.

567
01:02:02,695 --> 01:02:05,222
You've changed, Mr. Ha.

568
01:02:24,258 --> 01:02:27,703
Can you get me something hot to drink?

569
01:02:28,721 --> 01:02:31,081
The wind is picking up. It's chilly.

570
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:43,677
Sure.

571
01:03:02,004 --> 01:03:03,322
Mr. Ha.

572
01:03:09,516 --> 01:03:10,876
Thank you.

573
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,169
I'll be quick.

574
01:03:56,267 --> 01:03:57,543
Excuse me.

575
01:03:57,852 --> 01:03:59,920
One minute, please.

576
01:04:02,702 --> 01:04:05,431
Excuse me. I'd like to pay for these.

577
01:04:05,456 --> 01:04:08,108
Sure. One minute, please.

578
01:04:09,989 --> 01:04:12,759
I'm sorry, but could you hurry?

579
01:04:12,783 --> 01:04:14,184
Okay.

580
01:04:17,092 --> 01:04:18,236
Here.

581
01:04:18,261 --> 01:04:20,621
That's 10,000 won. The change--

582
01:05:10,132 --> 01:05:14,119
<i>The phone you have dialed is turned off…</i>

583
01:05:18,771 --> 01:05:20,118
Thank you for the meal.

584
01:05:20,142 --> 01:05:22,669
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Bye.

585
01:05:29,107 --> 01:05:30,383
Hello.

586
01:05:39,328 --> 01:05:41,605
Where's Mom? I heard she was discharged.

587
01:05:42,748 --> 01:05:47,111
She's resting at home. Have you eaten yet?

588
01:05:48,941 --> 01:05:51,302
I want to drink instead.

589
01:06:24,527 --> 01:06:26,386
Why did you do it?

590
01:06:30,504 --> 01:06:33,198
We may have been poor.

591
01:06:35,551 --> 01:06:38,787
But we were still a happy family
before that incident.

592
01:06:41,849 --> 01:06:46,211
Mom worked really hard
while you were away working.

593
01:06:46,812 --> 01:06:50,340
She worked at a restaurant
and sold insurance as well.

594
01:06:51,692 --> 01:06:54,469
She worked her fingers to the bone.

595
01:06:56,408 --> 01:06:58,810
So why did you do that to her?

596
01:07:09,376 --> 01:07:11,695
Did you like that woman that much?

597
01:07:15,135 --> 01:07:17,822
You didn't care about hurting others

598
01:07:17,846 --> 01:07:20,540
or being criticized by them.

599
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:24,377
Were you that much in love?

600
01:07:33,486 --> 01:07:35,596
It can't be stopped.

601
01:07:41,161 --> 01:07:43,646
Once you start loving someone,

602
01:07:44,539 --> 01:07:46,232
you can't stop.

603
01:07:50,044 --> 01:07:53,489
You know it's wrong,
but you just can't stop.

604
01:08:06,088 --> 01:08:07,315
Then why did you come back?

605
01:08:07,339 --> 01:08:09,324
Because of regret.

606
01:08:11,301 --> 01:08:14,871
If it were possible to turn back time,

607
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,040
that choice wouldn't be made.

608
01:08:18,058 --> 01:08:22,420
Nobody would make that choice
if they knew how much they'd suffer later.

609
01:08:38,746 --> 01:08:41,231
You weren't of any help to me back then…

610
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:45,277
and you're still of no help.

611
01:08:45,836 --> 01:08:48,405
Su-yeong, is something going on?

612
01:08:48,839 --> 01:08:50,240
I'm leaving.

613
01:09:13,534 --> 01:09:14,952
JEONG JONG-HYEON

614
01:09:15,035 --> 01:09:17,955
SU-YEONG, WHY IS YOUR PHONE OFF?

615
01:09:18,038 --> 01:09:19,373
OPEN IMAGE

616
01:09:20,207 --> 01:09:24,127
SECTION CHIEF
HA SANG-SU

617
01:10:07,004 --> 01:10:10,031
Can we meet right now?

618
01:10:29,818 --> 01:10:31,052
Hello.

619
01:10:31,653 --> 01:10:34,639
Has Ms. Ahn come to work yet?

620
01:10:34,806 --> 01:10:37,684
Oh, she just went into the locker room.

621
01:10:38,325 --> 01:10:39,962
I see.

622
01:10:43,206 --> 01:10:44,601
-Hey.
-Hello.

623
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:48,521
Long time no see, Mr. Kim.
The advertisement pamphlets just came in.

624
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:50,864
-Good. Thanks in advance.
-My pleasure.

625
01:10:51,173 --> 01:10:54,068
By the way, where is Mr. Jeong?

626
01:10:54,092 --> 01:10:56,202
I'm not sure. Maybe he's running late.

627
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:27,776
You're here.

628
01:11:34,466 --> 01:11:37,660
Why did you leave
all of a sudden yesterday?

629
01:12:14,131 --> 01:12:16,032
Is it true?

630
01:12:18,927 --> 01:12:20,900
-Let's talk outside.
-Answer me!

631
01:12:20,925 --> 01:12:23,940
-Jong-hyeon--
-I'm asking you a question!

632
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:31,381
Tell me.

633
01:12:35,736 --> 01:12:37,303
You already know the answer.

634
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,533
What are you doing?

635
01:13:05,557 --> 01:13:08,036
-Let me go!
-Mr. Jeong!

636
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:11,254
What? Is there something
between you and Su-yeong too?

637
01:13:11,772 --> 01:13:14,257
Did you sleep with her too?

638
01:13:47,068 --> 01:13:49,625
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

639
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:10,306
You scumbag. Why did you…

640
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:12,044
{\an8}Did you have feelings for Gyeong-pil?

641
01:14:12,068 --> 01:14:13,416
{\an8}Is this funny to you?
