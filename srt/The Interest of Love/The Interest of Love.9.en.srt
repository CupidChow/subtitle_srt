THE INTEREST OF LOVE

2
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,274
-You're here.
-Hey.

3
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,984
You're home early.

4
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,611
The audit ended a little early.

5
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,450
I wonder if your mother arrived safely.

6
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,246
The Thai airport is a busy place.

7
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:20,914
Right.

8
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,545
I heard you gave her some spending money.

9
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,130
Thank you.

10
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,133
It's not a big deal.

11
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,211
EPISODE 9

12
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,132
Mr. Ha.

13
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,593
Mr. Ha.

14
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,554
Yes?

15
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,266
Ms. Ahn.

16
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,018
This is bad.

17
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,312
The groom has to enter,
but Mr. Yang is gone.

18
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,314
What?

19
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,835
Have you found him yet?

20
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,296
No, but Mr. Ha.
This building has a rooftop.

21
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,215
I'll go take a look.

22
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,811
Hey, you punk. What in the world…

23
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,105
Why are you here, Seok-hyeon?

24
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,149
How can Jeong-eun do this to me?

25
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,276
What is it?

26
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,319
She told me…

27
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,406
She told me to be happy.

28
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,828
I'm marrying another woman
after four years with her.

29
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,954
How can she say that?

30
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,958
How can I be happy without Jeong-eun?

31
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:33,088
You're getting married today.
You need to pull it together.

32
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:37,592
Sang-su, I won't get married.
I'm not going to get married.

33
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,719
Darn it.

34
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,596
Please welcome the bride and groom.

35
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,951
I can't believe that happened.

36
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,664
I knew he'd go through with it.

37
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,918
Right.

38
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,421
He would've done it anyway.

39
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,764
Everyone, please look at the camera.

40
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,726
Excuse me. The tall man in the second row.

41
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,562
Me?

42
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,106
Yes, please switch places
with the man behind you.

43
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,068
Darn it.

44
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,206
Here we go now. Please look at the camera.

45
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,791
One, two, three.

46
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,007
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

47
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,470
Ms. Park.

48
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,890
-It's been a while.
-Hello.

49
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,975
It's nice to run into you.

50
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,685
Have you been well?

51
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,063
Is your father doing well?

52
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,231
Yes.

53
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,400
Hello, Director.

54
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,194
-May I speak with you?
-Shall we?

55
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,153
Yes.

56
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,989
Ms. Park?

57
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,033
Yes.

58
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,663
Hey.

59
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,457
Looks like your girlfriend
knows the director too.

60
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,794
Good for you, Sang-su.

61
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,525
What are you doing here?
I didn't see you during the banquet.

62
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,031
I don't think I should have come.

63
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:12,038
You work with everyone too.
I'm sure Mr. Yang will be happy you came.

64
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,053
Should we get going?

65
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,229
Actually, I'm a little hungry too.

66
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,399
Let's go eat something good.

67
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,359
Okay.

68
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,706
Is his name really Ha Sang-su?

69
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,999
Yes.

70
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,168
Funny, right?
I thought it sounded strange.

71
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,047
Anyway, he was one good-looking man.

72
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,840
But that's not everything.

73
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,592
He was raised by a single mother…

74
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,304
I mean…

75
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,224
Of course,
there are great single mothers like you.

76
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,226
I'm not that narrow-minded.

77
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,314
It's just that my husband
is very conservative.

78
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,434
Did you know you need to get married

79
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,812
within six months
after catching the bouquet

80
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,647
or it won't happen for three years?

81
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,066
That's just a superstition.

82
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,735
Superstitions are based on statistics.

83
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,823
Superstitions are just superstitions.

84
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,287
Why does my stomach feel so queasy?

85
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,581
Let's go to your place.

86
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,334
I want to stay and have some <i>ramyeon.</i>

87
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,675
What's with that look?
I'm only staying for <i>ramyeon.</i>

88
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,594
Sure. I didn't say anything.

89
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,730
We could've gone somewhere better.

90
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,815
This is my favorite.

91
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,446
Why don't we do something this weekend?

92
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,868
Oh, right.

93
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,041
No, it's okay.
I was going to take the weekend off.

94
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,422
Then let's go to the flower market
early in the morning.

95
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,923
Sure. Sounds great.

96
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,471
Or maybe an art gallery?
There's an exhibition I'm interested in.

97
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,597
That sounds good too.

98
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,187
How about a trip to the ocean?

99
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,355
I like the ocean too.

100
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,111
What's going on, Jong-hyeon?

101
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,363
What?

102
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,117
Why are you saying yes to everything?

103
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,833
Because you want to do those things.

104
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,546
Then are you just trying to please me?

105
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,176
I like doing those things too.

106
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,350
Forget it.

107
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,854
I want some alone time,
so you should go study.

108
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,904
-Are you done?
-Yes.

109
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:13,863
Shall we go?

110
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,449
-Let me get it.
-Next time.

111
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,742
Excuse me.

112
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,162
Here. Thank you.

113
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,665
Let's go.

114
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,304
All done.

115
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,642
Gosh, this looks good.

116
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,897
I'm sorry, Sang-su.
I don't think I can eat that.

117
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,732
What? Why not?

118
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,902
I'm sorry.
I don't feel good all of a sudden.

119
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,363
What is it? Do you feel sick?

120
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,575
I think I ate too much at the wedding.

121
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,035
-I'll take medicine and sleep.
-Let me drive you.

122
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,080
No, stay home.
It's just a short taxi ride away.

123
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,832
I'll call when I get home.

124
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,718
What's that?

125
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,511
Wine, but it's not that great.

126
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,016
I used to drink this a lot before.

127
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,938
You said that I don't have
to please you in every way.

128
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,151
I don't want you to do that for me either.

129
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,572
Go back to the wine bar
and the gallery you used to stop by

130
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,199
after work.

131
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,956
I only stopped because I enjoyed
staying home with you more.

132
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,838
This is even better than I remember.

133
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,715
Thank you.

134
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,177
And take this too.

135
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,013
It's for living expenses. It's not much.

136
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,515
You don't have to do this.

137
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,434
It'll make me feel better.

138
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,608
Okay, then. I'll accept it.

139
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,903
How about a toast?

140
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,907
Here's to passing your exam.

141
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,577
Cheers.

142
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,636
Hey, Mom.

143
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:43,805
I'm home.

144
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,182
I'm alone, of course.

145
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,025
Why did you call ahead?
You've never done that before.

146
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,070
I thought you might be with someone.

147
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,864
And who would that be?

148
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,243
Park Mi-gyeong.

149
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,750
Are you two really dating?

150
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,880
And did you two meet today?

151
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,757
How did you know?

152
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,387
She's a regular at my shop.
She and her mom are my VIP clients.

153
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,892
Ms. Park's mother gave you
that necktie as a gift.

154
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,103
We became friends.

155
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,192
Did you know about her family
when you got into this?

156
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,612
What's her family like?

157
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,074
The landlord of my shop
is friends with her mom.

158
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,659
They're in the same group.

159
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,788
And the poorest one in that group is
my landlord, who owns the shop building.

160
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,839
But still, I support your relationship.

161
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,926
I like that you're dating someone
and living your life.

162
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,975
Take some <i>jangjorim </i>too.

163
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,063
Ha Sang-su,
you are just as good as she is.

AHN SU-YEONG, JEONG JONG-HYEON
BLIND DATE?

168
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,744
<i>Ms. Park, the handover files</i>
<i>are on your desk.</i>

169
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,954
Thank you, Ms. Ahn.

170
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,248
And this is yours.

171
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,582
Thank you, Su-yeong.

172
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,670
-Did you like her too?
-Who?

173
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,839
Ms. Ahn.

174
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,599
You didn't know, did you?

175
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,232
Like you said,

176
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,944
I'm not 100% ready yet.

177
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,072
Were you really single that whole time?
Not even a crush?

178
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,366
<i>Ahn Su-yeong!</i>

179
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,084
What's going on with you and Sang-su?

180
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,966
Do you like Mr. Ha?

181
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,010
What?

182
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,689

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO TAKE ONE

186
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,850
Hey.

187
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,645
<i>Sang-su, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I don't think I can make it today.</i>

188
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,732
Why? Is something the matter?

189
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,651
No, something important suddenly came up.

190
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,903
Right. I see.

191
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,072
I'm sorry.

192
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,450
Yes.

193
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,327
Okay, I'll call you.

194
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,454
Bye.

ASSISTANT MANAGER
PARK MI-GYEONG

196
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,415
-You're home.
-Are you going out?

197
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,292
Ms. Park wants to see me.

198
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,545
I finished early because it's the weekend.

199
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,506
I'll be home soon. I won't be late.

200
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,132
No, you should have fun today.

201
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,492
What happened here?

202
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,124
I was getting tired
of watering the plants,

203
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,419
and I rarely play the piano anyway,
so I got rid of everything.

204
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,508
It's better to have all this out here
than in your room, right?

205
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,556
I'm going to be late. See you soon.

206
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,808
Su-yeong.

207
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,313
Let's talk for a moment.

208
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:42,366
I had to think long and hard
about moving into your home.

209
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,415
I moved in,
pretending as if you'd convinced me…

210
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,754
but I sometimes wondered
if I had been waiting…

211
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,508
for you to ask me.

212
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,636
Whenever that happened…

213
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,933
I felt really small and pathetic.

214
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,394
Jong-hyeon, what's this about?

215
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:11,812
The veranda.

216
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,156
If you do this, then how can I stay here?

217
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,287
What did I do?

218
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,873
I'm disrupting your life.

219
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:38,255
I made you give up a room
and empty out the veranda.

220
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,760
You keep giving up
or compromising because of me,

221
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,596
but it's too much.

222
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,187
So I really don't know what to do.

223
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,949
Do you regret it?

224
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,913
Do you regret moving in with me?

225
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,383
You're right about the veranda.

226
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,762
I wouldn't have cleaned it out
if I lived alone.

227
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,851
You were part of the reason, but…

228
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,896
why is that a bad thing?

229
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:41,277
If I were in your situation,
wouldn't you have done the same for me?

230
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:47,032
Would you have just sat
and watched as I struggled?

231
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,033
Su-yeong.

232
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,952
It's not that.

233
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,132
Tell me.

234
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,557
No. I'm sorry.

235
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,697
I'll be back.

236
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,006
Let's grab a drink.

237
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,593
Next time.

238
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,304
Why? Do you have a date?

239
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:58,270
Everyone knows
that you're dating Ms. Park.

240
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:04,735
And here I thought you had
something going on with Ms. Ahn.

241
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,945
I saw you two at the training institute,

242
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,948
and I asked you
to set her up with me, but you said no.

243
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:14,203
Anyway, you now have
a solid insurance plan in place.

244
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,871
If you marry Ms. Park,

245
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,582
you won't have to worry
about money even if you quit.

246
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,887
Is there something wrong?

247
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,309
Why?

248
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,270
Just because.

249
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,108
You look a little down.

250
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,783
I'm very happy these days.

251
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,370
Things are going great with Sang-su.

252
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:06,422
Maybe that's why
I want to know more about him.

253
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,636
What was he like?

254
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:18,183
You two worked together for a long time.

255
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,895
I thought you'd know more about him.

256
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,069
Was he really single all those years?

257
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,659
Did he at least like someone?

258
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,455
Or maybe flirt a bit?

259
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,838
Things like that
sometimes happen at the bank, right?

260
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,304
No?

261
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,146
I really don't know.

262
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,070
Right.

263
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,907
Who cares about all that?

264
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,912
I'm the one he's with now…

265
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:26,460
and I'm the one he likes.

266
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,089
Right?

267
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,560
Let's have another glass of wine.

268
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,524
Choose one while I go to the ladies' room.

269
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,441
Okay.

270
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,673
MY PERSON

271
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,830
<i>Was he really single all those years?</i>

272
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:51,211
<i>Did he at least like someone?</i>
<i>Or maybe flirt a bit?</i>

273
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,260
Things like that
sometimes happen at the bank, right?

274
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,399
Su-yeong, are you asleep?

275
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:17,279
No.

276
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,248
May I come in?

277
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,504
Sure.

278
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,230
I'm sorry.

279
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,025
For what?

280
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:02,699
For being such a useless person.

281
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,373
But still…

282
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,877
I like you a lot, Su-yeong.

283
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,384
I know.

284
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,103
That's why I'm staying here.

285
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,114
I know.

286
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:28,697
Hello.

287
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,075
You're here early.

288
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,870
I had to open today.

289
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,251
I just made some coffee.

290
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,878
Would you like a cup?

291
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,672
No, thank you.

292
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,092
Okay.

293
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,886
LOCKER ROOM

294
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:56,141
I'd like a cup once I get changed, though.

295
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:58,852
Sure.

296
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,156
POSITION TRANSFER APPLICATION

297
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,796
Are you applying for a position transfer?

298
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,425
Not this time.

299
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,767
I heard there will be openings at HQ
next quarter. Are you going to apply?

300
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,687
I'm not sure. I'll have to see.

301
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,484
One second.

302
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,334
Take this.

303
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,502
<i>FOREIGN EXCHANGE</i>

304
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,421
You have to prepare
for the in-house test as well.

305
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,132
If you start reading that now, it'll help.

306
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,470
But you need this too, Mr. Ha. I'm fine.

307
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,763
It's okay.

308
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,516
Remember when you gave me your notes?

309
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,309
I'm just paying you back.

310
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,855
Thank you. I appreciate it.

311
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,566
Sure.

312
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,110
And please feel free to ask questions.

313
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,197
You've become a good clerk.

314
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,076
You trained me well, Ms. Ahn.

315
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,210
Hey, you're here.

316
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:49,754
Good morning.

317
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,631
Are you feeling okay?

318
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,383
Totally.

319
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,385
I'm sorry I stood you up yesterday.

320
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,304
Did you have fun alone?

321
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,598
I went and played some hockey.

322
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:03,018
I knew that my boyfriend
would be fine on his own.

323
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,855
Come on. Stop that.

324
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,442
Why don't we get a cup of coffee?

325
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,444
Do you want some too?

326
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,696
-Yes.
-Okay.

327
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,252
Why did you leave early after the wedding?

328
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,421
I wanted to go to the afterparty with you.

329
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,507
Something came up.

330
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,386
Like a date with Mr. Jeong?

331
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,849
I saw you two leaving together.

332
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,562
Don't worry. It was just me.

333
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,398
So you can take a breather.

334
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,442
What if Mr. Lee and Mr. Ma saw you two?

335
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:56,905
They would've gone on and on
with their non-stop blabbering.

336
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:01,993
But you know,
you should still be a bit careful.

337
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:04,996
Sorry?

338
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:11,836
I didn't realize it before,
but now that I know, it's so obvious.

339
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,507
He was concerned for you all morning long.

340
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:24,474
Gosh, I miss the good old days of dating
when your relationship runs hot and cold.

341
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,812
As you get older,
you don't really feel much anymore.

342
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:34,734
I guess that's why we fall in love
and date passionately while we're young.

343
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,530
Breaking up is inevitable,

344
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,700
but couples lie to each other
as if they'll last forever.

345
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:46,705
But you know,

346
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,541
now that I think about it,

347
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,961
those were my shining moments.

348
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,964
Like what you're experiencing now.

349
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,425
Hey.

350
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:04,472
No matter what happens,
just make sure that you're happy.

351
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,563
Thank you, Ms. Seo.

352
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,697
The interest rate
at your other bank is rather high.

353
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,909
I can't even pay the interest
because sales have gone down so much.

354
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,162
Is there anything you can do?

355
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,541
I think I can help you find a new loan
with a lower interest rate.

356
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:37,338
And our bank has a program
for small business owners

357
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,633
where we provide
financial consultation and support.

358
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,385
Would you like to apply for it?

359
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:47,932
If you're selected, you can operate
your funds in a more systematic way.

360
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,852
-Thank you.
-Thank you for coming.

361
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:56,232
Number 312. I can help you here.

362
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:00,820
How may…

363
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,615
Ha Sang-su.

364
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:06,785
Hey!

365
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:10,872
You're a huge success.

366
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,875
So should I call you CEO Park now?

367
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,629
Come on. I'm here for a loan.
I just look shiny on the outside.

368
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:22,217
I thought you'd never return to Korea
when you left school for Australia.

369
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:25,678
Going through all the hardships there
made me miss Korea.

370
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,266
Let me know if I can repay you in any way.

371
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,769
I know how important
performance is to a clerk.

372
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,854
And you kept me
on the straight and narrow.

373
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,190
Come on, that's ancient history.

374
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,651
It really was a long time ago, right?

375
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,904
Is everyone doing well?

376
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,032
Remember Gyeong-pil and Mi-gyeong?

377
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,200
-From our major?
-Yes.

378
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,993
They both work at our branch.

379
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,162
Gyeong-pil and Mi-gyeong?

380
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,540
Hey, you remember them.

381
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:56,751
They'll be thrilled to see you.
Should I call them?

382
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,796
So those two are
working in the same office?

383
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,464
Yes.

384
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,299
My gosh.

385
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,427
Didn't you know?

386
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,267
<i>They dated.</i>

387
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,894
<i>Wait, were you in the army?</i>

388
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,105
Gyeong-pil was Mi-gyeong's first love.

389
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,898
They broke up

390
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:22,235
because Gyeong-pil went
and slept around with all of her friends.

391
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,364
<i>Mi-gyeong made a huge scene,</i>
<i>crying and everything.</i>

392
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,786
If you liked the food there,

393
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,580
we can go to that place near…

394
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,883
<i>You say you like me so much now,</i>

395
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:48,177
but you couldn't
care less about me back in college.

396
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:53,766
So whom did you
give your heart to instead?

397
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,857
What's on your mind?

398
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,944
What's with the look?

399
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,489
It's nothing.

400
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,367
What are you doing today?

401
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,453
Today? Why?

402
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,915
My friends want to see you.

403
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,375
If it's okay with you,
I'd like you to meet them.

404
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,543
What do you think?

405
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,758
Are you meeting Gyeong-pil again?

406
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:31,512
Don't hang out with him so much.
His nosiness might rub off on you.

407
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,353
I don't have any plans.
Let's do that tonight.

408
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,272
-Really?
-Yes.

409
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:44,275
You're sweet, so you get a gift.
Go open your cabinet.

410
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,861
Go on ahead.

411
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,029
Okay.

412
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,676
No way. Did you get this?

413
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,594
Sorry?

414
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,849
It's this season's new suit.
It looks even better in person.

415
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,685
Wait.

416
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:21,938
My gosh.

417
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,692
Look at you, Sang-su.

418
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:29,070
Going out and buying
a five million won suit for yourself.

419
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,406
You can take this back now.

420
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,838
Here you go.

421
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,256
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

422
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,823
Hi, Jong-hyeon.

423
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,162
I'm sleeping over
at my friend's place tonight.

424
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,751
I hope you get some good rest too.

425
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,950
-Sang-su, you're here.
-Hey.

426
00:42:58,618 --> 00:42:59,744
Come in.

427
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,550
-So?
-He's here.

428
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:15,927
-Hey.
-He's here?

429
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,389
This is my boyfriend. Isn't he handsome?

430
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:21,641
Nice to meet you.

431
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,102
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

432
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,438
They're like this, Sang-su.
We've been friends since kindergarten.

433
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:14,068
We go way back, but you're
the first boyfriend she has brought here.

434
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,903
Is that so?

435
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,489
You seem a little quiet, though.

436
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,366
Are we boring you?

437
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,078
-Not at all.
-Hey.

438
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,539
Then ask him some fun questions.

439
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:32,837
You know, like how we met,
or what he likes so much about me.

440
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,966
-Come on.
-I'm not curious.

441
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,468
-I don't want to know.
-Is that good?

442
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,304
-Let's just drink.
-Okay.

443
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,434
Room service charges add up
to 1.28 million won.

444
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,269
How would you like to pay?

445
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,274
-I'll pay in full.
-Okay.

446
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:59,322
Actually, can I pay in three installments?

447
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,573
Sure, of course.

448
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,747
I had a lot of fun today.

449
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,166
I was planning on buying, but thanks.

450
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:11,876
Don't mention it.

451
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,962
My friends say you're cool.
You totally pass.

452
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,340
I should thank them.

453
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,843
Your car is here.

454
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,306
It's a surprise present.

455
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,268
We'll get going, then.

456
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,312
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

457
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,897
-Get in, Sang-su.
-Bye.

458
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,315
-Bye.
-See you.

459
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,483
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

460
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,376
What's with the car?

461
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,838
Why? Don't you like it?

462
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,382
Mi-gyeong.

463
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,300
I told you.

464
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:04,261
-It's a surprise present.
-How is this a present?

465
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,514
Both this car…

466
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,475
and this suit are too much.

467
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,354
It isn't compared to how I feel about you.

468
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,733
You're good to me too.

469
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,654
Why is that okay, but not these gifts?

470
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,907
Because they're expensive?

471
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:30,162
Sang-su. To me, money is about luck.

472
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:31,872
I have it because I'm lucky.

473
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,334
It has nothing to do with my effort.

474
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:39,296
Your car is old, and I can buy you this.

475
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,717
Can you please just accept it?

476
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,392
Why won't you…

477
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,604
consider the thought that went into this?

478
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,404
I'll take my car home. You should go.

479
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,432
<i>It wasn't that you couldn't come.</i>

480
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:11,013
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

481
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,023
You must be here with Ms. Park.

482
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,320
Are you here with Mr. Jeong?

483
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:31,992
Yes.

484
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,172
I'll see you later, then.

485
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,342
Okay.

486
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,251
<i>Seasons passed.</i>

487
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,848
Once I get married…

488
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,518
I want to live here.

489
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,694
<i>For some, it was an anxious time.</i>

490
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,200
I thought you could use it for the test.

491
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,370
Thank you.

492
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,790
You got this.

493
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,553
<i>Some felt desperate.</i>

494
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:35,074
<i>While others had to remain calm.</i>

495
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,825
Did your interview go well?

496
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,621
No, what about you?

497
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,873
Me neither.

498
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,712
Shall we?

499
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,216
<i>Time passed…</i>

500
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:56,303
<i>for everyone, but in their own way.</i>

501
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,013
TEST ID SLIP
JEONG JONG-HYEON

502
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,024
SU-YEONG

503
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,911
<i>And…</i>

504
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:37,636
<i>something…</i>

505
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:40,681
<i>began to change.</i>

506
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,870
Jong-hyeon, what happened?

507
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,499
I couldn't reach you for days.
I was so worried.

508
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,341
What's wrong? What is it?

509
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:23,974
I just wanted to clear my head.
I went to see my friend in Gangneung.

510
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,273
You could've at least called.

511
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:35,736
I'm sorry. I couldn't charge my phone.

512
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,197
I need to take a shower.

513
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:48,415
What did you get?

514
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,917
Just this and that.

515
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,003
Your cardigan, my pajamas,
and you ran out of body wash,

516
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,171
so I got that too.

517
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,840
Are you moving in?

518
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:01,720
Should I?
It'll be practice for the real thing.

519
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,226
Have you eaten?

520
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:09,978
Not yet.

521
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:13,649
I starved all day so that
I could have some of your cooking.

522
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:15,943
So how about some food?

523
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:20,364
What should we eat?

524
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:41,009
INTERNET CAFÉ
48 HOURS, 30,000 WON

525
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,852
This kimchi is delicious.
Did you buy this too?

526
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,729
No, my mom made it.
She makes kimchi herself.

527
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,613
When are you going
to introduce me to your mother?

528
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,913
It's about time we did that, right?

529
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,683
We need to talk.

530
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,951
What happened to your face?

531
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:50,704
Something happened.

532
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,790
-Let me take a look.
-I'm fine.

533
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,266
You didn't go to your friend's house.

534
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,143
I did.

535
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,104
I did go,

536
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,774
but we got into a fight.

537
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:23,654
Then why didn't you come home?

538
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,784
I didn't want to.

539
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,876
I failed the test.

540
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,383
I didn't know how to tell you.

541
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,890
It's okay.

542
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:55,894
You can try again.

543
00:55:57,145 --> 00:56:00,315
I heard even people
who prepared for years fail too.

544
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:04,194
It was just a few points last time,

545
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,822
-but this time--
-I did worse this time.

546
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,866
And I might do worse next time.

547
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,662
No, it'll all work out.

548
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,330
-Everything will be--
-Stop that.

549
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:22,421
Will you stop saying that?
What do you mean everything will be fine?

550
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,136
Do you know why I fought with my friend?

551
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:38,186
Come on. What's so hard about life?
Who cares if you failed some test?

552
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:44,651
Your pretty girlfriend feeds you,
gives you shelter,

553
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:47,613
and you know,

554
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,240
everything else you want.

555
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,701
You bastard.

556
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,582
But what he said wasn't wrong.

557
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,668
I have nowhere else to go.

558
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:05,589
I should have…

559
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,968
I never should've
come here in the first place.

560
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:43,126
2022 POSITION TRANSFER FINAL RESULT CHECK

561
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:45,462
AHN SU-YEONG
YOU DID NOT PASS THE TEST

562
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:05,482
2022 POSITION TRANSFER FINAL RESULTS

563
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,859
NEXT: HQ PERSONNEL APPOINTMENT

564
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:11,863
PERSONS ON THE LIST ARE APPOINTED
AS OF OCTOBER 31ST, 2022

565
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:13,156
KCU BANK HQ APPOINTMENTS

566
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:20,163
PARK SEONG-SIK, YANG JUN-HO,
GU HUI-JEONG, KANG IL-JU

567
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:22,874
AN GUK-JEONG, KIM MIN-JUN, PARK JEONG-SUK

568
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,425
<i>Mr. Yuk must've pulled some strings.</i>

569
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,389
You got level one on the in-house test

570
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,725
and got extra points
for winning the contest.

571
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:41,560
Your performance is great as well.

572
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,937
That's the only reason
you didn't make the cut.

573
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:49,234
There could be another reason.
The competition for HQ is really high.

574
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,694
Good grief.

575
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:54,322
So why did you meddle in the first place?

576
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:55,574
Jeez. Here.

577
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:03,415
Didn't you quit smoking?

578
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,545
It's harder to quit these days.

579
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:15,802
-This is really good. Try some.
-Gosh.

580
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:17,888
-Look.
-My gosh.

581
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:18,930
-Try this.
-Hello.

582
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:20,057
Let's see.

583
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,975
Mr. Jeong, you're here early.

584
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,812
What happened to your face?

585
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,857
I'm just a little tired.

586
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,192
Come and have some.

587
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,152
Come and sit here.

588
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,321
Anyway, as I was saying,

589
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,741
I looked into this.
Remember Ahn Su-yeong's revolt?

590
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:42,370
Mr. Yuk was reprimanded back then,
thanks to Mr. Ha.

591
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:45,165
I thought it was because of my interview.

592
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,877
So Mr. Ha didn't make it
to HQ for helping Ms. Ahn?

593
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,381
He's such a great guy, right?

594
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:57,219
Good for you
for having such a great boyfriend.

595
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,639
Anyway, did you know about this?

596
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:04,810
Of course. I told him he did a great job.

597
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:09,147
He has a strong sense
of justice, you know?

598
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:12,025
-You're here.
-Hey.

599
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,568
-Hi, Su-yeong.
-Hey.

600
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:17,239
-Come and eat some.
-Okay.

601
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,825
Please excuse me. Thank you for the food.

602
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:24,538
-Try a bite.
-Have some.

603
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,456
Try it before it turns cold.

604
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,042
-Is this made with milk?
-What do you think?

605
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,002
-I think so.
-Yes.

606
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,546
I understand.

607
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:39,928
Ms. Ahn.

608
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:40,971
A moment, please.

609
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,222
Mr. Ha.

610
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,104
Remember Mr. Kim Seong-hun?

611
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:50,897
Yes.

612
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,276
He passed away last night.

613
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:00,657
Can you two go there
and pay your respects on our behalf?

614
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:03,243
Not only was he a long-time VIP client,

615
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,496
he was also kind enough
to ignore the withdrawal incident.

616
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,415
So we should pay our respects to him.

617
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,168
Please leave once you're ready.

618
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:12,878
-Yes.
-Yes, sir.

619
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:33,857
Going out for work?

620
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,526
Can't you tell?

621
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,111
Are you going to the reunion?

622
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:43,366
I mean, Sang-su can't go,
so if you're free, let's go together.

623
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,996
Do you think I've forgotten
what you've done?

624
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:51,041
I mean…

625
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:55,045
You were acting pretty cool with me,
so I thought we were good.

626
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,881
Our end was too vulgar to forget.

627
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:05,555
By the way…

628
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,100
Did you know?

629
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,852
Know what?

630
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:16,274
That Sang-su stepped up to help Su-yeong.

631
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,403
Yes, well…

632
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,865
I'm sure he didn't mean anything by it.

633
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,533
Mr. Yuk was crazy back then.

634
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,043
Are you all right?

635
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,965
Why wouldn't I be?

636
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,885
Sang-su is kind, unlike someone I know.

637
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,560
What makes Sang-su…

638
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,774
so different?

639
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:00,819
People are all the same.

640
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,489
If you trust him that much,
why are you so anxious?

641
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:07,784
Who's anxious? Me?

642
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:10,161
Sang-su went that far to help Su-yeong,

643
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:12,831
and now they're going
to a funeral outside the city.

644
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,874
That's why you're anxious.

645
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:17,877
You're wrong.

646
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:24,175
I'm sorry to say this about Su-yeong,
but anyone would've felt sorry for her.

647
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,888
And Sang-su can't turn a blind eye
to people who need help.

648
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,311
Why are you laughing?

649
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:39,858
Do you know the most dangerous thing
when it comes to men and women?

650
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:43,820
Romance?

651
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:48,950
Romance can't win over morals or ethics.

652
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,078
No, the most dangerous thing

653
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,541
is feeling pity and sympathy.

654
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:02,047
Those emotions
make it impossible to look away.

655
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:10,305
I hope
your love for Sang-su will continue.

656
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:13,975
This time, at least.

657
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:28,490
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

658
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:00,105
You haven't had anything to eat, right?

659
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,272
Come on. Let's eat.

660
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,984
The living must keep going.

661
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,452
Isn't that a strange thing to say?

662
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:22,252
"The living must keep going."

663
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,963
That's not comforting.

664
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:33,179
<i>My father passed away</i>
<i>when I was about his age.</i>

665
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:38,143
<i>Back then, I couldn't even cry.</i>

666
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:43,898
It must've been difficult.

667
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,945
You were too young to know
what death was, let alone face it.

668
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:56,119
"The living must keep going."

669
01:05:56,995 --> 01:06:00,248
Back then, that expression scared me.

670
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:07,005
"Things may be sad and hard,
but don't let that take control of you."

671
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:11,050
"You need
to cope with it and get over it."

672
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:14,137
That's what it sounded like to me.

673
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:19,767
Some people told me

674
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:22,645
that I had to be twice as happy
for my brother's sake.

675
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:30,195
I remember you saying
that your brother was 27.

676
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,532
If he were still alive, yes.

677
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:42,832
There was an accident.

678
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:51,716
We laughed and ate breakfast that morning,

679
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,928
but he died that day.

680
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:03,478
He was a kid with many dreams.

681
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:10,527
<i>He was bright and always smiled.</i>

682
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,989
After he died…

683
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:20,370
I even thought about
living miserably on purpose.

684
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:25,124
But that made me feel even worse for him.

685
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:34,217
That's when I decided
that I should try and be happy instead.

686
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,221
And that's what I'm doing right now.

687
01:07:58,283 --> 01:07:59,450
JEONG JONG-HYEON

688
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:02,787
<i>I suddenly had to go to a funeral,</i>
<i>so I think I'll be late.</i>

689
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,042
What are you up to?

690
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,211
Nothing much.

691
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,763
It looks like you're on a picnic.

692
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,192
You regret it, don't you?

693
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:42,118
You didn't make it to HQ
because you helped me.

694
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:47,582
Of course, I regret it.

695
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:52,879
But if I didn't do anything back then,

696
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:55,965
I would've regretted that more.

697
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:02,347
You didn't make it either, right?

698
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:06,184
Right.

699
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,772
Here's a tangerine to cheer you up.

700
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:18,404
I'm going to try again, though.

701
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:26,037
And if I fail again,
then I'll apply again later.

702
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:30,917
You're pretty brave.

703
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:35,046
I won't let
something like this bring me down.

704
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,925
This is how I fight.

705
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:50,395
<i>In a moment,</i>
<i>this train will stop at Jeongdongjin,</i>

706
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:52,855
<i>Jeongdongjin Station.</i>

707
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:57,110
<i>Please watch your step</i>
<i>as you get off onto the platform.</i>

708
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:00,154
This is nice.

709
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:05,952
It's so nice.

710
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:13,793
Su-yeong.

711
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:17,880
Should we get off here?

712
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,769
Mr. Ha, you should try this too.

713
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:33,020
It feels cool.

714
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:37,358
The water seems freezing, though.

715
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:40,194
But it feels warm
when you're in the water.

716
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:42,363
I'm serious.

717
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:48,661
I guess you don't believe me.

718
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:54,667
Okay.

719
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:07,221
See what you get for being too careful?
You got wet anyway.

720
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:10,600
Did you just lie to me? It's freezing.

721
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:12,810
Yes, I lied to you.

722
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:36,417
Are they still wet?

723
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:41,297
Yes. Thanks to a certain someone.

724
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:45,635
Thank you.

725
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,813
Why? Do you hate steamed silkworms?

726
01:11:58,439 --> 01:11:59,315
No.

727
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,777
You don't seem to like it. Can you eat it?

728
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,404
Yes, of course. I like it. I eat it often.

729
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:10,785
Dig in, then.

730
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:21,587
That's it?

731
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,892
I thought you said
you liked it and ate it often.

732
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:46,529
Do you like it?

733
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:49,740
Yes.

734
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,576
Really?

735
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:54,912
No.

736
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:09,385
It's my first time
seeing you smile like that.

737
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:19,478
We couldn't go to the beach
even when we were on Jeju Island,

738
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,772
but here we are now.

739
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:30,948
Did you want to go to the beach back then?

740
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,039
Why didn't you tell me?

741
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:42,835
I should have.

742
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:45,963
I should've made myself clear.

743
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:02,146
I think it's too late.

744
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:05,441
We should get going.

745
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,300
Thank you for today.

746
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:34,804
For what?

747
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,558
Just everything.

748
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:46,774
I had a good laugh
for the first time in ages, thanks to you.

749
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:04,625
Are you happy?

750
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,216
Sorry?

751
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:20,349
Earlier today,
you said that you're trying your best.

752
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,399
So are you happy?

753
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:07,063
There's our train.

754
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:14,862
Should I break up?

755
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:36,967
Should I break up with Jong-hyeon?

756
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:14,797
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

757
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:37,111
Are you really quitting?
Are you leaving the bank?

758
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:42,032
I'm going to move out, Su-yeong.
So can we start over?

759
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:44,910
<i>She was fine when I left Tongyeong.</i>
<i>So what happened?</i>

760
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:47,788
Mom!

761
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:50,916
Are you going to see him now?
Are you going to confess?

762
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,921
Do you also have something like this?
Something you haven't told me about.

763
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:58,090
<i>I skate pretty well, right?</i>

764
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:01,594
I don't think I can do this anymore.

765
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:09,602
