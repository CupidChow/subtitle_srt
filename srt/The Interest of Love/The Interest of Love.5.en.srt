00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,429
PARCEL

3
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,066
POST OFFICE

4
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,070
Did you send us money again?

5
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,907
Goodness. Why did you send so much?

6
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,826
<i>You need money to eat too.</i>

7
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,954
Dad, you've heard of KCU Bank, right?

8
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,040
Yes, I got a job there.

9
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,712
<i>I'm also moving out of the tiny studio</i>
<i>and into a really nice place.</i>

10
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,799
It's better than the studio
because it's got everything.

11
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,384
Of course.

12
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,304
It comes with a gas stove
and a refrigerator.

13
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,471
It's fully furnished.

14
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,933
Dad, on top of that,

15
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,353
the view is amazing here.

16
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,397
You really need to see this too.

17
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,026
Come on. I'm doing fine.
There's no need to worry.

18

EPISODE 5

19
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,574
JEONG JONG-HYEON

20
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,708
You're the new guy, right?

21
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,251
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

22
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,378
-I'm Jeong Jong-hyeon.
-I'm Ma Du-sik.

23
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,298
Are you an aspiring actor?

24
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,760
No, I'm studying
to become a police officer.

25
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,637
An aspiring civil servant then.

26
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,806
-Hello.
-Hello.

27
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,726
Mr. Ma.

28
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,396
I have bad heartburn.
Get me some medicine.

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,689
Yes, sir.

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,070
Mr. Jeong, why don't you go instead?

31
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,616
-Sure, I'll--
-Don't go.

32
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,122
There's a hangover cure
on the second shelf in the locker room.

33
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,333
-Oh, that?
-Yes.

34
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,335
Is that what's on the shelf?

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,299
You must be the new security guard.

36
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,468
Nice to meet you.

37
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,095
My name is Ahn Su-yeong.

38
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,013
I'm Jeong Jong-hyeon.

39
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,606
SOJU

40
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,413
Do you live around here?

41
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,164
Hello.

42
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,917
I live nearby too. Up there.

43
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,089
Goodbye, then.

44
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,217
About that client who made a scene today…

45
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,096
The crosswalk light will change to red
whenever they try to cross the road.

46
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,348
Sorry?

47
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:47,102
It's frustrating to see
the light change from green to red

48
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,479
right before you're about to cross.

49
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,357
And they'll always miss the bus by a hair.

50
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,280
And spill red <i>tteokbokki</i> sauce
on their white outfit.

51
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,364
And another thing.

52
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,409
The exchange rate will drop
as soon as they exchange money.

53
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,412
Right, people get
really frustrated when that happens

54
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,706
even though
it doesn't make a big difference.

55

THE INTEREST OF LOVE

56
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,802
JEONG JONG-HYEON

57
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:10,352
Let me… ask you a question too.

58
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,272
If I…

59
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,651
If I had kept my promise…

60
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,696
that day at the hotel…

61
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,534
would you have dated me?

62
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,007
Actually…

63
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,427
I…

64
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:46,972
Hey, Sang-su!

65
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,767
Let's have a smoke.

66
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,464
Are you close to Ms. Ahn?

67
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,010
Can you set him up with her?

68
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:26,928
He wants to start dating.

69
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,392
It's just that I'd like to have one last
exciting romance before I get married.

70
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,936
I'm a pretty decent catch, no?

71
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,691
What is it? Is she seeing someone?

72
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,036
Really? Is she seeing someone?

73
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,063
Hello?

74
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,107
Hi, Jong-hyeon.

75
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,280
No, it's okay.

76
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,283
I had dinner.

77
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,141
<i>What is it? Is she seeing someone?</i>

78
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,727
JEONG JONG-HYEON

79
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,175
I've lost my mind. What am I doing?

80
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,106
KCU BANK

81
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,326
Why did you just go back in yesterday?

82
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,164
I saw you on the phone.

83
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,877
-So--
-About yesterday.

84
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,464
I'm sorry if I made you
feel uncomfortable.

85
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,218
I didn't feel uncomfortable.

86
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,314
Do you want to meet tonight for a bit?

87
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,402
Let's talk after we're done for the day.

88
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,364
Okay.

89
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,102
SANG-SU

90
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,395
<i>Sang-su, call me</i>
<i>when you see this message.</i>

91
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,453
Is that your lunch?

92
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,457
I think it's expired.

93
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,047
It expired yesterday,
so it should be fine.

94
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,675
You were like that in college too.

95
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,260
You're still the same.

96
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,265
Why do you keep speaking so formally?

97
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,184
I did?

98
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,854
Do I make you uncomfortable?

99
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,817
Talk comfortably.
I don't want things to be awkward.

100
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,904
Hey.

101
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,532
Sang-su, I didn't know you were here.

102
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,449
Hey. Yes.

103
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,744
You didn't answer my calls
when you were there.

104
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,831
Sorry, I ended up
grabbing a drink afterward.

105
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,624
It must've been fun.

106
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,837
Those sessions are all the same.
Why? Did something happen?

107
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,048
Hyeon-a and Hyeong-su
from college are getting married.

108
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,383
You heard, right?

109
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,594
-Yes.
-Let's go there together.

110
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,014
Hi, Su-yeong.

111
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,267
Hello.

112
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,981
-Let's go to the wedding.
-Okay.

113
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,863
Su-yeong.

114
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,825
Sang-su seems weird, right?

115
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,163
I'm not sure.

116
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,956
It's because of me.

117
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,791
I told him that I liked him.

118
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,588
He probably feels awkward.
He's so bad at lying.

119
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,636
So are you two dating now?

120
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,472
Not yet.

121
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,099
Knowing him,
he's going to think about it a lot.

122
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,852
It's really difficult to date at work.

123
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,481
But I think I might have a chance.

124
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,741
Sang-su, drink this.

125
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,117
Right. Thank you.

126
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,662
Can you show me the files
that we talked about?

127
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,122
-Here they are.
-I see.

128
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,250
-All the information is here…
-I see.

129
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:37,715
The total is 123,780 won.

130
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,175
What? That can't be right.

131
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:45,181
When I counted it at home,
it was 125,780 won.

132
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,059
Would you like me to count it again then?

133
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,937
No, just give it to me.

134
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,566
My wife is alone at home.
Her dementia has gotten worse.

135
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,236
I feel really anxious when she's alone.

136
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,364
I see. Then please take this.

137
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,914
People who need help can use this device
to make emergency calls.

138
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,666
There's a GPS tracker inside, so…

139
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,129
You can find out where your wife is,

140
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,799
and if she calls for help,
you'll be notified immediately.

141
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,927
-I've never heard of this.
-We provide it for free.

142
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,431
I could help connect it
to your phone if you'd like.

143
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,856
The balance is correct.

144
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,733
Okay, let's call it a day.

145
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,110
-Good work.
-Great day.

146
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,070
-Great work today.
-Great day.

147
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,573
Ms. Ahn.

148
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,368
Come with me to meet Punggyeong Products.

149
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,496
Right now, sir?

150
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,915
You couldn't come
while you worked the PB shift.

151
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,334
You're back at your post,
so you should come.

152
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,712
Okay, sir.

153
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,672
Then get changed and come downstairs.

154
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,051
-Goodnight, sir.
-Keep up the good work.

155
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,061
<i>We'll have to meet next time.</i>

156
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,230
<i>It's okay.</i>

157
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,865
Here, let me take that.

158
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,076
-Thank you.
-Good job today.

159
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,253
Look at that.
Why does he always take Ms. Ahn with him?

160
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,797
Is there something going on?

161
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,424
Of course not.
What could possibly go on with them?

162
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,010
Did she look happy to go with him?

163
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,762
She could've just said no, then.

164
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,849
That's our Ms. Bae.
You can tell that she grew up sheltered.

165
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,436
You don't know how
command and discipline work, do you?

166
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,480
-I'm heading out.
-Goodbye.

167
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,649
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

168
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,318
Well, what Ms. Bae said isn't wrong.

169
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,946
Ms. Ahn probably gets something
in return for going.

170
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,033
If you're not going to help her,
then at least stop badmouthing her.

171
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,369
It only hurts the victim.

172
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,122
You're acting as if
you're Ms. Ahn's mother.

173
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,416
-You're so protective of her.
-I'm leaving.

174
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,459
Hey, wait up. Let's leave together.

175
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,336
I thought you had plans.

176
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,631
They got canceled. I'll join you.

177
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,049
-Okay.
-Let's go.

178
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,176
Here you go.

179
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,640
We'll continue to support you
in every way we can.

180
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,518
I can't do business alone
in this day and age.

181
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,354
I've come this far
because I have a trustworthy partner.

182
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,439
I see.

183
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,358
I checked your account earlier,

184
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,361
and you have some funds
that will mature in a few weeks.

185
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,865
May I suggest a good product
before they mature?

186
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,784
We recently put together
a product for VIPs…

187
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,040
I thought this was a casual dinner.

188
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,628
Gosh, of course.

189
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:07,592
It's just that Ms. Ahn
is very dedicated to her job.

190
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,110
Goodness. Allow me to pour you a drink.

191
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,572
Bank clerks are too business-oriented.

192
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,575
They only talk about what they want
in any given situation.

193
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,245
Business dealings stem
from personal relationships, you know.

194
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,915
I'm not like that, sir.

195
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,960
I can see disapproval
written all over her face.

196
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:50,468
She has a long way to go,
and she has a lot to learn.

197
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:54,013
Young people these days
are different than us.

198
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,724
-What?
-What?

199
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,103
I'm getting married.
The parents are meeting this month.

200
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,022
Is it a shotgun wedding?

201
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,401
How can you get married? You just met her.

202
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,986
Marry first, date later.

203
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,114
Guys, my outlook on life has changed.

204
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,075
Think about it. Our ancestors

205
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,786
met their spouse
on their wedding day but lived well.

206
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,955
Getting married
to a suitable partner first

207
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,456
is a system proven by history.

208
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,624
It's not the Joseon era.

209
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,752
There was a higher birthrate
and lower divorce rate back then.

210
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,837
Are you sure about this?

211
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,256
You won't regret it?

212
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,632
Do you know what's funny?

213
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,219
I hesitated a lot
until the moment I made my decision.

214
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,265
But as soon as I decided,
it was really easy to move on.

215
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:40,142
Will I regret this decision?
I guess it's possible.

216
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,437
But I even have regrets about
not taking a dump before work, so…

217
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,732
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

218
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,485
In that case,

219
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,154
treat us to an expensive meal.

220
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,574
Okay, fine. What do you want?

221
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,495
-This one.
-This?

222
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,163
-Yes.
-Get this dish too.

223
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,090
I'll get going too.

224
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,760
You know you were
being bold back there, right?

225
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,181
I thought that was my job--

226
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:23,894
When you're at a meeting like this,
your job is to entertain the other party,

227
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,022
not offend them.

228
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,775
Anyway, good work, Ms. Ahn.

229
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,947
Wait, Ms. Ahn.

230
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,083
-Take a cab.
-No, I can take a bus.

231
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,836
It'll make me feel better. Just take it.

232
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,590
-No, sir. It's okay.
-Just take the money.

233
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,634
I told you it'd make me feel better.

234
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,846
Just take it!

235
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,436
See you tomorrow.

236
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,098
<i>The meeting went great</i>
<i>thanks to you, Ms. Ahn!</i>

237
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,184
<i>It's good manners to accept</i>
<i>what your superiors give you.</i>

238
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,729
<i>Just take it. It'll make me feel better.</i>

239
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:02,993
<i>Are you done?</i>
<i>Do you want to meet tomorrow evening?</i>

240
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,217
-Good morning.
-Hi.

241
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,176
Hello.

242
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,690
-Have you had breakfast?
-I had a sandwich.

243
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,793
-Mr. Ha.
-Yes?

244
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:56,464
Here's the receipt from last night
for Mr. Yuk's operating expenses.

245
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,177
Did the meeting end late yesterday?

246
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,888
A little.

247
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,184
Okay, I'll process this.

248
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,909
<i>That's our branch manager.</i>
<i>Who was the woman next to him?</i>

249
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,496
<i>All I know is that it wasn't his wife.</i>

250
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,289
<i>She was younger and prettier.</i>

251
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,959
If it was yesterday, then…

252
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,636
Ms. Ahn.

253
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,764
I'm meeting Seonghun Construction today.

254
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,848
Come with me.

255
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,772
Mr. Yuk, let me accompany you today.

256
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,275
They're Ms. Ahn's clients,
so she should go.

257
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,736
You need to play golf
with a client this weekend.

258
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,782
Yes, sir.

259
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,451
Mr. Yuk.

260
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,081
If they need me to explain the product,

261
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:15,459
I'll visit their office
during business hours.

262
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,216
Are you saying that you won't go?

263
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:29,181
I feel uncomfortable having drinks
when no business is being conducted.

264
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,812
Are you refusing to do your job
simply because you feel uncomfortable?

265
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,565
Not just today, but from here on out?

266
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,363
I don't believe
it's my duty to entertain clients.

267
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,755
All right. I'll go alone, then.

268
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:09,221
In that case, Ms. Ahn, you should
clean out the filing room today.

269
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:13,058
Some of the documents have expired,
and it's a huge mess in there.

270
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,020
Pull them out and organize everything
before our next audit

271
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,314
and have them shredded by Monday.

272
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,277
I'll do it with her, then.

273
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,322
-It's too much to do alone.
-You don't have time for that.

274
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,907
Instead of paying attention
to menial work,

275
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:32,161
you should update
the list of the Winner's Plan clients.

276
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,832
I want everyone
to focus on their own jobs.

277
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,752
Ms. Ahn.

278
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,756
I hope you don't feel
uncomfortable about this.

279
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,468
I'll do it.

280
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,794
May I give you a hand?

281
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,588
Tell me what to do. I can help.

282
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,215
You should go study.

283
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,301
-But still…
-Mr. Yuk will get mad

284
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,261
if he finds out you were in here.

285
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,686
LOCKER ROOM

286
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:42,022
My gosh, Ms. Ahn
is having the worst day today.

287
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,191
Mr. Yuk used to adore her,
but not anymore.

288
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,359
He's one scary guy.

289
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,070
Cleaning out the filing room
is a two-person job.

290
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,532
It means she has to finish today
in order to shred files by Monday.

291
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,326
She'll have to work this weekend.

292
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,994
This is abuse.

293
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,206
She's pretty tenacious, though.
I'm sure she'll manage.

294
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,457
Whatever.

295
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,709
-Let's go.
-Okay.

296
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,842
What are you doing? Let's go.

297
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,803
You can go on ahead.

298
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,665
Are you okay?

299
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:45,461
Yes.

300
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,507
Let me help.

301
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,968
Didn't you hear Mr. Yuk?

302
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:57,222
He said not to pay attention
to menial work and focus on your job.

303
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,312
This is just repetitive work.

304
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,730
It's okay, really.

305
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,864
I sent you a text message yesterday.

306
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,371
I got tired and fell asleep.

307
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:28,754
Should I wait?

308
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,388
This is going to take a while.
You should go ahead and leave.

309
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,893
Thank you.

310
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,188
KCU BANK

311
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,605
<i>Eat dinner as you work. You got this!</i>

312
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:16,695
<i>Thank you.</i>

313
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,088
You should've brought
enough food for both of us.

314
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,342
I can't believe
you only got enough for yourself.

315
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:43,138
You said you were on a diet
and that you weren't going to eat.

316
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,183
This isn't a restaurant.
It's a massage shop.

317
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,436
Why are you eating here?
And what's with the long face?

318
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,146
I'm fine.

319
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:54,775
You're here often.

320
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,277
I was just bored and stopped by.

321
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,029
Why are you bored?

322
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,240
There are lots of
pretty ladies at the bank…

323
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,325
I mean, there should be.

324
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,578
What about you? Why won't you go on dates?

325
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,416
I dated plenty when I was younger,
so I don't feel the need.

326
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,921
And I had enough passionate relationships
before I met your father.

327
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:22,219
I don't know if this
is a proper mother-son conversation.

328
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,138
Actually, there was someone
I liked more than him,

329
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,850
but I still married your father.

330
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:33,563
So I figured you end up marrying
someone whom you're meant to be with.

331
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,565
And thanks to that, I had you.

332
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,780
I realized fiery,
passionate love wasn't everything.

333
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:47,369
If you just
go with the flow and follow your heart,

334
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,289
you'll end up with a kid with an old soul.

335
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,666
That's life.

336
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,629
Do you want some beer?

337
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,174
No, I have to play golf tomorrow.

338
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,472
Mom.

339
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:10,392
Put some ointment on your hands.
They're a mess.

340
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,104
My hands would've looked like flowers
if I lived a sheltered life,

341
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,942
but I had to live under the scorching sun
without a husband to provide shade for me.

342
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,861
Now look at my hands.

343
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,030
So where was I?

344
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,990
That's right.

345
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,994
So as soon as Seong-hye's husband
threw the spoon,

346
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:33,123
she ducked under the table,
and ended up with a herniated disc.

347
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,709
She's always been like that.

348
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,502
She puts up with everything,

349
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:41,590
so now her kitchen walls are covered
with an assortment of sauces.

350
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,303
I took a photo. Do you want to see it?

351
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,599
What's funny is that
it looks a bit like a Matisse.

352
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,017
-Mom.
-Yes?

353
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,187
Do you want to chat or eat?

354
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,988
You're just like your dad.

355
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,990
I wanted to get a reaction,

356
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,619
so I put two tablespoons
of salt in his stew.

357
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,246
But he just ate it without a word.

358
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,668
Even monks who made a vow of silence
would talk more than him.

359
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:22,047
If you have no one to talk to,
then you should meet your friends.

360
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,590
Weren't you listening to me?

361
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,968
They're all busy bickering
with their husbands.

362
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,553
I'm an outcast now.

363
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,143
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

364
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,770
Then come with me.

365
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,315
-What now?
-Hurry now. Come on.

366
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,110
You need to stop shopping.

367
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,529
The price tags are still on this.

368
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,197
Why do you keep buying stuff?

369
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,157
It's my way of protesting
against your dad.

370
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,493
I'm spending as much money as possible,

371
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,370
but I can't make a dent. It's annoying.

372
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,332
Mom, I don't want this. It's not my style.

373
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:01,002
Just paint on it then.
You love doing that.

374
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,295
Mom, please.

375
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,214
Wait, I got another one.

376
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,474
<i>I'm going out to play golf.</i>
<i>I'll see you at the wedding.</i>

377
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:18,019
<i>Where are you playing?</i>
<i>I'll pick you up. Let's go together.</i>

378
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,866
President Park, I heard you found
a great plot of land recently.

379
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,909
You'll get hurt if you stand there.

380
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,163
We will do our best for the growth

381
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:39,082
of both our businesses
through financial support.

382
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,919
Both our businesses?
It's a better business for the bank.

383
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:46,548
Isn't that why you invited me
out for a round of golf?

384
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,093
President Park, if you read the proposal--

385
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,637
We came to play golf,
so let's just focus on that.

386
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,682
Do you play a little?

387
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,686
-I'm--
-Allow me to introduce--

388
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,021
I was asking him.

389
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,692
I've been practicing a lot.

390
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,070
I'll play with him this time.

391
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,658
Mr. Ha is still a beginner.
He can't even beat me.

392
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,660
What do you think?

393
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,038
Do you run when you don't stand a chance?

394
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,832
I'll give you a handicap.

395
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,672
I won't accept the handicap.

396
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:28,840
Instead…

397
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:36,598
if I win, please consider this proposal.

398
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:40,477
Sure.

399
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,812
Thank you.

400
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,193
Nice shot.

401
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,114
Nice shot.

402
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,413
Nice.

403
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,082
Excellent.

404
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,673
-Nice.
-Good.

405
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,966
Nice one.

406
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,808
-I'll do it.
-It's okay.

407
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,351
-I got it.
-It's fine.

408
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,613
You should look
a little more to the right.

409
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,657
There's a bit of an incline.

410
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,592
-Nice birdie.
-Nice birdie.

411
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,475
-Congratulations, sir.
-Congratulations.

412
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,935
Are you really a beginner?

413
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,770
I was just lucky today.

414
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,522
I was the one who got lucky.

415
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,400
I would've lost
if it hadn't been for your advice.

416
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,528
No, sir. It was an honor
to have played with you.

417
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,238
I learned a lot.

418
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,158
All right.

419
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,871
-Good work.
-Thank you, sir.

420
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,003
Thank you very much for your time today.

421
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,589
I want a rematch.

422
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:35,967
And bring your proposal then.

423
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,970
Thank you, President Park.

424
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,680
You've done well today, Mr. Ha.

425
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:41,765
-Good.
-Thank you.

426
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,562
Ms. Park, what brings you here?

427
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:48,980
Hello.

428
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,566
I'm here to pick up Mr. Ha
for an engagement.

429
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,151
May I leave with him?

430
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,612
Ms. Park.

431
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,198
-Say hello. This is Daeseong--
-Hello.

432
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,618
We should get going now.

433
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,371
Sure. See you at the bank, Ms. Park.

434
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,876
See you next time, Mr. Ha Sang-su.

435
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,044
-Yes, sir.
-Goodbye.

436
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,128
Goodbye, sir.

437
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,883
Why did you do that just now?

438
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,053
He's an important client for our branch.

439
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,349
I don't even say hi to him at home.

440
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,267
Why should I do it out here?

441
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,478
What?

442
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,106
That client was my dad.

443
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,443
I'm hungry.
Let's eat as soon as we get there.

444
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,425
MOM

445
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,182
-Hello.
-You're here.

446
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,976
-Sang-su, you're here.
-Hey.

447
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:08,977
It's been a while.

448
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,187
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

449
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,023
-Sang-su, I'll go upstairs first.
-Sure.

450
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,444
-Looking good.
-How have you been?

451
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,279
Good. You don't look too bad yourself.

452
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,322
I just look decent for a bank clerk.

453
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,699
You sure do look like one.

454
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,048
What is it?
Do you want to get married too?

455
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,134
What?

456
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,222
-Let's go in.
-Let's go.

457
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,140
All right.

458
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,815
Hello.

459
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,401
One has no money
after getting a doctorate,

460
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,528
and the other has never worked a day.

461
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,449
How will they make a living?
I'm so worried.

462
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,494
Why would you say that
on their wedding day?

463
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,163
I'm just worried, that's all.

464
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,624
Marriage should bring benefits,
but this is the opposite.

465
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:17,170
Who knows if it'll be good or bad?
Only they would know.

466
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,214
Everyone's standard
of happiness is relative.

467
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,383
But there's also an absolute standard.

468
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,011
If you're here to celebrate,
then stick to that.

469
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:28,097
Don't be so rude.
We don't talk about you behind your back.

470
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:32,644
We respect your picky standards
when it comes to men.

471
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,398
Sang-su.

472
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,609
-Hey.
-Hi, Sang-su.

473
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,530
Does it taste all right?

474
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,031
Yes, it's good.

475
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:46,991
Enjoy your meal.

476
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,706
Sang-su, is Mi-gyeong
also like this at the bank?

477
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,707
What do you mean?

478
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,251
I mean, she's arrogant.

479
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,379
Pretending like she never benefits
from her rich parents.

480
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,840
You're drunk. That's enough.

481
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,717
She got a full scholarship
throughout college.

482
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:09,055
I know you're proud
that you received a full scholarship,

483
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:12,267
but you pretty much stole it
from those who really needed it.

484
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,770
The person who lost the scholarship to you
had to work three jobs, you know.

485
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:20,400
Do you think you
still would've gotten the scholarship

486
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,110
if you had to work and study too?

487
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,613
You could focus on your studies

488
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,950
because you didn't have to work
thanks to your family's wealth.

489
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,037
The clothes you wear
and that bag you carry…

490
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,623
An ordinary bank clerk can't afford those.

491
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,751
You couldn't have done anything
without your father.

492
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:42,380
So stop pretending
like you're different from us.

493
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,215
You're being a pretentious hypocrite.

494
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,800
What's gotten into you?

495
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,636
Mi-gyeong, she's just drunk.

496
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,597
I need to go to the ladies' room.

497
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,647
It must be hard for you, Sang-su.

498
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,692
She stands on everyone's help,
thinking she achieved it all on her own.

499
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:07,614
Sang-hui.

500
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:14,078
I understand what you're saying,
but she's working hard and doing well.

501
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:19,834
I hope you'll apologize to her
when you get the chance.

502
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,348
You caught me, didn't you?

503
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,309
You caught me running away.

504
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,186
No.

505
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,440
Let's have our own reception.

506
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,401
Can you buy me a drink, Sang-su?

507
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,031
Sure. Let's go.

508
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,373
Back in school…

509
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,752
do you know what I loved to do the most?

510
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,256
Running.

511
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,262
Because the results are clear.

512
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:19,102
And no one could say that I won…

513
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,730
thanks to my parents.

514
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,401
I just…

515
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:31,155
wanted people to acknowledge my effort.

516
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,869
I wanted people to think
that I came this far

517
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,957
and became Park Mi-gyeong
of the Youngpo branch's PB Team

518
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:45,837
without the help of my parents.

519
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:52,802
I also work just as hard as everyone else.

520
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,935
But what's important

521
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,938
is that I'm afraid

522
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,277
you'll just think of this as a rant
coming from a spoiled rich kid.

523
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,414
I don't think of it that way.

524
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,209
Everyone has…

525
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,464
their share of pain and misfortune.

526
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,720
So I don't want to be quick to judge

527
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,640
or comfort you
without knowing the whole story.

528
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,395
I just can't do that.

529
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,950
What you just said…

530
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,539
comforts me the most.

531
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:32,985
<i>We'll close down the restaurant</i>
<i>and leave. I'm sorry, Su-yeong.</i>

532
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,456
TONGYEONG OYSTER GUKBAP

533
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,588
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

534
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,802
REAL ESTATE AGENCY

535
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:58,886
Excuse me.

536
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,891
Goodness, come on in.
Looking for a lease or a tenant?

537
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:08,771
About the new oyster <i>gukbap</i> place
in the marketplace…

538
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:15,528
<i>They insisted on opening their business</i>
<i>in that marketplace,</i>

539
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,656
<i>but now they want to cancel the lease.</i>

540
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,367
<i>They don't even mind</i>
<i>paying an early termination fee.</i>

541
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,327
<i>It's as if they're on the run.</i>

542
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,913
<i>They live up the hill.</i>

543
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,836
-Here.
-Okay.

544
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,129
-Thank you.
-No problem.

545
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,541
Sang-su.

546
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,460
Where have you been?

547
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,297
Here's a hangover cure.

548
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,051
I was knocked out, wasn't I?

549
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,427
It's okay, kiddo.

550
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:05,471
I'll get going now.

551
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,182
Thank you.

552
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,143
-Bye.
-Thanks.

553
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,242
Goodness gracious. Oh, dear.

554
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:30,079
These muscle cramps are killing me.

555
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,793
This is a bank, not a hospital.

556
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,712
-Stop with the fuss.
-What is this?

557
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,213
Did you buy this for me?

558
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:43,759
Are you crazy?
I just saw them lying around the office.

559
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:48,681
You should work out more.
All you did was jog, and you're half-dead.

560
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,226
I guess the only muscle
you have is the sphincter.

561
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,395
What do you mean? I have muscles.

562
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,857
They must be playing hide-and-seek
because I can't see them.

563
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,859
-Hello.
-Hello.

564
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,277
Hello.

565
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,529
Sang-su.

566
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,282
Are you feeling okay?

567
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,285
Yes, thanks to someone's hangover cure.

568
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,496
-Let's head to the meeting.
-Okay.

569
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,292
Is Su-yeong still in the filing room?

570
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,836
I hope she's okay.

571
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,466
-Hello.
-Hello.

572
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,342
-Hello.
-Hi.

573
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:27,636
-Hello.
-Hey, Ji-yun.

574
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:30,306
Mr. Yuk was spotted.

575
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:34,185
He was arm-in-arm with a woman
at a <i>naengmyeon</i> place in Jamsil.

576
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,771
Doesn't it look like Su-yeong?

577
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:37,855
What do you think?

578
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,315
Actually,

579
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,734
I got this photo too.

580
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,695
My gosh. No way.

581
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:47,531
This person also looks like Su-yeong.

582
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,367
Maybe they're really seeing each other.

583
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,620
But it's weird.

584
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,623
If they are, why would Mr. Yuk
make her life so miserable?

585
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,585
Maybe it's a lover's quarrel.

586
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:02,797
-Get dressed.
-Okay.

587
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,756
Gosh.

588
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,443
Is the shredding truck here?

589
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,445
Yes.

590
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,073
Let's move them together.

591
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,325
You should go to your meeting.

592
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,043
-Are you hurt?
-I'm fine.

593
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:43,003
You aren't fine. You're hurt.

594
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,923
Why would you…

595
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,176
Don't say you're fine when you're not.

596
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,391
You could've asked me for help
at the very least…

597
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,527
You could've done this another way.

598
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,447
-You didn't have to make it so hard--
-What other way?

599
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,830
You may find me frustrating,

600
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,332
but I'm trying to get through this
in my own way.

601
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,336
This is who I am here.

602
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:27,089
You know that, Mr. Ha.

603
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,263
It's funny…

604
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:40,644
how you thought
I had a choice in this matter.

605
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:47,401
Every day has been a struggle for me
at this bank since day one.

606
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,367
So don't mind me and go to your meeting.

607
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,545
Mr. Ha.

608
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:09,715
Please stand up.

609
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,306
Thanks to Mr. Ha,
the Youngpo branch got a chance

610
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,101
to become business partners
with Daeseong Construction.

611
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:24,855
Thanks to talented employees like him
who love our company,

612
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:28,108
we are able to march forward
despite people complaining

613
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,319
and neglecting their duties.

614
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,239
Mr. Ha.

615
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:39,912
The Deposits Team is missing a person
with Ms. Ahn shredding files,

616
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,039
so General Affairs should help.

617
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,209
And do not leave your post
trying to help Ms. Ahn.

618
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:49,505
If you do,
it'll be considered a dereliction of duty.

619
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,808
Is he saying

620
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:05,145
that he'll also hold us responsible
if we help her out?

621
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,314
He's completely bullying her.

622
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,441
This is ridiculous.

623
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,997
Where are you headed in such a hurry?

624
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,082
I…

625
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,336
The meeting is over.

626
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,131
We can get by without you, Ms. Ahn.

627
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,717
So just go do your job.

628
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,594
-Let's go.
-Yes.

629
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,356
If you ask me,
Ms. Ahn is being stubborn.

630
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,692
If she apologizes
and says she won't do it again,

631
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,861
I'm sure Mr. Yuk would accept the apology.

632
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,531
So what if he does?
She'll have to go to those meetings again.

633
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,242
What's wrong with that?
I go to those meetings too.

634
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,079
No one here

635
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:06,332
has been to those drinking meetings
more than she has.

636
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:09,501
It's part of life
to humor people when you need to.

637
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:12,755
I'm all about enjoying life,
but even I hold back sometimes.

638
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,632
How could a senior clerk
with no connections

639
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:18,260
have the guts to talk back
to the branch manager?

640
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:21,805
You all think she overreacted, don't you?

641
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,270
What do you think, Mr. Ha?

642
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,909
It's a choice she made.

643
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:59,927
If we step in hastily,
she could get in further trouble.

644
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,074
Yes, hello.

645
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:26,120
I'm calling about Mr. Park
and what happened last Friday…

646
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,291
No, it's not that.

647
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,856
<i>What do you think, Mr. Ha?</i>

648
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,986
It's a choice she made.

649
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:19,840
MOM

650
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,019
Why do you look so worn out?

651
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:34,855
Mom.

652
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:38,817
Don't force me.

653
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,949
You're forcing me
to forgive him just because you did.

654
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,873
It's not like that, Su-yeong.

655
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,960
Back then, when Dad…

656
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,928
When that man abandoned us…

657
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:12,142
and you had to work at a restaurant
while selling insurance…

658
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,523
The first thing I did when you came home
was check your feet,

659
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:23,111
wondering if they'd be
covered in blood again.

660
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,824
I was worried every single day.

661
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,752
On the day of Su-hyeok's death…

662
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:45,050
I went to meet the person
who picked up his cell phone.

663
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,728
Yes, I just arrived.

664
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,650
Yes.

665
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,410
Thank you.

666
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,377
Why did he come here?

667
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:53,201
Dad.

668
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,623
Su-yeong.

669
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,459
Why are you here, Dad?

670
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:05,922
Who's that woman?

671
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,552
We couldn't reach you for months. Why…

672
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,144
Did Su-hyeok see this too?

673
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:25,233
Did he come to this neighborhood
because of you?

674
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,152
What…

675
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,663
<i>Are you Mr. Ahn Su-hyeok's guardian?</i>

676
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,832
<i>The patient just passed away.</i>

677
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,637
"How did we end up like this?"

678
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,014
I thought about it again and again.

679
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:02,854
But I couldn't think of what it was
that we had done wrong.

680
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,780
That's why I can't understand
why you chose to forgive him.

681
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,077
Su-yeong.

682
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:20,747
Your father is…

683
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,342
a good man.

684
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,688
Only he and I know…

685
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,609
the sorrow of losing a child.

686
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,363
As you live on,

687
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,950
you realize that nothing really matters.

688
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,579
Don't hate your dad.

689
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:03,957
It's all my fault.

690
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,959
How is it your fault?

691
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,963
A parent who loses a child
lives forever in pain.

692
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:11,631
But that's my pain to bear.

693
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:13,008
So please…

694
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,845
don't hate anybody.

695
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,104
Just keep the restaurant open.

696
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:43,205
Stay here. I'll bring an umbrella.

697
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,380
What's wrong, Mom?

698
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,092
Why are you walking like that?

699
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:59,054
What happened?
How long has it been like this?

700
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:04,017
I'm fine.
It doesn't bother me. I'm used to it now.

701
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,853
-It doesn't hurt. I'm fine.
-You're not fine!

702
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,438
Why do you walk with a limp?

703
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,982
Mom, why on earth…

704
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,908
Can you stop making me feel bad for you?

705
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,995
Please.

706
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,125
Can you please stop living like this?

707
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:31,545
Su-yeong…

708
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:56,945
<i>Here's what it is.</i>

709
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,407
I like you.

710
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,706
I said I like you.

711
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,291
I'm afraid I have bad news.

712
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,044
They were right. I'm dating Mr. Jeong.

713
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,006
<i>I hurt his pride for nothing.</i>

714
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,683
<i>And all though I had feelings for him…</i>

715
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,354
<i>If I had kept my promise…</i>

716
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,357
<i>that day at the hotel…</i>

717
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,278
would you have dated me?

718
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,827
<i>I couldn't bring myself to be honest…</i>

719
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,625
<i>because I could understand…</i>

720
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,214
<i>why he hesitated.</i>

721
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:02,844
<i>So I did not have the right…</i>

722
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,473
<i>to be honest about my feelings.</i>

723
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,643
<i>No matter how hard I tried,</i>

724
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,896
<i>I was stuck where I was</i>

725
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,690
<i>and couldn't go any further.</i>

726
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:25,951
Are you all right?

727
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:32,832
<i>But despite all this…</i>

728
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,380
<i>this man…</i>

729
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:49,057
The weather is great, right?
This is my favorite weather.

730
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,228
Our neighborhood
looks the most beautiful when it rains.

731
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:02,612
Ms. Ahn.

732
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,740
Should we run?

733
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,036
What?

734
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,123
Let's run.

735
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,417
Here.

736
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,710
Thank you.

737
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,379
I got this for you too.

738
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:11,765
Why are you so nice to me?

739
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:17,437
Come on.
If you don't know why, then you're a fool.

740
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:44,923
Here.

741
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:52,931
I just think you're cool.

742
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,811
Ms. Ahn, you're such a cool person.

743
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:02,148
So you're not foolish at all.

744
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:07,987
In five years,
you'll shine even more brightly than now.

745
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,698
It'll be unimaginable.

746
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:14,828
Can you stop going on blind dates?

747
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:19,582
Sorry?

748
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,001
I like you, Ms. Ahn.

749
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:25,046
I waited for you to tell you that.

750
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,355
Why do you keep comforting me?

751
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:51,656
All done.

752
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,909
Make sure you put a fresh one on later.

753
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,588
I want to be more than just your neighbor.

754
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,552
I'm trying really hard
to become your boyfriend.

755
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:22,061
What I mean is--

756
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,480
Sure.

757
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:32,614
Be my boyfriend.

758
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:42,248
You wrapped my finger nicely.

759
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:48,922
Really? Do you mean it?

760
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,011
Yes, I mean it.

761
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,024
This isn't a dream, is it?

762
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,727
Hello.

763
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,021
We're from the Audit Team.

764
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:49,857
I see.

765
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:52,151
What brings you here?

766
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:53,403
Well…

767
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:55,905
We need to confirm a few things.

768
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:00,910
This way, please.

769
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,373
Can you please bring in some tea?

770
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:18,011
-Do you think it's about that?
-About what?

771
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,096
Mr. Yuk's affair.

772
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:23,349
Why would they come here
over a private matter?

773
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:29,105
They might if his mistress
is someone in the office.

774
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:41,618
Mr. Ma Du-sik.

775
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,245
Yes?

776
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:48,082
Ms. Bae Eun-jeong.
They want you in there one at a time.

777
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,252
Me?

778
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:53,838
Why me?

779
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,800
They want to talk to you two.

780
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:02,180
All I ever did was butter up my superiors.

781
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:13,566
What do you want to ask me?

782
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:18,613
Everything we talk about here
will be kept confidential.

783
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,073
Okay.

784
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,427
Ahn Su-yeong!

785
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,941
You…

786
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,812
THE INTEREST OF LOVE

787
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:37,293
I can take care of this myself.
Don't worry about me, Mr. Ha.

788
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,006
<i>Don't they look good together?</i>

789
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:45,051
He must really like her.
I'm so jealous that they're dating.

790
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:48,638
<i>You're going to think of me</i>
