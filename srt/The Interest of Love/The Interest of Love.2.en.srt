THE INTEREST OF LOVE

<i><font color="white">that I know nothing about.</font></i>

6
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,254
It's a bit run-down, but that's the house.

00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:33,760
<i><font color="white">Strangely, though,</font></i>

Come on in.

9
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:45,689
This house
is over 40 years old, so it's pretty old.

10
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,946
The sink needs to be fixed.

11
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,284
But the rent is cheap.
You can move in right away.

12
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,125
Old houses
have ridiculously wide balconies.

13
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:10,672
The fully furnished,
one-bedroom studio was better, right?

14
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,259
No, I'll take this.

15
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,305
What about your family?
Will you live here alone?

16
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:20,974
Yes.

17
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,727
It's just me.

<i><font color="white">subtly discriminatory as well.</font></i>

The questions were so unfair.

52
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,166
They practically want us to fail.

53
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,418
No wonder the acceptance rate
is less than 10%.

There seems to be a gap

00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,430
I worked part-time, sir.

58
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,309
Your performance evaluation is excellent.

59

I did my best, sir.

60
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,188
Why do you want to switch job positions?

61
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:20,862
I want my hard work
to be acknowledged, sir.

62

How is it unfair?

63
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,202
It's anything but.

64
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,954
Why bother going to college

65
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,332
only to be treated the same way
as high school graduates?

66
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,416
To be honest,

67
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,004
I think service reps should get paid
much less than regular workers.

68
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,799
I agree. The result can't be
the same for both groups.

69
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,968
Now that's what I call unfair.

Then what will happen to us?

Did we have something special?

87
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,706
You said you liked things
to be clear and defined.

88
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,877
I thought you said that
to clarify our relationship.

89
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,422
You had feelings for me too.

-And that day--
-You're the one who didn't show up.

It wasn't intentional.

I'm sorry.

I'm truly sorry

-that I couldn't make it that day.
-Do you mean that?

95
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:46,377
Are you really apologizing

Just go home. He's doing that

You're a heartless jerk.

It's okay to drink

How would doing that change anything?

But can at least one of you
sober up, please?

122
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:19,697
Sang-su, you stole that cardboard cutout
and said she was your girlfriend.

123
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,909
And Seok-hyeon,
you're the one who dumped her!

-But you're bawling every day.
-Jeong-eun…

125
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,709
I thought you said
drinking didn't solve anything

126
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,253
and that you didn't understand
people like him.

Why did you drink so much?

You scare me more than he does.

I can't believe how sober you look
while completely intoxicated.

What's the matter with you?

-Here.

154
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,644
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

155
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,479
-This isn't spiked, right?
-Good morning.

156
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,940
-Hello, sir.
-Good morning, sir.

157
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,526
-How about a morning coffee?
-Thanks, Mr. Ma.

158
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,236
Let me add a shot of love in it.

159
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,363
Actually, let me double that.

160
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,781
-That's great.
-Enjoy.

161
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,419
It's herbal tea.

162
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,132
Thank you.

163
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,266
Excuse me, Ms. Ahn.

164
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,477
About yesterday, I--

165
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,979
Yesterday? What do you mean?

166
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,118
-HR posted an announcement.
-Really?

167
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,120
Let me check.

168
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,419
Isn't it about time Mr. Ha left?

169
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,504
And Ms. Ahn, hasn't it been
three years for you?

170
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,217
Ms. Park Mi-gyeong from the Seocho branch

171
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,802
-is joining our PB Team.
-Really?

172
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,679
-And you're not leaving?
-Jeez.

173
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,389
I was looking forward to not seeing you.

174
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,308
I guess that won't happen. Darn it.

00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,104
You're beautiful, miss.

183
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,108
How was today's massage?

184
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,860
Yes, it was good.

185
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,363
You have good skin to begin with.

186
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,281
So tell me.

187
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,408
-Will you keep working there?
-Mom.

188
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:18,120
You went to a top university
and got a job on your own. That's enough.

189
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,666
Why on earth do you want
to handle other people's money?

190
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,545
Nobody will say anything
if you get married and take it easy.

191
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,549
You have everything
that others could only wish for.

192
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,927
Refusing your parents' help

193
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,096
doesn't make you
a good daughter, you know.

194
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,223
Don't you agree, Ms. Han?

195
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,017
I'll bring out the tea.

196
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,439
How's this place?

197
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,818
It may look shabby,

198
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,528
but it's popular with my friends.

199
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,739
Everyone with skin problems comes here.

200
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,408
You should come here too.

201
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,827
If you want to get massages,

202
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,122
take Pilates classes,
and hang out with me,

203
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,665
you should quit the bank--

204
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,626
Mom, stop talking to me.
My facial mask is stretching out.

205
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:19,724
Raise your hand if you know why
your performance is the same

206
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,392
despite working like a dog.

207
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,274
Who came in last
in the General Consultation Team?

208
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,327
Is it Mr. Ha?

209
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,203
Is it you again?

210
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,372
I'm sorry, sir.

211
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,171
Mr. Ha.

212
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,382
I'd like a word with you.

213
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,848
Go on.

214
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,309
I won't see you out.

215
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,147
Open up.

216
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,609
Pardon?

217
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,611
I said open up.

218
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:19,992
Suck on it.

219
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,912
Squeeze out every last drop.

220
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,831
All of it. Don't waste any.
All the way. Good.

221
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:32,755
Sang-su.

222
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,799
-Yes?
-Do you know

223
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,301
what happens if I don't become
a branch manager in two years?

224
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,179
Yes, sir.

225
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:49,689
Our branch manager only tends to VIPs
and boosts his performance.

226
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:55,569
As for me, I just tend to small fry
and that reflects on my performance.

227
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,154
And that's not all.

228
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:00,282
You know how much
Mr. Lee looks down on me.

229
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:04,787
These days, he doesn't even bother
to run things by me.

230
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,081
He reports directly to the branch manager.

231
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:13,003
People wouldn't question it if he ended up
becoming a branch manager next year.

232
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,049
I'm sorry, sir.

233
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,138
If this is my final position

234
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,141
during my 20 years here,

235
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,685
my wife will divorce me.

236
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,937
I'm barely keeping my head above water.

237
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,357
Sir.

238
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,157
My kids saved up
to buy me this on Father's Day

239
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,452
in the hopes it would help me
become a branch manager.

240
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,162
I don't share them with anyone.

241
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,038
-But you can have them.
-No, sir.

242
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,957
-You get me, right?
-I don't need them.

243
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,584
-Gosh.
-Just take them.

244
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,587
You'd better not share them
with those sly guys,

245
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,964
Mr. Lee or Mr. Ma.

246
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,217
Have one whenever you feel tired
from raising your performance.

247
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,469
Tell me if you need more.

248
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,512
Yes, sir.

249
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,350
Actually, can you give me one?

250
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,526
That's it. The other side too.

251
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,695
Do you not know
how to change a light bulb?

252
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,323
Hey, my parents didn't
make me do stuff like this.

253
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,451
What if I get electrocuted?
That would be painful.

254
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,535
Hey, you're done.

255
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,496
You could've zapped me.

256
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,247
Impressive skills, Ms. Ahn.

257
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,500
-All done.
-Thanks.

258
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,168
-Thank you.
-Hey.

259
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,302
Are you sure this is okay?

260
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,305
Of course. I'll be back.

271
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,293
I'll give bank employees a discount.

272
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,921
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

273

Hello.

274
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,516
Come by for lunch.

275
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,600
Here.

276
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:43,112
I only tended to five customers,
and it's already lunchtime.

Mortgage, house lease,
credit, mortgage, and credit.

Quite a variety, right?

00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,290
How's the hangover?

280
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,167

This is on the house.

00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,725
Thank you, Uncle.

284
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,436
Is it okay if I call you "uncle"?

285
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,354
Of course. Eat up.

286
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:18,564
-Thank you.
-Come again.

287
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,691
-Come often.
-Thank you.

<i><font color="white">I really love Tongyeong oysters.</font></i>

289
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,908
I like them raw,
and I like oyster <i><font color="white">gukbap</font></i> too.

290
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:31,827
And oyster <i><font color="white">jeon</font></i>--

291
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,705
I actually hate oysters.

292
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,009
Are you mad at the oyster?
Why are you picking at it?

293
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,139
What do you know about Mr. Jeong?

294
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,851
-Why, all of a sudden?
-Just because.

295
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,771
He's been here for about a month, right?

296
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:02,441
I'm not sure. I'm not that interested
in our security guard.

297
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,696
Do you think they're really dating?

298
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,282
It doesn't seem like it
based on their reactions.

299
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,660
If having lunch together
means you're dating,

300
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,536
then I'd have 100 exes by now.

301
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,665
Are you going to tell him?

302
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,084
"I like her."

303
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,503
"I like Su-yeong."

304
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,005
Just shut up and eat.

305
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,428
Jeez.

306
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,597
Give me that.

307
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,683
Unbelievable.

308
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,442
They're for our customers.

309
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,568
Thank you.

00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,438
Mr. Ha.

313
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:24,606
Yes?

314
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,317
Here. I forgot to give this back.

315
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,027
Thank you.

316
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,362
Right.

317
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,494
-Wait.
-Yes?

318
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,749
You must be tired from studying.
Have one of these.

319
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,209
-Thank you.
-Sure.

320
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,923
How about we each have one right now?

321
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,718
Sure.

322
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:02,269
It must be stressful
preparing for the state exam.

323
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:03,896
So…

324
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,566
Do you also study on the weekends?

325
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:12,404
I'm sure you're too busy
to do anything else, but study.

326
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:18,535
I work out early in the morning
to prepare for the fitness test.

327
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,457
-Of course, working out is important.
-Right.

328
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:29,379
Then I guess
you don't have time to date anyone, right?

329
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,800
Yes, that's right.

330
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,052
Right?

331
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,724
I'm rooting for you. I'm sure you'll pass.

332
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,393
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

333
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,629
YOUNGPO CENTRAL TRADITIONAL MARKET

334
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,673
What are you talking about?

335
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,175
I was never told that!

336
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,885
I don't want to talk to you!

337
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,720
Call your boss!

338
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,138
-What's going on?
-I'll be here.

339
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,058
He's Ms. Bae's client.
It's about the principal loss.

340
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,393
-How much?
-Call your boss!

341
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,436
-Three million won.
-Bring me my money.

342
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,064
-You can't--
-Don't touch me!

343
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,483
-He's saying, "You never told me that."
-Don't touch me.

344
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,987
-"You'd better pay me back."
-Call your boss. I was never told that.

345
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,947
-Where's Mr. Noh?
-I want my three million won!

346
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,741
Both he and the branch manager are out.

347
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:40,951
Don't play dumb!

348
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,703
He insists on acting that way

349
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,746
-until they come.
-I don't care. Call your boss.

350
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,373
-I can't talk to you.
-Sir--

351
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,917
I told you not to touch me!

352
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,964
The camera is recording this.
Don't touch me, or I'll report you.

353
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,341
I guess we won't be clocking out on time.

354
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,347
I want my three million won back.

355
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,018
How dare you ignore your customer?

356
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,733
Are you just going to watch?

357
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,611
Should we call the police?

358
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,114
And let word of this get out?

359
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,365
Of course not.

360
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:23,577
What if he posts about his arrest
on the Financial Supervisory Service site?

361
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,454
Then what should we do?

362
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,789
We can't stay here all night.

363
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,542
When can I clock out?
I have plans tonight.

364
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,711
What kind of answer are you expecting?

365
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:36,006
-That you can go ahead and leave?
-No.

366
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,842
The balance is correct.

367
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:39,968
Okay.

368
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,648
What?

369
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,905
Who are you? Are you the boss here?

370
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,075
I'm going to kneel here until you get up.

371
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:07,621
What? I don't want that!
I just want my money back!

372
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,083
You know that's not possible,
and that's why you're furious.

373
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,834
I'll stay here until you feel better.

374
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,920
Stop this nonsense!

375
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,256
I won't leave
without my three million won.

376
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,882
Bring it to me.

377
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,884
I won't get up until you do.

378
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:27,391
Is this funny to you?
Just give me back my money!

379
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,606
Do whatever you want,
and I'll do the same.

380
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:38,860
Jeez.

381
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,033
So is it possible or not?

382
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,411
I'm sorry, ma'am. Please wait a moment.

383
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,875
I'm sorry. It's his probation period,
so he must've made a mistake.

384
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,920
This won't take long, so let me help.

385
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,213
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

386
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,053
DEPOSITORY OPERATION MANUAL

387
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,484
I'm sorry, Ms. Ahn.

388
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,824
These are the list of mistakes I made
when I first started working here

389
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,118
and their solutions.

390
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,706
AHN SU-YEONG

391
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,792
I made tons of mistakes too.

392
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,796
They say it's a given for clerks to make
mistakes for the first three years.

393
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,882
Don't take it to heart.

394
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,676
HAVE ANSWERS READY FOR POSSIBLE COMPLAINTS

395
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,430
Thank you.

396
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,585
Jeez.

397
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,420
-What?
-Gosh.

398
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,425
Ms. Seo?

399
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,344
-Gosh.
-Ma'am.

400
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,764
Come on. Let's go.

401
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,823
Seriously? Look at you all.

402
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,742
What a beautiful sight.

403
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,003
<i><font color="white">I knew Su-yeong was tenacious.</font></i>

404
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,256
But that was still impressive.

405
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,800
How was that impressive?

406
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,219
I had to kneel because of her.

407
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,514
<i><font color="white">We get to go home, thanks to you.</font></i>

408
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,641
Thanks, Su-yeong.

409
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,852
You didn't have to do that, you know.

410
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,354
I wanted to go home too.

411
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,400
Anyway, thank you. This was all my fault.

412
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,111
I'm leaving now. See you tomorrow.

413
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,904
-Good job today.
-Goodbye.

414
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,991
-Right.
-Thank goodness.

415
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,326
How about a blind date, Su-yeong?

416
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,497
My ex and I got back together,
so I can't go.

417
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:41,460
I mean, it has nothing
to do with what you did for me today.

418
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:44,337
He works at Samjeon,
and he's good-looking.

419
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:47,549
I can't go because he and my ex
have mutual friends.

420
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,384
Are you interested?

421
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:52,971
A blind date?

422
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,432
No, that's okay.

423
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,684
What? Why not?

424
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,020
Why not go?

425
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:05,150
She said he works at Samjeon.
Is there a reason why you can't go?

426
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,362
Are you already taken?

427
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,990
Or are you casually seeing someone?

428
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,952
What? Have you been seeing someone?

429
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,205
Who is he? A colleague?

430
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:19,331
When is it?

431
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,416
Next weekend.

432
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,587
-I'll go.
-Really?

433
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,631
I'll go on the blind date.

434
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,009
That's great.

435
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,221
That's great.

436
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,450
CHAPTER 3
INCOMPREHENSIBLE WORDS

437
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,044
MR. SO-NOSY

438
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,306
Good shot, Sang-su.

439
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,434
But it's not good for me.

440
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,563
Gosh, that went far.

441
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,941
You need to practice how to lose
without making it look obvious.

442
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,402
Beating the branch manager
will do you no good.

443
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,861
Why are you dressed like that?

444
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,992
Should I just quit the bank
and open up a driving range?

445
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,412
Should I go on a blind date?

446
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:44,749
Did you get an offer?

447
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,586
No, it's not that.

448
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,838
Then whom will you go
on a blind date with?

449
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,133
Instead of that,

450
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,261
how about we go on a date
with pork belly and soju?

451
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,638
I'm sick of drinking.

452
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:01,099
It's not just any pork.
It's Jeju pork belly.

453
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:05,645
I don't care. I'll take a rain check.
I have a high school reunion.

454
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,647
You usually don't go. What gives?

455
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,319
I'm going there to raise my performance.

456
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,075
In that case, leave it with me.

457
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:20,869
Right here.

458
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,704
Yank out your pride and leave it behind.

459
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,207
Shut up. You're not making any sense.

460
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,295
Sang-su, remember who we are.

461
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,005
We're just bank clerks.

462
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:36,509
We don't need any pride. Come on.

463
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,773
You look good.
Is it because you're getting married?

464
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,941
Or could it be
thanks to your future father-in-law?

465
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,361
What do you mean?
Does he have his own business?

466
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:57,822
He owns some interior designing companies.

467
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,742
His mom-in-law is a vice principal,
his sister-in-law practices law.

468
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,827
That family has both wealth and honor.

469
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:06,206
Hey, I said she's only in law school.

470
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,667
-Come on.
-They're just an average family.

471
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,127
Hey, being average is the best.

472
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,338
-Right.
-I agree.

473
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,841
Hey, you should get
your home loan from Sang-su.

474
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,511
What?

475
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,430
-Are you interested?
-Go on.

476
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,682
Should I?

477
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,852
Hey. Since we're on the topic,
take a look at this.

478
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,104
Let me see that.

479
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,606
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

480
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,067
This is a pretty good product.

481
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,236
The rate of return is not bad at all.

482
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:37,987
An investment trust?

483
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,572
-What is this?
-Beats me.

484
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,915
Come on. We're all friends.
Help me out here.

485
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,042
-All right.
-Take a good look at it.

486
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:54,754
How much do you get
in commission for this?

487
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,050
What?

488
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,345
I'm constructing a new building.

489
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,975
It's the place where you used to live.

490
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,769
I'm going to demolish it
and put up a new one.

491
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,021
That's right.

492
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,815
-You two lived in the same building.
-Yes.

493
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,191
That's right.

494
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,068
Right.

495
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,617
<i><font color="white">That's right.</font></i>

496
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,454
<i><font color="white">It was pretty much underground.</font></i>

497
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:28,538
This is only temporary.

498
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,583
We won't be living here for long.

499
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,835
<i><font color="white">We lived on the first floor</font></i>
<i><font color="white">that got no sun.</font></i>

500
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:39,466
<i><font color="white">The address read "Gangnam,"</font></i>

501
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,470
<i><font color="white">My mom repeatedly told me</font></i>
<i><font color="white">that it was temporary,</font></i>

502
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,682
<i><font color="white">but we lived there</font></i>
<i><font color="white">for more than five years.</font></i>

503
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:54,063
<i><font color="white">And thanks to that experience,</font></i>
<i><font color="white">I became a top student.</font></i>

504
00:37:56,274 --> 00:38:01,237
<i><font color="white">I didn't fit in with the other kids</font></i>

505
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,115

506
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:09,537
<i><font color="white">And I promised myself</font></i>
<i><font color="white">to never live that poor again.</font></i>

507
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,298
You know what?

508
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,759
I'll move our company
and employees' accounts to your bank.

509
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,718
-Gosh.
-Great.

510
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,474
Really? Thanks.

511
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,976
It's nothing. Friends should
help each other out.

512
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,772
But hey, are you thinking about
getting married at all?

513
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,652
Of course. I want to marry
a nice, average woman.

514
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,238
-Right.
-Average is the best.

515
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,197
Let's drink.

516
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,824
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

517
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,784
-Let's meet up more often.
-Sure.

518
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:15,687
<i><font color="white">Seriously?</font></i>

519
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,276
Everyone! Attention!

520
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:29,659
Mr. Ha, right here,
finally did something terrific.

521
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,743
Applause, please.

522
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:38,293
I heard you went to an elite school.
Your friends sure are different.

523
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,669
Well done.

524
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,884
When is the new assistant manager coming?

525
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:49,387
She's going to show up exactly on time.
How do we feel about that?

526
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,556
Don't be mean now.

527
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,059
Getting a new PB Team worker
will take a burden off your shoulders.

528
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:57,770
No way. Check this out.

529
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,939
-This is the new employee.
-What is it?

530
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,357
-Let me see.
-Let me see.

531
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,984
-What?
-No way.

532
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,236
-Gosh.
-Look at her.

533
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,322
DESIGNATED PARKING SPACE

534
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:22,211
She has a different vibe
than our Goddess of Youngpo.

535
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,296
-She looks like me.
-Wait.

536
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,089
-Right?
-Don't irritate me like that.

537
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,258
-Someone this hot is coming here?
-Are you excited?

538
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,760
She's seriously coming here?

539
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,094
Good morning.

540
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,350
My name is Park Mi-gyeong,
and this is my first day

541
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,809
at the Youngpo branch.

542
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:39,228
I'll greet you officially
after I get changed.

543
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,940
-Okay.
-Okay then.

544
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,233
Where's the locker room?

545
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,486
That way.

546
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,712
Assistant Manager Park Mi-gyeong
is from the Seocho branch.

547
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,798
She'll be joining me in the PB Team.

548
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,093
-Why don't you introduce yourself?
-Okay.

549
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,097
My name is Park Mi-gyeong.
I'm the newest member to join Youngpo.

550
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,723
It's nice to meet everyone.

551
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:16,808
Applause, please.

552
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,352
Thank you.

553
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,020
-Let's work hard.
-Okay.

554
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,271
Thank you.

555
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,690
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

556
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,153
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

557
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,697
Did you see?

558
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,448
Unbelievable.

559
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,123
Here.

560
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,291
Thank you for the meal.

561
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,085
It was expensive and delicious.

562
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,045
I'll treat everyone often.

563
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,880
Is that a custom-made handbag?

564
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,300
This? It's called <i><font color="white">marquage.</font></i>

565
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:54,012
I like to draw pretty designs.

566
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,472
Doodling on luxury bags
must be your hobby.

567
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:02,145
You have great skin, by the way.
Do you go to spas and get facials done?

568
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:06,649
I go with my mom every now and then.
I'm too lazy to go often.

569
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,068
With your mom?

570
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:13,406
Let us help you in any way we can.
All you have to do is ask.

571
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:18,369
How are the employees at this branch?

572
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,997
Our branch manager is like a king.

573
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,917
And he married a wealthy woman,
so he's been jumping up the ladder.

574
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,503
Mr. Noh is anxious
as he has to voluntarily resign

575
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:30,131
if he doesn't become
a branch manager in two years.

576
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:33,342
He's had to struggle a lot
after marrying his dirt-poor wife.

577
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,053
But he's a good person.

578
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,973
Just watch out for TOM.

579
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,684
TOM?

580
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:44,062
It's short for "Two Obnoxious Men."

581
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,482
One of them is Mr. Lee.

582
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,984
He takes credit for good
and blames others for the bad.

583
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,028
Mr. Noh has no shame.

584
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,740
I planned out everything myself.
You saw me do that, right?

585
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,742
<i><font color="white">The other one is Mr. Ma.</font></i>

586
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:01,579
<i><font color="white">-He's not evil, but he's an opportunist.</font></i>
-Calm down. You're too tense.

587
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,623
<i><font color="white">And these three are the most popular.</font></i>

588
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,875
<i><font color="white">They made so many mistakes as rookies…</font></i>

589
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,418
<i><font color="white">…they were called the Three Idiots.</font></i>

590
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,296
Hey, is this supposed to be 80%?

591
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,468
Let's see…

592
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,640
Hey, does this mean 80%?

593
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,852
-Where did you get this?
-From him.

594
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,355
-I gave this to you.
-And I gave it to you.

595
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,483
-Exactly.
-It was originally from me.

596
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,027
You idiots.

597
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,154
So is it 80%?

598
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,157
I'm sure it is.

599
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,495
And lastly--

600
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,511
That's Senior Clerk Ahn Su-yeong.

601
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,429
She's a service rep, just like me

602
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:05,143
-and is called the Goddess of Youngpo.
-Goddess? That's stretching it a bit.

603
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:08,020
Guys fall for her
every now and then, but that's it.

604
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,272
You get it, right?

605
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,816
Are you jealous, Ji-yun?

606
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,949
Our banking app will be modified.

607
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:24,954
The president wants the employees
to come up with suggestions.

608
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:31,836
And the branch manager wants you two
to be in charge of this project.

609
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,673
But didn't you say we should focus
on achieving high performance?

610
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,301
Yes, but that's a given.

611
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,137
Sang-su.

612
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:43,639
Didn't you want to move up to HQ?

613
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,976
This is worth many points.

614
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,937
And the president
will present the reward himself.

615
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:51,647
Is it still a no? Should I do it?

616
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,650
-I'll do it.
-Good.

617
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:58,321
Sir. If we're going
to be at the center twice a week,

618
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,947
what about our main duties?

619
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,242
Then someone will have
to substitute for you.

620
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,829
Let's see. Sang-su, ask Seok-hyeon--

621
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,291
Ask Mr. Ma to take over for you.

622
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:17,340
As for you, ask Ms. Ahn to take over.
She used to help the PB Team.

623
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,633
Yes, sir.

624
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,055
Go ahead and talk things over.

625
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:27,683
Hi, honey.
No, I answered as soon as it rang.

626
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:31,312
Should we read up
and talk again after work?

627
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,607
Sure.

628
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:39,904
Sang-su.

629
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,073
Pardon?

630
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,035
Don't you remember me? It's Mi-gyeong.

631
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,665
I majored in business administration.

632
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,712
You're…

633
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:01,759
Hey, Gyeong-pil.

634
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,679
Ms. Park, here, went
to the same school as us.

635
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,931
You're So Gyeong-pil, right?

636
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,811
-Hi there.
-Since it's been a while,

637
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,188
how about we have dinner together?

638
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,232
Sure. You're free, right?

639
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,359
I have a memorial service today.

640
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,569
Let me take a rain check.

641
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,407
What do you like to eat?

642
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,409
Why don't you choose?

643
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,499
-See you later.
-See you.

644
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,502
Ms. Park, the handover files
are on your desk.

645
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,462
Thank you, Ms. Ahn.

646
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,465
And this is yours.

647
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:44,427
Thank you, Su-yeong.

648
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,899
<i><font color="white">Did you like her too?</font></i>

649
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,484
Who?

650
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:01,986
Ms. Ahn.

651
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,034
I hear she's the Goddess of Youngpo.

652
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,413
What do you mean?

653
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,416
She's pretty, though.

654
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:21,297
You changed your style, didn't you?
That's why I didn't recognize you.

655
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,423
Well…

656
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:25,259
Back then, I was rebellious.

657
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,386
Toward whom?

658
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,181
Just someone.

659
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,226
I haven't had this in a while.
I feel nostalgic.

660
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,020
Why haven't you?

661
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,939
There weren't many opportunities
after graduation.

662
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,984
So don't eat a lot. Let me have the rest.

663
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,113
Fine. You can have it all.

664
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,742
Have some more.

665
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:55,414
My scholarship was at stake,
and he wasn't picking up.

666
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:57,208
So I went to his place.

667
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,086
With a toothpick in his mouth,

668
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,671
he said, "You deserve a B minus,
not a B plus."

669
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,298
And he threatened to lower my grade.

670
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:08,010
That professor was notorious
for lowering your grade if you complained.

671
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,179
What? You knew that?

672
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,430
Of course.

673
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:15,142
Then you should've told me!

674
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:17,728
It's all your fault.

675
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,188
How is that my fault?

676
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,649
You should have told me.

677
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:31,450
That's the branch manager's spot.

678
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:32,618
I know.

679
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,204
The branch managers had a meeting at HQ.

680
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:40,543
I'll park in the public lot tomorrow.
Hop in. I'll drop you off.

681
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,353
TONGYEONG OYSTER GUKBAP

682
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,022
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE OPENING
OF YOUR NEW BUSINESS

683
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,579
This is a nice car.

684
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,707
I'm paying it off over a hundred years.

685
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,085
I think it's the same model
as our branch manager's.

686
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:24,420
But his is black.

687
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:29,091
Seriously? That's so annoying.
I'm going to get a new car, then.

688
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,432
Gosh, you're so considerate.

689
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:47,651
I felt hurt when you didn't recognize me.
We were in the same major, after all.

690
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,405
When I returned to school later,
you had already graduated,

691
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,615
so it was only natural.

692
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,617
What did you do after graduating?

693
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,411
I went on a trip abroad.

694
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,622
-Where?
-Türkiye.

695
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,916
Gosh, Türkiye is a lovely country.

696
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,460
Did you see the sunset from Hagia Sophia?

697
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,212
-Have you been to Türkiye?
-Yes.

698
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:08,214
I went to Italy afterward.

699
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,341
I've never been to Italy.

700
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,092
You should go next time.

701
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,053
But the pasta here is better.

702
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:20,226
Right, so any ideas on what to write
for the app improvement proposal?

703
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,269
I can't think of anything right now.

704
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:26,649
I think HQ has an ulterior motive
for this competition.

705
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,776
Like what?

706
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,820
I don't think modifying
or evaluating the app

707
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,032
is what they really want from us.

708
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,495
Then I'll write up a draft.
We can talk afterward.

709
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,829
Sounds good.

710
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,462
Good to see you again.
Thanks for dropping me off.

711
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,297
I look forward to working with you.

712
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:53,217
I should be saying that to you, Ms. Park.

713
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,055
Right then. See you tomorrow, Mr. Ha.

714
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,643
-Bye.
-Okay.

715
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,186
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

716
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,046
<i><font color="white">Just got home. Today was fun.</font></i>

717
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,803
I HAD FUN TOO

718
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:54,403
AHN SU-YEONG

719
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:57,364
LET'S NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TOMORROW

720
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,882
CONTACTS

721
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,091
AHN SU-YEONG

722
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,609
I'd like to take out a housing loan.

723
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,736
A housing loan?

724
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,864
Normally, you can get up to 80%
of the down payment,

725
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,200
but you have to speak to
the Loan Team about the details.

726
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,035
Can't you just do it instead?

727
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:28,831
I'm sorry, but I'm only in charge
of deposits and withdrawals.

728
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:29,915
Let's see.

729
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,793
Mr. Ha?

730
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,879
This customer wants a housing loan.
Can you speak with him?

731
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,047
Sure.

732
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,091
This way, please.

733
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,017
Number 312, how may I help you?

734
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:51,520
How much money do you need, sir?

735
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,772
-About 250 million won.
-Okay, got it.

736
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,858
-Can I see your ID, please?
-Yes.

737
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:56,942
Okay.

738
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:04,158
My mom was thrilled
when I became a bank clerk.

739
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,327
But I bet she never knew
I'd be so busy that I'd skip meals.

740
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,621
Up until recently,

741
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:12,207
my mom thought bank employees
clocked out at 4 p.m.

742
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:16,211
Four is actually an unlucky number for us
because that's when our job really begins.

743
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,508
The position transfer notice
will be up soon. Are you doing it?

744
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,636
You have to have worked
at least three years. I'm a bit short.

745
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,971
What about you, Su-yeong?

746
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:27,973
I'm going to pass.

747
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,642
You'll soon be
a section chief anyway, right?

748
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:34,021
If you transfer, you'll have to start
from the bottom again.

749
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:36,273
You should apply for it.

750
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:39,234
If not, you'll be stuck
and won't know what to do.

751
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,528
What do you mean? I don't agree.

752
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,572
I love being a teller.

753
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:48,202
Still, you should know how to manage
loan applications as a clerk.

754
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:51,538
She's also helping
the General Consultation Team.

755
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,665
This is just her main job.

756
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:55,876
Right.

757
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:59,588
Mr. Noh wants you
to help out with the PB Team.

758
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,839
Yes, I heard.

759
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,758
Let's talk more about that later.

760
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:04,635
Give me your number.

761
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,434
Mr. Ha!

762
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,228
Come and join us.

763
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,812
-Come here.
-No, thank you.

764
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:17,397
-Come on. Hurry up.
-It's okay.

765
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:18,357
Come join us.

766
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,193
Just come in. Hurry up.

767
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,402
Okay.

768
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,780
Come and sit.

769
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,245
-This is good.
-It is.

770
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,871
It's really tasty.

771
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,125
-Your chopsticks.
-Right.

772
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:38,877
You didn't forget this weekend, right?

773
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:41,338
This weekend? What's happening?

774
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,465
I'm setting her up on a blind date.

775
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:45,551
He works at Samjeon.

776
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:49,805
I sent him your photo,
and he's dying to date you already.

777
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,473
I didn't forget.

778
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,643
Are you finally going to get married?

779
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:03,151
Thanks.

780
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:05,862
What was that?

781
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,699
What's going on between you guys?

782
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:12,160
I know you've been
preparing for the competition,

783
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:15,664
and now, you're handing her tissues.

784
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:16,957
It's not like that.

785
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,336
Don't lie. I can see through you.
I can see that you're dating.

786
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,714
Tell me. Do you think
we'll be happily married?

787
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,718
-You suit each other.
-You really do.

788
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,136
You should just date.

789
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:32,139
-Come on.
-Excuse me.

790
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:37,436
-Gosh.
-I can't believe this.

791
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,437
Eat up.

792
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,147
Eat up.

793
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,065
-Eat up.
-Okay.

794
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:45,402
Please have some.

795
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:46,987
Thank you.

796
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,966
It's not true. Mi-gyeong is…

797
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,221
There's nothing between Ms. Park and me.

798
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,683
-Okay.
-Wait.

799
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,315
Are you really going on that blind date?

800
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:30,489
You said you were dating Mr. Jeong.
But now, you're going on a blind date.

801
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,240
It just doesn't make sense.

802
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,328
This is none of your business.

803
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:41,959
Why are you…

804
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,046
Is there another reason?

805
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:54,137
Is there a reason that I'm not aware of?

806
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,224
No, there isn't.

807
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,063
So, good luck with Ms. Park.

808
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,816
Do you mean that?

809
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,611
Do you really want me

810
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,656
to date Ms. Park?

811
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:17,703
Yes.

812
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,039
You two look good together.

JEONG JONG-HYEON

814

BLIND DATE?

815
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,605
A blind date?

816
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:01,538
Mr. Ha, I know you're in there. Open up.

817
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:07,085
If you don't come out, I'll barge in.

818
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,804
Why do you keep showing up here?

819
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:22,059
Let's drink our loneliness away.

820
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:39,034
Hey, let's do this.
Let's drink until we drop.

821
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,744
Jeez.

822
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,955
I'm not drinking.

823
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,500
Why not?

824
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:49,294
Don't be a party pooper.

825
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,964
What's the problem?
You can tell me anything.

826
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,216
It's nothing.

827
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,135
I can see the torment in your eyes.

828
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,721
-What's Seok-hyeon doing?
-He's on a blind date.

829
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,849
A blind date?

830
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:07,604
People should try to meet others naturally
instead of going on blind dates.

831
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,190
He met his ex naturally,
and look what happened.

832
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,362
He wants to meet a well-off woman.
Her father is the vice president of FSS.

833
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:17,155
Jeez.

834
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,910
Is that right, though?

835
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:27,707
Should two people
from similar backgrounds get married

836
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,835
just to maintain
the lifestyles they're used to

837
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,338
even though they're not in love?

838
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:38,677
Who said there's no love?
Those people can fall in love too.

839
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:41,346
Sang-su.

840
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:46,643
Love can't conquer all
in this awful world.

841
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,146
Money is more powerful than you think.

842
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,319
Sure, there are people who try to raise
their status through marriage.

843
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,409
I heard Su-yeong's blind date
works at Samjeon.

844
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,662
How did you find out?

845
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:07,664
There are no secrets at work.

846
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:19,176
So that's why you're depressed.

847
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:22,053
If it works out, then good for her.

848
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:24,514
If he falls for her, that is.

849
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,784
<i><font color="white">She really is pretty, that's for sure.</font></i>

850
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,789
After coming to Youngpo,

851
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:52,626
guess what the other trainees
asked me about?

852
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:56,087
"Is Ahn Su-yeong pretty?"

853
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,425
And yes, she was.

854
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:01,426
But the problem is

855
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:06,556
even dating someone in college
could end in a four-year headache.

856
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,684
I didn't want to be reckless
and weighed my options.

857
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:11,978
So?

858
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,023
Am I not allowed to like her?

859
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,693
How serious do you feel about her?

860
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,450
Would you consider marrying her?

861
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:31,414
People at the bank even gossip

862
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:34,501
about those who dated
back at the training institute.

863
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,920
What if you two break up?

864
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,299
They'll say you're the guy who seduced
a cute teller and then dumped her.

865
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,594
Will you be able to handle that?

866
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:57,732
<i><font color="white">So just forget about her.</font></i>

867
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:05,282
<i><font color="white">If you keep this up,</font></i>
<i><font color="white">it won't help Su-yeong, either.</font></i>

868
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,194
Ms. Ahn Su-yeong?

869
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,697
-Yes.
-Hello.

870
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:47,240
Please sit down.

871
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:52,162
You're here early.

872
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,581
But you came even earlier.

873
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,750
I didn't want you to wait.

I don't like undefined relationships.

883
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:29,717
It's obvious that you majored in fashion
from the way you dress.

That's not me.

Ms. Kim Ji-yun was the one
who was supposed to be here today.

That was her major.

That's okay.

Then what was your major?

890
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,708
I didn't go to college.
