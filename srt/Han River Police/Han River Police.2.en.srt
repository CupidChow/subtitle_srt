We should send a distress signal

[scoff] Don't be a chicken.
Just tell them to stay put. Go.

They'll panic even more
if you say the wrong thing!

Just tell them to shut up
and stay put. Hurry!

[sighs] Are you saying
this isn't your fault?

Damn you. You should've known
the depth in advance!

71
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,505
Aren't you the captain?

72
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,008
The company isn't at fault here.
This happened because you were careless.

73
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,635
Give me the key.

00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,995
[Jisoo] Come down slowly, everyone.

173
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,830
-This way.
-Why is...

174
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,419
-This way, please.
-Come with me. Go straight.

175
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,509
[officer 1] Someone's injured here!

176
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,511
Try not to move.

177
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,598
Are you okay? Please don't move.

178
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,182
[breathes heavily]

179
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,892
-[officer 2] Hurry up!
-[officer 3] Watch out.

180
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,644
-[officer 2] Hurry!
-[Dujin] This patient has a fracture.

181
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,146
-Careful.
-Fracture.

182
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,523
-[groans]
-[Chunseok] Hey, Dujin.

183
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,317
-Han River.
-[Chunseok] Come over here.

184
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,944
No need to salute. Just come.
What's going on...

185
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,363
[reporter 1]
What's the situation here, sir?

186
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,948
Chief. A word, please.

187
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,076
-Well...
-We're doing our best to rescue everyone.

188
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,871
Go rent a boat right now!

189
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,832
-Director, this isn't a good time.
-Just go rent me one!

190
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,753
An unthinkable disaster happened,
and we are trying...

191
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,588
Hurry up and do something!

192
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,423
-Director, please!
-Move it!

193
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,051
Director Go! Mister.

194
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,971
Mr. Cop?

195
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,516
You were passed out earlier,

196
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,269
so perhaps you don't grasp
how serious this situation is.

197
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,772
But it's best to keep a low profile
for your company's sake.

198
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,607
-Be a good boy and stay away.
-Wait.

199
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,442
You're the one who hit me, right?

200
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,195
-Hey! Are you crazy?
-Reporters are here.

201
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,447
Do you know who I am... [groans]

202
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,324
Will you please be quiet?

203
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,451
-[reporter] It's Chairman Hwang!
-We are trying our best

204
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,621
to do what is necessary.
We are, but...

205
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,083
-[reporter 2] A word, please.
-Do you have anything to say?

206
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,335
I'm sorry, everyone.

207
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,505
I'm Hwang Mandae,
the chairman of River Cruise.

208
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,008
I promise that my company
will compensate the victims

209
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,636
for any psychological
or financial damages.

210
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,347
Also, we will do our absolute best

211
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,516
to prevent incidents
like these from reoccurring.

212
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,060
[camera shutters clicking]

213
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,437
[reporter 3]
Anything else you'd like to add?

214
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,565
[boat engine revving]

215
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,947
[indistinct chatter over radio]

216
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,951
Chul. Thank you.

217
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,705
I'll see if the station will reimburse you
for the fuel you used today.

218
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,833
No need. I know
how things are at the station.

219
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,876
Then how about a drink together?

220
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,878
-I'll buy--
-Hey! Chunseok!

221
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,922
-Yes, sir!
-[officer] Hey!

222
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,424
-Come over here.
-[Chunseok] Yes, sir.

223
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,654
-[Dujin grunts, exhales]
-[Chunseok] Man, I'm exhausted.

224
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,616
I didn't even jump into the water
but I'm so tired.

225
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,619
[groans] These days,
I'm exhausted just from breathing.

226
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,913
[sighs, groans]

227
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,835
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

228
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,005
Were you the ones
who first arrived on the scene today?

229
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,383
-Yes.
-Could we interview you briefly?

230
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,343
Oh, sure. I... [chuckles]

231
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,762
[peppy music playing]

232
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,889
We'll start with the officer
who's in good shape.

233
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,685
-[groans]
-What would you like to ask?

234
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,938
[chuckles] We'll start
with the younger officer.

235
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,150
Him?

236
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,028
-Han River.
-[dumbbells thud]

237
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,197
Make sure you do well, Han River.

238
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,282
Han River.

239
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,702
-[grunts]
-At ease.

240
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,415
-Do a good job, okay?
-[Jisoo] Yes, sir.

241
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,252
[laughs] Hey, Dujin.

242
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:22,343
It's all right, man.
You can't beat youth, man. [laughs]

243
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,932
You just can't win against
someone who's young.

244
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,935
[laughs]

245
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,230
[slurps]

246
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,483
Here comes the superstar.

247
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,109
[peppy music concludes]

248
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,488
-Han River.
-Hey, young blood.

249
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,574
How about we go out for a drink
to celebrate your TV debut?

250
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,700
[Jisoo] Sounds good, sir.

251
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,162
So I guess you enjoyed eating with me.
You remember, right?

252
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,998
Yes, but I won't be drinking.

253
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,668
Where's the fun
in that when we're not having eel today?

254
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,838
Can we invite Corporal Do, then?

255
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,591
Well, Corporal Do is a bit--

256
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,469
Let's just call her.
She worked with us today.

257
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,557
Should we, then? Should I?

258
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,893
[dial tone ringing]

259
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:17,231
Hello? Corporal Do?
What are you doing after work today?

260
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,988
No need to explain yourself
in detail. Okay. Bye.

261
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,074
-So? Is she coming?
-She has plans.

262
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,034
Oh.

263
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,167
-[pensive music playing]
-[checkers clattering]

264
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,391
You crave love, don't you?

265
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,270
[scoffs] Love, my ass.

266
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,565
You're bitter because your mother
didn't love you enough.

267
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,735
Damn it.
Why the hell are you talking about my mom?

268
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,404
Sit up straight!

269
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,245
Unless you want your uncle to stab you.

270
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,131
You...

271
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:29,261
you want your uncle's approval.
Am I right or wrong?

272
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,724
Yeah.

273
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,269
-You're right.
-Don't worry.

274
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,313
This accident is just
the beginning for you.

275
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,733
-What?
-It's a blessing in disguise.

276
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,904
If you do a good job cleaning it up,
everything will go your way.

277
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,907
Do you mean it?

278
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:52,993
Of course.

279
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,497
Really?

280
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,917
Then what do I have to do?

281
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,045
[pensive music concludes]

282
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,422
Hey, aren't you hungry?
Man, I'm starving.

283
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,091
[cricket chirping]

284
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,968
-Lieutenant.
-Yes?

285
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,679
Can I just skip dinner
and go home?

286
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,013
Fine, go. I won't stop you.

287
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,974
-Yes, sir. Han River.
-[Chunseok] Han River.

288
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,434
-I'll see you-- [gasps] Oh, my god!
-I'm right on time, aren't I?

289
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,103
-Yes, you are.
-[chuckles]

290
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,607
-[chuckling] You said she had plans.
-It's a surprise.

291
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,651
Hey, weirdo. What's that?

292
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,195
I told her to pick up some meat
on the way.

293
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,613
-This must be heavy.
-It's fine.

294
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,365
Didn't you say you were going home?

295
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,951
How can I let Corporal Do carry this?

296
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,077
-I see.
-[Jisoo] Yes.

297
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,287
-Is that a sack of rice?
-It's huge, right?

298
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,876
I don't know about Sergeant Han,
but I knew you'd come.

299
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,378
[chuckles] Really?

300
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,463
How long were you carrying this?

301
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,048
-It's really heavy.
-Give it back, then.

302
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,508
-It's not heavy for me.
-No.

303
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,219
I can't let a woman carry this.

304
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,638
[chuckles softly]

305
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,392
-Corporal Kim.
-Yes?

306
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,021
I'd like you to treat me
as a colleague, not a woman.

307
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,816
Well, but... You're not a man.

308
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,402
Consider me a man, then.

309
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,576
Damn, she's cool. Wait for me!

310
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,288
What's wrong with you?

311
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,208
-Where on earth are we going?
-You have to try this restaurant.

312
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,418
[laughs]

313
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,092
-I invited him to dinner.
-You're the one who helped us earlier.

314
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,679
Hey, come on now.

315
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,848
-Let's go in. I'm starving.
-Come on.

316
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,850
[Chunseok] Come on, hurry. I'm hungry.

317
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,436
-[Nahee] Give the meat to me.
-[Jisoo] No, it's fine. I'll carry it.

318
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,610
[meat sizzles]
[meat sizzles]

319
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,906
[Chunseok] Let's eat.

320
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,741
-[Jisoo] Thank you.
-[Chunseok] Eat up, everyone.

321
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,994
-Do you scuba dive?
-Yes.

322
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,206
But it's pink...

323
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,208
Oh, that's his.

324
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,168
Real men wear pink.

325
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,965
That's right. Real men love pink.

326
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,219
-I don't like pink.
-You love pink.

327
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,845
Don't you see how pink this is?

328
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,556
-The meat is so good.
-[Chunseok] It is, right?

329
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:23,018
This place ages the meat so well.
Eat up, everyone.

330
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,561
It's good.

331
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,569
-Are you a meat lover?
-I like my mouth full of it.

332
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,657
That's the way it's done.

333
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,203
Sergeant Han seems
a bit different than usual.

334
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,621
Are they on bad terms?

335
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,747
-He seems different?
-Yes.

336
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,666
This must be
what you call a woman's intuition.

337
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,960
[Jisoo] Is there something between them?

338
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,419
[Nahee] What is it? Can you tell me?

339
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,130
[Chunseok] Those two hate each other.

340
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,841
[water gurgling]

341
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,680
Isn't it beautiful at night?

342
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,226
Stop trying to make small talk.

343
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:10,190
Why are you here? You left the force.
Why are you still wandering around here?

344
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,319
How could you come rescue people

345
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,614
when you couldn't even save
your own colleague?

346
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,994
Why?

347
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,123
Did you want to feel less guilty?
Is that it?

348
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,501
You're right.

349
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,546
Is that so wrong?

350
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,425
What? I dare you to say that again.

351
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,388
Let me ask you something too.

352
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,223
-Answer me! Damn it!
-[Chul] Tell me.

353
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,269
Do you want me to feel guilty forever
about letting your brother die?

354
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,190
Why? [scoffs] Do you deny it?

355
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,736
Then tell me everything
that happened that day.

356
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,495
You're a damn coward.

357
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,880
-[Chunseok] It's delicious, isn't it?
-[Nahee] It is.

358
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,882
-[meat sizzling]
-[Nahee] Whew, that's hot.

359
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,592
Slow down.

360
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,510
You need to eat lots of veggies with meat.

361
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,387
[Nahee] You told me
to eat more meat earlier.

362
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,306
Eat more veggies.

363
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,225
Where's Sergeant Han?

364
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,535
[pants]

365
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:53,001
[groans] How is he so fast?
Now where on earth did he go?

366
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,882
Oh, Sergeant...

367
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,441
[sighs]

368
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,052
HAN WONJIN

369
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,846
-[trainer] Hit it!
-[upbeat music playing]

370
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,395
-[grunts]
-[trainer grunts]

371
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,981
I'm using only one hand.
Go easy on me, man.

372
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,816
There they go again.

373
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,069
-[groans]
-[grunts] You didn't get me.

374
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,863
[Wonjin] Come on, go easy.

375
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,073
-He says you didn't get him.
-[Chunseok] Stop it.

376
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,325
[Wonjin] That's enough, guys.

377
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,118
-[breathes heavily, coughs]
-[upbeat music concludes]

378
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,369
You didn't get me.

379
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,790
-Your face nearly exploded just now.
-Stop it. I have news. Let's go drink.

380
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,334
-Are you buying?
-Yeah, hurry up.

381
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,294
-All right.
-You didn't get me.

382
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,796
Fine, fine.
God, you're so persistent.

383
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,673
-[Chunseok] Great job, everyone.
-[Dujin] Great job.

384
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,758
-Eunsook, hello.
-[Eunsook] Hey.

385
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,760
Hello. Have a seat.

386
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,928
-Sit here. [clears throat]
-[Dujin] I'll take my glass.

387
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,557
-Here's yours. Cheers.
-[chuckles, exhales softly]

388
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,184
-I have something to say.
-[Chunseok] What is it?

389
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,977
[emotional music playing]

390
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,273
We're getting married.

391
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,485
-[chuckles]
-Stop joking around.

392
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,236
-You and your jokes.
-Crazy.

393
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,072
-It's not funny.
-I'm not joking.

394
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,574
And we're going to have
the wedding as soon as possible.

395
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,910
What on earth are you saying?

396
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:54,122
It's just as he said. I'm going to make
an honest man out of him.

397
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,210
[crowd laughs]

398
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,879
-She--
-What? Did you say, "honest man"?

399
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,507
-No, you can't.
-Why not?

400
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,050
Chul.

401
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,221
-I'll make your little sister happy.
-Why would you do that?

402
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,599
Come on, they love each other.

403
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,143
Why would you make my sister happy?

404
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,853
I know, right?

405
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,189
[chuckles] I do understand
how Chul feels.

406
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:23,443
What are you talking about?
Wonjin is a decent man.

407
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:27,697
He's handsome and has a great personality.
He's perfect. I approve of this marriage.

408
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,535
-What about you, Dujin?
-I'm a little shocked right now.

409
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,204
-[sighs] This is crazy.
-[Chunseok] Let's just drink.

410
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,748
Why are you drinking water?
Aren't you good at drinking?

411
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:43,004
-Are you pregnant or something?
-[clears throat]

412
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,799
[exclaims]

413
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,551
Sorry, Chul.

414
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,846
[chuckles] Why would you apologize to him?

415
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,849
Wow, I'm so glad
I prepared a nutritious meal.

416
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,976
Oh, that's hot.
Eat as much as you want.

417
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,394
Thank you, Hyosun.

418
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,020
[Hyosun] This is a great day.
You should...

419
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,230
Are you seriously smiling?

420
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:01,982
Cheers.

421
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,402
-[Chul] I can't believe this.
-[Wonjin] Cheers.

422
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,822
[Hyosun] One, two, three.

423
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,378
-[emotional music concludes]
-[cricket chirping]

424
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,259
Stop hiding and come out.

425
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,930
Come on out.

426
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,519
[Nahee sighs]

427
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,320
Since you're here,
say hello to my brother.

428
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,410
[exhales]

429
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,206
You go to church?

430
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:06,171
-Hello, I'm your future sister-in-law.
-Stop that.

431
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,342
It must be hard
to have such a clueless brother.

432
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,260
-Hey, weirdo.
-See?

433
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,012
He's still not even
offering me a seat.

434
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,516
Gosh, my legs hurt.

435
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,102
-Sit here.
-[chuckles]

436
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,647
-Really?
-[Dujin] Come sit.

437
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:24,981
[Nahee] Yes, sir!

438
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,904
-I'll get going, Wonjin. Let's go.
-Already?

439
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,030
[Dujin] Yes.

440
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,575
Wait for me.

441
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,374
I saw that your nephew is really cute.

442
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,545
-[chuckles] His name is Han Jun.
-Jun.

443
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,589
I want to meet him.
Can you take me with you?

444
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,133
-When are you going to see him?
-Why should I take you?

445
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,304
-Do you even visit him often?
-I do.

446
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,269
Really? How tall is he?

447
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,274
-Come on. Tell me.
-Jun is...

448
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,485
about this tall?

449
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:16,575
Oh, well, I've never met him,

450
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,911
so I wouldn't know
if you were lying or not.

451
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:25,125
So, take me with you
when you go see him next time, okay?

452
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,460
Promise me.

453
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,590
Are you getting sassy with me?

454
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,967
When did I do that?

455
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,177
-I so did not.
-"I so did not?"

456
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,722
-[chuckles]
-You've lost it. Weirdo!

457
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,266
-Come here.
-[Nahee] No, hold on!

458
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,810
-Hey! [grunts] Hey!
-[screams]

459
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,105
Wow. [laughs] I'm not...

460
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,732
[Dujin] You're pretty fast.

461
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,693
-Wait for me.
-Come on.

462
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,575
[gentle music playing]

463
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,084
[doctor] Our last hope is this new drug.

464
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:12,964
But it's not covered by insurance,
so it'll be quite expensive.

465
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:40,241
Uncle Chul. Why do you all come see me
only when I'm sleeping?

466
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,787
Sorry, I'll come during the day next time.

467
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,375
Go back to sleep. I'm sorry.

468
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,050
[gentle music concludes]

469
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,246
[indistinct chatter]

470
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,377
Chul.

471
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,217
-Take this.
-You keep it.

472
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,052
I have no use for it anyway.

473
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:46,015
-You're not doing anything shady, are you?
-I'm not.

474
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,352
Are you sure? I'm worried.

475
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,939
I'm worried
that you might end up like him.

476
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,027
Don't worry about it.
Just take care of yourself.

477
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,572
A mom should be strong for her kid.

478
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,825
Focus on taking care of Jun.

479
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,828
I'll see you.

480
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,292
[breathes shakily]

481
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,545
[anchor] The Han River Business Division
has been dredging

482
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,881
the riverbed for the past two months

483
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:21,843
to add a bigger cruise ship
to their previous lineup.

484
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,096
However, when the River Ferry
passed by the juncture of the Han River...

485
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,473
-[clicks tongue]
-...and Anyangcheon,

486
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,807
the bottom of its bow got stuck...

487
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,809
-...in the river's sandbank.
-[sighs]

488
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,771
This all happened
because the administration made...

489
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,689
-Who's that guy?
-...hasty, performative decisions

490
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,191
for the Seoul mayor's reelection.

491
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,442
PARK DONGSIK
FISHING VILLAGE CHIEF

492
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,779
Who knows what kind of relationship
he has with that cruise ship company?

493
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,822
-[door knocking]
-[Dongsik] Look at what happened.

494
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,616
If he had followed proper procedures...

495
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,253
The matter is quite serious,
so you should stay in your office, sir.

496
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,964
And do what? Eat this garbage?

497
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,176
-Just think of it as campaigning.
-Get this out of my sight!

498
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,763
[sighs] It's making me lose my appetite.

499
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,224
Should I bring you a boxed lunch instead?

500
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,810
-With two pills for my digestion.
-Yes, sir.

501
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,274
Has Chairman Hwang called yet?

502
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,658
This is his third call.
Would you like to answer it?

503
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:27,867
CHAIRMAN HWANG MANDAE

504
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,413
They should have been aware
of the tide times...

505
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,873
-[Hwang sighs]
-...but some say

506
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,167
-they spent too much time at the stop...
-[dial tone ringing]

507
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,045
...missing the time
when the water was at its highest.

509
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,924
[anchor] They attempted
to salvage the River Ferry,

510
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,009
which became stranded
during its test drive.

511
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,137
However, due to the low water level
of the Han River...

512
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,598
-[pensive music playing]
-[remote controller thuds]

513
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,645
[sighs] These damn bastards.

514
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,858
They came running like dogs
when I gave them treats.

515
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,109
[chuckles] My God.

516
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,657
-[sighs]
-[lighter flicks]

517
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,579
[blows]

518
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:15,957
Director Go.

519
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,086
-Yes, sir.
-My nephew.

520
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,921
Yes, Uncle.

521
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,215
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

522
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,429
Do you think I made you a director...

523
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,974
-so you can light my cigarette?
-No, sir.

524
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,894
Can you tell me why
I still have to put up

525
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,646
-with all that crap?
-I'm sorry, sir.

526
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,025
[Hwang sighs]

527
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,447
[chuckles]

528
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,951
You know how important
this project is, right?

529
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,078
-I'm aware, sir.
-I will...

530
00:31:55,121 --> 00:32:00,168
thoroughly evaluate
if you are worthy of your position.

531
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,754
I'll take care of it, sir.

532
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,801
Sir, your phone...

533
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,806
Tell me. Should we go with
Doctor or Hitter?

534
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,644
Doctor is neat.
But Hitter will be painful and messy.

535
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:19,979
Right now...

536
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,398
I don't want anything neat.

537
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,865
How many times, sir?

538
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,619
Did you not hear him? Hit him
all the way to the ninth inning.

539
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,871
Yes, sir.

540
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:52,762
[groans]

541
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:02,730
[groans]

542
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,442
Look at him go.

543
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,448
[pensive music concludes]

544
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:17,286
CONGRATULATIONS ON SAILING

545
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:22,625
-[indistinct chatter]
-[instrumental music playing]

546
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,131
[Giseok] Hello, sir.

547
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,892
Director Go.

548
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,023
Hello, ma'am.

549
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,862
You're the one who invited me.
Should I not have come?

550
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,655
That's not what I said, ma'am.

551
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,949
Look around you.
How is this a celebration?

552
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:58,786
It's more like a funeral.
You should've canceled this.

553
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,540
The stock price dropped more than 13%.

554
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,544
Who is going
to be held responsible? [chuckles]

555
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,881
I hoped to meet the chairman,
but he isn't here.

556
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,632
Do you even have a plan?

557
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,510
It will be taken care of soon.

558
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:18,222
And when the Han River
First City Project begins,

559
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,266
all of you who hold preferred shares,

560
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,642
every single one of you

561
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,396
will be doubling your money.
Why in the world are you only seeing

562
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,941
what's right in front
of your eyes? [chuckles]

563
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,154
Please do not worry.

564
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,990
[giggles]

565
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,034
That's what you would say.

566
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,081
I need to hear this from the chairman.

567
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,627
-Where is he? When is--
-If you have something to say to him,

568
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,547
you can tell me.
I'll be in the corner upstairs.

569
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,041
[instrumental music fades]

570
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,646
-[Jisoo pants]
-[pants] Hey, wash your eyes.

571
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,609
-How does it look?
-I don't think we can do it right now.

572
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,528
Then do we have to dig up that riverbed?

573
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,280
Can't we just lift it?

574
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,866
That will damage the ship.

575
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,994
Why are you so concerned?
Let them deal with that.

576
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,706
Why are they trying to use
taxpayers' money to clean up their mess?

577
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,958
Maybe the higher-ups took bribes.

578
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,627
Times have changed,
so you should watch your mouth.

579
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,212
You'll get in trouble.

580
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,007
If the cruise ship tips over,

581
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,551
the parks near the Han River
will suffer damage.

582
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,469
And isn't the Han River public property?

583
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,763
It's our job to remove
all obstacles that may lead

584
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,265
to the citizens' discomfort

585
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,435
and to provide a safe environment
for the people.

586
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,854
-[sighs]
-Look at you and your silver tongue.

587
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,190
-I thought you were rapping.
-Don't change the subject.

588
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,151
-How deep is it stuck?
-It's not that serious.

589
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,612
If we dig up about a meter,
I think we can salvage it.

590
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,322
Really? Then let's leave it.

591
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,865
What?

592
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,534
Weren't you just saying
all that nonsense about saving the boat?

593
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,412
You said it's only a meter deep,
so if we wait until the spring tide,

594
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,456
it should come out on its own.

595
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,792
The cruise ship
is stuck deep in the sand,

596
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:56,756
so it won't be easy to dig it up.
But if we were to lift up the cruise ship,

597
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,966
-it might cause damage.
-What do you think they'll do?

598
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,802
[Chunseok] If you wait until
the spring tide...

599
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,804
-The man who's hoping to do nothing.
-...the water will rise.

600
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,640
-He will probably win.
-[Chunseok] When that happens,

601
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,183
the ship will pull itself out.

602
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,353
Okay, sounds good.
It makes sense if you think about it.

603
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,729
-Right?
-What?

604
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,064
-Spring tide?
-Yes.

605
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,150
When will that be?
And the water will just rise by itself?

606
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,986
Yes, the water will rise at least a meter.

607
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,156
-And after ten days...
-Ten days?

608
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,743
You want us to leave it there that long?
We're losing money here!

609
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:30,957
-Ten days is a bit... too long, right?
-Yes, indeed.

610
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,882

These are handmade shoes. Damn it.

[shoes scraping]

615
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,741
[Giseok] What on earth?
I never knew about this place.

616
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,202
It's beautiful.

617
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,080
I'll ask my uncle
to build me an office here.

618
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,505

619

620
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,183
-[Namki] How can I help you?
-Is Baek Chul here?

621
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,478
Hey, Baek Chul!

622
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,317
Hey, how dare you
speak so rudely to our boss!

623
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,529
Who the hell are you?

624
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,366
If you want to play ball,
go to the park and stop annoying me.

625
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,618
[chuckles] Play ball?

626
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,371
I'll use your head
for the ball. [chuckles]

627
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,666
-Damn it, you bastard.
-Namki.

-[chuckles]
-[grunts]

629
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,547
Let's keep going.

630
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:05,301
-Are you backing out?
-This one's a rude brat.

631
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,971
Are you crazy?

632
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,808
Hey. Stop acting like that here.

633
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,228
You're scaring them.

634
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,649
I told you not to act like that in public.

635
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:26,322
You're ruining the mood.
What the hell is wrong with you?

636
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:29,992
[chuckles softly]

637
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,163
Long time no see.

638

-[Giseok clears throat]
-[water gurgling]

639
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,758
I have another job for you.

640
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:52,181
It must be a big project,
seeing as how you came in person.

641
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,934
It's a very shady job.

642
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,604
In other words, you'll make a fortune.

643
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:02,650
-I told you, I'm done with those jobs.
-Hey.

644
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,820
Just because you want to quit

645
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,988
doesn't mean that you can.
I don't approve of that.

646
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,575
If you decide to quit
on your own... you'll get hurt.

647
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,578
[chuckles] Damn it.

648
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:21,168
Damn it, right? [laughs] Are you happy?

649
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,629
I'll give you money.
I'll give you a ton of money.

650
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,549
I know you need a lot.

651
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,937
This is the last time.
I'm never doing this again.

652
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,481
Damn, you're so boring.

653
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,360
Fine, this is the last job.
I won't come here again.

654
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,778
I won't.

Chunseok, the amount of water today
is just perfect.

[Chunseok] Really? [groans]

-It's raining, like you said.

-You didn't believe me, did you?
-No.

664
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,380
You answered that right away.

665
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,382
It's better than not responding, right?

666
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,967
[Chunseok] It is, but it's not nice.

667
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,720
You said there'd be a lot of calls,
but there are none.

00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,995
Hey, get closer!

676
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,458
Closer! No, this way!

677
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,836
A little bit closer!

678
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,257
All right, stop!

679
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:54,613
-[crane motor whirring]
-[crane beeps]

680
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,131
Follow me.

681
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,596
COLD STORAGE

682
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:28,939
This is it.

683
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:36,113
-[grunts] Damn.
-Hey.

684
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,408
Be careful, will you?
Hurry up and lift this.

685
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,290
[Giseok] God damn it,
it's pouring like hell.

686
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,293
-Hey, Doctor. Have you started?
-Yes, sir.

687
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,296
We're getting started.

688
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:55,174
[Giseok] I'm gonna press
these bastards to get it done fast,

689
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,384
-so be quick.
-Okay.

690
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,846
How long will it take?

691
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,558
-This is very rusty, so...
-That's not what I asked.

692
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,519
-I'll finish up soon.
-You have 30 minutes.

693
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,865
[grunts]

694
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:22,868
[exhales]

695
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:28,999
Move it.

696
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,460
Hey!

697
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,884
It's pouring rain out here.
Let's move faster.

698
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:46,600
HAN RIVER POLICE
SEOUL POLICE

699
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,363
[Jisoo] This way, Sergeant.
A little bit more.

700
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,324
Yes, we got it! [grunts]

701
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,302
[sighs]

702
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,731
HAN RIVER POLICE

703
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,611
-[officer 1] Thanks, guys.
-[Chunseok] Sure. Goodbye.

704
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,946
[pensive music concludes]

705
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,703
Wow, how did you recognize him?

706
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,329
Do you know him?

707
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,040
He was the cruise ship captain.
I saw him during the rescue operation.

708
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,917
[sirens wailing]

709
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,754
You have keen eyes.

710
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,214
It's a homicide case, right?

711
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,885
I think so, but we'll have to wait
for the autopsy report to be sure.

712
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,471
It's getting chilly, right?

713
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,390
Let's call it a day and go home. Come on.

714
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:16,064
[thunder rumbling]

715
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,985
What are you doing, you bastard?

716
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:23,614
He wants to leave quickly.
I'm soaked through to my underwear.

717
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,659
Namki. That's the last box.
Let's go quickly.

718
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:29,828

-[thunder rumbling]

720
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:44,343
-Did you see that?
-The lightning? Yeah.

721
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,428
-Is that weird?
-I'm not talking about that.

722
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,388
The stranded cruise ship over there.

723
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,265
What about it?

724
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,684
The operation to move it
is on hold, right?

725
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,353
[Chunseok] I think so.

726
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,772
Then why is a barge anchored next to it?

727
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,649
[Chunseok] Tell me about it.

728
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,025
[pensive music playing]

729
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,902
Chunseok, what are you doing?
Get closer to it.

730
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,779
Man, do we have to go?

731
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,865
-When in doubt...
-Go and check first.

732
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,370
Fine, let's go. Geez.

733
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,915
[boat engine revving]

734
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,482
[Hitter grunts, groans]

735
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,362
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

736
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,540
[Namki grunts]

737
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,921
Wow! What a glorious sight this is.

738
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:07,551
Do as you're told if you want your money.
Don't look at or touch anything.

739
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,344
Just follow my goddamn orders,

740
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,597
and don't cause any trouble, got it?

741
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,932
Hey, mister.

742
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,185
If we started a fight right now,
could you even stop us?

743
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,772
-We have more men.
-Do you have a death wish or what?

744
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,357
-[Namki grunts]
-Enough.

745
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,527
Why do you keep changing your mind?
What do you want us to do?

746
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,945
Are we going to keep doing this job?

747
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,824
If not, let's just get rid
of these bastards and take everything.

748
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,534
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

749
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,537
Yes, all that gold
is making me crazy, so what?

750
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:41,501
-[groans]
-Let's just go quietly.

751
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,088
-Okay?
-[groans]

752
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,758
[breathes heavily]

753
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:54,264
-Fish the box out.
-Okay.

754
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,392
[scoffs]
