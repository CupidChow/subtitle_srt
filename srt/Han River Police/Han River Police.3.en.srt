[boat horn blaring]

00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,338
[Dujin] What are they doing?

5
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,174
[Chunseok] They're obviously working.

6
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,884
In this weather?

7
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,677
But fishing has been suspended.

8
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,389
-Pull up.
-How about just a warning?

9
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,435
Stop glaring at me like that,
you're scaring me.

10
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,439
-Jisoo, get ready for some rain.
-[Jisoo] Yes, sir!

11
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,274
I have a hard time seeing in the rain.

[engine rumbling]

13
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,249
Why are you guys out
so early in this weather? Huh?

14
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,876
What's going on?

15
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,841
What's going on here?

16
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,887
I want to know what's going on!

17
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:37,931
Huh?

18
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,558
We just came out to catch a few fish.

19
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,602
Sorry for bothering you.
We'll wrap it up soon.

20
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,481
You know
fishing is prohibited around here.

21
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,151
You obviously don't want me here.
Tell me the truth and I'll leave.

22
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,945
What exactly were you doing?

23
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,780
Unloading the ship's cargo.

24
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,990
I get it. You're here to steal something.

25
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,408
We're here at the client's request.

26
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,369
We needed to retrieve some boxes.
We'll leave soon.

27
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,745
What is it?

28
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,831
Is that it?

29
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,750
What is this?

30
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,835
Don't.

31
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,087
I'm with the Han River Police.
Move.

32
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,256
You don't need to assist me.

33
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,674
Do you have a search warrant?

34
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,260
[chuckles]

35
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,555
Showing off that you're an ex-cop?
What did you say earlier?

36
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:19,973
You said you were fishing, right?

37
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:21,975
I can tell.

38
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,977
We're just investigating
illegal fishing activity.

39
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,020
So, please move, okay?

40
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,274
-Pull up the anchor. Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,112
I wonder what's inside.

42
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,906
What could possibly be
making you work in this rain?

43
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,285
Step aside.
Now I'm really curious.

44
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,828
Hey, open this.

45
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,124
[Dujin grunting]

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,294
[Ki-seok] Oh, come on!

47
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,172
I'm only taking what's mine!

48
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,716
What the hell's wrong with you people?

49
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,513
It's Kyungin River Cruise again.

50
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,141
God, it's you again?

51
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,941
Mr. Cop. Why?

52
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,986
Why do we keep running into each other?

53
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,613
Are you that curious?

54
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,533
-Put that down.
-Why do you want to know what's here?

55
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,494
-I said put that down.
-[Ki-seok] Why do you want to know?

56
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,746
[Dujin] I said put that down.

57
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,415
Why the hell do you want to know?

58
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,877
-Damn it.
-[Chunseok] Director Go! Please!

59
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,589
You came out to fish in such bad weather!

60
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,258
But I'm afraid fishing is prohibited here.

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,136
Well, would you look at those lobsters!

62
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,306
The weather is getting nasty,

63
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,726
so you'll have to wrap things up
and leave right away. Sorry about that.

64
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,978
Dujin, let's go.

65
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,731
-Come on, let's go.
-Use an umbrella. It's raining.

66
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,941

really necessary?

Yes. I'm sorry.

I'll put you on leave,

you've done for me.

Sorry, sir. Let's go.

-Dujin.

Will you tell me already?

-What?

What's the point of chasing him?
We couldn't find anything.

Dujin, I know you hate Chul,

00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,031
but you shouldn't bring
your personal feelings to work.

Then let's catch him and find out.

he's involved in.

This is the box he smashed.

Why leave them here
after all that trouble?

00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,025
It should be used with caution.

164
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,027
I said bring it!
Don't make me repeat myself.

165
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,540
[grunts]

166
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,711
It's a gift from a business partner.
I should try it. [chuckling]

167
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,716
[Ki-seok] Step aside.

168
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,093
That's enough. I'll bring them back.

169
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,514
[laughs]

170
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,391
Why didn't you say that earlier,
Mr. Baek?

171
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,435
But we're going in by ourselves.

172
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,772
That's horseshit.
You think I would allow that?

173
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,398
Move. I can't see him.

174
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,319
No? Okay, then.

175
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,700
He's going to die
because you ran your mouth.

176
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,080
Fine, then just shoot us all.

177
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,791
And have fun searching
the entire Han River.

178
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,003
I wonder how long that will take.
I'm sure your uncle will love that.

179
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,339
[gunshot]

180
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,883
Don't talk about my uncle, you bastard!

181
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,428
[Dujin] Stop!

182
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,265
Wasn't that a gunshot?

183
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,977
There are no guns in this country!
A tire must've exploded!

184
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,688
We've gone too far.
We can't respond to dispatches on time.

185
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,606
Okay. Let's look around
just a little more.

186
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,442
What's that building?

187
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,529
-[Chunseok] It's a flood pumping station.
-Let's check that out.

188
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,364
-[Chunseok] Yes, sir.
-[Jisoo] Jesus.

189
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:30,202
[bike engine rumbling]

190
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,874
-That cop is nearby.
-[breathes heavily]

191
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,167
It looks like he followed us here.
We'd better be careful.

192
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,670
That damn cop works too hard.

193
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,714
Go deal with it.

194
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,925
Yes, Boss.
But you must not use the gun again.

195
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,846
Good luck with the rest. We're taking off.

196
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,599
Let's hurry up and leave.

197
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,268
"Hurry"?

198
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,270
Not with that leg of his, you won't.

199
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,026
If you don't retrieve the goods,
everyone dies.

200
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,946
You can't sell them on your own anyway,
so don't get any ideas.

201
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,452
It costs a lot of money
to raise a kid, doesn't it?

202
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,458
Don't do anything stupid.

203
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,801
[laughs]

204
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,641
[gun cocks]

205
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,270
Bang!

206
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,940
[laughs]

207
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,492
[security officer] Can I help you?

208
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,203
We're the police.
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

209
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,414
-No.
-Have you seen anyone riding those?

210
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,792
-No.
-I'm sure it's here.

211
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,752
Dujin, I don't think it is. Let's go.

212
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,880
What are they working on in there?

213
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,716
The facility's having some issues,
so it's being repaired.

214
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,551
This is a flood pumping station, right?

215
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,929
It would be terrible if it broke down
after heavy rain.

216
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,223
-[security officer] Yes.
-I know they're here.

217
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,142
[man over wireless] <i>This is G1.</i>
<i>We have a jumper.</i>

218
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,519
-[Chunseok] Let's hurry up!
-[Jisoo] Let's go.

219
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,312
[man over wireless]<i> This is G1.</i>
<i>We have a jumper.</i>

220
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,065
<i>This is G1. We have a jumper.</i>

221
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,908
[birds chirping]

222
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,827
[indistinct chatter]

223
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,622
-[officer 1] Open the fish tank!
-[officer 2] Open it.

224
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,294
It stinks.

225
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,839
-Please check the floor.
-We will.

226
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,340
-Please scrape the floor.
-Hey.

227
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,468
You should check the floor first.
Why are you scraping the top?

228
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,055
Don't focus on that.
We're not fishing right now.

229
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,849
Dip the net as deep as possible.

230
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,980
[Ko Hyungmin] Go as deep as you can.

231
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,149
[officer 3] Keep searching.

232
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,153
Scrape the floor around the corners.

233
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,948
I don't think there's anything in here.

234
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,908
Do we have to keep going?

235
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,869
-Nothing?
-Nothing.

236
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,122
-[Ko Hyungmin] Stop.
-Okay. Stop.

237
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,875
Put the fish back in.

238
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,758
Sir... there's nothing there.

239
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,595
Have you looked thoroughly?

240
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,804
Yes.

241
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,016
I think the intel was bad.

242
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,228
Damn it.
Are we back to square one again?

243
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,856
You can check if you want.

244
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,654
[grunts]

245
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,243
-There's nothing in here…
-It just stinks like hell.

246
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,287
[Hyungmin] Watch your step
when you go down.

247
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,663
-It's slippery.
-[Jungchan] I will.

248
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,915
Hello, there.

249
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,170
Damn it.

250
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,010
Let me borrow that.

251
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,575
[worker] Search all you want.
You'll only find fish guts anyway.

252
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,669
[horn blaring in distance]

253
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,587
[worker] Gosh.

254
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:03,225
Gosh, I'm sorry about the fish.
I apologize.

255
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,064
Are you done here?

256
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,567
Thanks for cooperating.

257
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,779
-You touched the fish.
-[chuckles]

258
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,700
This is awkward.

259
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,875
What are you doing?

260
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,251
Damn it.

261
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,587
Sorry about that.

262
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,008
It looks like you'll need a bath.

263
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,551
Mind your business.

264
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,767
-Let's go.
-Let's go. Wrap it up.

265
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,187
-Let's wrap it up.
-[grunts]

266
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,108
Sir. There's blood…

267
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,781
Why would you wipe it on your…

268
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,581
Aw, that's disgusting.
He and I are total opposites.

269
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,883
Ew, you really stink, sir!

270
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,344
Is it the fish or my body?

271
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:25,265
Both! You need a bath.
There's a public bath right there.

272
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,977
-Hey, there are two public baths here.
-[Hyungmin] Yes.

273
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,147
Which one should I choose?
Which one would you use?

274
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,732
[sighs]

275
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,151
That one over there
seems a little newer.

276
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,737
I'd probably go to the newer one.
What about you?

277
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,572
-This one.
-[Hyungmin] Why this one?

278
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,783
There's a monthly membership.

279
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,911
Who pays for a monthly membership
at a public bath? [chuckles]

280
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,997
That guy.

281
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,964
I don't know, punk…
Those damn cops came to poke around.

282
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,173
You were right.

283
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:02,511
-Well, it's time to get clean.
-You're going to bathe?

284
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,887
Yes.

285
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,598
[Hyungmin] How did he know that?

286
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,308
That's amazing.

287
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,653
[screams]

288
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,948
[water gurgling]

289
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,662
-Why are you doing this?
-You know why.

290
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,706
What do you mean?

291
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,666
[groans] Wait, hold on!

292
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,173
[breathes heavily]

293
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,677
Cover your junk, you bastard.

294
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,435
Ready to talk now?

295
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,562
Yes.

296
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,856
Where did you drop off the goods?

297
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,233
What goods?

298
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,194
You saw it earlier,
there was only fish!

299
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,949
Wait! Wait! Hold on!

300
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,952
It's hot, damn it!
It's so hot!

301
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,788
Don't move! You can talk there…

302
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,790
I'll tell you everything.
Just talk from over there.

303
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,375
[breathes deeply]

304
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,506
Hey. I'll ask you one last time.

305
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,966
Where did you drop the goods?

306
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,262
What do you mean?
I just went fishing.

307
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,391
[Jungchan]<i> You didn't use your logbook.</i>
<i>You erased all the GPS data.</i>

308
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,226
And you don't remember anything.

309
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,770
Right.

310
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,526
Here.

311
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,488
I'll take this to recover
the deleted navigation records,

312
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,740
measure all of your crewmen's
blood alcohol levels,

313
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,535
and call immigration
to identify any undocumented workers.

314
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,872
Plus, I'll ask the Ministry of Oceans
and Fisheries to assess the ship's safety

315
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:57,042
and check if you received
safety training. Sounds good?

316
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,252
No.

317
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,134
Wait. Hold on. Palmi Island!

318
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,100
I docked at Palmi Island.

319
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,520
That is the most honest answer
you gave me today.

320
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,022
-About what you said earlier…
-What?

321
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,817
You mean the undocumented worker?
And safety assessments?

322
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,276
Yes.

323
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,529
They're already grilling everyone.

324
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,864
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

325
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:34,621
You bastard! Come back here!
God, it's cold! Damn it…

326
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,131
I found this in the car.

327
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,594
I was wondering why
you wanted to take a bath for once.

328
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,763
They switched the covers somewhere.

329
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,851
-Where?
-Palmi Island.

330
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,102
Where in Palmi Island?

331
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,021
That's for us to find out.

Great. We're working late again.

334
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,573
Sounds great.

335
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,658
What's wrong?
Not getting along with your wife?

336
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,077
We'd have to see each other
to not get along.

337
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,745
Nothing worse can happen.

338
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,956

Yes, this is Ko Hyungmin.

Yes. What?

342

Okay. Bye.

-Sir.
-What is it?

344
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,390
Jeon Kwangil was found dead.

345
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,726
The captain of the Kyungin River Cruise.

346
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,395
Damn it!

347
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,276
It's so wet.

[nurse] What happened?

353

We were out camping…

Boss.

357
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,427
You should have told me
that you hid the goods.

358
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,346
I actually fell for it. [chuckles]

359
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,140
Are we keeping them?

360
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,685
No.

361
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,813
What do you mean?

362
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,606
Don't tell me
we're just handing them over.

363
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,610
I'm going to the bathroom.

364
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,487

Hey, that jumper attempt was resolved.
Man, this is wearing me out.

369
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,441
Then we don't have to hurry back. Right?

370
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:52,986
Come on, Dujin!

371
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,865
-Go on.
-Okay.

372
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,713
[Chunseok] Hey, I'm sure there's nothing
worth looking at in here.

373
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:22,349
[grunting] I’m going to take a break.
Make it quick. Oh, my legs!

00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,310
Man…

375
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,316
Why do they have
two corporate registrations?

376
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,943
I guess they changed their corporate name.

377
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,740
Look right here.

378
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,535
"Kyungin River Logics."
Both have Palmi Island as their address.

379
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,329
They look like the same company.

380
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,291
I think it was
Kyungin River Cruise's subcontractor.

381
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,211
Wow, they used to rake in the dough!

382
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,963
But they're barely making
any money at the moment.

383
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:55,799
Auction…

384
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,759
How do you understand
those kinds of documents?

385
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,719
My dad is a tax accountant.

386
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,138
I used to help him
when I was in college.

387
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,518
But why would they change
the corporate name?

388
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,019
It's unusual, isn't it?

389
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,355
Kyungin might have changed
their subcontractor to a subsidiary.

390
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:14,150
Or maybe they had a rift
and gave the job to the lowest bidder.

391
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:18,947
Hey, then the director of that company
and Chul might have known each other.

392
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,122
This is the cruise ship route.

393
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,256
Palmi Island.

394
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,593
They wanted me to sell my family's land
on Palmi. I was already pissed

395
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,721
that a factory popped up
right next to the property.

396
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:47,183
Hold on. Maybe the cruise ship company
owns the factory as well.

397
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,859
Palmi Island… Those boxes… Chunseok.

398
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,485
Hey, don't even think about it.

399
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,320
I'm nervous that you're going
to stir up trouble again.

400
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,239
Those boxes might be related
to this island.

401
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,449
-Don't do it. Hey!
-Inside the boxes--

Oh, gosh.

408
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,375
I was in the Mangwon area as backup.
Then I saw your patrol boat.

409
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,753
So, I came to help.

410
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,632
I asked her to come.
I was worried you would make us late.

411

Aren't you glad she's here?

412

Let's go.

-Are you all right?
-Don't touch me.

We should go.

How she elbowed me?

I didn't do that.

We should get going.

420
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,498

00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,876
And replace those checks
with rolls of 50,000 won bills.

483
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,335
You got that?

484
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,840
Listen, Director.

485
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,551
If we're going to do this,
let's do it right.

486
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,844
What?

487
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,597
Let's be honest.
You're trying to bring back the investors

488
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,640
who were put off by the ship accident.

489
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,852
Then are you sure this will do it?

490
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,773
Won't it be nicer if it comes with logos
of government agencies or companies?

491
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,034
-An MOU?
-Now you're talking. [chuckles]

492
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,994
[both Laugh]

493
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,873
[man] It won't cost you anything,
so get started on those right away.

494
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,293
Then you can replace this IOU
with double the amount.

495
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,964
[both laugh]

496
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,558
-Corporal Do.
-Yes?

497
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,936
-Do you want some tea?
-Sure.

498
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,900
Are you in, Chief?

499
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,277
Is that how you greet your superior?

500
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,363
Of course I'm here.
That's why I called you over.

501
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:24,200
Come see me later, Corporal Do.
Chunseok and Dujin, come in.

502
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,451
Yes, sir.

503
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,709
[chief] Smuggling?

504
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:38,714
The captain who was being investigated
for smuggling was found dead.

505
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,385
There's a chance he was involved in
another smuggling case,

506
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,929
so you need our cooperation.
Is that it?

507
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:49,517
Wow. Lieutenant Lee understands
and summarizes the situation very well.

508
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,644
Is there any more information?

509
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,729
Not at the moment.

510
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,274
We're being asked to help
without much to go on.

511
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,402
You just want us to run errands for you.
Chief.

512
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,029
Could we handle the case
and share the results with them?

513
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,533
Dujin, we have
a more important job to do.

514
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,995
Saving lives.
Please, focus on that.

515
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,038
We can do both.
I'll take care of everything.

516
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,499
There you go again.
You've barely made up for your failure

517
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,001
with the cruise ship rescue operation.

518
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,919
And now you want to make another mess?

519
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,130
Just take them
to where the body was found.

520
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,424
Provide them
with any assistance they need.

521
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,009
-Punk.
-Yes, sir.

522
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,437
-Stop frowning.
-What?

523
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,064
-I said, stop frowning.
-[Dujin] You stop!

524
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,358
[boat engine rumbling]

525
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:48,617
Was the captain really killed
because he got mixed up in smuggling?

526
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,828
It's too early to tell.

527
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,081
We'll know once we find a motive.

528
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,374
I see.

529
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,294
-Get the security footage and examine it.
-Yes, sir.

530
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,756
He didn't die from drowning.

531
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,801
-Why bother asking if you won't listen?
-You have something to say?

532
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,055
Looking at the body,
you can tell he was beaten to death.

533
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,222
Isn't it obvious?

534
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,559
-This is killing me.
-Got it, thank you.

535
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,562
But I'm the kind of person
who needs to go over everything myself.

536
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,439
[Chunseok] Sure, go ahead!

537
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,776
Excuse me. Drop me off here, please.

538
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,528
[chief] Corporal Do.

539
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:28,115
Don't hang out with those guys
you ate lunch with earlier.

540
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,661
Dad. I'm not your daughter at work!

541
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,580
You little brat.

542
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,999
-You talking back to your dad?
-[screams]

543
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,335
That hurts! And I'm not a kid anymore!

544
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,629
Hey, wait a minute!

545
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,255
Are you wearing makeup?

546
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,717
It's just sunscreen.

547
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:50,012
And I'm 30 years old now.

548
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,598
You can't pinch my cheek
or check if I'm wearing makeup anymore!

549
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,893
See? You hung out with those idiots,
now you're acting like them.

550
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,061
You know what?

551
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,230
I will transfer you
to another location!

552
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:04,777
-Don't you dare. Then I will--
-What? What are you going to do?

553
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,363
[sighs] Forget it!

554
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,536
You've changed, you know that?

555
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,083
[chuckles]

556
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,210
I have to admit.

557
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,171
She's still my cutie-pie. [laughs]

558
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,218
Goodbye! Thanks for everything!

559
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,220
Give us a little push.

560
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,930
-Do I need to push it?
-[Jisoo] Yes.

561
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,851
[grunts]

562
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,772
[boat engine rumbling]

563
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,864
Does he think this is a taxi?

564
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,326
You know, the radio has been quiet today.

565
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,954
It's a good thing
that dispatch hasn't called in anything.

566
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,914
Right.
There haven't been any accidents…

567
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,626
Watch your mouth. Spit it out!
Come on, do it!

568
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,838
[Dujin] Spit if you don't want to
curse us!

569
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,799
God! You spat on me.

570
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,096
How long do we have to
escort him around?

571
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,601
Just drop me off near
Kyungin River Cruise and leave.

572
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,561
I need to have a talk with them.

573
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,812
[Jisoo] I guess he heard us.

574
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,482
He can hear us.

575
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,073
How deep is the Han River?

576
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,409
Well, actually…

577
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,578
It all depends.

578
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,580
Some areas are ten meters deep.

579
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:42,166
Some are too shallow
for ships to pass through.

580
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,501
You saw the news, right?

581
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,754
That cruise ship got stuck in a sandbank
and is currently docked.

582
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,881
It's because the water depth
is different everywhere.

583
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,634
-I'll go with him.
-[Chunseok] Hey, wait.

584
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,093
Weren't you the one complaining?

585
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,970
It's an investigation.

586
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,722
-I'll see you later.
-[Chunseok] All right.

587
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,015
Let's go.

588
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,353
What about us?

589
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,896
We'll just wait.

590
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,572
I don't know him.

591
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,326
Take another look and…

592
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,286
Then I'll suddenly recognize him?

593
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,039
-I don't know him.
-[scoffs]

594
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,124
You do know him.

595
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,502
You passed out while fighting him.

596
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,170
That's because you…

597
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,552
I don't recall anything.

598
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,640
Okay, then.

599
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,309
How many captains
are currently working here?

600
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,564
About two? Three? Four?

601
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,942
That's not that many,
yet you still don't recognize him?

602
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,320
[chuckles] It's not my job
to manage the captains.

603
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,656
Cut the crap.

604
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,450
What was in the boxes?

605
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,494
[breathes deeply]

606
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,955
You saw them yourself.

607
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,333
-Lobsters and king crabs.
-[scoffs]

608
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,712
You must think
we're a bunch of king crabs.

609
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,090
You're a funny guy.
You made all that fuss on the river

610
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,967
in the middle of the night
just to eat crabs?

611
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:19,805
I was really craving them.
But they all went bad

612
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,890
-because someone delayed us.
-[scoffs]

613
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,892
Where are those minions you were with?

614
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,646
Oh, please…

615
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,566
My neck hurts.

616
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,026
[Dujin] You'll probably say
you don't know again.

617
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,236
You're so distracting.
Why don't you take a seat?

618
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,447
No. We should get going.

619
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,617
I'll ask the rest of my questions
to your employees.

620
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,495
If I need your help again…

621
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:47,082
then I'll find someone
who knows more than you do.

622
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:48,834
Suit yourself.

623
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:55,507
This Park Chanho ball
doesn't look authentic. It's fake, right?

624
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,719
Or is it?

625
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,311
[sighs]

626
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,189
That crazy bastard.

627
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,196
What are you trying to do?

628
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,115
Did you think
he'd answer your questions?

629
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,951
Well, you won't get answers
by asking him politely.

630
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,246
These guys look down
on the police anyway.

631
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,539
They'll never answer you.

632
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,001
You have to shake
those bastards really hard

633
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,087
to get anything.

634
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,676
Still, I think we're a great team.
You agree, right?

635
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,552
You haven't done this in a while, right?

636
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,472
You look too excited.

637
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,519
Was it that obvious?

638
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,606
I think I can solve this

639
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,734
