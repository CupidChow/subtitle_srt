1
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,510
-She's not picking up?
-No.

2
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,805
She might be busy putting Jun to bed

3
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,432
or doing laundry or something.

4
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,434
What do you know?
You don't even have kids.

5
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,502
-I can't get out on this side.
-Come on, just try.

6
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,295
-You and your stupid parking.
-Oh!

7
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,756
Hey, this is the chief's car.
Did you just…

8
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,342
-Uh-oh.
-Oh, no.

9
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,804
Give it to me.
I'll take it to her. I can't…

10
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,764
Thanks.

11
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,432
- Damn it.
- I'll stay behind.

12
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,022
Why can't I…

13
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,643
What's taking him so long?

14
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,065
God damn it.

15
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,304
Did you watch
Kim Haseong's game yesterday?

16
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,640
I took a nap and missed it.
How was the game?

17
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,025
-Damn it. You scared me.
-How should I know?

18
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,402
I only watch Ryu Hyunjin's games.

19
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,697
We only have a few Koreans in the MLB.
You shouldn't be picky.

20
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,142
Get the hell away from that car,
you bastard!

21
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,978
Sorry, is this your dad's car?

22
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,709
Hey, get the hell out here!

23
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,717
I'm going to kill you, asshole.

24
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,226
Damn you, you idiot.

25
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,176
- You crazy bastards!
- Dujin!

26
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,929
- Dujin, Dujin.
- Hey, Chunseok.

27
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,181
-I'm okay.
-Eunsook!

28
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:08,933
Eunsook.

29
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,644
Eunsook!

30
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,942
Over here.

31
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,029
SHINJIN POLICE WILL MAKE
SHINJIN SAFE AND THE PEOPLE HAPPY

32
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,573
Why are you here?
You left like you'd never come back.

33
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,783
I came to see you. Here.

34
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,078
Man, just cut to the chase. What's up?

35
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,291
- How's Mr. Lee doing?
- Lee Jungchan?

36
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,251
He's working his butt off as usual.

37
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:41,549
Well… what case is he working on now?

38
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,386
You've never been interested
in any of his cases before.

39
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,265
But I don't know either.
You know he never tells us anything.

40
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:50,892
What's wrong?

41
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,102
This might be a stretch,

42
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,314
but I'm afraid
it might turn out like before.

43
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,399
Do you have a reason?

44
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,071
From a distance, I saw some red smoke.

45
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,115
I swear that's all I saw.

46
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,370
-Red smoke.
-So, it's about gold.

47
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,465
This footage
hasn't been copied, right?

48
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,217
No.

49
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,638
We'll take the hard drive as evidence.

50
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,264
SECURITY

51
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,266
I have to check with the director first.

52
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,648
You know this is a crime scene, right?

53
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,528
If I come in here with a warrant
and attract attention,

54
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,279
the director won't be too happy.

55
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,116
If the press finds out,
it'll be bad for the hospital too.

56
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,369
We'll take care of it…

57
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,664
discreetly.

58
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,293
Thank you.

59
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,556
So, the tip was right again?

60
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,890
Yeah.

61
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,018
-But…
-But?

62
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,812
Hold on.

63
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,741
Giseok sent you guys, right?

64
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,166
Hey, you. Come closer.

65
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,710
Come on.

66
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,754
I asked you a question. Talk!

67
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,554
So, do you know who Giseok is?

68
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,187
Thanks for your answer, morons.

69
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:08,279
This is how he's going to use me?
I hate cleaning up after other people.

70
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,281
What should I do with these guys?

71
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,284
- Take them away for now.
- What about you?

72
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,077
I've got to write up a contract.

73
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,038
Yes, sir.

74
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,421
DO NOT ENTER

75
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,349
Jun is a brave boy, so he'll be fine.

76
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,980
Of course he has to be fine,
otherwise you'll feel guilty!

77
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,607
Am I right?

78
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,693
You're a cop, Dujin.

79
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,489
Please hurry up and find Jun.

80
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:57,286
I can't live a single day without him.

81
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,207
If something happens to him,

82
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,292
-I'll--
-Eunsook.

83
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,587
I'll find Jun, no matter what.

84
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,090
I promise.

85
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,556
-Hey, Dujin. Damn it.
-Where are you going?

86
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,933
If I beat Director Go to a pulp,
he'll start talking!

87
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,061
-Are you sure?
-Didn't you know? He's one of them!

88
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,396
MINSOK VILLA BUILDING B

89
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,730
Hold on.

90
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,275
-What's the plan?
-Why are you holding me back?

91
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,859
Is it because they're not your family?

92
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,738
You bastard! I know you're upset,
but how can you say that to me?

93
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,365
They're not just your family!

94
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,618
Eunsook is like my little sister,
and Jun is like my son.

95
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,495
So stop spiraling!

96
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,003
And here's some advice.
Treat them better.

97
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,089
If you don't show them
that you care, they'll never know.

98
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,727
Damn it!

99
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,690
Can you calm down? I need to think.

100
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,293
Did they come in my dad's car?

101
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,799
Pink? That's not Dad's.

102
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,136
I've seen that somewhere.

103
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,724
-But it's pink…
-Real men wear pink.

104
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,023
-Then I heard a sound!
-That's right!

105
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,566
This is a total mess.

106
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,240
Have you calmed down?

107
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,745
Let's get this straight first, okay?

108
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,249
Let's assume that
Director Go is involved in this.

109
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,168
I told you he's involved.

110
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,171
Fine. Let's assume that he's involved.

111
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,133
Why would he kidnap Jun?

112
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,637
Hey.

113
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,598
Let's list what we know in order first.

114
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,434
A cruise ship company,
suffering from a loss in profit,

115
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,895
expanded its route despite the loss.

116
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,772
On the day of the test drive,

117
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,900
the cruise ship got stuck
and the captain was murdered.

118
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,860
He had a history of smuggling.

119
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,070
JEON KWANGIL, CAPTAIN

120
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,948
And after midnight,
Baek Chul and Director Go

121
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,742
secretly took something out
and ran away from us.

122
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,411
So?

123
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,622
Maybe things didn't go as planned
because we showed up.

124
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,499
They wouldn't kidnap
a cop's family for that.

125
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,794
They wouldn't.
That would be going too far.

126
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,004
The kidnapper
didn't demand anything either.

127
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,468
Maybe it's to blackmail
someone related to Jun.

128
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,011
My brother.

129
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,142
Baek Chul?

130
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,271
He…

131
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,316
he helped me and Jun out a lot
after my husband died.

132
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,486
And recently, he paid…

133
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,531
the overdue hospital bills for Jun.

134
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,324
It was a big amount.

135
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,618
He couldn't have gotten it
by normal means.

136
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,913
The amount was just too big.

137
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,500
Hey, now it all makes sense.

138
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,628
They planned to kidnap Eunsook and Jun
to make Chul do their bidding.

139
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,963
That makes sense.

140
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,090
Let's find Chul first.
I'm sure we'll find something.

141
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,426
-I'm here.
-Hey, Corporal Do.

142
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,179
-Didn't you call Jisoo?
-Am I not allowed to be here?

143
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,598
You are allowed, but I was just surprised.

144
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,266
What's wrong?

145
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,226
Take care of Eunsook.

146
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,729
-I'm fine.
-No, stay with her.

147
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,608
I have no one else to trust.

148
00:12:56,984 --> 00:13:00,029
Why can't you just say,
"You're the only one I trust?"

149
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,072
Go. I'll call Jisoo instead.

150
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,283
-I'll stay.
-Hey.

151
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,121
-Thanks.
-What? What did you say?

152
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,790
-He said, "Thank you."
-What?

153
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,334
He says, "Thank you." Good luck.

154
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,678
Why aren't you eating?
You don't like the food?

155
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,309
-Let's go.
-You should stay for more.

156
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,353
Do you want something else?

157
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:37,942
Yeah, let's stay longer.
We have some time left until the low tide.

158
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,110
We'll work better with a full stomach.

159
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,155
The bulgogi is really good.

160
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,950
Thank you.
Do you want more rice?

161
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,159
Yes, thank you.

162
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,252
I can do it.

163
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,254
Thank you.

164
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,802
Is Jun about five years old?

165
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,930
Yes, how do you know?

166
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,723
I saw him where the ashes…

167
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,061
of Sergeant Han's brother are.

168
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,399
I guess he at least visits his brother.

169
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,111
-Sorry?
-Never mind.

170
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,158
I think Sergeant Han visits Jun
as often as he visits his brother.

171
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,247
-Do you even visit him often?
-I do.

172
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,961
Really? How tall is he?

173
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,714
Jun is…

174
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,758
...about this tall?

175
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,431
It's what my father used to do.

176
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,852
He left for work before I was up
and came home after bedtime.

177
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,438
So, he always measured me
when I was sleeping.

178
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,190
That idiot.

179
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,902
Why does he visit Jun at night
instead of during the day?

180
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,612
It's not like he's guilty.

181
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:12,328
It seems like you know him
much better than I do.

182
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:25,507
He really adores his brother
and his family.

183
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,638
I had no idea.

184
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,641
He's that type of person.

185
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,523
You should leave. I'll be fine.

186
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,152
Please go help my Jun and Dujin.

187
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,530
Hurry.

188
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,212
Say something.

189
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,383
-The silence is killing me.
-I'm thinking of what to do.

190
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,970
Sergeant Han!
The case that Lee Jungchan is working on

191
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,388
is about gold.

192
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,226
Does this piss you off?

193
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,103
No, sir.

194
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,440
It does. You're pissed.

195
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,360
Why is the kid the only one here?
I told you to bring them both!

196
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,989
Look at me.
You didn't play baseball, did you?

197
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:34,034
-Yes.
-Does that mean you played or not?

198
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,704
I played baseball until high school.

199
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,958
-Are you certified?
-No. You can't be certified in baseball.

200
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,167
Why not?

201
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,381
Then what about Doctor? Is he certified?

202
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,592
Why are you comparing yourself to others?

203
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,887
You are just a dumbass…

204
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,308
Doctor.

205
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,748
He's so damn loud.

206
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,961
See that?

207
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,047
He's like a real doctor.

208
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,175
You dumbass.

209
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,975
GO GISEOK

210
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,331
Mr. Baek.

211
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,166
Did the Han River get rerouted
or something?

212
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,417
I'll be there soon.

213
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,252
Don't worry.

214
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,094
My goodness, Mr. Baek.

215
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,973
You must've forgotten your place
because I've been treating you well.

216
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:25,104
But I'm sick and tired of playing nice!
So, stop giving me an attitude.

217
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,064
And why should I worry?

218
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,524
You're the one who needs to worry.

219
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,651
I feel so damn bad for the kid.

220
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,487
He was stuck inside a hospital
and couldn't even go outside to play.

221
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,114
So…

222
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,492
I brought him with me
to help him get some fresh air.

223
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,620
If you touch even a hair on his head...

224
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,999
- I'll kill you.
- Hair?

225
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,794
Can I touch other things then?
He was being really loud.

226
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,131
-So, my guys put him to sleep.
-You bastard!

227
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,762
You know how to yell? Man, I had no idea.

228
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,683
It was so annoying to watch
you be all pretentious and serious.

229
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,476
Baek.

230
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,355
If you want to save the kid,
hurry up and get me the gold.

231
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,573
I'm sure he'll stop messing around...

232
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,159
and cough it up now.

233
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,244
Let's go get it.

234
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,832
Didn't the chairman ask you
to wrap it up quickly?

235
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,044
I'm going to do just that.
Do you disagree?

236
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,130
Do you think Baek Chul
will obey your orders?

237
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,716
Are you worried
that I might get played by him?

238
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,801
-It's not that…
-Then what?

239
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:42,181
The kid and our goods.
The cops caught on to both of them.

240
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,765
Don't you think it's too risky?

241
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,143
-It'd be wise to get rid of the trace…
-Doctor.

242
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,020
Yes, sir.

243
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,859
You're a smart guy, so you think too much.

244
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,072
-Thank you.
-That's not a compliment, you idiot.

245
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:00,824
Hey.

246
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,828
Listen. Listen.

247
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,789
It's so simple!

248
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,667
If we get rid of those bastards
after getting the goods,

249
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,504
everything will be solved! It's perfect!
Then my uncle,

250
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:18,175
the chairman, will finally recognize me.
He'll finally see I'm worthy!

251
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,636
Yes, sir.

252
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,722
Don't argue with me anymore.
Bring the kid.

253
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,691
What are you doing?

254
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,495
I have to pull this off without a hitch.

261

you weren't trading stolen goods,
were you?

We don't deal with stolen goods.

You're trading stolen goods.

I'm telling you I'm not.

265
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,759
I heard rumors that
a big whale is trading something here.

266
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,513
I also heard Chairman Hwang is involved.

277

Let me in. We need to talk.

278
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:31,868
What's wrong?

279
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,205
Is someone in here?

280
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,380
- What's wrong with you?
- Just…

281
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,506
Give me a second.

282
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,716
No.

283
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,440
Hello.

284
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,864
What was that all about?
I thought you were with your boyfriend.

285
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,243
-You all know each other, right?
-Yeah.

286
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:17,330
-From the cruise ship incident.
-Did you come here to see Sergeant Han?

287
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,832
Yeah.

288
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,501
Let's go.

289
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,337
Get up.

290
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,549
I can't even get a break.

291
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,141
Hold on.

292
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,940
You forgot your bag.

293
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,070
Pink?

294
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,910
Real men wear pink.

295
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,085
Why do you only have one side though?

296
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,087
Did you lose the other?

297
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,134
Oh! It looks like you hurt your leg too.

298
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,179
Were you diving?

299
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,866
No!

300
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,570
I'll get going.

301
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,261
I'm sorry, Nahee.

302
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,044
What took you so long?

303
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,129
You must be the gatekeeper.

304
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,597
Damn it.

310
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,790
That's weird.

311
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,919
What the hell?

312
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,675
Looking for this?

313
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,303
What are you doing?

314
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,056
Here you go.

315
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,232
Let's go without a fight,
okay?

316
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,068
- What the hell?
- Where do you want it?

317
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,279
Top or bottom?

318
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,540
Let's go.

319
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,089
What are you doing?

320
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,564
Stop it!

321
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,941
That's enough!

322
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:05,530
Are you showing off your fighting skills?
Look at him panting! He's old now.

323
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,409
I'm not old.

324
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,204
Damn it, seriously.

325
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,427
Okay. What brings you all the way here?

326
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,388
Aren't you the one who made me come?

327
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,893
Are you implying
that I was testing you?

328
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,352
Is that right?

329
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,564
Didn't you?
I wouldn't be here if you didn't.

330
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,858
Fine.

331
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,528
If you thought this was a test,
you probably didn't come empty-handed.

332
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,907
May I ask you something first?

333
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,870
Madam Choi, the big whale
of the underground gold trade.

334
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,540
Is it possible that you're scared?

335
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,960
Don't be so arrogant. Cut to the chase.

336
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:04,881
All right.

337
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,553
Hwang Mandae's goods
have been imported successfully.

338
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,348
There was a problem along the way, though.

339
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,435
Why are you telling me to trade
with him if there's an issue?

340
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,148
Red smoke.

341
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:26,653
In the process of purifying gold,
toxic gas and red smoke are released.

342
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,905
Well, you know the story,
so I'll skip all that.

343
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,617
They changed the boxes on Palmi Island.

344
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,911
Yeonan Pier was just bait.

345
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,205
It's bold, but the main route
is the Han River.

346
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,042
No one was suspicious
because he used his cruise ship business.

347
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,586
I was also very surprised.

348
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,339
Your point?

349
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,300
Hwang Mandae.

350
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,220
In order to take over
the Han River development business,

351
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,138
he needs serious cash.

352
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,975
He's paying for the acquisition
in two days.

353
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,310
He has no choice but to trade with you.

354
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:04,774
Take advantage of this situation
and demand his smuggling route.

355
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,402
Then you'll be able to secure safety...

356
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,946
for your imports and exports.

357
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,256
Bring him in.

358
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,842
Let him in.

359
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,326
Dujin.

360
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,546
Do you really want to know?
What happened that day?

361
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,301
Go ahead.
You should've told me years ago, anyway.

362
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,190
Wonjin was a great cop.

363
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,402
He loved his job, and he was diligent.

364
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,660
He was really happy
after he got married to Eunsook.

365
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,537
- Jun, are you sleepy?
- And then they had Jun.

366
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,956
- Wow, look how sleepy you are.
- But…

367
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,793
Currently, instead of hoping for a cure,

368
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,545
it's better to maintain his condition
so it doesn't get worse.

369
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,423
HEEMANG GENERAL HOSPITAL

370
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,841
How could this happen?

371
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,345
How?

372
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,639
It's okay.

373
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,059
Aren't you ashamed to face Jun?

374
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,813
Yes. I am.

375
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,397
But…

376
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,025
we need money to keep Jun alive.

377
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,361
As long as Jun lives...

378
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,115
I don't care how much shame I feel.

379
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,951
There's still a line
you shouldn't cross, you bastard.

380
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,412
I won't ask for your help anymore.

381
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,333
-Just look away.
-How can a cop smuggle…

382
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:34,423
-Don't do it. I'll look for another way.
-I have to do this.

383
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,635
I already got paid.

384
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:43,599
-You crazy bastard. Have you lost it?
-What choice do I have?

385
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,478
-I can't even pay for his surgery.
-Be honest with me.

386
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,438
This isn't the first time, is it?

387
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,236
- I asked you a question!
- Hey, sorry we're a bit late.

388
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,572
Hey.

389
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,532
What's wrong?

390
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,617
This better be the end.

391
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,496
The end of what?

392
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,751
OFFICER OF THE YEAR
HAN WONJIN

393
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,170
"Han River Officer of the Year?"

394
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,381
Shame on you, you bastard.

395
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,217
What's with you?

396
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,892
Hey, Wonjin. What's wrong with Chul?

397
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,977
-What happened?
-It's nothing.

398
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,604
Talk to me, man.

399
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:46,078
-It's here.
-I think so too, but Wonjin…

400
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,294
This tank's nearly empty.
Let's get a new one.

401
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,338
It's fine. It won't take long.

402
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,414
Dujin.

403
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,124
Wonjin…

404
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,759
Wonjin!

405
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,095
Wonjin!

406
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,472
Wonjin!

407
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,058
What happened?

408
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:05,032
Jun is waiting for you! Wake up!

409
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,494
-That's enough.
-Damn it, don't tell me to stop!

410
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,622
I said that's enough, you bastard!

411
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,207
Damn it!

412
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,420
Wonjin!

413
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,588
Damn it.

414
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,591
Tell me. Tell me what happened!

415
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,595
- What happened? Tell me.
- I'm sorry.

416
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,681
I'm sorry, Dujin.

417
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:33,394
Damn it. Being sorry doesn't solve this!
Bring back my brother! Wonjin!

418
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,522
Wonjin, Wonjin!
Wonjin!

419
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:43,696
Wonjin! Wake up, wake up!

420
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,700
Wake up, damn it!

421
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:52,288
You all knew
Wonjin was smuggling goods.

422
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,875
You hated me
for helping him rather than stopping him.

423
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,543
I told you to shut up!

424
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,671
Get yourself together...

425
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,257
and face the facts.

426
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,051
Face the facts?

427
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:09,221
Face what?
Don't bullshit me. What about you?

428
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,476
What you did for Jun
put him in even more danger!

429
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,395
Can you just let me go?

430
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,399
We have to save Jun.
I'll turn myself in as soon as it's over.

431
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:25,863
Like hell you will. I'm going to save Jun.

432
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,964
Hello, I would like to request backup.

433
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,342
Backup?
I don't think we can help you.

434
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,345
- What?
- This is my case.

435
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,513
You guys are the backup.

436
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,932
All right.

437
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,269
Fine, go ahead and take all the credit.

438
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,360
Excuse me for taking the call.

439
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,822
Aren't you supposed to say that
before you pick up?

440
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,200
Also, why is this man here?

441
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,454
Why? Do you feel uncomfortable
sitting across from a cop?

442
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,999
-Is that what you're implying?
-I approve of his involvement.

443
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,963
If that's the case, sure.

444
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,925
He had quite an interesting story.

445
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,680
Chairman Hwang.

446
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:37,518
If you want to succeed,
you should learn how to keep a poker face.

447
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,187
Oh, come on.

448
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:43,190
Stop beating around the bush
and get on with it.

449
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,276
Director Go.

450
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,612
He's working very diligently
to ruin everything.

451
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,158
What kind of nonsense is this?
What do you want?

452
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,743
You trying to squeeze money out of me?
You want some?

453
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,872
Looking out for your family?

454
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,499
So, that's the way it is.

455
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:04,837
I can criticize my family,
but I can't allow others to do the same.

456
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,714
Isn't that right?

457
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,259
Also, do you even have evidence?

458
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,304
If you're just poking around...

459
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,309
I don't care who has your back.
I won't let it slide.

460
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,644
The cops are on your case.

461
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,688
It's only a matter of time
before they catch him.

462
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:26,108
So? Are you offering me help?

463
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,360
Who do you think I am?

464
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:32,948
-I can take care of this on my own.
-You must be quite confident.

465
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,409
Aren't you desperate for cash?

466
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,079
Are you threatening me?

467
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,957
What if I am?

468
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:49,840
I told you to keep a poker face.

469
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,427
I'm telling you
not to trust the politicians.

470
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,889
To keep their positions,
they won't hesitate to abandon

471
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,935
all their convictions.
I'm sure you know this very well.

472
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,731
You seem to be well aware
of where I stand.

473
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,943
Let's call it customer management.

474
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:14,532
All right, have fun selling your goods.

475
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,744
That's enough for today.

476
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:29,129
What do you want me to do?

477
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,969
If you make me turn around one more time,

478
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,431
I won't let it slide.

479
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,352
I understand.
Please tell me what you want.

480
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,152
Your smuggling route
using the cruise ship.

481
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,408
-How do you…
-Give it to me.

482
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,828
-And Director Go as well.
-...my God…

483
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,499
Hmm?

484
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,430
Hey, Jisoo.
How is your arm? Is it okay?

485
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,765
I'm at the barge office.

486
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,728
If you can't come, I can go with Chunseok.

487
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,814
Do you want to come?

488
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,317
Sure, okay.

489
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,279
Why would you tell him to come?
He's injured.

490
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,364
We're a team.
We should stick together.

491
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:43,078
-Actually, I should tell him not to come.
-It'd be weird if Jisoo came, right?

492
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:44,663
What do you mean?

493
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,624
-What?
-What?

494
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,959
I'm just worried
that Jisoo will get hurt again.

495
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,712
I mean, if Jisoo comes here,

496
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,798
-he'll find out about Wonjin.
-And?

497
00:43:56,717 --> 00:44:00,137
My job is to save Jun
and put all the smugglers behind bars.

498
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,432
-It's simple.
-Yeah, that's true.

499
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,185
You sure you're okay with that?

500
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,354
Everyone will find out
about what Wonjin did.

501
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,233
Let's think this through
and see what's best for Jun.

502
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,444
You want to cover it up?

503
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,488
Hey, I'm just saying.

504
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,283
-There's no need to…
-The truth will come out anyway.

505
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:25,245
I'd rather bring it to light myself
than let some stranger do it.

506
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,622
As for Jun...

507
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,124
I'll stay beside him.

508
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,632
Baek. Where are you?
Why aren't you coming?

509
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,550
I'll be right there.

510
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,896
-Shall we go now?
-Okay.

511
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,692
Let's go. Hey, come on.
This brings back memories, doesn't it?

512
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:58,487
- Memories, my ass.
- Are you still upset? Come on now.

513
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,960
We'll finish up the job.

514
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,087
I'm sorry.

515
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,718
