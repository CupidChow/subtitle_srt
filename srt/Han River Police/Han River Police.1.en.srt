-[intense music concludes]

Why are you doing this to me?

109
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,350
Say something!

110
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:25,356
-Those SWAT bastards actually shot me!
-My gosh… Can you believe this idiot?

111
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,902
It was a simulation training.
They're allowed to shoot rubber bullets.

112
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,573
It hurt so much! Look. Look here.
Chunseok got hit here as well and…

-I'm okay, sir.
-He says he's okay!

114
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,035
You said it hurt.

115
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,290
Even the broadcasting station
came to cover the drill,

116
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,710
and you single-handedly humiliated
the entire police force.

117
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:49,422
Are you happy now?
And aren't you a cop too?

118
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:54,510
-We're the Han River Police, right?
-Yes, we are the Han River Police.

119

Then how come we're just sidekicks
for a drill on the Han River?

120
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,517
It just feels so wrong and pathetic.
Isn't the Han River our jurisdiction?

[chuckles mockingly]
Are you talking back to me?

123
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:10,526
I'm disappointed in you too, Chief.
It's a drill on the Han River.

124
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,988
How could they tell the Han River Police
to play the terrorists?

125
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,198
Even if the order came down from HQ,

126
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,285
you should've said, "I'm sorry.
My men deserve better than that!"

127
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,288
-You should've stood up for us!

Chief, please calm down.

129
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,043
He inhaled too much smoke,
so he's out of it right now.

130
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,670
Yes, that seems to be the case.

131

Get this punk out of my sight
before he makes me even angrier.

132
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,760
Yes, sir. We will go on patrol now,
for your peace of mind.

133
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,428
-Attention, salute.
-Salute!

134
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,388
-Whatever. Just get out.
-Han River!

135
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,060
Get out!

136
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,444
[Han] I can't tell
if I'm a Han River Police officer

137
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,987
or a Han River sanitation worker.

138
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,115
This is on you. We're doing this
because you got us in trouble.

139
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,327
Ugh, seriously.

140
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,163
Oh, man, my back is about to go.
This is exhausting.

-Help!

143
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,217
-Should we just kill him?
-Hurry up and help him out.

144
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,760
[Jisoo] Please help me!

145
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,055
[Han] I have the worst subordinates.

146
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,766
-Hey, grab my hand. What the heck?
-Thank you.

147

-[grunts]
-I told you I wasn't kidding!

148
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:31,649
-You're both so annoying.
-I can't get him out. Try crawling out.

149
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,027
Chunseok, hurry up and help!
Come on. I'm stuck!

150
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,862
You should've started crawling
from the beginning.

151
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,699
-It won't work after you get stuck.
-Oh, man.

152
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,536
-[officer 1] This is so embarrassing.
-Go!

153
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,121
[Chunseok] Hey, wave your hands.

154
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,541
We are the Han River Police
who protect the clean Han River.

00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,078
HAN RIVER POLICE
SEOUL POLICE

166
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,716
[police siren wailing]

167
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,218
What? Why won't they stop?

168
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,970
-Chunseok, get closer.
-Okay.

169
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,434
Yacht Kyle! Stop the yacht.

170
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,687
Stop moving! Kyle!

171
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,358
Damn it. They aren't stopping.

172
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,445
Chunseok, block them off.

173
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,416
-Why aren't you stopping the yacht?
-Don't you dare touch it.

174
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,086
They're stopping.

175
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,134
-What are they doing?
-See? They're stuck in the fishing net.

176
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,888
-How did you know that?
-It's eel season right now.

177
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,057
-[gasps]
-[breathes heavily]

178
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,226
You're a veteran officer, indeed.

179
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,441
[upbeat music concludes]

180
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,777
Hey, Jisoo. Cut the fishing net behind it.

181
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,404
Don't. They got stuck
because they tried to run away,

182
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,697
so why bother?

183
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,451
Our jobs involve both crackdowns
and public service.

184
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,703
If they file a complaint,
the Chief will kill you.

185
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,749
-Are cops in the service industry now?
-Yes, didn't you know that?

186
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,294
Our fundamental job is to serve. Hey.

187
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,381
-What are you doing?
-You told me to cut the net.

188
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,343
Lift up that engine and cut it.
Where did your shirt go?

189
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,886
Put your clothes on!

190
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,347
-Hey, go check in on them.
-Okay.

191
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,982
Excuse me. This is the Han River Police.

192
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,442
You must be in a hurry.
You were going way too fast.

193
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,819
It's dangerous.

194
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,154
-[party guest 1] He's handsome.
-So you're a cop.

195
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,322
[party guest 2] You're right.

196
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,409
But why would you
chase us down like that? You scared me.

197
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,453
Even the yacht stopped
because it was so scared.

198
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,082
They said this one was expensive.
Damn it!

199
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,335
I should file a claim for damages.

200
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,880
That's up to you.
Could I see your license?

201
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,465
Do I look like the helmsman?

202
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,135
-Yes.
-Wrong. Wait. I'm not.

203
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,014
Honey, come here.

204
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,851
I guess you haven't seen her.
Look at her. She was behind the helm.

205
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,061
What are you saying?
He wants to see your license.

206
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,772
-He knows you were driving it.
-You seem very carefree,

207
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,567
but I'm busy,
so please give me both of your licenses.

208
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:06,196
Mr. Cop wants your license.
But it really wasn't me.

209
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,575
It wasn't me either, Mr. Cop.

210
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,499
[both laugh]

211
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,460
Look at him blushing.

212
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,046
[indistinct chatter]

213
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,340
-Come drink with us.
-[party guest 3] Let's hang out together.

214
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,884
-Let's drink together.
-My gosh!

215
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,639
Where are you going?
Man, you're wasted.

216
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,849
The Water-Related Leisure Activities
Safety Act prohibits

217
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,559
operating a vehicle
under the influence.

218
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,562
You can be fined five million won
or imprisoned for a year…

219
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:42,358
You're boring. Come on.
Come party with us…

220
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,403
-[cheers, laughs]
-[girls laugh]

221
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,989
-His hands are so fast! Wow!
-[party guest 3] What a man.

222
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,157
-Sergeant Han.
-[Han] Yes, sir.

223
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,909
-We have to move.
-[Han] Okay.

224
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,869
[Chunseok] We're leaving. Director Go.

225
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,872
This is your penalty charge notice.
Make sure you pay on time.

226
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,749
You'll be fined if it's overdue.

227
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,377
Don't operate the yacht.
I'll be right back. Han River!

228
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,297
-Put your drinks down.
-Where are you going, Mr. Cop?

229
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,968
[Han] Have a great time, Kyle.

230
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,389
If we just leave like this,
won't they run away?

231
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,765
They aren't going anywhere.

232
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,018
[whimsical music playing]

233
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,063
My key…

234
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,066
-I have his key.
-You and I make a great team.

235
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,945
HAN RIVER POLICE

236
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,453
HAN RIVER POLICE

237
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,165
-[whimsical music concludes]
-[traffic buzzing]

238
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:18,412
Things were quite chaotic yesterday.
The police couldn't even work together.

239
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,750
I thought you were talking
about the protest.

240
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,168
You had me startled there.

241
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,255
I'm really sorry about that,
Chairman Hwang.

242
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,216
No need. It's fine.

243
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,721
By the way,
about that fishing village chief,

244
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,347
you should keep him under control.

245
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,143
You don't want rumors going around
when you're launching a new business.

246
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,188
Maintaining a good image
is important, you know.

247
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,192
Yes, sir. I will pay more attention to it.

248
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,864
But honestly, I was quite surprised.

249
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,785
-By what?
-The route isn't even profitable,

250
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,704
and you want to add
a bigger cruise ship there.

251
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:06,460
[laughs]
I'm only following the mayor's grand plan.

252
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,171
"The Renaissance of the Han River.
The Lifeline of Seoul."

253
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,882
What is the Han River
without cruise ships?

254
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,259
We should maintain them
even if we are in the red.

255
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,511
Thanks to you,

256
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,597
the city budget is being used
to scrape the bottom of the river.

257
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,684
So, your massive cruise ship
can sail without a problem.

258
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,103
[chuckles]

259
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,648
I heard you're acquiring business rights
to Han River First City too.

260
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,526
At this rate, every business
involving the Han River

261
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:35,155
will fall into your hands,
Chairman Hwang. [laughs]

262
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:40,536
But I heard the acquisition cost
and the compensation for land

263
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,872
are quite a hefty sum.
Wouldn't that be a problem?

264
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:49,503
And if the development gets delayed,
we won't be able to ensure

265
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,047
-the mayor's third term.
-[intense music playing]

266
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,091
-You are aware, right?
-Of course.

267
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,635
You don't have to worry.

268
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,889
With the support from the two of you,
everything will go smoothly.

269
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,684
-This is only the beginning.
-Of course.

270
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,812
How can we not support you
when you've treated us to this great meal?

271
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,230
[chuckles]

272
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,941
Treated you?

273
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:17,156
Anti-graft laws are strict these days,
so we'll split the bill. [chuckles]

274
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,204
Director Go.

275
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,665
Director Go!

276
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,289
-Please, open it.
-[clears throat]

277
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,096
Instead of this meal,

278
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,059
please accept these untraceable gifts
as a sign of my gratitude.

279
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:33,190
Chairman Hwang. You're quite the tease.

280
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,109
Tell me about it. I was completely fooled.

281
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,197
[both laugh]

282
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,242
[politician 1] Wow, look at these!

283
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,803
-[intense music concludes]
-[birds chirping]

284
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,434
[engine starting]

285
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,115
To hell with this shit.

286
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,284
I would've never imagined that

287
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,577
I'd still be groveling to people
at this age.

288
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,331
Listen. Don't be like me
when you're my age.

289
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,167
It's awful.

290
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,379
Then how about you let me take over,
so you can rest now…

291
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,508
Are you saying that I should buzz off now?

292
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,593
Do you want my position?

293
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,263
No, I'm just saying
you can relax a little now…

294
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,099
I'm sorry, sir.

295
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,436
You moron.

296
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,188
I only let you follow me around
because you're family.

297
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,568
-Do you think this position is yours?
-I'm sorry, Uncle.

298
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,362
-Again with that! Damn it.
-[intense music playing]

299
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,163
-I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.
-Damn it!

300
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,795
Give some money to the punk
who was protesting on the boat.

301
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,841
-Make sure I don't see him again, okay?
-Yes, sir.

302
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,786
[exhales heavily]

303
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,455
Why is it wrong to call
my uncle who he is?

304
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:58,043
Why can't I? Huh?
"Again with that"? Again with what?

305
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,128
[exhales heavily]

306
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,964
And his voice is crazy loud.

307
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,592
I almost wet myself. Damn it.

308
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,141
I should eat something nice and warm.

309
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,230
[engine starting]

310
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,318

HAN RIVER POLICE

312
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:29,866
Whew, that stinks.
Hey, did you not dry my suit?

313
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,412
You didn't dry yours?
The weather was nice yesterday.

314
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,831
Man, you're so selfish.

315
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,501
Tidying up your suits?
While you're at it, do mine too.

316
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:46,007
Man, yours is so dry and nice.
It smells like fabric softener.

317
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,135
It's because my sweat doesn't smell.

318
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,763
You never dive, so you never sweat.

319
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,183
Is there a way
to weasel out of diving today?

320
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,561
What are you saying?
We're off duty soon.

321
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:02,732
-[Jisoo] We have a drill today.
-We do? I don't remember hearing that.

322
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,777
Thanks to you, we're having
a disciplinary training session.

323
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:11,241
Yeah, we're getting punished too,
when you're the only one who deserves it.

324
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,034
We're a team, aren't we?

325
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,120
Han River Police officers
should train together.

326
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,373
I don't want to.
Can I please skip this one?

327
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,375
-[clicks tongue]
-No, you cannot.

328
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,002
-Han River.
-[Chief] Yeah, okay.

329
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,337
-Han River.
-Go to the training center now.

330
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,424
-Don't you dare skip.
-Okay.

331
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,721
I really don't wanna be surrounded by men.

332
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:36,016
There's a woman there. Corporal Do Nahee
from the Yichon Patrol Division.

333
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:39,102
She's not a woman, kid.
She's been in the army.

334
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,407
HAN RIVER POLICE AQUATICS CENTER

335
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:56,536
Was Corporal Do really in the army?

336
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,873
She was in the Marines.
The Ghostbusters, you know?

337
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,627
[slow music playing]

338
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,804
Striking as always.

339
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,265
[Nahee] Sergeant Han.

340
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,521
-What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?
-I got sick of wearing black.

341
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,940
So? How do I look?

342
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,275
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

343
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,902
Marines wear red.

344
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,074
[blows whistle] Everyone, gather around!

345
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,536
All right, I see
that you're all training hard. [laughs]

346
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:44,584
Hey, Do Nahee!
Your swimsuit is a bit too…

347
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,170
Don't you think
that red stands out too much?

348
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,215
-It's just a swimsuit.
-No, it's not.

349
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:54,302
Next time, make sure you wear black
and zip up!

350
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:02,477
Well, anyway, it must be exhausting
for you guys to train like this

351
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,397
-after working all day today, right?
-Yes, sir.

352
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:12,445
[laughs] Make sure to thank Sergeant Han
for providing this training opportunity.

353
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,701
But it'd be boring to just train
without a prize, right?

354
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,578
How about we hold a match

355
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,914
and allow the winning patrol division
to be exempt

356
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,208
from the next training?
How does that sound?

357
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,545
-Sounds great!
-[cheers]

358
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,672
-And Chunseok.
-Yes, sir?

359
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,216
-Aren't you going to train?
-I was.

360
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,468
Your hair is completely dry, though.

361
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,721
-It dried.
-Is your hair waterproof?

362
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,514
-[chuckles]
-Stop slacking off.

363
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,184
-Yes, sir.
-Anyway, do your best!

364
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,519
-[officers] Yes, sir!
-All right.

365
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,527
Hey.

366
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,621
-I have an important mission for you.
-What is it?

367
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,625
This guy is really sensitive.

368
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:12,297
-He's super ticklish.
-You want me to cheat? I refuse.

369
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,841
It's not cheating.
It's called strategizing.

370
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,719
-I'll buy you some eels.
-Freshwater ones, not saltwater.

371
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,429
Fine, I'll buy you freshwater ones.

372
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,972
-Let's play.
-[Chief blowing whistle]

373
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,100
-Okay, get ready! [blows whistle]
-[officers applaud]

374
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,763
[Chunseok] Look how quickly he came out.

375
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,640
-I'll show you how it's done.
-Yes.

376
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,434
That's all you've got? Geez.

377
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:29,207
-My ear infection must've gotten worse!
-Okay, just come up.

378
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,754
-Are you joking?
-What?

379
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,196
Hey, my ear infection just got worse.

380
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,574
What are you doing?
You even made me tickle him!

381
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,326
Are you really scolding me
when I'm in so much pain?

382
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,911
Oh, man…

383
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,062
[mumbles]

384
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,283
-[officer 1] Chunseok.
-Yes?

385
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,993
We should drag Sergeant Han out now.

386
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,412
Hey, a competition is a competition.
Just let him be.

387
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:54,250
-Corporal Do may pass out at this rate.
-It's fine, just let them be.

388
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,213
[mouths, mumbles]

389
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,013
[chuckles]

390
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,630
-[officer 1] Are you okay?
-[officer 2] Nahee, are you okay?

391
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:43,132
-[officer 3] Take off her goggles!
-[officer 4] Bring her this way.

392
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,884
[officer 5] Man, this is crazy.

393
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,973
[Han] What are you doing?
Are you insane? Damn it.

394
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,187
[coughs]

395
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,816
Hey, Nahee! Are you okay?

396
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,865
It's just a game, guys.
You don't have to try so hard.

397
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,158
-Are you okay?
-What's the score?

398
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,827
What's the score?

399
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,495
[Chief blowing whistle]

400
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:17,500
Look at you, Nahee.
It looks like you're about to die.

401
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:22,964
You must've really given it your all.
Yichon Patrol Division wins this match!

402
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,259
-Congratulations.
-Yes! [screams, cheers]

403
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,136
My gosh.

404
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,682
-What am I going to do with that clown?
-We won, we won!

405
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,476
Look at that weirdo.
I regret saving her.

406
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:37,979
Hey…

407
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,982
-Did you go into the water?
-I did.

408
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,152
I did, sir.

409
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,293
[indistinct chatter]

410
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,794
A new face?

411
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,049
Hardly. You've worked here
for three months now, right?

412
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,133
Yes, sir.

413
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,595
I thought welcoming parties
were always held at our place. I'm hurt.

414
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,014
It's because he can't drink.

415
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,975
Hey, why did you come today
when you can't even drink?

416
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,979
I wanted to have a meal with you guys,
and a drink too.

417
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,358
Lieutenant Lee said he'd buy me eels
if I beat my diving opponent.

418
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,571
Chunseok, why are you
a Han River Police officer

419
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,865
when you hate training so much?
Just quit!

420
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,452
Working in another department is awful.
I like it here.

421
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,371
We have regular work hours.

422
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,705
-And also…
-[both chuckle]

423
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,499
...I can enjoy my evenings.

424
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,669
And do you even know
how beautiful the Han River is?

425
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,004
There are lots of cities
with rivers in the world.

426
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,464
-Eat.
-[Chunseok] But not a single one

427
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,091
is as big and beautiful as our river.

428
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,009
-Eat.
-[Chunseok] It has a great nighttime view.

429
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,761
The park is nice too. Hey.

430
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,973
How can you be so focused on eating
when I'm talking right now?

431
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,393
Oh, hello!

432
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,353
-I was about to order more fish.
-Oh, you're here.

433
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,271
-Yes, hello.
-[Han] Hey.

434
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,649
Would you like more eels?

435
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,859
-[Jisoo] Yes. Yes.
-I'll cook them quickly.

436
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,949
You're eating all the eels.

437
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,451
You had some too earlier.

438
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,953
-I had one piece.
-Right.

439
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,039
You had one piece,
so technically, I didn't eat all the eels.

440
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:24,127
I apologize for saying that.
Then you ate most of it.

441
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,754
Yes, that's more like it.

442
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,760
You've gotta be kidding me. [chuckles]
Are all the kids like him these days?

443
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,387
Come on, just buy him some.

444
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,597
He works his butt off
when you're slacking.

445
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,850
-Eat up.
-Yes, sir.

446
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,768
I'll be right back.

447
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,980
-Where are you going?
-To smoke.

448
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,483
[crickets chirping]

449
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,322
[Dongsik]
Why do you smoke that thing?

450
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,868
-You want one of these?
-No, I'm trying to quit.

451
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,914
Do you have something against
that cruise ship company?

452
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,207
Why did you do that?

453
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,253
What about you?
You should've held back your temper.

454
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,591
-I could say the same thing to you.
-[chuckles] You think?

455
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,176
[both chuckle]

456
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,762
Those bastards.

457
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,599
They dug up the entire riverbed
for the new cruise ship

458
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,268
and destroyed all our fishing nets
in the process.

459
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:25,313
On top of that,
it's been hard to catch eels these days.

460
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,732
I hope those pricks get what they deserve.

461
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:31,569
-Just ask them for compensation.
-Speaking of, they did come see me.

462
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,616
That's great!
Then you're going to get paid, right?

463
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,203
I got tired of all this,

464
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,539
so I was going to take
the compensation and end it there.

465
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:47,210
But they suddenly wanted me to sell
my family's land on Palmi Island.

466
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,507
Palmi Island?
You own a piece of land there?

467
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,050
I didn't know you were rich.

468
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,844
I was already pissed
that a factory popped up

469
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,430
right next to the property. Hold on.

470
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,811
Maybe the cruise ship company
owns the factory as well.

471
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,687
[cellphone buzzing]

472
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,691
-It's my daughter. I'll get going.
-Okay.

473
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,276
-Goodbye.
-[Dongsik] Hello?

474
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:16,322
HAN RIVER MOONLIGHT

475
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,740
OPEN

476
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,909
It's time to go to the gym.

477
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,495
You still have some left.
Finish it before you go.

478
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:25,498
I'm sorry. It's my CrossFit day today,
so I can't miss out.

479
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:29,085
-Your life sounds exhausting.
-It's not that exhausting.

480
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:32,547
-I'm nothing compared to Sergeant Han.
-You already look better than him!

481
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,007
Don't try to be like him. He's crazy.

482
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,804
-Ta-da. [groans]
-Hey, Nahee.

483
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:45,726
[grunts] Wow, you're really here.

484
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,106
Look how wasted she is.
She must've drunk a lot.

485
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,693
Where were you? Why are you so drunk?

486
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,489
Whoa, look at you. You're totally wasted.

487
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,825
-You can't feel it?
-I can't.

488
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,411
I'm sure you felt it.
You touched me earlier.

489
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,496
Is this true, Sergeant Han?

490
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,584
Of course not.
Hey, don't give them the wrong idea.

491
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,086
Look at him denying it.
I guess it's not entirely false.

492
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,672
-Why are you siding with her?
-I'm all for you lovebirds.

493
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,340
-I'm against it.
-Me too.

494
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,385
-Aren't you going to the gym?
-Skipping one day won't kill me.

495
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:22,430
-I can enjoy my evenings, can't I?
-Are you mad?

496
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,850
-You scumbag.
-Did you just curse at me?

497
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,728
You did CPR on me!

498
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:33,399
-You touched me all over, like this.
-[Han chuckling]

499
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,443
CPR, my ass! Damn it.

500
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,987
-Are you cursing at me?
-Yes.

501
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,697
[blows air] Wow, you reek of alcohol.

502
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,782
-[blows raspberry]
-I didn't touch her.

503
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,701
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles]

504
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:44,869
It must be true.

505
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,872
-Yeah, you still have your hand on her.
-[Han] Hey, let go.

506
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,833
-Let go of me, you weirdo.
-[Nahee] No, no.

507
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,627
[chuckles, grunts]

508
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,102
Seriously, you weirdo.
Stand up, attention. Attention.

509
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:14,190
-You've totally lost it.
-Dujin. She's just drunk, that's all.

510
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,483
I just can't with her.

511
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,570
-[Chunseok] Where are you going?
-[Han] She's so weird!

512
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,741
[Jisoo] Corporal Do. Corporal Do!

513
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:28,746
Wow, she really is a weirdo.
Hey, help her up.

514
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,790
-[Nahee snoring]
-She's snoring, sir.

515
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,542
-[Chunseok] She's such a weirdo.
-[snores]

516
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,296
HAN RIVER MOONLIGHT

517
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,508
Finished cleaning up?
Man, my stomach burns.

518
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,220
-[coughs]
-I can clean up myself.

519
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,430
We're done. You should've told us earlier.

520
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,476
You got me.
I only said it out of courtesy. [chuckles]

521
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,729
I'm sorry you had to close so late today
because of us.

522
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,612
-[clock ticking]
-[sighs]

523
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,575
-Tell Baek Chul to drop by sometime.
-You miss him, don't you?

524
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,954
A little bit.

525
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,789
[Chunseok] Admit it, you miss him so much.

526
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,836
That coward.

527
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,301
Hey, you shouldn't call him
names like that.

528
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,053
Do you also call me names
when I'm not around?

529
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,433
You're not answering me,
so I guess you do.

530
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,976
Is that what I taught you?

531
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,273
Where are you going? Where are you going?

532
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,026
That's enough.

533
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,154
I understand why he's acting like that.

534
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,282
I mean, I do too.
But I should teach him a…

535
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,079
Hey, you're up.

536
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,959
-Han River.
-Han River.

537
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,422
-Good night.
-Are you okay?

538
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,179
Everyone's such a mess today.

539
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:11,807
I should really teach them
a lesson tomorrow.

540
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,101
-Gosh.
-[soft music playing]

541
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,229
[Chunseok] I'm worried about our division.

542
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,359
When did the Han River Patrol Division
start neglecting order and ranks…

543
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,740
[worker 1] A little bit more!

544
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,792
[soft music concludes]

545
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,017
[worker 1] It's time! You can stop!

546
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:59,271
-[Chul] I'll get down by myself!
-[worker 2] Okay. That's enough!

547
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,816
What are we having today?

548
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,984
[worker 2]
We're having jjajangmyeon today.

549
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,615
[sighs]

550
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,413
[sighs]

551
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,948
Chul, are we done
with digging up the riverbed?

552
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,826
What about the money?

553
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,582
[worker 1] We got half of it.

554
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:03,669
Just half, on our final day?
The money is on hold again?

555
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,963
Damn it, this has happened too many times.

556
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,466
Sir, we don't have any work
lined up after this.

557
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:10,885
I'll find work.

558
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,432
Are we not getting more of that project?

559
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,476
It pays the most.

560
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,438
Do you really want to take that job?
Stop talking about that.

561
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:27,735
-But still, we need some money coming in.
-I'm going to find work for us.

562
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,490
-Split the money into three and wire it.
-Okay.

563
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,660
-[exhales] I'll be right back.
-Are you off to the bank?

564
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,830
Don't withdraw all the money.
Leave some in your account.

565
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,708
How will you make ends meet
if you give it all away?

566
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,002
It's about time you live a normal…

567
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,340
I'll buy some ribs, so come back soon!

568
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,052
[Hwang] The float-out of the River Ferry
took place 20 years ago.

569
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,012
RIVER FERRY FLOAT-OUT CEREMONY

570
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,640
It reliably sailed
across the center of Seoul

571
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,099
every single day.

572
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,560
Kyungin River Cruise
is striving to develop

573
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:06,524
the gift of nature that is the Han River
into a complex theme park

574
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,776
where culture and tourism coexist,

575
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,488
and turning it into an attraction
that will represent Seoul.

576
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:18,494
We will now expand our route
from Dongjak Bridge and Seongsan Bridge

577
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,330
-to the Yellow Sea through the Ara Canal…
-[crowd cheering]

578
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:26,377
[Hwang] It is bigger and wider!
Making the Han River even better.

579
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:32,800
We have added a 1,500-ton cruise ship
that can accommodate 800 passengers,

580
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,512
allowing more citizens
to enjoy the experience.

581
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,264
-Welcome.
-Hello.

582
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,308
Welcome.

583
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:04,999
[host] Welcome.

584
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,586
What are you watching?

585
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,299
A cruise ship.
The new one weighs 1,500 tons.

586
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:18,721
-I find that so strange.
-What's strange about it?

587
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:22,766
They keep saying that operating
cruise ships is losing them money,

588
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,727
so why are they adding bigger ships?

589
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,396
Chunseok, is there anything
you don't know?

590
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,774
You should become a politician.
Maybe the mayor of the Han River.

591
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,528
-Actually, we should send you there.
-[Chunseok] What?

592
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,825
Well, my district is the Han River,
so I should receive a nomination here.

593
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,827
Do you even know what a nomination is?

594
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,747
-You're screwing with me, aren't you?
-What?

595
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,709
-You know what it is?
-You think I'm a joke, do you?

596
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:54,923
Oh… Didn't Corporal Do say
she's going on that cruise ship today?

597
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,635
Don't look at me.
I was drunk, so I don't know.

598
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,012
[foghorn blaring]

599
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,181
[upbeat music playing]

600
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,582
Look at the camera, come on.

601
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,459
Hurry up.

602
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,128
All right.

603
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,758
-You're here, so try to have some fun.
-Hyosun.

604
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:41,970
I'm not in the best condition to have fun.
I don't feel so…

605
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:49,186
-You should've stopped me.
-How could I have stopped you?

606
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,854
You were wasted
when you showed up, you weirdo.

607
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,232
Don't call me that.

608
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:57,444
Only… Sergeant Han can call me that.

609
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,781
[screams] I'm so embarrassed!

610
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:04,952
-You should've come with him, not me.
-He's on duty today.

611
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:09,123
You even memorized his schedule?
You're so devoted.

612
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:14,336
I'm so jealous that you don't like anyone.
It must be so easy.

613
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,547
-Who says I don't?
-[gasps]

614
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,299
You have someone? Who?

615
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:23,137
A man who is so much cooler
than Sergeant Han.

616
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,015
Come on, no one is cooler than him.
I don't think that man exists.

617
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,935
Are you serious?
No more free food for you from now on.

618
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:33,230
Hyosun, you know that…

619
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,733
I love you, right?

620
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,235
I don't know. [chuckles]

621
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,487
Come on, Hyosun.

622
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,117
-[indistinct chatter]
-[burps]

623
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,327
Gosh, I feel so much better now.

624
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,164
You brat, where are your manners?

625
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,668
Did it stink? Sorry.

626
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,921
-I could hear it as well.
-Come on, it wasn't that loud.

627
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,886
[burps]

628
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,474
Hey, at least look the other way
when you burp.

629
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,143
-Get a move on! We have to set sail!
-[suspenseful music playing]

630
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,023
Hey.

631
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,650
I'll throw you into the sea
if you drop that.

632
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,360
Hurry up!

633
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,157
-Unbelievable.
-[suspenseful music concludes]

634
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,369
Why aren't they telling us
when we'll start sailing?

635
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,707
[Chunseok] It's been three minutes
and 15 seconds.

636
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,084
-Drop the egg.
-Drop it!

637
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,629
[sniffs] Man, it smells good.

638
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,882
-[sniffs] That looks so delicious.
-[Chunseok] Good.

639
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,718
We can start eating in exactly 12 seconds.

640
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,011
[Han] It's 12 seconds.

641
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,684
-It's ready.
-Let's eat!

642
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,978
-All right, it's ready.
-Yes!

643
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,063
Let's see.

644
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,359
[slurps]

645
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,446
[exhales heavily, gasps]

646
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,533
It's so good!

647
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,829
When it comes to ramyeon,
you're the world's best chef.

648
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,706
You deserve five Michelin stars for this.

649
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,459
-It's delicious.
-I'm a pretty good ramyeon chef.

650
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,795
-You're not eating?
-I have my own food.

651
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,129
[Chunseok coughing]

652
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,340
-Suit yourself.
-I always cough when I eat ramyeon.

653
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,676
-Mm!
-[Han groans]

654
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,137
[Han] Do you want a mandu?

655
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,514
-I'm okay.
-[Han] All right, then.

656
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,391
[Chunseok] Hey, is that even good?

657
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,686
I eat it because it's healthy.

658
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,106
[munches] I think people... [slurps]

659
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:43,527
...who don't know the joy of eating
are somewhat twisted.

660
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,322
-I'm not twisted.
-I wasn't referring to you.

661
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,617
-But that's what you said.
-[Han] I heard it too.

662
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:51,743
[munches, clears throat]

663
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,511
The scenery is terrible.

664
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:12,806
Go that way.

665
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:17,019
We don't know
how deep the water is on that side.

666
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:20,689
The city spent money to dig up
the riverbed, so it's fine. Just go.

667
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:22,900
[suspenseful music playing]

668
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,661
[suspenseful music concludes]

669
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,622
It's delicious.

670
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,416
It's good. [chuckles]

671
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:43,253
-The food here is decent.
-I know, right? The vibe is good too.

675

-[machine beeping]
-What was that?

676
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,932
I think we scraped the riverbed.

677
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,475
Damn it.

678
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,269
Accelerate the ship and pull us out.

679
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,483
-[passenger 1] My gosh!
-[passenger 2] What in the world?

680
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,818
-[passenger 2] The ship is shaking.
-[dishes rattling]

681
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,865
Oh, no. What's happening?

682
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,793
[machine beeping]

683
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,087
Pull out!

684
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:35,681
What do we do?

685
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,313
[crowd clamors]

686
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,776
[groans]

687
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,036
-Nahee, are you okay?
-Hyosun! Call 9-1-1!

688
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,287
[Hyosun] Okay.

689
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,543
I'm a Han River Police officer!
Go upstairs to the second floor!

690
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,712
Everyone, go upstairs!

691
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,547
Upstairs!

692

-Go to the second floor! Hurry!
-[groans]

693
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,263
Hello? Is this the police?

694
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:20,434
I'm on a cruise ship on the Han River.
I think there's been an accident. Help!

695
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,312
You're both geniuses, aren't you?

696
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,814
[9-1-1 operator] This is G1,
Anyangcheon Joint Force.

697
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,566
There's been a cruise ship collision.

00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,693
-This is G1, Anyangcheon Joint Force.
-Hey, we got to go!

699
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,570
Don't tell me it's the River Ferry.

700
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,989
-I thought it was quiet for once.
-Get ready. Release the line.

[intense music playing]

705
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:05,896
Hey, that looks like big trouble.

706
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,026
Lieutenant,
what do we do with all those people?

707
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:14,654
Chunseok, get close to the ship. Hurry!

708
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,756
