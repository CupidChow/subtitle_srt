CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY

2
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,831
They look so different
without the lobsters.

3
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,167
It's still the same gold, isn't it?

4
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,795
You idiot.

5
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,800
The packaging is different.

6
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,011
Presentation is everything,
whether it's a person or a product.

7
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,306
Even the worst person
can be elevated by an impressive title.

8
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,351
Fine, be like that.

9
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,523
Come on, let's get moving!

10
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,774
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,227
HAN RIVER MOONLIGHT

12
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,444
Where do you get off being so moody
after what you did?

13
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,364
Hyosun.

14
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,700
Hey, listen!

15
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,952
Are you going crazy?

16
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,542
That's him, right?

17
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,044
The man you're in love with.

18
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,842
A so-called cop who has gone rogue.
What a disgrace.

19
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,052
Don't talk about him like that.

20
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,805
How can you possibly defend him
under these circumstances?

21
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,433
He and his gang attacked Sergeant Han.

22
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,102
-And me as well.
-That's not true.

23
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,896
I'm telling you, it's not.

24
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,441
Chul is not that kind of person.
There must've been a reason.

25
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,484
He's just not good at explaining things.

26
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,654
He's a fool, who carries
all his burdens by himself.

27
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,911
Do you think she'll be
in the mood to eat this?

28
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:27,123
It's all the more reason to eat.
She hasn't looked too great lately.

29
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,130
Damn it!
Hey, where did you hide it?

30
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,843
- What do you mean?
- What your husband stole!

31
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,762
I really have no idea!

32
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,513
You little--

33
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,849
MINSOK VILLA BUILDING B

34
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,896
You've done a great job.

35
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,690
From now on…

36
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,403
I'll keep doing it,
so stop bothering that family.

37
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,073
You'll hear from us.

38
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,013
Chul, please. This is wrong.

39
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,807
Don't do this.

40
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,560
Wonjin's son.

41
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,562
Someone has to save him.

42
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,565
Why does it have to be you?

43
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,402
-Who else is there?
-There's Dujin!

44
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:23,906
No, not him.

45
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,909
Why not?
I don't want you to do this either!

46
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,204
I hate that you're doing this!
No, don't do it!

47
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,791
I hate this.

48
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,960
I really do.

49
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,212
Don't say a word…

50
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,257
to Dujin about this.

51
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,749
SERGEANT HAN

52
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,921
Sergeant Han!

53
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,885
Lieutenant!

54
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,599
Sergeant! Lieutenant! Oh, no!

55
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,227
Sergeant Han! Lieutenant!

56
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,105
Sergeant! Are you all right?

57
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,689
HAN RIVER POLICE

58
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,318
-What happened?
-Did you see anyone else?

59
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,363
-No, just the two of you.
-I'm gonna kill those bastards!

60
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,156
Sergeant!

61
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,120
Can you stay still? It's very distracting.

62
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,331
How am I supposed to do that
when I'm so pissed?

63
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,916
Damn it, this is frustrating.

64
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,169
I'm so mad.

65
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,756
WEIRDO

66
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,758
-Man, why is she calling?
-Just answer it.

67
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,301
What did I tell you earlier?

68
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,638
It was actually her call
that helped me find you.

69
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,976
See? Everything happens for a reason.

70
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,273
Corporal Do!
This is Lieutenant Lee Chunseok.

71
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,191
Are you with him?

72
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,528
Yes. I'm with Dujin and Jisoo.

73
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,781
We're chasing someone,
but it's not looking good.

74
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,616
It's Baek Chul.

75
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,370
- Am I right?
- Hey, weirdo. How do you know that?

76
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,165
He came to see Hyosun.

77
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,126
- When?
- In the last hour or two.

78
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,795
Wait, that's before he retrieved the gold.

79
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,340
So gold is involved, right?

80
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:52,305
Hyosun said he would handle it on his own.
But then what about Jun?

81
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,516
We have to catch them in action
to prove the smuggling, right?

82
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,018
We can't just sit back.

83
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,438
Corporal Do, let's take it
one step at a time, okay?

84
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,484
Of course, we shouldn't slack off,
but we don't know where he went.

85
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,653
Then I'll go to the station
to see if there is a way.

86
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,821
All right.

87
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,908
Give it to me. Chul went alone, right?

88
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:18,372
Hey, Hyosun. Yes, he went alone.
Actually, he ran off on his own.

89
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,000
Then I'm sure he left a trace.

90
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,170
- I'm not sure.
- Please save him.

91
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,714
He hasn't been able
to move on since that day.

92
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,593
I want to help him live in the present.
Please help me.

93
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,931
I have to go.

94
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,355
Should we put in a request
to track their location?

95
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,650
That's a good idea,
but it'll take some time.

96
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,902
Then what do we do?

97
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,321
-Do we hire a hacker?
-God.

98
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:54,659
Come on, we're cops. Get a grip.
Have you lost your mind?

99
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:00,039
Hey, the tracker we put on the box.
That might still work.

100
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,167
Would he have left it there
if he knew about it?

101
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,627
Well, think about it.

102
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,505
Maybe he left it
because he wants us to track him.

103
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,840
Turn the app on.

104
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,051
You really think this will work?

105
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,932
-Hey, it's really working.
-See? It's working.

106
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,768
He's asking us
to clean up his mess, right?

107
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,852
Yes.

108
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,021
That bastard,
showing off until the very end.

109
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,856
Hey.

110
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,568
-Come on, let's hurry up.
-Yes, sir.

111
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,979
Man, is there a hole?

112
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,398
What's wrong with this?

113
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,066
Oh, hello.

114
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,360
-You're late.
-Yeah.

115
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,572
So…

116
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,450
do you want me to burn these guys?

117
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,995
All right. Here we go.

118
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,580
HYDROCHLORIC ACID

119
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,624
They are so heavy.

120
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,418
That was quite a workout.

121
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,992
Did you bring it?

122
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,869
-Let me see Jun.
-Show me the gold first.

123
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,372
If you want the gold,
you'll do what I say.

124
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:10,544
Playing hardball, again?
Your dedication always makes me cry.

125
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,672
Hey.

126
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,263
You bastards!

127
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,308
Don't worry, he's not dead.

128
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,853
I showed you the kid first.

129
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,023
Give me the gold.

130
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,572
First, I want to make sure
Jun leaves safely.

131
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,827
-Take Jun.
-You're really pissing me off!

132
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,787
You bastard!

133
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,892
-What are you doing?
-Driving. What do you think?

134
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,649
Who is that?

135
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,153
I swear, you'll be the death of me!

136
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,073
Hey, there are too many of them.
You got a plan?

137
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,533
A plan?

138
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,869
-Things never go as planned anyway.
-What?

139
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,913
-Let's just round them up!
-For God's sake, damn it.

140
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,089
Attention!

141
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,550
Don't you dare move, you bastards!

142
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,888
You're shameless!
We've got all the evidence here!

143
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,725
You've been caught red-handed,
and now, you're all under arrest!

144
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,482
Damn it, it's you again?

145
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,988
- Are you the Three Musketeers?
- God, he's smirking again.

146
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,074
What are you all doing?

147
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,660
-Kill them!
-Bring it on!

148
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,537
Stop right there, you bastards.

149
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,747
Don't move.

150
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,459
Now, guys. Let's all go quietly, okay?

151
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,378
-Do as I say.
-I'm taking mine out now.

152
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,256
Don't come any closer or I'll shoot.

153
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,592
-You hear me? I'll shoot!
-You little--

154
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,802
You asshole!

155
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,142
What's wrong with this?

156
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,190
Why can't they make this automatic?

157
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,364
Hey, Jisoo!

158
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,698
Damn it!

159
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,117
Hey, come and get me!
Jisoo, come here!

160
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,872
Damn you!

161
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,425
-Dujin! Chul needs help over there!
-What?

162
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,938
Come on, let's go!

163
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,189
Just kill them!

164
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,816
Hey, come here!

165
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,027
-Hey!
-Come here!

166
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,529
What are you throwing?

167
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,132
Hey, get him.

168
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,473
You bastards!

169
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,146
-Are you okay?
-Thanks.

170
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,651
Take care of Jun.

171
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:43,293
Stop! Everyone freeze! Don't move!
Stay where you are!

172
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,546
Hey, Jisoo! Our backup is here.

173
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,257
It's over for you guys. Drop your weapons.

174
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,467
Chul! Are you okay?

175
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,469
-I'm fine.
-Damn it!

176
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:56,140
-I'm okay. Get Jun.
-Damn it. Stop talking!

177
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,059
We need help here!

178
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:03,355
Drop the bag. Drop it!
I said drop the bag!

179
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,442
What the hell do you think you're doing?

180
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,321
- Cuff him.
- Let me go.

181
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,865
Stay still
or it's going to hurt.

182
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,074
Hey, over here!

183
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,537
-Get over here quickly!
-Hurry up!

184
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,665
Hang on to this one.

185
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,042
- Hey!
- Asshole!

186
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,961
-I'm fine.
-I told you to stop talking!

187
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,883
Thanks.

188
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,845
What?

189
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,265
Damn you. I said thank you!

190
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,478
What did you just say?

191
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,730
Stop talking.

192
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,523
Over here!

193
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,658
-Dujin.
-We need an ambulance here!

194
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,457
Uncle Dujin.

195
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,758
Hey, you! Yes, you!

196
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,095
Hey, behave yourself, or else.

197
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,141
Detective Jungchan,
how should we deal with them?

198
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,613
Hold on!

199
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,740
Follow me.

200
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,868
What are you doing?

201
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,456
Are you trying to take all the credit
when we did all the work?

202
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,875
We'll investigate,
and brief you on the results.

203
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,004
I'll come with you.
It's not a big deal. Hop in. Let's go.

204
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,507
Where's he going?

205
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,467
Who knows?

206
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,302
-Man.
-Damn it.

207
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,810
Can't one of you sit in the front?
It's cramped in here.

208
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,353
Shut up, you thug.

209
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,039
Hey, move. Make some room.

210
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:29,960
Hey, Chunseok.

211
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,004
Hey, where are you going?
We have to go to work.

212
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,422
I'm on my way to the HQ.

213
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,885
These guys are trying
to take all the credit.

214
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,846
Why did you tell them our location?
You're too polite.

215
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,274
Damn it.
He said he didn't give you the location.

216
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,948
You shouldn't have insisted on
getting in this cramped car.

217
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,076
Damn it, you're humiliating me
in front of this thug.

218
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,704
Well, it wouldn't be appropriate
to humiliate a cop, would it?

219
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,459
What are you doing?

220
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,710
Are you joking?

221
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,880
Tell me about it.
This whole situation is just so confusing.

222
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,966
Don't be confused.
I'm only doing the right thing.

223
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,720
-Hey, I'll see you when we get there.
-You're going nowhere.

224
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,973
You're only here because Uncle sent you,
so just do as you're told.

225
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,808
Why the hell would you point the gun…

226
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,521
Wait a minute. You're throwing me out?

227
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,276
What are you doing? You dick!

228
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,737
Shove it!

229
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,491
You bastard!

230
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,085
I thought you and I were the same.

231
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,629
-I guess I was wrong.
-No matter how bad things get,

232
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,006
we're no different from them
if we break the law!

233
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,252
Hey, thug. You have to wake up!

234
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,511
Come on, wake up!

235
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,731
Let's go.

236
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,477
Pull!

237
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,158
Come on!

238
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,079
Let's go!

239
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,672
-Jisoo! Get the fire extinguisher!
-Hey, what happened?

240
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,758
Why are there only two of them?

241
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,557
Hey, he's dead!

242
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,017
Did Go Giseok do this?

243
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,394
Go Giseok, that bastard.

244
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,023
Where did he go?

245
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,150
SECURITY CARD

246
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,405
What's this?

247
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,907
- What did they burn?
- Is this Spanish or what?

248
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,035
It says Kyungin River Cruise.
This looks important, right?

249
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,703
Dujin.

250
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,168
Jisoo, come on.

251
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,843
- Load them properly.
- Yes, sir.

252
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:57,185
KYUNGIN RIVER CRUISE

253
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,285
God, you scared me.

254
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,829
When did you get here?

255
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,539
Just now.

256
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,250
I'm sorry I'm late.

257
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,210
Nonsense.

258
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,005
We're family, right?

259
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,799
No need to apologize.

260
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,518
I used to be so scared of this noise.

261
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,608
But it was nothing.

262
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,325
Uncle.

263
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,370
You were really disappointed…

264
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,373
because I was late, right?

265
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,762
We checked everything,

266
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:17,182
but the quantity appears to be
a little less than was reported.

267
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,310
Great timing.

268
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,439
My nephew just brought in
the rest of it with him.

269
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,191
Let's all go together.

270
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,319
We're all family now, aren't we?

271
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,948
Come on, let's go.
Why don't we go, sir?

272
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,629
Where's Madam Choi?

273
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,297
She's already there.

274
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:13,113
Man, I'm getting tired in my old age.

275
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,950
Director Go.
Would you like to take over as chairman?

276
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,218
I knew it.

277
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,846
Even my mom didn't love me.
Why would my uncle love me?

278
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,183
-You! Are you just going to watch?
-Stay out of this. It's a family matter.

279
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,644
Damn it!

280
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,413
PARK SEUNGTAE
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

281
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,957
This bastard was a cop too.

282
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,673
Mr. Chairman.
Were you really going to screw me over?

283
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,218
No, of course, not. We're family.

284
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,970
You liar.

285
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,598
You won't even eat with me.

286
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:25,810
Did that hurt your feelings?
All right, I admit it.

287
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,272
I did push you
a little too hard, didn't I?

288
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,317
-When we wrap this up--
-Uncle!

289
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,110
Be honest with me.

290
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,321
To this day,
I've obeyed all your orders,

291
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,198
and I've always worked hard.

292
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,159
I brought all the gold.
How could you do this to me?

293
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,705
If I were your son…

294
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,584
-would you have done the same?
-My dear nephew.

295
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,796
Giseok. Please don't do this.

296
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,216
You wouldn't have, right?

297
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,079
No one's inside.

298
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,164
Is this the wrong place?

299
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,792
-Damn it.
-I don't think it's here. It's too quiet.

300
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,794
Tell me about it. Jeez.

301
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,297
Hey, Nahee.

302
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,551
It's impossible to track all the vehicles
that left the flood pumping station.

303
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,345
So, I traced it backwards
and I found a truck.

304
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,638
The car is…

305
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,183
a white Mighty QT.

306
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,394
Yes, we have one here.

307
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:50,979
Hey, weirdo.

308
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,940
Find all the Kyungin River Cruise ships
that used the river lock.

309
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,150
Okay.

310
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,735
Did you hear what he said?

311
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,319
Of course. I always recognize his voice.

312
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,238
Man.

313
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,823
That's just amazing.

314
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,783
There are too many ships.

315
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,035
How do I look for the right one?

316
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,414
I doubt they went out of their way
to make the deal.

317
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,916
The security card.

318
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,127
It must be that building
instead of this one.

319
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,421
Hey, weirdo! Come back us up here.

320
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,298
She's not going anywhere.

321
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,176
What are you doing,
running around and abandoning your post?

322
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,888
Chief, that's not what we're doing.
Well…

323
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,141
Stop making excuses. Get back in here!

324
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,895
Hey, Chief! Han River,
that's our jurisdiction, right?

325
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,023
We're chasing those who committed
a crime in this beautiful river.

326
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,358
Give us some time.
We'll come back after arresting them.

327
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,277
Are you joking?

328
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,405
Why would I joke about this, Chief?

329
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,866
If you would stop getting mad,
and send some backup,

330
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,326
we could make a big score, sir.

331
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,077
- Han Dujin!
- Han River!

332
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,163
-Don't pick up his calls.
-Good job. Let's go.

333
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,676
As a police officer, I'll make us proud.

334
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,680
What's with you? I never gave you orders
to go back them up.

335
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,063
Nahee! Hey, Nahee!

336
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,202
Damn it!

337
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,373
Attention, all patrol divisions.

338
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,179
-What brings you here?
-What do you think?

339
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,851
I'm here to make a deal.

340
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:03,278
- What about Chairman Hwang?
- He's not feeling well.

341
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,157
So, now, I'm the chairman.

342
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,960
This looks
like the place, right?

343
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,086
Yes.

344
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,170
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

345
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,839
Let's go once our backup gets here.

346
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,632
Fine.

347
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,344
Hey.

348
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,983
You can't go in.

349
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,235
He says we can't go in.

350
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,529
Why not? We're cops.
Get out of the way.

351
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,489
Outsiders aren't allowed in.

352
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:08,843
This bastard, turned out to be a cop.
Cute bastard.

353
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,972
It wasn't easy to get him on board.

354
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,309
-Sorry about that.
-It's fine.

355
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,436
We can find someone else.

356
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,023
The deal…

357
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,609
is off.

358
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,404
Why the hell are you leaving?

359
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,782
I brought the gold, didn't I?

360
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,535
So, let's make the exchange.
We have unfinished business.

361
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,413
Why would you leave
without making a deal? Why?

362
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,540
Was that a gunshot?

363
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,751
-What was that sound?
-You asshole!

364
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,296
-Get them! Stop them!
-You bastards!

365
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:51,886
The cops are here.

366
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,015
You brought cops with you.

367
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,939
You won't be trading with me anymore.

368
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,402
Damn it!

369
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,458
-Let's go!
-Stop them!

370
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,589
We should go.

371
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,181
- Hurry up and get them.
- Hey!

372
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,016
Get out of the way!

373
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,068
Damn it!

374
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,990
Hey, this way!

375
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,129
Catch them!

376
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,464
Get them!

377
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,347
- Hey, Jisoo.
- Yes, sir.

378
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,724
Nahee. Let's go that way.

379
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,817
Hey!

380
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,575
Stop right there!

381
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,993
Stop, asshole!

382
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,921
Stop! Stop, you bastard!

383
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,883
-Stop right there!
-Fuck you, asshole!

384
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,843
When I get you, you're dead.

385
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,606
Hey!

386
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,065
Stop the boat!

387
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,483
Get lost!

388
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,279
Go Giseok, you asshole!

389
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,324
-When I catch you, you'll be sorry!
-Go away!

390
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,626
- Damn it!
- Shit.

391
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,378
Get out of there, you bastard!

392
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,771
Damn prick!

393
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,076
Damn it.

394
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,502
You bastard.

395
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,051
Get up!

396
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,140
You bastard!

397
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,352
Stop chasing me, you piece of shit!

398
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,562
No way, you bastard!

399
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,553
An organization smuggling gold
in the Han River has been apprehended.

400
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,557
More than 80 billion won worth of gold
has been smuggled so far.

401
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,685
High-level government officials
are being investigated…

402
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,479
- We pulled that off.
- We did, right?

403
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,898
Well,
we found large amounts of gold…

404
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,483
Hey, that's our chief!

405
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:24,695
An incident like this
should not be tolerated.

406
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,863
Anyway,

407
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:30,743
we, the Han River Police, will keep on
protecting the Han River of Korea.

408
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,244
Han River!

409
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,831
We did all the hard work,
and he's taking the credit.

410
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,752
It looks like he's wearing makeup.

411
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:40,920
I think you're right.

412
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:43,923
Are you awake?

413
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,802
-Man, get that off, it's heavy.
-You're finally awake.

414
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,722
Too bad we couldn't let you die again.

415
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,101
What happened?

416
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,436
-Jisoo.
-Yes?

417
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:02,608
Thanks for saving me.
One day, I'll return the favor.

418
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,568
I didn't save you.

419
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,029
It was Lieutenant Lee.

420
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,657
-Who?
-Lieutenant Lee.

421
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,910
Hey, don't you know he can't swim?

422
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,413
- A Han River cop who can't swim.
- That's true.

423
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,498
But he really did.
Come on, say something.

424
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,251
You think I'm crazy?
Why would I save this idiot?

425
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,087
Have you seen him in the water
without a life vest?

426
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,089
You haven't, right? See? He can't swim.

427
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,299
By the way, where does it hurt? Here?

428
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,093
Are you okay?

429
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,719
Are you sure? Is it your side?

430
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,304
- Do you feel okay?
- It really hurts.

431
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,806
Are you crazy? Just go.

432
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,808
- Man--
- Hello, Eunsook.

433
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,185
- It looks like you're awake.
- Yes.

434
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,395
Hello, Eunsook.

435
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,988
-What about Jun?
-He's playing with the nurses.

436
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,242
This is all thanks to you.
Thank you so much.

437
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,910
It was nothing.

438
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,206
Eunsook, don't watch the news.

439
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,792
They'll be talking about Wonjin.

440
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,172
I can handle it. For Jun's sake.

441
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,593
Don't hate Wonjin too much.

442
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,804
I would've done the same if I were him.

443
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,392
- Uncle!
- Hey, Jun!

444
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,769
Ow, Jun.

445
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,526
-Does it hurt a lot, Uncle?
-No, it's fine.

446
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,487
Should we go see dinosaurs
when I'm better?

447
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,696
-Yes!
-Great.

448
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,993
But why are both of my uncles sick?

449
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,663
We'll get better soon.

450
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,584
Gosh, that hurts.

451
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,549
You look good.

452
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,267
Will you wait for me?

453
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,116
Hyosun…

454
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,453
I'm sorry.

455
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,065
Lieutenant,

456
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,609
"CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT"

457
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,068
Lee Chunseok is promoted to captain.

458
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,446
Captain Lee Chunseok!

459
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,325
Wear your cap properly.

460
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,492
Yes, sir.

461
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,164
Sergeant Han Dujin
is promoted to lieutenant.

462
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,085
Lieutenant Han Dujin!

463
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:51,587
Thank you, sir!

464
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,591
Okay, then.

465
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,596
Corporal Kim Jisoo
is promoted to sergeant.

466
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,849
Sergeant Kim Jisoo! Thank you, sir!

467
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,225
All right.

468
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,772
Thanks to all of you,

469
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:14,068
I was the headliner
on the prime time eight o'clock news.

470
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:18,030
And it felt really good.

471
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,077
It is important to continue protecting

472
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,037
the Han River.

473
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,748
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir!

474
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,625
Attention!

475
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,085
Salute to the Chief!

476
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,419
Han River!

477
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,046
Han River!

478
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:40,302
HAN RIVER POLICE STATION

479
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,565
Captain Lee Chunseok, looking sharp!

480
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,860
Hey, how dare you use my official rank
in such a careless manner.

481
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,154
You got promoted because of me.

482
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:02,324
Hey, I'm the man who saved your life.
So, don't get smart with me.

483
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,909
-Hey, rookie.
-Yes?

484
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,786
Are you sure you didn't save me?

485
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,329
Lieutenant Lee--

486
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,832
"Captain."

487
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,210
I mean, Captain Lee saved you.

488
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,840
What should we do all dressed up?

489
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,802
We should go on patrol.

490
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,554
- Patrol sounds nice.
- Patrol?

491
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,097
Dressed up like this?

492
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,515
-Follow me.
-Sounds good.

493
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,058
A drive? Okay.

494
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,022
I've been waiting for you all day.

495
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,357
- Yeah.
- Hey, weirdo.

496
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,567
Why are you here?

497
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:40,404
Lieutenant Han, you and I
are on the same boat now.

498
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:45,701
-Forget it. Hurry up and get out.
-I'll work with her if you'd like.

499
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,038
Are you crazy?

500
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,417
Attention! At ease! Get a grip!

501
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,627
No. I won't allow that!

502
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,297
Hey! You just said you won't allow that.

503
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:03,177
Hey, lovebirds. We're here to work.
Hey! Let's start patrolling.

504
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,054
-Jisoo, you can untie the ropes.
-Yes, sir.

505
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,891
He won't allow it!

506
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,097
