-[Jungchan] Where have you been?
-I thought I saw someone I knew.

00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,328
By the way,

00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,372
were you really waiting for me?

-We still have somewhere to go.
-Is it Palmi Island?

[Hitter] Should I work him over?

Shut your mouth!

18

Damn you, Hitter!
I told you to stay away from here!

19

did the captain's body float back up?

It sure is.

28
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,341
I got sweaty, and then I got wet from rain
and jumping in the water.

29
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,927
Man, this stinks.

30
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,805
I feel so happy
just sitting here like this.

31
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,600
Then you should ask
to be switched to another team.

32
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,852
You're always arguing with Sergeant Han.

33
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,438
-Don't you get tired of it?
-I do.

34
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,649
But he can't function without me.

35
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,484
Who else will keep him in line?

36
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,695
Oh, please. Even now,
you're waiting for him.

37
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,032
Hey, this is also part
of keeping him in line.

38
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:05,536
Man, this is all so touching.
To see you taking him under your wing.

39
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,665
Mind your own business
and stop badmouthing your colleague.

40
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,292
Did you just smack
a higher-ranking officer?

41
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,086
Happy you got promoted first?

42
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,588
You're setting a nice example
for the juniors, aren't you?

43
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,216
Throw this away.
The Han River is full of trash.

44
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,467
Let's go, Chunseok.

45
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,970
We should wait for Jisoo.
What's taking him so long?

Wow, this feels so cool and refreshing.

Well, I'm still deciding.

-Why are you so impatient?
-I'm sorry.

[Do Nahee]
One, two, three, four, five, six.

55
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,329
But there are just five of us.

56
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,624
Oh, one is for Sergeant Han.
He'll be here soon.

57
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,086
Why do you care so much
about Sergeant Han?

58
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,801
The look of sadness in his eyes.

59
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,594
Sergeant Han?

60
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,056
Are you sure we're talking
about the same person?

61
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,726
Not everyone can see it.

62
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,228
I'll let you pay.

63
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,232
-Hey, wait for me.
-Ma'am, you should pay for those.

64
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,151
It's okay, he'll pay.

-Hey!
-[Do Nahee] When did you get here?

67
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,703
It's been a while, Corporal Do.
So, you were transferred to this team?

68
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,246
Yes, sir.

69
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,332
You two know each other?

70
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,334
We worked together
before I transferred here.

71
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,710
[Chunseok] I see.

72
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,088
Wow, what a small world!

73
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,344
-You're going to Palmi Island?
-The chief said we should cooperate.

74
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,804
I know that, but are you sure
this wasn't your idea?

75
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,306
No, of course not.

76
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,808
I need to go check something.

77
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:57,106
But if we all go,
our jurisdiction won't be protected.

78
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,275
As far as I know,

79
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,362
our top priority
is saving lives, right?

80
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:07,533
The Han River shouldn't suddenly
be so unprotected and unsafe, you know.

81
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,701
-You're right.
-Of course.

82
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,952
I'll go on my own.

83
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,788
Well, you're a big part
of that protection.

84
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,208
-Fine, go ahead. We'll figure it out.
-I'll come with you!

85
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,667
Where do you think you're going?

86
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,836
He needs someone
to take turns driving.

87
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,338
I'll go with him.

88
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,300
Since you two are so competent,

89
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,969
I'm sure Yichon won't have
any problems without me, right?

90
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,306
-You have a point.
-I'll see you later.

-See you soon.
-I'll join them as well.

No, you can't.
Then who'd go into the water?

93
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,606
Did you find something?

94
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,734
Not much. It doesn't seem like
they used the bridge.

at the footage from different angles, but…

[Yoon Wongchul] Hello, Chairman Hwang!

Thank you for coming.

106
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,790
When you say it that way,
you make it sound like I'm the guest.

107
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,460
That'd be true if I were playing
the role of a host

108
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,795
waiting for a guest
without knowing when they'll arrive.

110
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,631
That's right.

111
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,095
But then again, a host should give
his guests a warm welcome.

112
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,764
-Isn't that right?
-Sure.

113

[Jungchan] Are cruise ships
operated like this too?

114
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,444
Yes, the same goes for all the ships
that pass through here.

115
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,448
It seems inconvenient
for anyone to come in here.

-[Do Nahee] What do you mean?
-[Jungchan] Never mind.

117

This might actually be safer.

118
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,414
-Because even I couldn't think of this.
-What's he talking about?

119
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,919
An MOU?

120
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,673
Why would you need something
that cannot be legally enforced?

121
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,842
Then there's nothing
to worry about, is there?

122
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:35,264
-Come on. You're playing games with me.
-Of course not. [laughs]

I'm just trying to keep up appearances.

124
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,728
After all, that business
isn't really mine.

125
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,813
It'll all count towards your legacy.

126
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,735
So, you want to attract more investors
by using me as bait, right?

127
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,488
-Essentially, yes.
-I see.

128
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,746
Fine. I'll do it.

129
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:03,417
But if you make one more mistake,

130
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,922
I'll cancel the MOU immediately
and sever all ties.

131
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,049
Of course.

but you came all this way.

Give it to me.

-We can go on our own.
-No, come on.

144
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,752
We should all go together.

145

You don't know this area.

00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:03,055
Hey. I'll throw you into the sea
if you drop that.

162
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,266
Hurry up!

163
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,892
Unbelievable.

164
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,978
You were the one moving the box.

165
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,855
-Wait.
-Do you know him?

166
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,898
I have some questions.

167
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,819
God, I had no idea you were cops.

168
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,404
Is this how you treat other people?

169
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,240
I thought those bastards were back.

170
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,200
What bastards?

171
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,494
They wanted to use the furnace
for a few days,

172
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,747
but after only paying half the money,
they disappeared.

173
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,082
What did they do with the furnace?

174
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,043
I don't know. I really don't.

175
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,296
-You sure you're not in on it?
-No, I'm not.

176
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,298
I wasn't even allowed
to get close, I swear!

177
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,632
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

178
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,634
Still, you must have seen something.

179
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,930
From a distance,
I could see some red smoke.

180
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,350
I swear, that's all I saw.

181
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,228
Red smoke? What's that?

182
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,277
[Choi] Please have a seat.

183
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,326
[grunts]

184
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,164
What brings you here?

185
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,513
Sudden visits can often cause
uncomfortable situations.

186
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,057
And today is no exception.

187
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,393
Four nines. One ton in total.

188
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,853
[chuckles]

189
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,980
Clearly, this weighs one kilogram.

190
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,899
My reputation, built on trust,

191
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,985
has made me the man I am today.

192
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,783
I'm listening.

193
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,496
I'm interested in trading the entire ton.

194
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,500
Have you forgotten?

195
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,670
To avoid disrupting the market,

196
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,256
we only trade up to 200 kg at a time.

197
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,424
Please make an exception this time.

198
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,845
And why would I do that?

199
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,347
Because I'm a regular.

200
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,225
[laughs]

201
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,980
Do you think we're running
a nonprofit here?

202
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,442
It's about money.

203
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,571
I need cash.

204
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,908
You're putting me in a tough spot.

205
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,379
I'll take it. One ton.

206
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,925
Don't try to fool me.
If you bring anything less than one ton,

207
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,346
you won't be able to trade
with us ever again.

208
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,599
Deal.

209
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,484
[Hyungmin grunting]

210
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,111
-Thank you.
-No problem.

211
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,406
This is a murder investigation, right?

212
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,787
If I have any information,
I'll let you know.

213
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,498
[Hyungmin] Um, sir? What's next?

214
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,833
[Jungchan] We'll go meet him.

215
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,502
Wait, already?

216
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,298
Let's go.

217
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,346
Hey, welcome back.

218
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,181
-Wow.
-It smells great in here!

219
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,433
-It's kimchi fried rice.
-[Do Nahee] Can I have some?

220
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,352
Sure. Have a seat.
It's almost done now.

221
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,854
Get comfortable. Didn't you guys eat yet?

222
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,356
We didn't have time.

223
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,401
-What's wrong? Eat up.
-Okay.

224
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,946
Late lunch, isn't it? Anything unusual?

225
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,073
No, sir. Just don't ever leave again.

226
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,076
Come on, Jisoo.
You're making me feel bad.

227
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,039
-Why? Did something happen?
-Everything is fine. Just eat.

228
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,043
It's obvious what happened.

229
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,337
You did all the diving jobs, right?

230
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,674
Look at him! He looks so exhausted.
You should go diving too.

231
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,550
That's enough. Any news?

232
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,011
Remember those boxes?

233
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,347
They all trace back to Palmi Island.

234
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,807
The lobsters?

235
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,227
There's something else in those boxes.

236
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,189
-Like what?
-Maybe gold?

237
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,566
That could be why
Team Leader Lee joined the case.

238
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,903
Hey, Corporal Do. You need to stop
hanging out with Dujin.

239
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,531
You're becoming like him.
You find everything suspicious.

240
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,159
Why would a successful company
bother smuggling gold

241
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,913
when it has its cruise business
and the Han River First City Project?

242
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,124
You're right.
It just doesn't make sense.

243

CHIEF'S OFFICE

244
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,547
It smells in here.
At least keep the door open while you eat.

245
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,885
Hey, Corporal Do.
Why are you here again?

246
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,262
I'm eating.

247
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,557
Is this like your favorite lunch spot,
where you have to eat every day?

248
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,769
It really is. Thanks for the food.
I'll keep you posted.

249
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,855
At least finish your lunch.

250
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,858
I told you not to hang out with them.
You little…

251
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,863
-What should you do after lunch?
-Go on patrol.

252
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,741
-Then get out there.
-But we're still eating.

253
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:19,038
I said, get out!
I can't bear to look at you guys.

254
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,584
-Keep eating.
-Sure thing.

[boat engine rumbling]

257
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,219
Should we find somewhere to hide?
We're just circling the same area.

258
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,430
Let's circle a bit more.

259
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,348
Whatever, I'm going back.

260

[Han] <i>We're here at the client's request.</i>
<i>A box fell into the water.</i>

261
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,520
<i>We'll leave soon.</i>

262
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,691
Sir, you've been on patrol
much longer than usual.

263
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,194
Hey, it's always been this long.

264
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,362
Fine, let's just get
to the cruise ship, then head back.

265
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,281
Just one quick turn over there.

266
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,242
-This is the last time.
-Sure.

267
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,631
Hey, stop!

268
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,841
-We should stop, sir.
-What is it?

269
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,178
[Han] The scuba tank fell into the water.
Jisoo, get your gear.

270
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,846
How did it fall in the water?

271
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,640
Hurry up. Get ready.

272
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,809
Yes, sir.

273
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,312
Why do I sense
that you're up to something?

274
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,943
Do you like going into the water
that much?

275
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,362
Why do you need that
to retrieve the scuba tank?

276
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,155
I'll just take a look down there.

277
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:39,451
Give that to me. I'm not giving it back
until you tell me the truth.

278
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,662
I just want to check
what's inside the boxes.

279
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,207
I feel so betrayed.
Are you hiding things from me now?

280
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,917
Would you have come if I told you?

281
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,585
-[Jisoo] Probably not.
-Were you in on this?

-Yes.
-[Han] Hey.

[Jisoo] No, no.

Which is it? Yes or no?

285
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,134
I just learned about it
when I was changing.

286
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,596
-Are you really going to stop us?
-You need to stop if you find lobsters.

287
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,182
I'll bring you a box of lobsters,
just wait.

Did you find anything?

We did, but they took it away.

Are you sure everything will go smoothly?

00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,576
Didn't I say it would?
The grandmother spirit told me.

482
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,371
Something earth-shattering will happen.

You should go.
I have another client waiting.

So, don't worry.

Huh? You look perfectly fine.

What? You wanted me to look dead?

I guess the chief tricked us.

Stop eating.
Late-night snacking makes you fat.

You'll get too heavy
to go back up on the bridge.

Did he get a lot of compensation
or something?

My daughter said
she'll never speak to me if I do it again.

00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,649
[chuckles] When was the last time
you listened to her?

510
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,360
Exactly.
You've never listened to her before.

From now on, I will.

I hope it gave you a new lease on life.

we'll just watch him sleep.

Why are you so eager
to see my nephew? Is he yours?

I think of your nephew as my own.
You don't visit often enough.

He keeps getting hospitalized,

I see.

614

Maybe Eunsook borrowed money
from someone?
