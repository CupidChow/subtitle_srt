1
00:00:34,504 --> 00:00:38,494

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,990

3
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:49,954
We got it.

4
00:00:49,954 --> 00:00:51,764
Let's move on to the next step.

5
00:00:51,764 --> 00:00:53,114
Next step?

6
00:00:53,114 --> 00:00:54,684
We need to find out

7
00:00:54,684 --> 00:00:57,194
who killed the Chief and why.

8
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:04,774
This place is not for just anyone to come in.

9
00:01:08,994 --> 00:01:11,124

10
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:16,324
Prosecutor General, congratulations.

11
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:19,614
- Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations.

12
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:22,324
Congratulations.

13
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:23,664
I just saw the announcement.

14
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:26,654
- Congratulations, Prosecutor General. 
 - Thank you.

15
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:31,344
Investigator, now is not a good time.

16
00:01:32,054 --> 00:01:33,694
- I look forward to working with you. 
 - Thank you.

17
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,194
Pardon?

18
00:01:36,684 --> 00:01:38,994

19
00:01:38,994 --> 00:01:44,594
Prosecutor Jin Jung, you're under arrest for the murder of Chief Lee Jang Won.

20
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:14,034

The record of vehicles in and out of the legal complex at the time of the incident.

21
00:02:14,964 --> 00:02:18,744

This is the testimonial of the eyewitness who saw you at the scene.

22
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:20,164
What I'm wondering is this.

23
00:02:20,164 --> 00:02:24,554
Why on earth did you murder the Chief, Prosecutor Jin?

24
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:26,714
The Chief was probably not so fond of you

25
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:30,704
for suspecting him as the culprit of a murder case.

26
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:32,304
Did you two have a fight?

27
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:35,074
The Chief's last phone call was made to you, Prosecutor Jin.

28
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:36,824
He said there was something he needed to tell me.

29
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,064
There's no way to confirm that.

30
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:40,174
There's a suspect for the murder.

31
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:41,964
But you don't have any evidence.

32
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,164
I could say the same to you.

33
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:48,854
Present a concrete evidence that I'm the murderer.

34
00:02:56,914 --> 00:02:59,194
This was found at your house.

35
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:01,354
The blood on the needle was confirmed to be the victim's.

36
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:04,254
Your fingerprints were found on the syringe.

37
00:03:04,254 --> 00:03:07,414
Hey. What are you doing?

38
00:03:09,894 --> 00:03:11,734
Who put you up to this?

39
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,064
What do you mean?

40
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:15,474
I'm saying, whose behind this?

41
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:21,164
Gosh. Think as you'd like.

42
00:03:28,014 --> 00:03:30,454
Give up, Prosecutor Jin.

43
00:03:30,454 --> 00:03:32,994
You can't get out of this.

44
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:34,554
I thought you only lacked conscience,

45
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:36,794
but you also lack brains.

46
00:03:36,794 --> 00:03:38,344
I told you last time, right?

47
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:41,564
That I'll bring people like you down.

48
00:03:41,564 --> 00:03:44,564
I wouldn't have even started if this was all it took to stop me.

49
00:03:44,564 --> 00:03:47,104
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say right now.

50
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:49,294
I'm going to dig and find out

51
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:52,404
who's trying to frame me and why

52
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:55,054
to the smallest detail...

53
00:03:55,054 --> 00:03:57,624
and get all of you locked up.

54
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:07,874

55
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:09,654

56
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:15,814
What brings you here?

57
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,934

58
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:27,704

59
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:30,164
Nonsense.

60
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:31,634
If you're done looking, can you leave?

61
00:04:31,634 --> 00:04:33,874
I have to prepare for prosecution.

62
00:04:35,124 --> 00:04:37,474
Are you going to prosecute as written here?

63
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:39,544
Is there a reason not to?

64
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:42,474
I don't know who the author is,

65
00:04:42,474 --> 00:04:45,304
but they went the extra mile to make Prosecutor Jin the main character.

66
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:47,344
It doesn't make sense! Why would he—

67
00:04:47,344 --> 00:04:50,364
Does it make sense for you to do this to me?

68
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:55,264
This is also an obstruction of the investigation, Prosecutor Shin.

69
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:57,634
Get out.

70
00:05:03,684 --> 00:05:06,494
I know that you treasure Prosecutor Jin.

71
00:05:08,394 --> 00:05:12,234
But you should still... be cautious this time.

72
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:14,284
I'm telling you this for your sake.

73
00:05:18,814 --> 00:05:21,434
You'd better be careful yourself.

74
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:25,104
Who the hell do you think you are to order me around?

75
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:33,754
Prosecutor! Are you okay?

76
00:05:33,754 --> 00:05:35,324
Yes.

77
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:37,894
You know the situation, right?

78
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:39,844
As things are, you're going to go down alone for sure.

79
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:42,514
Prosecutor Jin doesn't have a motive for murder.

80
00:05:42,514 --> 00:05:46,174
His movements after the incident are also far from that of a suspect.

81
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:49,164
I think these points will give us some advantages.

82
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:51,294
At trials, evidence take priority before testimonies.

83
00:05:51,294 --> 00:05:53,584
They'll be useless.

84
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:56,434
For now, you keep your mouth shut.

85
00:05:56,434 --> 00:06:00,644
We still have time until they press charges. I'll find a way somehow.

86
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:03,154
Based on what we know about Oh Do Hawn...

87
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,514
this isn't something he planned by himself.

88
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:08,014
There's clearly someone behind him.

89
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:10,084
What about Deputy Chief Kim Tae Ho?

90
00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:13,314
He became the Prosecutor General, right?

91
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,344
Deputy Chief?

92
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:16,374

93
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:17,414
 Try then.

94
00:06:17,414 --> 00:06:19,564
 If it's suspicious, it's right to investigate until the end.

95
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:22,334
 I'll take responsibility for whatever the outcome is...

96
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:25,554
 so you two do your best and focus on the investigation.

97
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:28,274
Deputy Chief always helped us, though.

98
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:35,114
He's probably related to the Chief's case.

99
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:38,554
The guy who wanted his death to stay as a suicide.

100
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:41,124
And that person framed you

101
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:44,494
so that you can't look into the case anymore?

102
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:47,274
There's probably the intention to cover up the case like this.

103
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,304
If I'm found guilty in court,

104
00:06:49,304 --> 00:06:51,784
there would be no reason to continue the investigation anyway.

105
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:56,384
Just like Kim Hyo Jun... of the Seocho-dong murder case?

106
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,654

107
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,934
Are you on your way out?

108
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:42,014
What is this?

109
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:47,634

110
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:53,444

111
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:59,534
I would like to confirm your claim

112
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:01,694
that you'll do anything, Prosecutor Oh.

113
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,400

114
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:14,944
 I'll look into who's behind Oh Do Hwan.

115
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:19,074
Thank you, but I'll keep your words only, not your help.

116
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:21,274
I'll look into it myself.

117
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:23,244
You'll do it, Prosecutor?

118
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:27,004
There's an ox bone soup place near the market, right?

119
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:29,324
Order me one ox bone soup, please.

120
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:31,634
A thick one for tomorrow morning.

121
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:38,044

122
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:40,284

123
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:43,994

124
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:56,744
Okay.

125
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:05,524
Come on, please undo the cuffs.

126
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:07,614
I need to eat.

127
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:11,754
Gosh...

128
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:17,414

129
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:20,294
The broth is thick.

130
00:09:21,864 --> 00:09:22,964
That's true.

131
00:09:22,964 --> 00:09:25,244
You wouldn't know even if something's hidden inside.

132
00:09:26,614 --> 00:09:28,354
What do you mean?

133
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:30,514
Something like a handcuff key?

134
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,294
Look.

135
00:09:33,294 --> 00:09:35,044
You can't see it at all.

136
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:39,084
Why bother...

137
00:09:40,154 --> 00:09:42,094
Please enjoy your meal.

138
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:08,814

139
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:20,254
What the heck?

140
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,154
Gosh, you're finally here.

141
00:10:26,154 --> 00:10:27,574
What's this?

142
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:29,624
Where are the handcuffs?

143
00:10:29,624 --> 00:10:31,664
Didn't you hear from Prosecutor Oh?

144
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,074
There was a misunderstanding.

145
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:37,394
- Please take care. 
 - One moment, Prosecutor.

146
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:39,474
We'll give one confirmation call first.

147
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:42,554
Why bother with a confirmation call? Go ahead.

148
00:10:51,804 --> 00:10:53,934
What is this sound?

149
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:58,804

150
00:11:04,584 --> 00:11:06,544
What's this? Hey.

151
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:15,184
Yes.

152
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:17,040
No!

153
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:20,994
Take care now.

154
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:23,794
- Wait, wait. My hand. 
 - The key!

155
00:11:54,374 --> 00:11:57,084

The key... Give me the key...

156
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:04,344
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:16,414 --> 00:12:17,904
Yes.

158
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:20,764
Okay, understood.

159
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:36,224

160
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:49,374

161
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,610

162
00:13:22,454 --> 00:13:24,584
Excuse me, excuse me!

163
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:26,994
Thank you.

164
00:13:26,994 --> 00:13:29,024
I'll open it for you next time.

165
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:34,484
Stop!

166
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:36,204
Geez, he scared me.

167
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:53,944
 Stop right there!

168
00:13:53,944 --> 00:13:55,684
 Get him!

169
00:13:57,124 --> 00:13:59,684
 Get him! Stop there!

170
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:02,984
 There he goes!

171
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:04,364
 Corner him!

172
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:06,544
 What are you doing?

173
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:09,094
 Stop!

174
00:14:09,094 --> 00:14:10,804
 Don't let him go!

175
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:18,084
 Follow him!

176
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:34,134
Lee Chul Ki speaking.

177
00:14:36,114 --> 00:14:39,604
Oh, no... Are you okay?

178
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:41,914
Yes.

179
00:14:43,184 --> 00:14:44,854
Yes.

180
00:14:44,854 --> 00:14:47,084
I'll be right there.

181
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:58,114
- Is it Prosecutor Jin? 
 - No!

182
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:01,444
How could that be?

183
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:04,074
It's definitely not Prosecutor Jin.

184
00:15:04,074 --> 00:15:06,534
Are you a robot?

185
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:08,674
Act properly if you're going to act or

186
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,784
answer the phone outside, man.

187
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:14,464
That one has some loose gears.

188
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:17,424
Get out.

189
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:18,934
It's distracting.

190
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:23,294
Get out, I said. You're distracting me!

191
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:24,994
Thank you.

192
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:38,794
Please come with us.

193
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,614
The police had already searched Prosecutor Jin's house...

194
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:46,994
You never know, though.

195
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:49,017
Perhaps something beneficial for Prosecutor Jin will come out.

196
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:51,267
Let's head on over first.

197
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:56,094
Hello, Manager.

198
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:58,564
 They said Prosecutor Jin disappeared.

199
00:15:58,564 --> 00:15:59,604
Sorry?

200
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:01,204

201
00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:09,894
Hello?

202
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:15,014
Yes, Prosecutor.

203
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:16,804
Are you on the way?

204
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:20,384
I'm sorry, Prosecutor.

205
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:22,554
I don't think I can come.

206
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:25,524
Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan is next to me! Please run away!

207
00:16:25,524 --> 00:16:27,374
Prosecutor Jin.

208
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:29,914
You're only adding years to your sentence. Stop now and turn yourself in.

209
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:31,564
I need to see the end of what I started.

210
00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:32,864
You're going to be caught anyway.

211
00:16:32,864 --> 00:16:34,774
You'll be the one getting caught, Prosecutor Oh.

212
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:36,404
Wait for me.

213
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:38,684
I'll come see you very soon.

214
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:48,454
Investigations will continue without restraint.

215
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:50,694
Leave your phone on at all times.

216
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:55,634
Focus on arresting Prosecutor Jin for a while.

217
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:57,244
Prosecutor General!

218
00:16:57,244 --> 00:17:01,644
- But Prosecutor Jin is— 
 - I know what you're going to say.

219
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:04,494
I'm on the same page as you.

220
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:06,004
However, Prosecutor Shin...

221
00:17:06,004 --> 00:17:08,754
you're a prosecutor, and I'm a prosecutor, too.

222
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:11,374
Sometimes there's a need to trust and follow the organization's decision.

223
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:14,574
Prioritize the organization's decision before the innocent person.

224
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:15,834
Is that what you're saying?

225
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,804
It's for Prosecutor Jin's own good.

226
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:21,874
I don't understand what it is that's good for Prosecutor Jin!

227
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:29,204
The press started to catch on.

228
00:17:29,204 --> 00:17:32,024
For now, I'm holding off the press for him.

229
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:35,334
Further down the road, no one knows what they're going to say about him.

230
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:41,754
It's right to solve a problem within, not outside, right?

231
00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:45,054
Follow my orders on this one.

232
00:17:45,054 --> 00:17:49,764
Also... when Prosecutor Jin contacts you, persuade him to return.

233
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:53,344
I'll do my best on my end as well.

234
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:55,284
Prosecutor General...

235
00:17:56,144 --> 00:17:58,414

236
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:02,384
You may leave.

237
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:53,824
Hyeon Gyu.

238
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:03,054
Tae Ho.

239
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:04,474
Yes.

240
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:08,964
I understand you're busy after becoming the Prosecutor General,

241
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:13,014
but you still need to clean up your home.

242
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,114
Let's do a good job, okay?

243
00:19:20,374 --> 00:19:22,374
Yes, CEO.

244
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:27,134
I've been thinking as to how I can help you.

245
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:29,474
These are some guys who are good to use,

246
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:32,744
so give them some seats and use them well.

247
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:37,314
The Anti-Corruption and the Public Investigation.

248
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:40,794
Those guys are exceptionally good with those things. They'll be helpful to you.

249
00:19:42,804 --> 00:19:45,424
CEO, this is still a little...

250
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:50,694
Is there a need for you to go this far?

251
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:53,104
I'm on your side, so why...

252
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:34,404
You just want me as a figurehead?

253
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:36,994
Damn...

254
00:20:39,324 --> 00:20:42,734
What about our internal and external CCTVs? Did they catch anything?

255
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:44,044
Nothing at all.

256
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:45,564
What about the reports from the police agency?

257
00:20:45,564 --> 00:20:47,494
Even something like a card transaction history.

258
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:49,134
Nothing from them yet.

259
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:52,724
Since things like cards are sure to be tracked down.

260
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:04,624
Investigator Park, there are people who work with Prosecutor Jin. A man and a woman.

261
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:06,699
Please do a background check on them and find their personal information.

262
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,729
- As soon as possible. 
 - Okay.

263
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:11,764
See you later.

264
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:24,574
Miss... Come on, what the heck is this? It's so unspeakable.

265
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:28,887
The Big Boss is going to cry if he sees this.

266
00:21:30,434 --> 00:21:32,694
It's fine. They're my brothers.

267
00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:41,444
Ms. Baek Eun Ji?

268
00:21:43,444 --> 00:21:46,684
I'm from the Prosecution. Please come with us.

269
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:50,124
Come on! Let go of this!

270
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:52,394
Let go of me and talk to me!

271
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,154
You need to tell me what's going on first!

272
00:21:55,154 --> 00:21:58,054
Prosecutor Jin told you to do this, didn't he?

273
00:21:58,054 --> 00:22:01,844
I-I'll walk on my own feet.

274
00:22:01,844 --> 00:22:03,674
Hey, get him!

275
00:22:03,674 --> 00:22:05,624
W-Wait, wait a minute. No...

276
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,984
You're here because of that, right? Last week...

277
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:11,899
T-The text messages that I hacked!

278
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,237
I apologize for using rough means.

279
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,760
The summons takes a long time, so...

280
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,320
Also, you two are not the type to come, even if I send the summons.

281
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:28,177
Let me introduce myself formally.

282
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:32,147
I'm Prosecutor Shin Ah Ra of Central District Prosecutors' Office Criminal Division 3.

283
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:38,317
Baek Eun Ji.

284
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:46,947
I'm Go Joong Do.

285
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:53,747
Okay.

286
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,777
Why did you need us?

287
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:58,537
Let me be brief and cut to the chase.

288
00:22:59,827 --> 00:23:04,587
Prosecutor Jin has been cornered as the suspected murderer of Chief Lee Jang Won.

289
00:23:04,587 --> 00:23:06,747
- What? 
 - What the...?

290
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:29,887
I told you that I'll come see you soon.

291
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:32,937
Who's the bastard that framed me?

292
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,997
Answer me.

293
00:23:36,997 --> 00:23:41,737
If you knew... What could you do if you knew?

294
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:46,367
A criminal being chased for murder allegations. That's who you are right now.

295
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:48,887
Also, didn't I tell you already?

296
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,557
You're going to be caught anyway.

297
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:55,827
Who is it?

298
00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:57,707
Step on it.

299
00:23:57,707 --> 00:23:59,157
Step on it if you don't want to die.

300
00:23:59,157 --> 00:24:00,927
What's going on?

301
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:04,127
Step on it, punk!

302
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:12,457
He escaped from the Prosecutors' Office while being interrogated.

303
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:15,107
So we're now searching for Prosecutor Jin.

304
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:17,617
At this rate, Prosecutor Jin will be expelled and

305
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:20,447
there will even be public wanted orders.

306
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:22,887
Have you been contacted by him, perhaps?

307
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:26,227
Or is there any way to locate him?

308
00:24:26,227 --> 00:24:28,687
I-I don't know.

309
00:24:31,277 --> 00:24:33,647
Prosecutor Jin has been located!

310
00:25:46,427 --> 00:25:49,257
Let's go, Buddy.

311
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,897
Come here.

312
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,137
What's wrong?

313
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:55,067
What—

314
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:23,697
Have you eaten?

315
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:39,477
Hey.

316
00:26:39,477 --> 00:26:40,887
Yes?

317
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:44,157
Eat slowly. I'm getting indigestion from just watching you.

318
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:51,537
Look how happy you are. With a hole in your head.

319
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:54,027
The kimchi tastes good.

320
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:55,077
What?

321
00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:57,317
The kimchi tastes good.

322
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:58,527
- It tastes good? 
 - Yes.

323
00:26:58,527 --> 00:27:00,347
Is that so?

324
00:27:00,347 --> 00:27:01,917
Eat up, then.

325
00:27:03,817 --> 00:27:06,517
The pickled radish doesn't taste good.

326
00:27:10,817 --> 00:27:12,657
Framed?

327
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:18,987
That's that, then.

328
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:20,947
What are you going to do now?

329
00:27:22,257 --> 00:27:23,917
I'm going to find it and show them.

330
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:25,847
That they messed with the wrong person

331
00:27:25,847 --> 00:27:28,827
regardless of who they are.

332
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:30,807
Your fighting spirit is there.

333
00:27:34,397 --> 00:27:36,687
Your son is handsome...

334
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:39,257
and your wife is also a beauty.

335
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,387
Where are your family members?

336
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:44,187
It looks like you live here alone.

337
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:49,087
- A wild goose. 
 - Sorry?

338
00:27:49,927 --> 00:27:51,540
I'm a wild goose dad, you punk. 
  (T/N: Dad who lives alone to support family living overseas)

339
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,790
Both my son and my wife...

340
00:27:54,787 --> 00:27:56,757
are abroad.

341
00:27:59,987 --> 00:28:02,077
I'm letting you stay only for tonight.

342
00:28:02,077 --> 00:28:04,687
You're on your own starting tomorrow.

343
00:28:04,687 --> 00:28:07,057
I'm curious about one thing.

344
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:11,427
Why are you at the Civil Service Division, Director?

345
00:28:11,427 --> 00:28:13,327
Because I was living like you-know-who.

346
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:18,777
- Director! 
 - Can't you ask everything at once? What?

347
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:20,627
It's something important.

348
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:23,477
Thank you.

349
00:28:24,757 --> 00:28:26,227
Sleep.

350
00:28:31,957 --> 00:28:35,497
Coco! Have you been well?

351
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:38,197
I'm sorry. Daddy hasn't been taking care of you.

352
00:28:38,197 --> 00:28:40,397
Let's sleep with Daddy, okay?

353
00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:42,127
Come here.

354
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:44,517
Snowball, come in.

355
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,617
- Prosecutor. 
 - Yes?

356
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:06,217
The two of them... Why did you let them go?

357
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:10,637
We can't exactly keep holding innocent citizens hostage.

358
00:29:10,637 --> 00:29:13,697
It's not like they're helping Prosecutor Jin with his escape.

359
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:17,647
I believe it's better to let them go for now.

360
00:29:18,587 --> 00:29:22,587
Aren't you telling them to help Prosecutor Jin?

361
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:24,607
Stop saying weird stuff, and go home.

362
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:26,597
Okay, I'll be going ahead.

363
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,557

364
00:29:59,807 --> 00:30:01,427
This is Shin Ah Ra.

365
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:04,147
 It's me, Senior.

366
00:30:04,147 --> 00:30:05,777
Where are you right now?

367
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:09,197
I'm at a safe place. How are things at the office?

368
00:30:09,197 --> 00:30:10,627
Are you asking when you know already?

369
00:30:10,627 --> 00:30:14,077
- I've also been ordered to arrest you. 
 - That's a little upsetting.

370
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:15,697
 You said you met Oh Do Hwan.

371
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:17,687
Did you find out who schemed it?

372
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:20,007
It's not easy.

373
00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:23,737
How great would it be to have you next to me at a time like this.

374
00:30:23,737 --> 00:30:26,217
No. It's a "no, thanks" from me.

375
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:30,587
Go Joong Do and Baek Eun Ji have been sent home.

376
00:30:30,587 --> 00:30:33,167
 Call them or not, do as you please.

377
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,917
Thank you.

378
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,447
 Forget it.

379
00:30:36,447 --> 00:30:38,657
From now on, I'm going to catch you.

380
00:30:38,657 --> 00:30:42,547
I'm going to catch you and get a promotion, so don't be caught

381
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:46,757
by anyone else. Absolutely never.

382
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,277
I'll keep that in mind.

383
00:30:57,687 --> 00:31:04,447
♫  It feels like my blurry vision has become a little more blurred  ♫

384
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:08,407
♫  After all, the world is always unkind  ♫

385
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:10,567
Take care of yourself.

386
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:14,387
♫  It was a huge illusion, it hurts quite a bit  ♫

387
00:31:14,387 --> 00:31:16,927
♫  It's miserable, miserable  ♫

388
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:22,027
♫  I believed that something would be a little 
 different from yesterday  ♫

389
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:25,007
♫  Mistake, mistake, my bad  ♫

390
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:31,217
♫  I just close my eyes indifferently  ♫

391
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:34,957
♫  I want you to be quiet, but it's not easy this time  ♫

392
00:31:34,957 --> 00:31:37,507
♫  Look carefully, look at me  ♫

393
00:31:37,507 --> 00:31:41,737

394
00:31:41,737 --> 00:31:43,597
 There's something I need to tell you.

395
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:48,577
♫  I need just one bite, yeah, just one bite  ♫

396
00:31:48,577 --> 00:31:51,197
♫  Now you gotta know, yeah you gotta know  ♫

397
00:31:51,197 --> 00:31:54,827
♫  Somewhere in the dark corner  ♫

398
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:58,827
♫  Take a bite before the dawn right now  ♫

399
00:31:58,827 --> 00:32:02,187
♫  One bite, need just one bite  ♫

400
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:07,057
♫  Now you gotta know, yeah you gotta know  ♫

401
00:32:19,957 --> 00:32:21,717
Didn't you sleep?

402
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:27,827
Do you want some ramen?

403
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:30,287
This doesn't make sense at all.

404
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,717
I clearly asked you if you wanted.

405
00:32:35,717 --> 00:32:37,907
Don't steal from my plate later.

406
00:32:41,847 --> 00:32:45,777
Oh, yay! Here we go.

407
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:50,707
Gosh, it's looking good.

408
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:55,747
Whoa, ramen?

409
00:32:55,747 --> 00:32:57,367
Where's mine?

410
00:33:03,237 --> 00:33:06,157
How can you eat by yourself?

411
00:33:06,157 --> 00:33:08,777
Come on, let's eat together.

412
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:29,087
Is something not working out?

413
00:33:30,797 --> 00:33:33,807
I just don't understand it, no matter how many times I look at it.

414
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:35,707
This part right here.

415
00:33:37,617 --> 00:33:39,941
I didn't say I would take a look.

416
00:33:40,857 --> 00:33:42,587
All right.

417
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:46,967

418
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:49,037

419
00:33:53,527 --> 00:33:54,847

420
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:57,177

421
00:33:58,224 --> 00:33:59,197
What about this?

422
00:33:59,197 --> 00:34:02,967

Methamphetamine is a stimulant, not a sedative.

423
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:06,327
On top of that, it also causes extreme pleasure along with side effects.

424
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:07,697
Philopon? 
  (T/N: 1940s brand name of methamphetamine)

425
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:13,987
If they were going to make him commit suicide, shouldn't they have used a sedative instead?

426
00:34:13,987 --> 00:34:17,670
They need to make him docile first to drop him from a height.

427
00:34:21,487 --> 00:34:24,847
Why did the culprit bother using philopon...

428
00:34:24,847 --> 00:34:28,337
instead of an anesthetic, which is the easier way?

429
00:34:28,337 --> 00:34:30,687
Read me the effects of philopon.

430
00:34:31,577 --> 00:34:33,787
Pleasure, hallucinations,

431
00:34:33,787 --> 00:34:36,977
increase in sexual arousal, bodily vigor,

432
00:34:36,977 --> 00:34:38,617
increase in brain activity,

433
00:34:38,617 --> 00:34:40,787
anxiety, sense of happiness,

434
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,577
confidence...

435
00:34:42,577 --> 00:34:45,257
and increase in hostility. That's what I know about the drug.

436
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:47,217
There's one more in addition.

437
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:48,497
It's a truth serum.

438
00:34:49,257 --> 00:34:50,887
A truth serum?

439
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:52,877
At the moment of injection,

440
00:34:52,877 --> 00:34:55,687
your memories and emotions rush in here.

441
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:57,257
What do you think will happen then?

442
00:34:57,257 --> 00:34:59,697
Your mind is so overwhelmed that it is like it's going to explode,

443
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,557
but there's no way to relieve it.

444
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:04,177
From then on, you start running your mouth.

445
00:35:04,177 --> 00:35:08,317
You're feeling good anyway, so until the drug wears off. Blah, blah, blah.

446
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:09,947
Is that possible?

447
00:35:09,947 --> 00:35:11,757
Spilling secrets from being drugged up?

448
00:35:11,757 --> 00:35:13,457
You see it happen all the time.

449
00:35:13,457 --> 00:35:15,857
People get talkative while under the influence.

450
00:35:16,837 --> 00:35:17,927
Of alcohol?

451
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:21,167
Even alcohol... can be a truth serum.

452
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:28,427
Then the killer... was trying to find something out from the Chief?

453
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:40,187
 Sometimes, going back to where you started might be the answer.

454
00:35:40,187 --> 00:35:42,477
 Instead of looking for the person who framed you like that,

455
00:35:42,477 --> 00:35:45,887
 looking for the person who killed the Chief could be faster.

456
00:35:58,267 --> 00:36:00,747
 Today's lesson ends here.

457
00:36:00,747 --> 00:36:04,117
 The rest is up to you to find out yourself. Dismissed.

458
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:10,007
What is he telling me to find out?

459
00:36:11,387 --> 00:36:13,227

460
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:16,667

461
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:21,747

Even the same black bean noodles...

462
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:24,457
differ in taste depending on who makes them.

463
00:36:24,457 --> 00:36:26,347
Why am I telling you this?

464
00:36:26,347 --> 00:36:30,417
As you know, our country isn't a drug-free country anymore.

465
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:32,677
China, Japan, and the Philippines...

466
00:36:32,677 --> 00:36:35,707
All kinds of drugs from around the world—

467
00:36:38,547 --> 00:36:39,907
I'm sorry.

468
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,617
- Come on. 
 - Sorry?

469
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:43,067
Your hands.

470
00:36:46,107 --> 00:36:50,057
Anyhow, since things got competitive in our country,

471
00:36:50,057 --> 00:36:52,797
these guys started using their heads.

472
00:36:52,797 --> 00:36:54,017
Signature.

473
00:36:54,017 --> 00:36:56,177
It's a way to appeal to your customers.

474
00:36:56,177 --> 00:37:00,137
By adding or removing certain ingredients, they create uniqueness in their drugs.

475
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:02,017
"This drug was created by me."

476
00:37:02,017 --> 00:37:04,787
"You can buy this only from me."

477
00:37:04,787 --> 00:37:07,997
Just like black bean noodles made by a new chef.

478
00:37:11,337 --> 00:37:14,257
Then if you analyze the ingredients of a drug,

479
00:37:14,257 --> 00:37:17,207
you can also find the manufacturer?

480
00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:21,127
Gosh, don't forget about the customer list.

481
00:37:23,897 --> 00:37:26,087

482
00:37:42,187 --> 00:37:43,897
All right...

483
00:37:43,897 --> 00:37:46,077
- Did you have fun today? 
 - Gosh...

484
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:49,637
What now? I've been interrogated and released already.

485
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:51,557
I already told everything to Prosecutor Oh.

486
00:37:51,557 --> 00:37:53,857
It's about a different matter today.

487
00:37:56,887 --> 00:37:58,667
What's this?

488
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:01,807
Autopsy Analysis? What?

489
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:03,691

490
00:38:05,957 --> 00:38:09,177
S-So... this guy was murdered?

491
00:38:09,177 --> 00:38:11,267
Don't ask. Just answer.

492
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:13,197
Who's the one that made this?

493
00:38:16,867 --> 00:38:18,907
I know you've got your hands on distribution and

494
00:38:18,907 --> 00:38:22,177
that you can find the manufacturer with the recipe.

495
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:24,397
Stop shaking your pupils.

496
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:31,557
Well, I think I might remember...

497
00:38:33,137 --> 00:38:34,577
You've got golf clubs in your car, right?

498
00:38:34,577 --> 00:38:38,177
- Open up the trunk real quick. 
 - W-Wait, P-Prosecutor!

499
00:38:38,177 --> 00:38:42,547
My goodness. Are you a thug or a prosecutor?

500
00:38:43,597 --> 00:38:45,317
It's owned by the Gangnam gang.

501
00:38:45,317 --> 00:38:49,547

They're notorious for mixing in tons of pseudoephedrine.

502
00:38:49,547 --> 00:38:51,697
The cold medicine ingredient.

503
00:38:52,977 --> 00:38:54,647
Describe him and tell me where he hangs.

504
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:57,317
I wouldn't know that.

505
00:38:57,317 --> 00:38:59,497
I heard he's got a dragon tattoo on the neck.

506
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:03,897
They party every Friday at the club, so try going there.

507
00:39:12,097 --> 00:39:13,707
I'm borrowing this.

508
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:17,817
Don't make me come find you, and answer my call promptly.

509
00:39:17,817 --> 00:39:19,877
We're not done yet.

510
00:39:23,347 --> 00:39:27,417
Geez, why did he have to take the most expensive one?

511
00:39:40,487 --> 00:39:43,867
He left. I'll start trailing him.

512
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:10,057
- What's wrong? 
 - What the heck is this?

513
00:40:10,057 --> 00:40:12,617
- What's going on? 
 - Gosh!

514
00:40:12,617 --> 00:40:14,387
 My goodness!

515
00:40:14,387 --> 00:40:16,917
Why are you driving like that?

516
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,657
Gosh, my lower back.

517
00:40:29,507 --> 00:40:30,957

518
00:40:30,957 --> 00:40:33,397

519
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:36,147
 - Yes, where are you?  
 - We're at Joong Do's store.

520
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:37,207
What about the tail?

521
00:40:37,207 --> 00:40:40,537
We dropped them... thanks to Eun Ji.

522
00:40:43,447 --> 00:40:44,917
 Okay, listen up.

523
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:48,477
I think we can find out... who killed Chief Lee Jang Won.

524
00:40:48,477 --> 00:40:51,447
The keyword is Gangnam Club. A dragon tattoo on the neck.

525
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:54,567
 - Go Joong Do—  
 - This one is worth two big bills.

526
00:40:54,567 --> 00:40:57,357
 Find the location and text it to me. I'll see you there.

527
00:40:57,357 --> 00:41:00,167
How do you plan to get there, Prosecutor?

528
00:41:35,357 --> 00:41:36,997
 Oh, you're here?

529
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:39,567
 - Shall we go now? 
 - Yes.

530
00:41:47,717 --> 00:41:50,207
 - Hang on tight! 
 - Okay.

531
00:42:04,937 --> 00:42:06,127
Son.

532
00:42:06,127 --> 00:42:08,687
Geez! What the heck!

533
00:42:08,687 --> 00:42:10,737
What do you mean? It's your mom.

534
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:11,857
Holly crap...

535
00:42:11,857 --> 00:42:13,977
The police came by earlier.

536
00:42:13,977 --> 00:42:15,137
Did you get in trouble or something?

537
00:42:15,137 --> 00:42:18,227
Either eat cucumber or do the face pack. Choose one.

538
00:42:18,227 --> 00:42:19,967
Why would you have that on out here right now?

539
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:21,807
- Should I take it off? 
 - Please!

540
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:23,967
I just put it on, though.

541
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:29,737
Tell me now. What did you do?

542
00:42:29,737 --> 00:42:30,967
It's nothing like that.

543
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:34,147
Is this my first day with you?

544
00:42:34,147 --> 00:42:36,317
Tell me honestly.

545
00:42:36,317 --> 00:42:38,817
I won't hit you.

546
00:42:40,587 --> 00:42:43,237
I-It's nothing like that, M-Mother.

547
00:42:48,647 --> 00:42:49,927
Okay.

548
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:52,017
It's fine as long as you didn't kill a person.

549
00:42:52,017 --> 00:42:53,897
- What about food? 
 - I'm eating well.

550
00:42:53,897 --> 00:42:54,997
Seeing anyone?

551
00:42:54,997 --> 00:42:56,407
I'm still looking.

552
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,477
What about Coco?

553
00:42:58,477 --> 00:42:59,907
He's Snowball now.

554
00:42:59,907 --> 00:43:02,967
- What? 
 - It just happened that way.

555
00:43:05,137 --> 00:43:06,477
You took good care of it.

556
00:43:06,477 --> 00:43:08,377
You hated it when dad would ride it.

557
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,777
I want to throw it out, but I have no time to go to the District Office.

558
00:43:14,964 --> 00:43:19,427
Son... you know I trust you, right?

559
00:43:21,297 --> 00:43:25,867
Also, I've been to my friend's grandson's first birthday—

560
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,198
Wait a second.

561
00:43:41,098 --> 00:43:45,978
Why am I... working so hard right now?

562
00:43:46,778 --> 00:43:49,868
I need to tell Prosecutor Jin about this.

563
00:43:49,868 --> 00:43:52,928
Two bills aren't enough for this.

564
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:56,138
Focus, all right?

565
00:44:13,898 --> 00:44:15,618
It's out, yeah?

566
00:44:15,618 --> 00:44:16,838

There.

567
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:18,588
Club Vertigo!

568
00:44:20,898 --> 00:44:23,158

Wow, this place...

569
00:44:23,158 --> 00:44:25,488
This place is the bomb...

570
00:44:54,378 --> 00:44:56,568
It's nice, right?

571
00:44:59,328 --> 00:45:00,968
Let's move.

572
00:45:09,108 --> 00:45:11,448
 A drug ring is a sporadically networked group.

573
00:45:11,448 --> 00:45:14,678
 It means we can't reach the higher-ups regardless of however many underlings we catch.

574
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,108
 It's game over if we can't get them here.

575
00:45:16,108 --> 00:45:18,018
 We have to get them today.

576
00:46:03,948 --> 00:46:05,138
What the heck are you doing?

577
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:07,098
- I'm sorry. 
 - What's this?

578
00:46:08,238 --> 00:46:09,858
What's your problem?

579
00:46:09,858 --> 00:46:11,738
I-I'm sorry.

580
00:46:19,088 --> 00:46:22,238
If you find one, talk to me right away, and don't make it obvious.

581
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:08,598
The VIP table upstairs.

582
00:47:12,888 --> 00:47:14,238
Let's not cause a scene.

583
00:47:14,238 --> 00:47:17,408
Stand your grounds and get them all at once when they-

584
00:47:17,408 --> 00:47:18,968
We're from the Drug Investigation Unit.

585
00:47:18,968 --> 00:47:22,458
Please stay put, and we ask for your cooperation.

586
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:23,728
Hey, sit down!

587
00:47:23,728 --> 00:47:26,018
- Who the hell are you? 
 - Hey, sit down! Sit!

588
00:47:26,988 --> 00:47:28,968
 What the heck? What's going on?

589
00:47:28,968 --> 00:47:30,638
Why does the Drug Investigation Unit come out of nowhere?

590
00:47:30,638 --> 00:47:31,868
I think they're here for a crackdown.

591
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:34,038
Hey, you punk!

592
00:47:40,008 --> 00:47:41,738
Damn it!

593
00:47:44,408 --> 00:47:46,518
 Stay still!

594
00:48:23,378 --> 00:48:25,908
What? Where did he go?

595
00:48:37,098 --> 00:48:39,578
- What are we going to ride? 
 - Hubby...

596
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,728
Hey, hurry up and run!

597
00:48:56,795 --> 00:48:58,648
Hurry up and pack our stuff!

598
00:48:58,648 --> 00:49:02,158
- W-What? 
 - I said pack our stuff!

599
00:49:02,158 --> 00:49:03,698
Shit...

600
00:49:10,408 --> 00:49:12,538
Hurry up and move, you punks.

601
00:49:36,618 --> 00:49:38,018
Hey.

602
00:49:45,038 --> 00:49:47,388
- What the hell are you? 
 - Me?

603
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:50,958
A prosecutor.

604
00:49:53,388 --> 00:49:54,688
A prosecutor?

605
00:49:54,688 --> 00:49:55,698
Yes.

606
00:49:55,698 --> 00:49:57,358
Bast—

607
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:34,858
M-My bone, my bone!

608
00:50:44,988 --> 00:50:46,428
Gosh!

609
00:51:00,778 --> 00:51:02,448
This one's all right.

610
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,368
Oh, no!

611
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:09,318
- My bone, my bone! 
 - Stop being a wuss.

612
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:11,478
- You wuss! 
 - It hurts.

613
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:19,998
I told you I'm a prosecutor, but you kept acting up.

614
00:51:34,878 --> 00:51:41,358

615
00:51:51,618 --> 00:51:53,058
Hello.

616
00:51:53,058 --> 00:51:54,908
Gosh, Prosecutor.

617
00:51:54,908 --> 00:51:56,148
Hey.

618
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,608
I'm spent.

619
00:52:09,108 --> 00:52:12,498

620
00:52:12,498 --> 00:52:15,078
How was the stay at the temple?

621
00:52:15,078 --> 00:52:18,598
It was lame. The food was bad, too.

622
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:22,148
Lee Seung Joon embezzled the company funds.

623
00:52:24,338 --> 00:52:26,798
Who's Lee Seung Joon?

624
00:52:28,658 --> 00:52:30,958
Jung Il group's oldest son?

625
00:52:37,608 --> 00:52:42,068
If he's going to play with money, he shouldn't get caught.

626
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:45,518
If he's going to get caught, he shouldn't play with money.

627
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:48,618
How much is all this?

628
00:52:51,178 --> 00:52:53,068
Fifty billion won?

629
00:52:54,608 --> 00:52:57,348
The heir of a group tries this hard

630
00:52:57,348 --> 00:53:00,978
to steal a couple of bucks? Gosh.

631
00:53:09,368 --> 00:53:11,148
Yes, Chairman!

632
00:53:12,678 --> 00:53:15,958
Yes, of course, I have your back.

633
00:53:16,898 --> 00:53:18,978
It won't be in the newspaper,

634
00:53:18,978 --> 00:53:21,698
so tell your son he can stand up straight.

635
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,178
Yes. Yes, yes.

636
00:53:30,258 --> 00:53:32,708
Where's the jurisdiction for the case?

637
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:34,338
The Southern District Prosecutors' Office.

638
00:53:35,578 --> 00:53:38,328
Arrange a visit to the southern district attorney.

639
00:53:38,328 --> 00:53:41,348
And record Lee Seung Joon's story and put it in the archive.

640
00:53:41,348 --> 00:53:42,858
Yes, Father.

641
00:53:44,368 --> 00:53:46,198
What about Jin Jung?

642
00:53:46,928 --> 00:53:50,058
The intelligence team says he's tracking down drug dealers.

643
00:53:50,058 --> 00:53:53,258
He went all the way there in this situation?

644
00:53:53,258 --> 00:53:55,838
He's quite something, all right.

645
00:53:57,828 --> 00:54:00,958
What am I to do with him?

646
00:54:02,418 --> 00:54:04,898

647
00:54:04,898 --> 00:54:08,618
What's this guy doing that he's not calling me?

648
00:54:14,538 --> 00:54:16,488

649
00:54:20,798 --> 00:54:22,418
Prosecutor Jin?

650
00:55:02,228 --> 00:55:03,688
Senior!

651
00:55:07,468 --> 00:55:09,948
Are you hurt anywhere? Are you okay?

652
00:55:09,948 --> 00:55:11,988
Yes, I'm all right.

653
00:55:12,878 --> 00:55:14,658
Please do me a favor.

654
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:21,538
This is a ledger with the list of drug buyers.

655
00:55:23,558 --> 00:55:25,098
They're all usernames.

656
00:55:25,098 --> 00:55:28,348
The culprit is in there. The one who killed Chief Prosecutor.

657
00:55:28,348 --> 00:55:31,628
From two weeks before Chief Prosecutor's death until the day of the incident,

658
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,368
there were a total of five drug buyers.

659
00:55:34,368 --> 00:55:36,818
Please confirm their identities.

660
00:55:36,818 --> 00:55:39,468
All right. I'll look into it.

661
00:55:39,468 --> 00:55:41,618
It's important, so please get this done as-

662
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:47,088
I think someone was on your tail.

663
00:55:49,348 --> 00:55:51,238
Damn it!

664
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:06,298
Hey, you bastard!

665
00:56:07,368 --> 00:56:10,328
Go down, go down! Go down!

666
00:56:13,888 --> 00:56:15,658
Hey, punk, get in here!

667
00:56:15,658 --> 00:56:17,388
Go back up!

668
00:56:29,478 --> 00:56:30,928
Damn it.

669
00:57:04,248 --> 00:57:06,248
That little!

670
00:57:13,828 --> 00:57:15,918
- Hey, you! 
 - Stop!

671
00:57:18,488 --> 00:57:20,858
Oh, God.

672
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:22,278
That crazy nut!

673
00:57:22,278 --> 00:57:24,218
Hey, come.

674
00:57:24,218 --> 00:57:26,418
You can't come, can you?

675
00:57:26,418 --> 00:57:28,088
- You can do it! 
 - Hold on, hold on.

676
00:57:28,088 --> 00:57:30,458
- I'm coming for you! 
 - You're coming?

677
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:32,818
Don't. Don't do it. It's dangerous.

678
00:57:38,308 --> 00:57:40,108
Are you okay?

679
00:57:41,768 --> 00:57:43,748
Don't do it! Don't do it!

680
00:57:43,748 --> 00:57:45,438
I said, don't come!

681
00:57:45,438 --> 00:57:48,188
Hey, get him!

682
00:57:50,538 --> 00:57:52,228
- Hey, stop! 
 - Hey!

683
00:57:52,228 --> 00:57:54,178
Hey, bastard! Stop right there!

684
00:57:54,178 --> 00:57:56,038
Get him!

685
00:58:06,738 --> 00:58:08,478
Hey, stop right there!

686
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:14,178
Hey, stop!

687
00:58:14,178 --> 00:58:16,488
Hey! Catch him, catch him!

688
00:58:20,478 --> 00:58:23,098
Whoa! God.

689
00:58:24,578 --> 00:58:25,978
Stop!

690
00:58:27,868 --> 00:58:29,698
Shit...

691
00:58:31,078 --> 00:58:33,888
Hey...

692
00:58:33,888 --> 00:58:35,548
Man!

693
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:06,208
Hey! Come here!

694
00:59:10,408 --> 00:59:12,258
What the hell?

695
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:08,000
