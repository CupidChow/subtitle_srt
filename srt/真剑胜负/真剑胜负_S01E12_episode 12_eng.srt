1
00:00:35,206 --> 00:00:40,090

2
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:49,146
So it was you, Attorney Oh, huh?

3
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:52,236
The one who delivered the evidence to Prosecutor Jin.

4
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:02,620

5
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:18,296
I thought our relationship was fine.

6
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:21,226
Did you feel guilty or something?

7
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:23,306
That's not a virtue on an attorney.

8
00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:25,976
This isn't a matter of an attorney's virtue.

9
00:01:25,976 --> 00:01:29,346
It's a matter of being human or not.

10
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:31,036
Everything's over.

11
00:01:31,036 --> 00:01:32,586
Let it go now, please.

12
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:34,576
Sure...

13
00:01:34,576 --> 00:01:38,166
if that's what you choose.

14
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,486
However...

15
00:01:39,486 --> 00:01:42,576
after climbing up to where I am, Attorney Oh...

16
00:01:42,576 --> 00:01:45,526
there are things I see even if I try not to.

17
00:01:45,526 --> 00:01:47,986
The eyes of a person.

18
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:53,476
Here. It's okay. Pull the trigger.

19
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:56,516
It's okay!

20
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,386
Don't be scared and shoot.

21
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:01,076
I'll just die here today.

22
00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:07,936
I said it's okay, man.

23
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:09,326
Loosen it.

24
00:02:09,326 --> 00:02:11,276
Relax your finger!

25
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:22,066
You have a great expression on your face.

26
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:28,316
Now, let's stop fooling around.

27
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:34,096
The phone.

28
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,406
I know you're recording.

29
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:46,226
It doesn't hit well.

30
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:48,150
All right!

31
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:50,746
I understand.

32
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:13,856
Will it be okay for you to be like this?

33
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:16,356
Shut up and stay still.

34
00:03:17,076 --> 00:03:19,216
Oh Do Hwan there...

35
00:03:27,296 --> 00:03:30,156
What's the reason?

36
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:33,656
There's nothing money can't do in this world.

37
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:39,686
If there is one, that means you don't have enough money.

38
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:44,366
Choose wisely, Prosecutor Jin.

39
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:47,556
If you let him be like that, he'll die.

40
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:09,786

41
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:14,216

42
00:04:26,636 --> 00:04:29,246
Hey, are you awake?

43
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:32,836
Hey...

44
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:35,106
- Hey! 
 - What?

45
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:40,656
You're well prepared.

46
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:44,396
Had I known, I would've let you die there earlier.

47
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:48,076
Hey, do something about this if you got time to chat.

48
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:49,856
We're bound to be drowned ghosts.

49
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,417
I understand, so untie this. Okay?

50
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,580
Hey, untie this!

51
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,780
What's he saying?

52
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,706
"Untie this?"

53
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,219
Goodbye.

54
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:11,216
Hey, let's go get some food.

55
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:39,679
One, two, three!

56
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:42,036
One, two, three!

57
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:44,606
One, two, three!

58
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:47,096
One, two, three!

59
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,926
It ripped. Can you move?

60
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:51,036
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

61
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:09,736
- Untie it. 
 - Where is it?

62
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:21,666
What's this?

63
00:06:31,746 --> 00:06:33,646
Hey!

64
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:34,976
Can you handle a fight?

65
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,666
Better than you, probably.

66
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,846
Just don't slow me down.

67
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:40,406
Hey...

68
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:42,706
I told you to untie us, didn't I?

69
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:36,006
You all right?

70
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:38,386
You said you could fight.

71
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:41,726
Somebody was being baggage, so...

72
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:43,596
Get up.

73
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:59,446
Attorney Oh Do Hwan did?

74
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:00,836
Is he hurt badly?

75
00:08:00,836 --> 00:08:03,276
The doctor said he was okay.

76
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:06,746
Sorry for not letting you know
about Attorney Oh beforehand.

77
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:09,436
What's the plan from here?

78
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:11,396
I confirmed with my eyes, so we need to strike...

79
00:08:11,396 --> 00:08:13,446
Seo Hyeon Gyu's library.

80
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:17,086
We're going to heist everything there and expose it to the world?

81
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:19,386
We need to get a search and seizure warrant from the court.

82
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:21,956
So that we can use them as evidence when...

83
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:23,326
we bring Seo Hyeon Gyu to trial, at least.

84
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:26,066
The problem is we have no cause to request a warrant.

85
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:29,706
You two are the only ones who saw the contents inside.

86
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:32,856
What if everyone can look at the contents together?

87
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:43,116
This is the fire accident of the Director's family.

88
00:08:43,116 --> 00:08:45,246

89
00:08:45,246 --> 00:08:47,346
This wasn't an accident?

90
00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:50,226
Someone covered the car with gasoline and set it on fire...

91
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:52,596
after placing the two breathless people inside.

92
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:54,746
This is the proof.

93
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:57,576
Where the heck did you bring this from-

94
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,269

95
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,420

96
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,166

97
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,586
Since the location of the library has been exposed,

98
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:17,316
Seo Hyeon Gyu will surely attempt to relocate.

99
00:09:17,316 --> 00:09:19,166
Please get it as quickly as possible.

100
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,786
We may never get to catch him if we miss this chance.

101
00:09:21,786 --> 00:09:24,399
We'll strike at once and catch him properly.

102
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,079
It's a real sword fight from here.

103
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:35,896
♫  It's natural that you can be covered by many faces  ♫

♫  Beautifully shining little star  ♫

110
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,776
 Prosecutor, it seems we were one step behind.

111
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:11,616
Okay, I understand, Investigator.

112
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,116
It's just as we thought.

113
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:16,986
He had already emptied it completely.

114
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:20,046
Seo Hyeon Gyu would've been notified somehow.

115
00:10:20,046 --> 00:10:21,796
I expected up to this point.

116
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:23,656
Did they say it was a truck?

117
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,856
It's going through this road for sure, right?

118
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:28,896
This is the only road that comes from the Book Store.

119
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:33,106
Chul Ki said they left ten minutes ago.

120
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:35,406

00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:04,706

Let's go.

135
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:20,646
They're using a cheap trick.

136
00:12:21,286 --> 00:12:22,926
Let's contact the Traffic Department in charge.

137
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:26,336
If we check the CCTV, we might be able to track them.

138
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:27,966
We don't need to.

139
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:29,386
Let's follow them.

140
00:12:29,386 --> 00:12:31,306
How?

141
00:12:33,556 --> 00:12:36,736
Gosh, this isn't the purpose of a couples app.

142
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:41,066
But wait, who's this person?

143
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:44,036
Who could it be?

144
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,096
 Are you okay?

145
00:12:55,096 --> 00:12:58,226
 Do I look okay right now?

146
00:12:58,226 --> 00:12:59,626
 It's not like...

147
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:02,556
 I'm a package or something.

148
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,066
 What's this?

149
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:09,506
 Chamber pot.

150
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:11,526
 A can?

151
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:14,906
 Look how small the opening is, Chul Ki hyung.

152
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:16,316
 The small opening...

153
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:18,116
 If the opening is this small...

154
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:21,366
 Are you telling me to pee or do a circus trick?

155
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:25,856
 You need to give me at least a PET bottle for energy drinks. Hey!

156
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:29,176
 Just what do you think I am?

157
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,389
 Give me a PET bottle!

158
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:35,489

159
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:41,506
 I've penetrated the enemy line safely.

160
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:43,166
Okay.

161
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,906
All right. I have nothing to say now.

162
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:48,336
Please go meet up with Chul Ki and meet me there.

163
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:51,256
I'll go alone from here since it's dangerous.

164
00:13:52,776 --> 00:13:54,206
Prosecutor Jin!

165
00:13:54,206 --> 00:13:56,086
Yes?

166
00:13:58,396 --> 00:14:00,426
Be careful.

167
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:03,406
You, too. I'm off.

168
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:21,586

169
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:28,496
Hurry, hurry.

170
00:14:28,496 --> 00:14:30,346
Let's get it done quickly.

Gosh, what's in here?

172
00:14:50,826 --> 00:14:52,876
Wait, just a second.

173
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:10,086
Are we there?

174
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:28,966
Hey, are you okay?

175
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:35,686
I'm sorry. I'm the one to blame.

176
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:42,006
I'll pay them back for you, though.

177
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:44,096
Stop him!

178
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:46,876
You bastard—

 care about water and fire  ♫

00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:55,126
 Prosecutor Jin is here.

181
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:56,586
What a persistent bastard.

182
00:15:56,586 --> 00:15:57,986
 What should I do?

193
00:16:48,796 --> 00:16:51,726
Is it because the CEO is busy?

194
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:55,376
You see, I still belong to Kangsan.

195
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:57,516
A-Attorney, I...

196
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,806
Mr. Kang Shin Jo, you're fired.

197
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:07,216
I was wondering when you were coming.

198
00:17:07,216 --> 00:17:09,626
Honestly, I came way earlier, but...

199
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:13,226
it was too much for me to join in.

200
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,196
That's just like you, seriously.

201
00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:19,366
Hey, Go Joong Do, are you okay?

202
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:21,696
Do I look okay to you?

203
00:17:22,636 --> 00:17:25,586
This jerk...

204
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,326
Hey, your friends are coming.

205
00:17:28,326 --> 00:17:31,486
Why do you always come after everything is over?

206
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:35,366
I'm exhausted.

207
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:38,066
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay.

208
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:43,276
Did you eat yet?

209
00:18:03,346 --> 00:18:05,376
Have a bowl if you haven't eaten.

210
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,976
Their noodles are good here.

211
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:09,026
Please enjoy it yourself.

212
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:12,176
It'll be your last meal outside.

213
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:16,386
What do you plan to do to me?

214
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,026
Evidence that was collected outside the location written on the...

215
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:21,916
warrant holds no legal power anyways, no?

216
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,426
Using the loopholes in the law isn't...

217
00:18:24,426 --> 00:18:27,676
something only bad guys can do.

218
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:31,326
 Article 218 of the Criminal Law.

219
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:35,186
 Items voluntarily submitted by the criminal or at the scene of the crime

220
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:37,636
 can be seized without a warrant.

221
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:40,426
 Thank you for your voluntary submission of items you...

222
00:18:40,426 --> 00:18:43,606
 moved as ordered by CEO Seo Hyeon Gyu.

223
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:45,506
 Hand it over.

224
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:54,406
 Mr. Anonymous Informant, thank you. Let this go, unless you want to die.

225
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:14,256

226
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:15,796
Please get up now.

227
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:18,076
I'll take care of the bill.

228
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:23,096
Don't think you won just because of this.

229
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:24,706
How could I?

230
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,576
I haven't even started.

231
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:28,856
Brace yourself...

232
00:19:28,856 --> 00:19:31,896
There are a lot more unopened surprises for you.

233

♫  Deep, deep  ♫

234
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:52,816

Your suspension was lifted.

235
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:55,986
 Investigator Lee and I were also freed from inspection.

249
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:52,616
 October 28, 2022...

250
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:54,756
 Case number B761.

251
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:56,866
 Seo Hyeong Gyu of Law Firm Kangsan.

252
00:20:56,866 --> 00:21:01,406
 We'll start the trial on fabricating cases
and attempted murder.

253
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:05,096
Prosecutor, please state the summary of charges.

254
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:07,416
♫  You can't bring me down  ♫

255
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,296

256
00:21:09,296 --> 00:21:13,606
Your Honor, Defendant Seo Hyeong Gyu has fabricated the suspected cases

257
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:17,076
of VIP clients who are economic
and political figures for many years.

258
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,256
Mocking the legal system of Korea,

259
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:21,096
he has enjoyed unchallenged power by taking

260
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:23,936
hostage the clients' allegations, flaws, and corruption,

261
00:21:23,936 --> 00:21:25,376
and ruling above them

262
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,606
in addition to making unjust profits.

263
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:33,156
Defendant Seo Hyeon Gyu framed irrelevant persons as the defendants in cases

264
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:34,646
and had them be tried in court.

265
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:37,146
He instigated the murder of Chief Lee Jang Won to conceal

266
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:40,256
 his weakness and crimes.

267
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:43,206
He then framed the prosecutor, who was investigating the case, as the murderer...

268
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:45,370

269
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,616
and when matters worsened,

270
00:21:49,616 --> 00:21:53,486
he then attempted to have that said prosecutor murdered.

271
00:21:55,026 --> 00:21:57,726
To hide the evidence of his crimes and the

272
00:21:57,726 --> 00:22:00,186
so-called library, which is a collection of cases he fabricated,

273
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,716
 he also attempted to murder someone himself.

274
00:22:02,716 --> 00:22:05,326
Therefore, this prosecutor is charging the defendant with

275
00:22:05,326 --> 00:22:08,286
Article 283 threatening,

276
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,626
Article 155 destruction of evidence,

277
00:22:10,626 --> 00:22:13,126
Article 314 obstruction of legal process,

278
00:22:13,126 --> 00:22:16,186
Article 326's obstruction of use of authority,

279
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:18,916
Article 254 attempted murder,

280
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,576
Article 250 murder, and

281
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:25,166
Article 1-31 instigated murder under Criminal Law.

282
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:28,496
The said seven charges are to be indicted.

283
00:22:33,846 --> 00:22:36,406
You didn't...

284
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:39,466
hire a separate attorney, Defendant.

285
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,276
Yes.

286
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:46,236
I'll be representing myself.

287
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:49,146
Understood.

288
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:50,496
Defendant...

289
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:52,836
please state the summary of your rebuttal.

290
00:22:56,993 --> 00:22:59,340
This defendant...

291
00:23:00,036 --> 00:23:05,035
hereby denies... all the allegations stated by the prosecutor.

292
00:23:13,896 --> 00:23:18,476
Proceed with the examination of the witnesses about the defendant Seo Hyeong Gyu.

293
00:23:18,476 --> 00:23:20,966
Witness, please enter.

294
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:34,345
What is... your relationship to the defendant, Witness?

295
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:37,365
From the time I was a regular prosecutor to when I became the Prosecutor General,

296
00:23:37,365 --> 00:23:41,085
I was the right-hand man of the defendant for 20-something years.

297
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:45,925
Are you also aware of the Chief Lee Jang Won case?

298
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,825
Yes. I'm aware.

299
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:54,145
The one who made Chief Lee Jang Won's case into a suicide...

300
00:23:54,145 --> 00:23:56,525
was none other than me.

301
00:24:01,955 --> 00:24:04,365
Was it a crime committed by you alone?

302
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:06,155
No, it wasn't.

303
00:24:09,205 --> 00:24:13,565
I was ordered by CEO Seo, who's sitting at the defendant's seat over there.

304
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:23,285
CEO Seo attempted to rob Chief Lee of the evidence of a crime, so

305
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:26,995
he ordered a person to murder him and disguise his death.

306
00:24:26,995 --> 00:24:30,445
He then ordered me to fix up the case.

307
00:24:30,445 --> 00:24:33,215
What's this evidence of the crime you mentioned?

308
00:24:33,215 --> 00:24:36,975
It's an MP3 that Chief Lee had...

309
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,595
which contains a video of the defendant's act of murder.

310
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:44,515
Your Honor... this has not been confirmed.

311
00:24:44,515 --> 00:24:46,615
Accepted.

312
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:50,005
Witness... be careful with your statements.

313
00:24:52,885 --> 00:24:54,375
Witness...

314
00:24:56,285 --> 00:24:59,615
you and I have...

315
00:24:59,615 --> 00:25:03,185
talked about the Chief Prosecutor Lee Jang Won case.

316
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:05,755
Do you remember the conversation back then?

317
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:08,355
I do remember.

318
00:25:08,355 --> 00:25:10,205
Was it true that...

319
00:25:10,205 --> 00:25:13,425
I directly ordered you to fix up the case...

320
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:16,685
as a suicide on that day?

321
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:20,905
 His death was really a waste, though.

322
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:25,435
 Chief Lee Jang Won. It seemed as though it was concluded as a suicide on the news.

323
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:27,855
 Lee Jang Won did kill himself, right?

324
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:37,695
If it's hard for you to answer,

325
00:25:37,695 --> 00:25:40,265
I'll change my question.

326
00:25:41,925 --> 00:25:45,765
Did I ever... mention framing someone or

327
00:25:45,765 --> 00:25:49,855
fabricating the case even once?

328
00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:52,455
You didn't mention it directly per se, but...

329
00:25:52,455 --> 00:25:54,475
I think there was enough intent.

330
00:25:54,475 --> 00:25:58,925
Since when was the court a place for discussing intent?

331
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:01,405
You don't even have evidence, such as a video or voice recording.

332
00:26:01,405 --> 00:26:04,115
And your testimony also lacks credibility.

333
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:05,915
In the end, are you not...

334
00:26:05,915 --> 00:26:08,225
blaming me for a crime you committed...

335
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:11,575
voluntarily out of loyalty?

336
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:18,045
This is all, Your Honor.

337
00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:30,965
We'll continue with the examination of witnesses.

338
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,795
Prosecution.

339
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,095
You're currently imprisoned at the detention center for allegations

340
00:26:41,095 --> 00:26:44,085
of murdering Chief Lee and attempted murder of me.

341
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:45,715
Is that true?

342
00:26:45,715 --> 00:26:47,235
Yes. That is correct.

343
00:26:47,235 --> 00:26:51,445
During the investigation by the Prosecution, you didn't confess your motive for the crimes.

344
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:54,415
Could you tell us here at this moment?

345
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:04,025
 There will be a trial on CEO Seo soon.

346
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:06,255
 Cooperating with us...

347
00:27:06,255 --> 00:27:10,015
 is the only way for you to reduce your sentence even by a little.

348
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:12,705
 Even if I do cooperate...

349
00:27:12,705 --> 00:27:14,485
 you guys can't get that man.

350
00:27:14,485 --> 00:27:18,875
 Did you already forget... who our prosecutor is?

351
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:22,845
I was ordered to kill...

352
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:28,225
Chief Lee Jang Won and Prosecutor Jin Jung...

353
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:31,875
from CEO Seo Hyeon Gyu.

354
00:27:34,545 --> 00:27:36,125
That's all.

355
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:43,405
Witness, do you do drugs by any chance?

356
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:48,525
There was a trace... of you buying drugs on the SNS.

357
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:52,885
Your Honor, the defendant's question is irrelevant to this trial.

358
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:57,425
It's a question to dispute the credibility of her testimony.

359
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,265
Prosecutor's objection is denied.

360
00:28:00,265 --> 00:28:02,285
Proceed, Defendant.

361
00:28:02,285 --> 00:28:04,475
Let me ask you again, Witness.

362
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:10,000
Is it a fact that you purchased a substance from a drug dealer?

363
00:28:15,585 --> 00:28:17,955
Yes. I do have.

364
00:28:17,955 --> 00:28:19,745
But that was...

365
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:21,575
I'd like to submit the

366
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:25,475
books that show Ms. Tae Hyeong Wook's purchase of drugs from the dealer,

367
00:28:25,475 --> 00:28:29,515
her SNS conversations and...

368
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:32,595
the purchase history as evidence.

369
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:51,415
 Defendant.

370
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:53,915
Do you know where this place is?

371
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:56,025
Yes, I do.

372
00:28:56,025 --> 00:29:00,975
This is the secret storage of the data about the cases you concealed and fabricated...

373
00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:03,875
also known as the "Library."

374
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,585
Is that true?

375
00:29:06,665 --> 00:29:09,175
There is no such fact.

376
00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:13,315
The case names that are written here...

377
00:29:13,315 --> 00:29:16,435
Are they the cases you were in charge of?

378
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:17,625
Yes.

379
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:20,405
They're cases I took charge of.

380
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:23,755
It was a case that caused a huge commotion in Korea in the past.

381
00:29:23,755 --> 00:29:27,705

The Humidifier Sterilizer case... that produced hundreds of victims.

382
00:29:31,255 --> 00:29:35,905
Do you remember Mr. Jo Byeong Soo, who was the defendant at the time?

383
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:38,915
I'm not sure because it's been too long.

384
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:42,895
We have here a statement written by Mr. Jo Byeong Soo

385
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:45,025
who was a manager at the research company then,

386
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:49,075
saying he received hundreds of millions won... to be tried in court

387
00:29:49,075 --> 00:29:51,785
instead of the actual person in charge in his own handwriting.

388
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:55,165
Defendant... didn't you get this memorandum...

389
00:29:55,165 --> 00:29:59,595
out of Mr. Jo Byeong Soo after you threatened and convinced him?

390
00:29:59,595 --> 00:30:01,805
No, I didn't.

391
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:04,635
Then why did you have these documents?

392
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:07,125
Why did you suddenly relocate your document storage...

393
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:10,015
right on the day search and seizure by the Prosecution began?

394
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:12,425
It's just a coincidence.

395
00:30:12,425 --> 00:30:15,815
I was just trying to discard old documents and

396
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:18,875
didn't even know about the issuance of the warrant.

397
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:21,955
Also, I didn't even know such contents were in those files.

398
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:25,155
Wasn't this your private space, Defendant?

399
00:30:25,155 --> 00:30:28,805
How could contents unknown to you be stored there?

400
00:30:28,805 --> 00:30:30,965
When you work as an attorney for a long time,

401
00:30:30,965 --> 00:30:35,295
you inevitably create... many enemies along the way.

402
00:30:35,295 --> 00:30:37,535
I'm guessing it might be the work of...

403
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,575
someone who held me in spite,

404
00:30:39,575 --> 00:30:42,645
to put me in a tight spot.

405
00:30:57,235 --> 00:31:01,035
You and I have met at the Library before.

406
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,065
I don't remember.

407
00:31:04,065 --> 00:31:07,405
You pointed a gun at me there, Defendant.

408
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:11,215
Attorney Oh Do Hwan of Law Firm Kangsan was there as well and

409
00:31:11,215 --> 00:31:15,775
you instigated Secretary Kang Shin Jo to murder Attorney Oh and me.

410
00:31:15,775 --> 00:31:18,035
Do you admit that?

411
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:20,725
They're baseless claims.

412
00:31:20,725 --> 00:31:22,755
I won't answer those kinds of questions.

413
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,435
You killed Prosecutor Park Jae Kyung, Defendant.

414
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:27,045
Was it because of the MP3?

415
00:31:27,045 --> 00:31:28,835
Prosecutor! This is a warning.

416
00:31:28,835 --> 00:31:32,765
Because the contents inside it mustn't be exposed to the world?

417
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,305
Did you commit such an act because no one should

418
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:37,575
know that you're a crazy psychopathic murderer?

419
00:31:37,575 --> 00:31:39,525
This is the court, Prosecutor.

420
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:41,495
Mind your statements.

421
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,365
Prosecutor! Let go of the mic and stand back!

422
00:31:45,365 --> 00:31:47,205
This is your last chance.

423
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,255
Tell the truth.

424
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:52,695
You've crossed the line, you little brat.
.

425
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:55,435
Why do you think you can talk to me like that?

426
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:58,235
I warned you. Go back to your seat!

427
00:31:58,235 --> 00:32:01,185
You can't beat me.

428
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:03,905
Haven't you run out of witnesses?

429
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:05,925
What if there's one more?

430
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:07,715
Oh Do Hwan?

431
00:32:09,185 --> 00:32:11,585
I'd like to request a witness, Your Honor.

432
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:15,025
He's an important witness who will expose the truth about the case.

433
00:32:21,915 --> 00:32:24,755
♫  Breathe in the air  ♫

434
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:27,855
Do you agree to have this witness?

435
00:32:27,855 --> 00:32:30,045
I agree.

436
00:32:30,045 --> 00:32:32,245
Very well, then.

437
00:32:32,245 --> 00:32:35,380
Who's the witness, Prosecutor?

438
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,555
♫  The world seems to be slowing down  ♫

439
00:32:40,555 --> 00:32:42,555
♫  With every step I take  ♫

00:33:26,575 --> 00:33:28,575
There are a lot more unopened surprises for you.

455

♫  Don't look back  ♫

♫  Yeah, I believe in me  ♫

460
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:14,005
 We're done wrapping up.

461
00:34:30,925 --> 00:34:34,505

462
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,025
 Hello?

463
00:34:47,765 --> 00:34:48,995
 Who did this?

464
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:50,575
 I called the ambulance.

465
00:34:50,575 --> 00:34:53,345
 I said who did this, you jerk!

466
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,625
 Seo Hyeon Gyu.

467
00:34:57,585 --> 00:34:59,245
 What?

468
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:17,045
 Mister...

469
00:35:32,535 --> 00:35:34,565
 What happened?

470
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:39,425
 I brought you here by the collar on your way to the afterlife.

471
00:35:49,635 --> 00:35:52,885
 Everyone thinks you're dead.

472
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:55,045
 No one knows about you being alive...

473
00:35:55,045 --> 00:35:56,995
 Not even Seo Hyeon Gyu.

474
00:36:04,555 --> 00:36:06,995
 Even Seo Hyeon Gyu doesn't know?

475
00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:08,675
 Yes.

476
00:36:13,285 --> 00:36:15,455
 - Jung... 
 - Yes.

477
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:17,155
 You...

478
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:21,485
 go and meet with Kim Tae Ho.

479
00:36:22,645 --> 00:36:27,055
 Go and tell him I'm dead.

480
00:36:27,055 --> 00:36:29,625
 If he finds out that he killed me, too,

481
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:32,315
 even that guy will be shaken up.

482
00:36:33,055 --> 00:36:38,795
 Seo Hyeon Gyu's weakness that Kim Tae Ho knows and me.

483
00:36:38,795 --> 00:36:40,965
 We'll strike...

484
00:36:42,095 --> 00:36:44,775
 Seo Hyeon Gyu with those two.

485
00:36:44,775 --> 00:36:46,375
Oath.

486
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:51,155
I, Park Jae Kyung, swear to state all facts without adding or hiding any details.

487
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:55,755
Should there be any false statements, I also swear to be punished for perjury.

488
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:07,615
Proceed with the examination of the witness.

489
00:37:10,205 --> 00:37:12,415
Let me ask you straight.

490
00:37:12,415 --> 00:37:15,745
Is the person who tried to kill you here?

491
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,660

492
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,525
Yes, he's here.

493
00:37:20,525 --> 00:37:25,215
It's CEO Seo who's sitting over there.

494
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:32,885
CEO Seo killed my family...

495
00:37:32,885 --> 00:37:34,405
and, on top of that,

496
00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:36,705
he also tried to kill me...

497
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:40,455
to bury his crimes.

498
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:45,125
A trial is a process of excavating the factual truth of an incident and

499
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:48,905
testimonies at a court are vital proof for confirming the facts.

500
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:52,995
Prosecutor Park's credibility is easily fulfilled by his position and

501
00:37:52,995 --> 00:37:54,799
please consider that there's no contradiction

502
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:59,872
or logical errors in the testimonies of all witnesses so far.

503
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:08,635
Defendant, is there anything you want to say?

504
00:38:11,465 --> 00:38:18,825
The witness' testimony doesn't secure any level of credibility.

505
00:38:18,825 --> 00:38:22,815
I'm submitting evidence to substantiate Prosecutor Park's testimony.

506
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:27,655
There's no other evidence enlisted here.

507
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:29,645
What is the evidence?

508
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:39,305
Finish him for good now.

509
00:38:39,305 --> 00:38:41,245
You bet.

510
00:38:44,775 --> 00:38:49,465
I'm submitting the blunt weapon the defendant used to attack the witness as evidence.

511
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:56,195
 Seo Hyeon Gyu will surely try to take this from me.

512
00:38:56,195 --> 00:39:00,555
 You take care of it for me until we get Seo Hyeon Gyu to stand trial.

513
00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:08,355
 He'd be more suspicious if he found out you don't have the evidence.

514
00:39:08,355 --> 00:39:10,995
 It's an easily obtainable item.

515
00:39:13,295 --> 00:39:15,755
 Made in Dongmyo. 9,700 won.

516
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:25,375
It's evidence that wasn't agreed upon.

517
00:39:26,215 --> 00:39:27,725
I can't accept it.

518
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:31,435
You're the one who talked about credibility, Defendant.

519
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:32,865
That evidence won't work.

520
00:39:32,865 --> 00:39:34,975
That evidence is fake.

521
00:39:34,975 --> 00:39:38,815
The Prosecution is mocking the court with fake evidence.

522
00:39:38,815 --> 00:39:41,555
What's your reason for claiming that the evidence is fake?

523
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:43,755
Did you try to destroy the evidence or something?

524
00:39:43,755 --> 00:39:45,565
That's certainly not true.

525
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:48,255
I'm submitting another piece of evidence.

526
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:54,775
I'm attaching the NFS report stating that

527
00:39:54,775 --> 00:40:00,258
the defendant's fingerprints and the witness' blood were found simultaneously.

528
00:40:05,325 --> 00:40:07,635
Do you still have something to say?

529
00:40:09,565 --> 00:40:11,855
T-This...

530
00:40:11,855 --> 00:40:14,555
this defendant is...

531
00:40:14,555 --> 00:40:19,645
from this moment on applying for the avoidance of justice challenge.

532
00:40:19,645 --> 00:40:21,725
I'm worried about an unfair trial because...

533
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:24,305
of the witness and evidence that were not agreed upon.

534
00:40:24,305 --> 00:40:28,235
- Pause the trial immediately and— 
 - Enough is enough!

535
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,925
Defendant Seo Hyeon Gyu is not an attorney.

536
00:40:35,925 --> 00:40:38,655
He's just a criminal who filled his greed and wealth

537
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:42,115
by concealing powerful people's crimes using the law.

538
00:40:42,115 --> 00:40:43,615
Defendant Seo Hyeon Gyu cruelly...

539
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:46,385
took the lives of people who dared to

540
00:40:46,385 --> 00:40:49,855
stand in his way, whoever it is.

541
00:40:49,855 --> 00:40:52,765
He committed crimes using his status as an attorney...

542
00:40:52,765 --> 00:40:56,015
and used the law to conceal those crimes.

543
00:40:56,015 --> 00:40:58,875
He allowed criminals not to be punished...

544
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:01,975
and solidified his power.

545
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:04,025
Article 11, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution.

546
00:41:04,025 --> 00:41:06,185
The law is fair to everyone.

547
00:41:06,185 --> 00:41:08,705
No one can cheat the law.

548
00:41:08,705 --> 00:41:10,155
Regardless of position,

549
00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:12,015
authority and state of being,

550
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:15,255
no one is allowed to stand above the law.

551
00:41:15,255 --> 00:41:17,578
Because the moment you let someone be an exception,

552
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:21,178
the law loses its worth of existence as the law.

553
00:41:21,965 --> 00:41:25,535
The law exists to protect the people.

554
00:41:27,245 --> 00:41:33,085
Clearly stating that it can't be used to benefit a particular individual,

555
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:36,785
this prosecutor sentences the defendant Seo Hyeon Gyu as follows.

556
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:41,705
He's been manipulating countless cases and mocking the judiciary.

557
00:41:41,705 --> 00:41:47,105
In the process, he has committed terrible crimes such as murder and instigated murder.

558
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:50,600
He was consistent with lies and sophistry throughout the trial

559
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,035
and showed no sign of remorse.

560
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:55,035
And including the fact that the bereaved families of the victims

561
00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:58,145
and the victims are demanding severe punishment,

562
00:41:58,145 --> 00:42:00,805
I request that the court...

563
00:42:00,805 --> 00:42:02,545
sentences the defendant Seo Hyeon Gyu

564
00:42:02,545 --> 00:42:05,525
to death, the capital punishment.

565
00:42:20,392 --> 00:42:24,255
 In the trial of Seo Hyung Gyu, CEO of Gangsan Law Firm this afternoon,

566
00:42:24,255 --> 00:42:27,715
 the prosecution demanded the death penalty, the gravest sentence in the court.

567
00:42:27,715 --> 00:42:30,185
 In addition, Seo Hyung Gyu's son Seo Ji Han

568
00:42:30,185 --> 00:42:32,465
 has been found to be the real culprit of the Seocho-dong murder,

569
00:42:32,465 --> 00:42:35,055
 which is shocking the public.

570
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:39,285
 The deep-rooted ties between the political, business, and legal circles

571
00:42:39,285 --> 00:42:42,895
 have been revealed through the incident, sparking a major stir.

572
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:47,185
 The court announced that it will conduct a full investigation of the cases from Kangsan law firm

573
00:42:47,185 --> 00:42:50,265
 and will conduct retrials as necessary.

574
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:53,265
 Our prosecution will thoroughly investigate

575
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:56,215
 all those involved in CEO Seo Hyung Gyu's library

576
00:42:56,215 --> 00:42:57,855
 and leave no room for doubt.

577
00:42:57,855 --> 00:43:00,312
 The Prosecution stated that they will

578
00:43:00,312 --> 00:43:05,199
 thoroughly investigate CEO Seo and everyone
who's linked to the Seo Hyeon Gyu-gate.

579
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,338
Return it.

580
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:10,818
Pass it on to the HR for me.

581
00:43:12,907 --> 00:43:14,960
I've done my duty.

582
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,193
I'm sick of being a prosecutor now.

583
00:43:18,193 --> 00:43:20,736
Is there a need to go this far?

584
00:43:20,736 --> 00:43:23,689
I should've quit a long time ago.

585
00:43:23,689 --> 00:43:29,702
My dead wife... used to constantly beg me to quit.

586
00:43:29,702 --> 00:43:31,792
It took me this long.

587
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:39,071

588
00:43:39,071 --> 00:43:41,880
I'll come over when I crave ramen.

589
00:43:44,396 --> 00:43:46,857
Must I see you even after quitting?

590
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,240
Don't come. I'm sick of you.

591
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,000
Hey, come on now.

592
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:55,998
Let me.

593
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:00,018
By the way, Jung.

594
00:44:00,018 --> 00:44:01,728
Yes?

595
00:44:02,938 --> 00:44:05,118
Wasn't there anything else...

596
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:08,179
in Seo Hyeon Gyu's Library?

597
00:44:09,106 --> 00:44:10,939
Like what?

598
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,819
I'm asking you, just in case.

599
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:16,219
As in your father's file.

600
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:44,479

601
00:44:44,479 --> 00:44:49,309

602
00:44:49,309 --> 00:44:55,089

603
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,750

604
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:25,479

605
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:42,569
 Dad! Dad...

606
00:45:44,379 --> 00:45:47,369
 Somebody help, please!

607
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:50,599
 My dad got hurt...

608
00:45:51,289 --> 00:45:53,369
 Dad...

609
00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:06,029
My heart was always heavy.

610
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,859
I wondered if he died because of me.

611
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:13,609
There weren't any.

612
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,659
Dad's case was an accident.

613
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:20,679
All right, you did a good job.

614
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,149
Good job.

615
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:52,699

616
00:46:55,429 --> 00:46:59,099

617
00:47:17,829 --> 00:47:22,599

618
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:34,099
Here...

619
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:32,059

620
00:48:37,909 --> 00:48:40,329
 I also want to become a swordsman!

621
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:52,399
 You knew already.

622
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:56,339
 I told you I'll become... a swordsman.

623
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:59,199
 I've been appointed to the Civil Service Division starting today.

624
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:00,819
 I'm Jin Jung.

625
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:03,309
 Welcome.

626
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,219
 I'm Park Jae Kyung.

627
00:49:32,429 --> 00:49:36,419

628
00:49:36,419 --> 00:49:38,779
 What does it say here?

629
00:49:40,669 --> 00:49:43,269
 It's my favorite phrase.

630
00:49:43,269 --> 00:49:48,199
 The evil can't... win against the righteous.

631
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:51,369
 Anti-justice cannot beat justice.

632
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:54,829
 Anti-justice cannot beat justice.

633
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:57,149
 Anti-justice cannot beat justice...

634
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:05,109

635
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:37,989
I heard you were expelled from the Bar.

636
00:50:37,989 --> 00:50:39,939
What will you do now?

637
00:50:40,959 --> 00:50:42,809
I'll need to think about it...

638
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:44,939
while doing some fishing.

639
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:49,289
Thanks.

640
00:50:49,289 --> 00:50:51,449
Including the matter with the Director...

641
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:53,339
and many other stuff.

642
00:50:56,139 --> 00:50:59,619
I couldn't become the same monster.

643
00:51:01,499 --> 00:51:03,879
This is the first time

644
00:51:03,879 --> 00:51:05,909
I heard you thanking me.

645
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,849
Man, I'm hungry.

646
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:15,519
We're not catching any.

647
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,229
Let's just go eat spicy seafood soup.

648
00:51:17,229 --> 00:51:19,249
Next time.

649
00:51:19,249 --> 00:51:22,979
I still feel a bit... awkward with you.

650
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:25,949
We have that in common.

651
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:33,839
It's your treat next time.

652
00:51:35,269 --> 00:51:36,769
I'm leaving.

653
00:51:42,389 --> 00:51:44,349
That was so mean of you.

654
00:51:44,349 --> 00:51:48,776
You should've given us a heads-up that Director was alive.

655
00:51:48,776 --> 00:51:50,849
I was so shocked that

656
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:53,749
I almost miscarried.

657
00:51:55,139 --> 00:51:56,939
You were a woman?

658
00:51:58,229 --> 00:52:00,629
Loosen up, yeah?

659
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:04,119
It was just a joke. A joke.

660
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:07,329
I'm also curious.

661
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:09,489
You told me after everything was over, too.

662
00:52:09,489 --> 00:52:11,029
Gosh,

663
00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:14,459
you know what they say. If you wish to deceive the enemy,

664
00:52:14,459 --> 00:52:17,429
deceive your friends first. Something like that...

665
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:19,389
Anyway, good job!

666
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:21,780
 Cheers!

673
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:47,729
No wonder the beer was sweet.

674
00:52:47,729 --> 00:52:49,609
Stop touching that!

675
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:52,549
I just fixed it, so...

676
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:55,339
So, lord...

677
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,979
Lord...

678
00:52:56,979 --> 00:52:59,469
I get angry... 
  (T/N: Sounds like part of the word for "peace")

679
00:52:59,469 --> 00:53:01,019
just looking at you.

680
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:02,569
Sorry?

681
00:53:02,569 --> 00:53:04,959
The peace in my heart. 
  (/N: Korean word for "peace" has a similar sound as "anger" in it)

682
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:08,429
Okay...

683
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:13,769
Whitey... let's go...

684
00:53:13,769 --> 00:53:16,209
Let's go, let's go.

What happened?

705
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:30,949
Prosecutor, well...

706
00:54:30,949 --> 00:54:32,849
please come this way.

What the heck is this?

712
00:54:51,996 --> 00:54:54,269
What the hell is- What the?

713
00:54:54,269 --> 00:54:55,939
You're here?

714
00:54:55,939 --> 00:54:58,089
What are you guys doing here?

715
00:54:58,089 --> 00:54:59,479
And Sunbae, why are you here?

716
00:54:59,479 --> 00:55:01,719
That's Deputy Chief, not Sunbae!

717
00:55:04,299 --> 00:55:05,399
What the?

718
00:55:05,399 --> 00:55:07,079
You're here?

719
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:09,849
You told me you were quitting...

720
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:12,119
I did. I did, but...

721
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:14,319
I came back because I was bored.

722
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:15,449
What?

723
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:19,689
I used my annual leave for the month I spent resting.

724
00:55:19,689 --> 00:55:21,789
Your seat's still there, so have a seat.

725
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,739
I finally returned to the Criminal Division, though.

726
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:27,439
You can get assigned cases here, too.

727
00:55:27,439 --> 00:55:30,499
You can continue to jump around like before.

728
00:55:30,499 --> 00:55:34,319
There's an order from the top. They chose you specifically for this case.

729
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,279
Me?

730
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:41,599

731
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,909
They said there's a limit with the standard prosecution method or something.

732
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:47,959
Why don't you get a feel for it?

733
00:55:47,959 --> 00:55:49,949
Completely using your own method.

734
00:55:51,869 --> 00:55:53,449
That's why they put me here?

735
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:57,949
We're a bit... freer than the Criminal Division, you know?

736
00:55:57,959 --> 00:56:00,209
The team's all set, so have fun.

737
00:56:00,209 --> 00:56:03,009
Instead... don't get caught.

738
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:09,549
The Miracle Mat! The Miracle Mat.

739
00:56:09,549 --> 00:56:11,829

Mom, Dad, have you heard of germanium?

740
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:13,779
- Of course. 
 - You have, right?

741
00:56:13,779 --> 00:56:16,639
This Miracle Mat...

742
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,119
Man, I shouldn't be selling them so cheap...

743
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,839
What?

744
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:23,629
I'm worried about the health of my mom and dads,

745
00:56:23,629 --> 00:56:25,599
so as a dutiful son,

746
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,149
I'll sell them for 99,000 won!

747
00:56:27,149 --> 00:56:28,639
- 99,000 won!
- I'll buy one!

748
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:29,609
Three?

749
00:56:29,609 --> 00:56:31,709
Buy some more. Take the money.

750
00:56:31,709 --> 00:56:34,389
Here, one for him!

751
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:44,089
- Hyungnim, nice shot! 
 - Hyungnim, nice shot.

752
00:56:44,089 --> 00:56:45,359
By the way, Hyungnim...

753
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:49,789
I heard the rumors say you did pretty well in Gangnam in the past.

754
00:56:49,789 --> 00:56:51,799
I did.

755
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:56,549
Once upon a time, in Gangnam, anything was possible

756
00:56:56,549 --> 00:56:59,359
when you say my name, Yoo Jin Chul.

757
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,709
But now, why are you like this...

758
00:57:04,779 --> 00:57:07,269
I-I'm sorry!

759
00:57:09,556 --> 00:57:11,859
There was a prosecutor.

760
00:57:11,859 --> 00:57:16,239
There was a crazy prosecutor bastard who carried around a wooden sword.

761
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:19,269
Whoa, good shot!

762
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,559
His voice was exactly like that.

763
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:23,059
Hey, Jin Chul, this place is nice.

764
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:26,219
The interior's neat, yeah?

765
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,659
This is nice.

766
00:57:28,659 --> 00:57:32,189
I guess I should've been a professional golfer. Look.

767
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:36,769
Look.

768
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:38,309
Did you see that?

769
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:41,499
How have you been?

770
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:44,079
Your face got spiffier.

771
00:57:47,929 --> 00:57:50,669
Hey. If you came out on probation,

772
00:57:50,669 --> 00:57:52,609
you should've lived quietly, reflecting on yourself.

773
00:57:52,609 --> 00:57:55,849
How dare you con the elderly like that?

774
00:57:55,849 --> 00:57:57,789
Prosecutor, are you my stalker?

775
00:57:57,789 --> 00:57:59,369
Why do you only chase me around?

776
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:01,509
You think I'm chasing you around? Huh?

777
00:58:01,509 --> 00:58:04,049
You happen to be wherever I go.

778
00:58:04,049 --> 00:58:05,619
Forget it.

779
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:06,889
Let's start with a beating.

780
00:58:06,889 --> 00:58:09,589
This is the only way you can rehabilitate.

781
00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:11,769
You know what your biggest problem is?

782
00:58:11,769 --> 00:58:15,429
You view me too lightly, you know that?

783
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,169
Guys!

784
00:58:22,489 --> 00:58:23,889
Pretty awesome, huh?

785
00:58:23,889 --> 00:58:26,149
You're pulling all the stops, man.

786
00:58:26,149 --> 00:58:28,449
Are you here to look at flowers?

787
00:58:28,449 --> 00:58:30,059
I...

788
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:33,009
knew I'd meet you again like this one day.

789
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,319
These are the mercenaries I prepared for that day.

790
00:58:35,319 --> 00:58:40,739
You...are...dead meat today.

791
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:41,859
All right, fine.

792
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:44,939
If you're done talking, let's begin.

793
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:46,659
Hey, wait.

794
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:48,399
Wait, wait.

795
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,089
- Yes, Senior? 
  - Jin Jung!

796
00:58:50,089 --> 00:58:51,849
Where are you right now?

797
00:58:51,849 --> 00:58:54,189
I heard you went to catch Yoo Jin Chul!

798
00:58:54,189 --> 00:58:56,089
If you answer your own question,

799
00:58:56,089 --> 00:58:58,329
what am I supposed to say?

800
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:02,619
Well, s-should we w-wait for him?

801
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:05,459
Return immediately.

802
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,709
Come on, Senior.

803
00:59:07,709 --> 00:59:09,979
I-I told you, I'm Deputy Chief, now!

804
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:11,489
Deputy Chief Shin! Deputy Chief Shin!

805
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:14,179
All right, Deputy Chief Shin Sunbae! You happy?

806
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:15,819
And he's a bad egg!

807
00:59:15,819 --> 00:59:17,699
How can I just sit back and watch him

808
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:20,149
take the elderly's pocket money?

809
00:59:20,149 --> 00:59:21,839
Who said to just sit and watch?

810
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,479
I sent over the police force,

811
00:59:23,479 --> 00:59:25,299
 so you should hurry up and come back.

812
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:27,019
"I'm Jin Jung."

813
00:59:27,019 --> 00:59:29,309
Cut that crap and come in.

814
00:59:29,309 --> 00:59:33,299
If you don't, be prepared to process civil complaints your entire-

815
00:59:34,306 --> 00:59:36,139
Hello?

816
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:37,469
Jin Jung?

817
00:59:38,459 --> 00:59:39,919
Prosecutor Jin?

818
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:44,719
- Oh, come on.
- Hey! We don't have much time.

819
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:45,939
I'm only going to beat you up.

820
00:59:45,939 --> 00:59:47,719
Hey, get him!

821
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:50,519
- Hurry, hurry! 
 - Got it? Just you.

822
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:52,219
Look.

823
00:59:52,219 --> 00:59:53,689
Okay?

824
00:59:53,689 --> 00:59:55,079
Die!

825
00:59:57,409 --> 00:59:59,139
Don't come. Don't come!

826
00:59:59,139 --> 01:00:01,399
- At once! All at once!
- Don't come.

827
01:00:01,399 --> 01:00:03,299
- He's strong! 
 - Hey, stay put!

828
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,409
Why should we stay put?

829
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:06,989
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

830
01:00:06,989 --> 01:00:09,529
- Hey, he's coming here! 
 - Whoa!

831
01:00:12,759 --> 01:00:14,459
- Hey! 
 - Whoa, hold on.

832
01:00:14,459 --> 01:00:15,959
- Where are you going? Come here. 
 - I can't, I can't!

833
01:00:15,959 --> 01:00:17,349
Get him!

834
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:18,609
D*** it!

835
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:22,799
- Come here.
- Hold on, hold on!

836
01:00:24,149 --> 01:00:25,909
I mean...

837
01:00:27,399 --> 01:00:28,759
Let's talk it out.

838
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:33,209
What's wrong?

839
01:00:39,879 --> 01:00:42,089
♫  Let the best man win!  ♫

840
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:45,559

841
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,749
♫  I pay back crap with a s***  ♫

842
01:00:47,749 --> 01:00:50,039
♫  Magic of the real sword, I dig into all the hideouts  ♫

843
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:52,549
♫  This ahjumma told me to write one more letter of apology  ♫

844
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:55,259
♫  The protagonist does the work here  
 and issues the arrest warrant  ♫

845
01:00:55,259 --> 01:00:57,219
♫  An unfathomable crazy prosecutor  ♫

846
01:00:57,219 --> 01:00:58,699
♫  Rip the subpoena  ♫

847
01:00:58,699 --> 01:01:01,999
♫  You'd rather live in your fantasy, lock up all the bad guys  ♫

848
01:01:01,999 --> 01:01:04,339
♫  Consider the circumstances my a**, beat 
 the hell out of the underling  ♫

849
01:01:04,339 --> 01:01:06,159
♫  I hold a sword, but doesn't mean I'm a swordsman  ♫

850
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:09,009
♫  Full of ambition, up to death's door, why not the drama?  ♫

851
01:01:09,009 --> 01:01:11,219
♫  Kids wander as if they're holding off their credit card debts  ♫

852
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:13,389

853
01:01:13,389 --> 01:01:15,219
How did it go?

854
01:01:15,219 --> 01:01:18,189
 He says you should stay on the down low for now.

855
01:01:18,189 --> 01:01:19,429
For how long?

856
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:21,209
 Until Prosecutor Jin is taken care of.

857
01:01:21,209 --> 01:01:23,299
Tell Chairman Park.

858
01:01:23,299 --> 01:01:27,149
Stop annoying me and get me out of here first!

859
01:01:27,149 --> 01:01:30,329
 And Chairman also wants to tell you this.

860
01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:32,129
 "Stay quiet."

861
01:01:32,129 --> 01:01:34,849
 If you don't want to retire permanently.

862
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:40,289

863
01:01:40,289 --> 01:01:44,100
