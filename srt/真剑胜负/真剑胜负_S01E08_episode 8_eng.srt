1
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,420

2
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,500
Excuse me, you can't just barge in—

3
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,920
It's okay. Just stay outside.

4
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,820
I don't recall having agreed to meet you.

5
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,160
I think you're being too rude.

6
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,690
I'm leaving in five minutes.

7
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:12,123
There's a National Prosecutor Generals' Conference at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

8
00:01:12,123 --> 00:01:14,313
Hurry up and say what you need to say.

9
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,223
This is Prosecutor Jin. Call the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

10
00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:24,670
The Prosecutor General won't be able to make it.

11
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,870
Mr. Kim Tae Ho, you are under immediate arrest for

12
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,080
concealing murder, instigated fabrication of evidence,

13
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,310
threatening, abduction, and attempted instigated murder.

14
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,770
What?

15
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,970
Cuff him up.

16
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,920
I told you, didn't I?

17
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,050
You're done for now.

18
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,790
Why did you do it?

19
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,800
I'm asking out of pure curiosity.

20
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,990
What the hell

21
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,290
were you trying to gain by being loyal to someone,

22
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,640
to the point of throwing away your sense of duty as a prosecutor?

23
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,170
Sense of duty?

24
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,010
Did we ever have it in the first place?

25
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:54,760
We're nothing but hounds of the authority whose master changes every five years, aren't we?

26
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,560
I needed power because I wanted to break free.

27
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,450
To be a strong Prosecution that doesn't answer to anyone.

28
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,420
I needed the power to rise to a position where I could make that a reality.

29
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,970
To fight authority, you got help from another man in power?

30
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,570
It just sounds to me like you chose a different master.

31
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,120
There is a thing called a necessary evil.

32
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,300
I just did my best to protect the organization.

33
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,250
I wasn't wrong, Prosecutor Jin.

34
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,000
No. You were wrong.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,560
To protect the Prosecution?

36
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,940
Who are you to protect us?

37
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,870
Don't be mistaken, Mr. Kim Tae Ho.

38
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,940
Neither power nor positions protect us.

39
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,750
Only the law and the people protect us.

40
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,250
I'll prove to you

41
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,940
just how wrong that shallow conviction of yours is.

42
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,160
I'll show you how easily that so-called power you believe in

43
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,020
can crumble down.

44
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,260
You think you're right, don't you?

45
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,320
Even if each individual prosecutor is the same as a government office,

46
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,410
hierarchy still exists among prosecutors.

47
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:19,020
Even if obeying the higher order is a deeply rooted problem of the Prosecution,

48
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,190
it's a clear fact that it's the essential leading power of the Prosecution so far.

49
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,260
You probably think of yourself as righteous, but you're not, Prosecutor Jin.

50
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,710
When looking at the organization as a whole,

51
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,770
you're nothing more than just a defect,

52
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,160
one rotten apple in a barrel,

53
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,670
or a confounding species ruining us all. Nothing more, nothing less.

54
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,070
Look at what you've done so far.

55
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,240
Our organization as a whole is crumbling down because of you.

56
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,520
If we end up losing all of our power and authority,

57
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,640
who would ever stay in the next generation of the Prosecution?

58
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,800
Only the true prosecutors.

59
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:16,370

60
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,530

61
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,070

62
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,910

63
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,320
Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan?

64
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,490
We're from the Supreme Prosecution's Inspection Department.

65
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,530
Please come with us quietly.

66
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,160
This way, please.

67
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,580
Let us go.

68
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,840
Were you ever ordered separately by Prosecutor General regarding

69
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,950
the fabrication of Chief Lee Jang Won's case?

70
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,660
Never.

71
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,530
Have you ever blackmailed the NFS's medical examiner, who conducted the autopsy

72
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,140
on Chief Lee Jang Won, to lie under oath?

73
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,960
Never.

74
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,180
Look here, Prosecutor Oh.

75
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,040
Are you kidding me?

76
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,720
The rumors about you being Prosecutor General

77
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,380
Kim Tae Ho's underling is widespread even here at the Supreme Prosecution.

78
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,840
So does it make sense that you didn't know anything at all?

79
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,240
I didn't know.

80
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,550
You're one shameless jerk.

81
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,960
Don't you know where this is?

82
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,830
This is the Supreme Prosecution's Inspection Department, you jerk!

83
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,690
It's a place where you can't leave until you lose your job.

84
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,120

85
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,150
The Inspection Department conducted a search and seizure.

86
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,900
Everything will come out after shaking you up anyway

87
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,850
and you're bound to wear the jumpsuit.

88
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,600

89
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,390

90
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,010

91
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,070

I checked the alibis on four out of the five people from the drug dealer's list.

92
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,760
The last one left is...

93
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,500
Tae Hyeong Wook, Secretary Director of Kangsan Law Firm.

94
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,880
It's hard to get a warrant with just the drug dealer's list.

95
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,880
The evidence itself was illegally obtained and

96
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,770
the correlation between the suspect and the crime isn't certain, either.

97
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,330
Sometimes, taking it head-on is the answer.

98
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,100
Let's just hear what they have to say first.

99
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,820
What do you mean?

100
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,170
Could you give me a heads-up next time?

101
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,940
Let's go inside.

102
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,690

103
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,830
How may I help you?

104
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,310
We're here to see the Secretary Director, Tae Hyeong Wook.

105
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,020
May I have your name, please?

106
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,880
- My name's Jin Jung. 
 - Mr. Jin Jung, okay.

107
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,560
Have you made an appointment prior to your visit?

108
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,910
No. We just barged in.

109
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,020
I'm sorry.

110
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,370
It's impossible to meet the Director without an appointment in advance.

111
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,920
Is that so?

112
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,190
Then I'll make an appointment right now.

113
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,090
A priority reservation as soon as possible, please.

114
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,150
- Are we at a karaoke or something? 
 - What?

115
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,070
What is this about?

116
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,230
We meet again, Prosecutor.

117
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,590
- And this is...? 
 - Who's this?

118
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,410
I'm Seo Ji Han. You can speak to me.

119
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,990
Should we?

120
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,030
Hold on. One moment, please.

121
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,870
You think Director Tae murdered the Chief Prosecutor?

122
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:24,830
I'm sorry, but I think we'll need time to look into this and sort this out on our end as well.

123
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,550
If it's not too much to ask, could we end the meeting for the day—

124
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,790
Attorney Seo Ji Han, I won't say this again.

125
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,990
Stop giving me excuses and bring her here.

126
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:42,630
You are not being polite, Prosecutor Jin Jung.

127
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,930
I don't think I need to be in this situation.

128
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,190
What if I won't let you see her?

129
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,960
If you don't let me see her,

130
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,200
I'll just have reasonable doubt

131
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,380
to think that Law Firm Kangsan is deeply involved with the Chief's case.

132
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,970
Understood.

133
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,350
I'll let you see her.

134
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,190
Thank you.

135
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,470
Please tell Director Tae to come up.

136
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,700
Did you call for me?

137
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,080
Your name came up on a drug dealer's list, Director.

138
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,640
It's for the same drug that was found in the deceased Chief Lee Jang Won's body.

139
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,450
Please explain.

140
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,820
I know nothing about that matter.

141
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,720
"I know nothing about that matter?"

142
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
Is that all?

143
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,890
My personal information could have been leaked.

144
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,650
That's all I can tell you.

145
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,280
Do you know Chief Prosecutor Lee Jang Won?

146
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,820
I saw him on the news.

147
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,170
- What about personally? 
 - I don't know him.

148
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,830
Between 10 and 11 at night on the day of the Chief Prosecutor

149
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,410
Lee Jang Won's death, what were you doing?

150
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,980
I thought it was a simple interview,

151
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,130
but I see it is an interrogation.

152
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,150
You're deflecting my question.

153
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,750
That's because I feel like you already decided that I'm the culprit while asking me this.

154
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,030
It's also a question to remove you from the suspect list.

155
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,080
I was exercising after leaving work.

156
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,120
If you need it, I'll send you the CCTV footage as an alibi.

157
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,380
Unless you have more questions,

158
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,600
may I take my leave now?

159
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,530
Sure.

160
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,930
Director Tae Hyeong Wook.

161
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,170
What are you doing?

162
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,130
Hey, Prosecutor Jin!

163
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,170
I apologize. I was mistaken.

164
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,130
That was extremely rude of me.

165
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,040
I sincerely apologize.

166
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,030
Are you out of your mind?

167
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,320
What are you going to do if Tae Hyeong Wook sues you or something?

168
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,550
- Why the heck would you do something that crazy? 
 - She's the one.

169
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,140
- What? 
 - A normal person would've

170
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,160
at least closed their eyes in that situation,

171
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,900
 but she didn't.

172
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,430
She didn't even bet an eye.

173
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,090
She's a professional.

174
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,730
Even if your claim is true, all we have is a suspicion.

175
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,760
Leave the possibility open—

176
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,140
Prosecutor Jin Jung, from the Central District Prosecutors' Office?

177
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,040
Who might you be?

178
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,200
Goodness, it's an honor to meet you.

179
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,800
I'm Seo Hyeon Gyu, the CEO here.

180
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,460
How do you know me?

181
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,640
How could I not know?

182
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,130
You're the one who sent Prosecutor General Kim Tae Ho to prison.

183
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,870
Actually, backstabbing a member of your family isn't...

184
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,530
something that normal folks can do.

185
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,870
You're as amazing as the rumors I've heard.

186
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,900
Thank you for the compliment.

187
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,830
Please contact us whenever.

188
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,570
I'll prepare an office for you with a great view.

189
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,440
I'll only thank you for the offer.

190
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,870
Bye.

191
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,170

Director Tae Hyeong Wook of Law Firm Kangsan.

192
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,380
Director Tae Hyeong Wook?

193
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,840
 Yes. Find anything that's related to her.

194
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,830
Collect everything that you can possibly find about her life.

195
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,400
From the day of the Chief's death to today,

196
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,470
 look into her location history and alibis.

197
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,250
Okay, I understand.

198
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,360
Secretary Director Tae Hyeong Wook of Law Firm Kangsan.

199
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,870
There must be a flaw somewhere, whether it's her testimony or her alibi.

200
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,040
If she really is the culprit, that is.

201
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,490
We just need one thing, whatever it is.

202
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,350
Just one piece of evidence that we can use to tie her down.

203
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,240
She dropped a person to death from the 11th floor.

204
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,870
A person who was alive and well.

205
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,410
I'm going to catch her, no matter what.

206
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,850
Why would you be the one to catch her?

207
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,510
Let's get her together.

208
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,010
Why? Who is it?

209
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,570

210
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,250
- Yes, Mom. 
  - Son...

211
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,800
 why is it so hard to hear your voice? I thought you were dead.

212
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,590
Well, no, that isn't true.

213
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,070
I was going to call you, but—

214
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,480
 Run over here unless you want to die.

215
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,360
But Mom, I'm a little busy, so—

216
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,220

217
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,440
Gosh...

218
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,480
Do you want to eat?

219
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,640

220
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,490
Gosh, had I known an important guest was coming,

221
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,370
I would've gone grocery shopping, at least.

222
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,070
I'm sorry, there's nothing much to eat.

223
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,600
No, not at all. This is enough.

224
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,450
- Thank you for the food. 
 - Gosh... my goodness.

225
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,370
I thought only your face was beautiful,

226
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,840
but you're so polite on top of it.

227
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,680
What's your name, by the way?

228
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,040
My name's Shin Ah Ra.

229
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,900
Shin Ah Ra...

230
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,150
Have you eaten, Mother?

231
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,070
If you haven't, please join us.

232
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,070
How could you also be so considerate?

233
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,530
It's still a meal between a man and a woman,

234
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,930
so an elderly butting-in wouldn't look too good, right?

235
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,740
Yes. You're right.

236
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,093
Leave, Mom.

237
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:03,923
You just cook the meat.

238
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,090
No, I like to eat with elders.

239
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,390
Please take a seat.

240
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,290
Okay, then, please don't mind me.

241
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,120
Forgive me for being rude, but how old are you?

242
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,230
- I'm 34 years old. 
 - Oh, my.

243
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,700
How could you—

244
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,440
I thought you were 20 years old!

245
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,090
Because you have such a nice complexion!

246
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,820
- Twenty years old? 
 - Yes.

247
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,110
Twenty years old?

248
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,860
You look way younger to me, Mother.

249
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,980
I was so shocked...

250
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,060
because Prosecutor Jin called you "Mom."

251
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,280
My goodness! I do look younger than my age.

252
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,570
It's all cooked. Eat up now.

253
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,080
This is the best meat in my restaurant.

254
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,570
It's so delicious.

255
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,130
It's delicious, isn't it? Please help yourself.

256
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,940
Are you married yet?

257
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,680
Married? I couldn't even date because I was too busy with work.

258
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,850
- What do you think about dating a younger man? 
 - Only up to five years younger!

259
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,850
- Whoa! Dating younger men is the trend nowadays. 
 - I love it.

260
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,220
How was Prosecutor Jin when he was a kid?

261
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,080
What do you think he was like?

262
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,880
Well... I don't think he was ordinary, if anything.

263
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,780
He was quite the kid.

264
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,030
He'd fall from the fourth floor while hanging on the window

265
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,640
to save a cat that was on the rails.

266
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,530
He'd get hit by a car while picking up a ball for a kid.

267
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,560
I thought I needed to take him to the hospital at first.

268
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,700
Because he never cared for himself and only for others.

269
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,370
That's just like him.

270
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,400
He also got in a lot of fights.

271
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,340
He said fists were the answer to turn bad guys into humans.

272
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,400
He could never stand the sight of someone bullying the weak, whether it be a student or a teacher.

273
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,780
Paying back ten times what was done to him and

274
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,620
if that doesn't work, he'd pay back a hundred times.

275
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,390
He's just like his dad.

276
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,640
What about Jung's father?

277
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,890
An accident. When he was 12 years old.

278
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,500
I'm sorry for asking.

279
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,210
It's an old story. It's fine.

280
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,700
Don't worry about it.

281
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,460
Well...Thank you so much for the meal today.

282
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,550
No, you don't!

283
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,110
I'd be upset if you did this.. .between us.

284
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,180
Where's your house?

285
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,250
Son! Jung!

286
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,520
Why? I'm washing the grill, and I didn't even get to eat.

287
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,090
Fetch a cab for Prosecutor Shin. Come here quickly.

288
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,510
There's a cab application. She just needs to call one right here.

289
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,970
Hurry!

290
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,650
Okay.

291
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,910
Let's go.

292
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,860
What kind of a person was your father?

293
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,030
He was a good person...

294
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,430
who I really wanted to take after.

295
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,250
He was a very cool and strong person.

296
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,310
It was a car accident...

297
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,690
right in front of me.

298
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,730
 I still remember it every now and then.

299
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,120
 What if I had held back...

300
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,140
my dad for just five seconds back then?

301
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,540
Then my mom wouldn't have had to cry.

302
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,960
I was determined after my father's funeral.

303
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,240
"I should never cry again."

304
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,920
"I'm never going to make my family

305
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,860
and my people cry ever again."

306
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:00,130
You're going to have to live diligently to do your father's part as well.

307
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,940
Thank you so much for the food today.

308
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,830
Please get home safe.

309
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,990
Jung...

310
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,290
your father's probably happy to see who you are now.

311
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,440
Thank you. Take care.

312
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,550
- I'll be going. 
 - Okay.

313
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,530
♫  Deep, deep, the more you hide  ♫

314
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,930

315
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,420
♫  Okay, let go of your hands  ♫

316
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,330
♫  Just do that, I can't stand it any longer  ♫

317
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,070
Then the killer... was trying to find something out from the Chief?

318
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,790
♫  Look forward to the big picture I've drawn so far  ♫

319
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,530
♫  As you did, no more than that  ♫

320
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:18,310

321
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:22,200
 Prior to the incident, Father went to meet someone.

322
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,480
 He said he needed to give him something.

323
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,970
 It was a yellow envelope.

324
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,200
♫  I'm going off the deep end, even if I'm out of breath  ♫

325
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,070
 What you said a long time ago was right.

326
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,350
 "A monster must be killed...

327
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,060
 not controlled with a leash."

328
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,770
♫  You can't bring me down  ♫

329
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:49,850
 Anyhow... the sword handle is in your hands now.

330
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,580
 Go ahead and give it a good swing.

331
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,020
I'll put it to good use.

332
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,400
By the way, who are you guys, and why are you here?

333
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,050
W-Well...

334
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,773
the Prosecutor said let's use this space as the office starting today.

335
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:38,153
What...

336
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Where's Prosecutor Jin?

337
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,760
Hey.

338
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,630
Are we doing a community meeting or something?

339
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,310
Why do you let people irrelevant to the Prosecution in as you please?

340
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,360
Make them leave right now.

341
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,520
Why are you discouraging my guys?

342
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,150
They're all helpful for the investigation.

343
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,020
You can just make something up for reporting.

344
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,100
Just call them external advisors or something.

345
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,670
Come on, let's just come to terms.

346
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,760
Come to terms, my butt.

347
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,230
What exactly do they do?

348
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,260
Hey, Chul Ki, get ready.

349
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,000
Hurry up and introduce them.

350
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,690
Why did you call me over?

351
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,640
So you can listen together.

352
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,550
Are we at a theater?

353
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,430
Hurry up and start.

354
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,540
I'll start then.

355
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,290
The name's Baek Eun Ji.

356
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,340
Twenty-eight years old.

357
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,190
She's the only daughter of the nationwide White Bear gang's boss.

358
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,440
Really?

359
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,100
It's quite the variety from the beginning.

360
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,850
 She suddenly stated her retirement while gaining fame

361
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,610
 as the gang's second boss and sword.

362
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,320
 Although she has cut all ties now,

363
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,530
her nickname is passed down in the black market like a legend.

364
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:14,460
The name that was given since she fights with a raptor scissor...

365
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,760
Bongcheon-dong Velociraptor.

366
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,030
Whoa...

367
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,790
The dinosaur that comes out in the movies?

368
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,990
Wait, her dad's a bear, but how is she a dinosaur?

369
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,870
Do you know what's even funnier?

370
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,430

371
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,230
 Number Three is called Ssangmun-dong T-Rex.

372
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,450
 Are you okay?

373
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,250
 Go fight! Go now!

374
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,480
 Whoa... this...

375
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,790
 His name comes from the fact

376
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,750
 that his limbs are short although he has a big face.

377
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,880
- And Number Four is... 
 - Cheonha-dong Triceratops— 
 - Enough. Next.

378
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,060

379
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,060
The name's Go Joong Do.

380
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,540
He is...

381
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,040
28 years old.

382
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,750
2-28 years old?

383
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,500
Saying that to my face hurts my feelings.

384
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,150
Why? How is he 28 years old?

385
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,790
I'm still trying to find out.

386
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,470
I'll finish finding out the cause in the near future.

387
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,030
What do you mean "find out the cause"?

388
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,250
It's not like I have a problem.

389
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,100
Boss, please say something.

390
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,580
What can I say? You don't look like you're 28.

391
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,130
Don't say he's older than you.

392
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,140
Is it against the law to state the facts?

393
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,100
How else can I put it?

394
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,450
Don't you like younger men?

395
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,150
I hate them. A lot.

396
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,150
Although the years haven't been kind to him,

397
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,390
he is smarter than you think.

398
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,700
 Winning the Codegate Hacking Defense Competition five years in a row,

399
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,500
 and most recently, the main culprit of NIS Hacking Terror-

400
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,940
National Intelligent Service?

401
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,750
You crazy bastard—

402
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,100
He's the cousin of the main culprit.

403
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,570
It worked!

404
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,940
- I won! 
 - Crap...

405
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,560
My aunt's son won.

406
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,920
You should've kept talking then. I was shocked

407
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,490
because you stopped in the middle, you punk!

408
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:25,820
I mean... it was for the dramatic effect...

409
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,030
I'm sorry.

410
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,010
What was Go Joong Do's place?

411
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:33,840
He was the... 41st out of 82 people.

412
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
It's ambiguous.

413
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
Is he good or bad?

414
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,510
I'm in the middle. Right in the middle.

415
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,560
Hey, Prosecutor Jin why do you need a guy like him in the company?

416
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,630
Him? He's a meat shield.

417
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,980
Come on...

418
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,700
How can you say that?

419
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,470
With that, my presentation is over.

420
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,210
- That's enough. Right? 
 - So now...

421
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,890
who are these kids?

422
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,920
They're my friends.

423
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,380

424
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,860

425
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,850
Honestly, I was surprised.

426
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,630
I didn't think you'd contact me this quickly.

427
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,470
Your situation at the Prosecution must be pretty bad.

428
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,430
I came to see CEO Seo Hyeon Gyu.

429
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:34,880
That's a little too much to ask just because you got his business card.

430
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,943
You can speak to me.

431
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:41,343
Despite the looks, I'm in charge of my father's door lock.

432
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,810
I'll speak to CEO Seo personally.

433
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,190
You still have your pride?

434
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,100
This is an interview, Prosecutor Oh.

435
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,320
What are you going to do if I just cross out your

436
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,610
resume because of your stiff neck?

437
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:02,190
I assume you have already finished scanning my father's character.

438
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:06,050
That's why you came.
To ask my father for his help, isn't that true?

439
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,070
Try saying you're sorry with your head on the ground.

440
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:20,890
One of my bucket lists is...

441
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,460
making a prosecutor put his head on the ground.

442
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,350
What are you doing? Hurry up and do it.

443
00:30:32,337 --> 00:30:36,310
Your lifeline... is in my hands.

444
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,800

445
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,960
 Check the footage of my car's black box.

446
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,290
 Gosh, what a problem for you, Prosecutor?

447
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,620
 You got the totally wrong destination.

448
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,480
 Chief Lee Jang Won... isn't the culprit.

449
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,730
 The real culprit is someone else.

450
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,220

451
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,360

452
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,330
I'm seeing you often.

453
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,780
I had something to say.

454
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:08,630
I met Chief Lee Jang Won... one day before he passed away.

455
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:12,270
What CEO Seo Hyeon Gyu is looking for...

456
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,440
He gave it to me.

457
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,310
Why are you telling me this?

458
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,720
It's a little weird for me to contact him directly.

459
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,380
Please pass my words on to him.

460
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,800
Do you realize what you're saying?

461
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,940
So... you're going to do a rematch with Seo Hyeon Gyu with that item?

462
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,670
After getting done like that before?

463
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,440
Well, now...

464
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:55,337
I have nothing more to lose.

465
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:57,117
Jae Kyung...

466
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,580
You could really die.

467
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,930
I already died once...

468
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,050
when I let my wife...

469
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,740
and my son go before me.

470
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,980
We're done talking, so I'll be leaving now.

471
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,190
Good luck with the trial...

472
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,600
Also, Tae Ho...

473
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,410
I'm sure you know better than anyone,

474
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,870
but don't trust Seo Hyeon Gyu too much.

475
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,500

476
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,610
Prosecutor General Kim Tae Ho at the Detention Center has called.

477
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,600
The CEO is in a meeting right now.

478
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,640
Now, this person...

479
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,590
Her name is Tae Hyeong Wook.

480
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,450
She's 32 years old.

481
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,210
Secretary Director of CEO Seo Hyeon Gyu of Law Firm Kangsan.

482
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,650
Currently, as CEO Seo's right-hand woman,

483
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:59,150
she follows wherever the CEO goes.

484
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,210
Does she even follow him to the bathroom?

485
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,160
It's a joke. Come on.

486
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,390
Before this, she served seven years in the Army Special Mission Team.

487
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:13,110
Her main missions were... anti-terror, punishment, and retaliation.

488
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:17,210
She went on confusing the enemy rear forces and short-term blow missions for seven years...

489
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,300
Wow, who is this woman?

490
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,430
Is she the main character from a movie?

491
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,000
What about the thing I told you to look into?

492
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,350
Well, nothing special in her current location history.

493
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,270
Her alibi is also certain.

494
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:33,010
Prosecutor... this is the CCTV footage from the fitness center.

495
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,954
Chul Ki hyung, I'm not done yet...

496
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,300
This is the CCTV footage at 11 o'clock.

497
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,910
At the time of the Chief's death...

498
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,430
Tae Hyeong Wook was at the center.

499
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,020
Was Prosecutor Jin wrong this time?

500
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,840
Be quiet!

501
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,700
I didn't think it was going to be easy.

502
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,630
Keep an eye on Tae Hyeong Wook for now...

503
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,170
- but let's think about other possibilities— 
 - Wait, Jin Jung.

504
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:08,000
Look here at the clock.

505
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,830
It's 11 o'clock. What about it?

506
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,330
If Tae Hyeong Wook really worked out at 11,

507
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:19,290
then the clock shown here shouldn't be 11 o'clock.

508
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,160
It's reflected. What we're seeing is the reflection.

509
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,520
Then the actual time of Tae Hyeong Wook's workout was... one o'clock in the morning.

510
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,900
It's two hours after the Chief's death.

511
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,340
It's more than enough time to leave the scene.

512
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,440
What about the timeline? It was recorded at 11 o'clock.

513
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,010
Oh, it was fabricated!

514
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:42,780
Prosecutor Jin... perhaps the one who tried to kill you and the examiner was also...

515
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,680
Sterile gloves...

516
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,710
It's probably the same one.

517
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,960
However, inferring that they're the same person just by the appearance from behind

518
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,963
is a little hasty, isn't it?

519
00:37:57,963 --> 00:38:01,213
She left the syringe she used on the Chief at my house.

520
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,360
The one who stabbed me at the abandoned factory also had the same gloves.

521
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,620
But we don't have the evidence, you know?

522
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,470
We'll start looking now.

523
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,100
This one first.

524
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,050

525
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,020

526
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,820

Hurry up and get in.

527
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,812
I looked up the license plate, and it was a stolen car.

528
00:38:36,812 --> 00:38:40,152
Tracking down its whereabouts would still be possible, don't you think?

529
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,590
Can I fall for you, Senior?

530
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,170
Wait...

531
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,700
I mean...

532
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,550
it depends.

533
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,000
All right.

534
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,670
Let's move.

535
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,100
You're working out hard.

536
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,700
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

537
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,100
Let's get to work.

538
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,880
Boss, let's have a word.

539
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,970
It's quite rude to talk to someone in the middle of a workout.

540
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,080
That's indeed rude. Let's go.

541
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,080
Okay, okay.

542
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,010
I'll talk to him. Okay.

543
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:04,660
Boss... take a break and have a word with me.

544
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,520
Gosh...

545
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,010
You know... t-this person, don't y-you?

546
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,940
Yes. I do, but why?

547
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,680
Yes. I do, but why?

548
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,140
You take care of all the CCTVs in the gym, correct?

549
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,380
Yes, but why... do you people care?

550
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,240
Why?

551
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,750
What's the matter with this lady?

552
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,270
What?

553
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:45,800
Stop muttering and talk.

554
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,550
Come on...

555
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,370
Hey...

556
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,670
is it really necessary to go this far?

557
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,580
Come on, you're a man.

558
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,390
Don't be a coward.

559
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:08,010
If we just cover up the top with dirt, no one will know, so quit worrying.

560
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,390
I mean, if you cover the top with dirt...

561
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,970
So what I'm saying is... like...

562
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,930
Never mind. It's fine. Just do what you want to do.

563
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,820
Well, Eun Ji...

564
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:26,280
are you really going to cut ties with the Big Boss?

565
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,400
Even so...

566
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,410
aren't you two related by blood, not water?

567
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,050
I'm not going.

568
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,640
Bury Prosecutor Jin... in your heart and...

569
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,420
let's go back, please.

570
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:48,690
To be blunt, for someone who's been wielding knives all her life to hang out with a prosecutor is—

571
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,920
beautiful to see.

572
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,650
What did you say?

573
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,530
You two look great together.

574
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,400
Did you get anything out of him?

575
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,880
He's hell-bent.

576
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,920
He wouldn't open his mouth.

577
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,550
This guy... then... you need to make him open his mouth.

578
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,420
Watch closely, okay?

579
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:18,080
We're just shoveling here and doing nothing.

580
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,250
You idiot!

581
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:34,650
Seriously... My God!

582
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,100
What! I'll tell you everything!

583
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,190
W-What, what, what? What do you want?

584
00:42:46,558 --> 00:42:48,268

585
00:42:56,427 --> 00:42:58,007
One moment, please.

586
00:42:59,067 --> 00:43:01,107
Please zoom in here.

587
00:43:07,477 --> 00:43:09,187

588
00:43:12,097 --> 00:43:17,387

589
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:36,537
Yes, Prosecutor.

590
00:43:37,487 --> 00:43:39,317
I think I found it.

591
00:43:44,617 --> 00:43:46,947
This is where it was last caught on camera.

592
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:02,917
There's no way that the car suddenly disappeared.

593
00:44:02,917 --> 00:44:04,627
Where could it have gone?

594
00:44:04,627 --> 00:44:07,717
They could've tried to hide the car nearby...

595
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,277
or tried to get rid of it.

596
00:44:22,557 --> 00:44:24,657
Where is this place?

597
00:44:28,607 --> 00:44:30,287
It's there!

598
00:44:33,697 --> 00:44:36,777

599
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:48,717
I can't see anything inside.

600
00:44:51,267 --> 00:44:52,837
- Hey, move. 
 - What?

601
00:44:52,837 --> 00:44:55,597
- Move out. 
 - W-Wait, what's wrong?

602
00:44:58,337 --> 00:45:00,797
I saw other people do it like this.

603
00:45:26,897 --> 00:45:29,547

604
00:45:29,547 --> 00:45:33,897
- Yes. 
 - Prosecutor Jin. We got the confession.

605
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,267
Tae Hyeong Wook wasn't at the gym at 11 p.m.

606
00:45:35,267 --> 00:45:36,777
Okay, good job.

607
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:39,317
Secure the original footage, and I'll see you tomorrow.

608
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:40,617
Okay.

609
00:46:26,527 --> 00:46:28,067
What?

610
00:46:28,067 --> 00:46:31,057
This is the blood taken from the suspect's shoes.

611
00:46:31,057 --> 00:46:32,947
This is my blood.

612
00:46:32,947 --> 00:46:36,137
Please analyze them to see if they're the same.

613
00:46:37,557 --> 00:46:40,827
- Excuse me, Prosecutor Jin. 
 - Yes.

614
00:46:40,827 --> 00:46:43,724
This is the Anatomy Department.

615
00:46:43,724 --> 00:46:47,592
Come on, you have people who can do this job. I beg of you.

616
00:46:50,304 --> 00:46:52,967
Come on, it's really, really the last one.

617
00:46:52,967 --> 00:46:54,797
Tell me honestly.

618
00:46:54,797 --> 00:46:58,397
You can't ask the NFS because it was illegally obtained, right?

619
00:46:59,207 --> 00:47:01,407
No, no way.

620
00:47:01,407 --> 00:47:04,287
Would I ever? Not at all.

621
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:05,367
Hey.

622
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:07,367
How could you say something like that?

623
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:09,227
What?

624
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:12,457
Anyhow, I'll take it as you're doing it. I'll be waiting.

625
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:14,607
- Hey— 
 - Oh, Professor!

626
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:16,597
You're beloved. I love you.

627
00:47:16,597 --> 00:47:18,507
Hey, Jin Jung!

628
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,337
Gosh.

629
00:47:42,137 --> 00:47:44,387
This just came in via a courier.

630
00:47:46,717 --> 00:47:49,027

631
00:47:51,047 --> 00:47:53,037
Oh Do Hwan?

632
00:47:56,367 --> 00:47:58,037
Good job.

633
00:48:16,657 --> 00:48:22,327
Kids these days... are so fearless.

634
00:48:35,387 --> 00:48:38,887
You're saying the blood on the boot is the same as mine, right?

635
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:41,597
 Yes, RH positive, type B.

636
00:48:41,597 --> 00:48:42,907
 99.9 percent.

637
00:48:42,907 --> 00:48:45,407
Thank you, Professor.

638
00:48:45,407 --> 00:48:47,257
It's become certain now.

639
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,487
Yes.

640
00:48:48,487 --> 00:48:50,097
Okay.

641
00:48:55,017 --> 00:48:57,027
Chul Ki, where's my wooden sword?

642
00:48:57,027 --> 00:48:58,227
The...

643
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:01,637
Director said he's going to use it to dust his comforter.

644
00:49:01,637 --> 00:49:03,227
- His comforter? 
 - Yes.

645
00:49:03,227 --> 00:49:05,287
- Wooden sword? My wooden sword? 
 - Yes.

646
00:49:05,287 --> 00:49:08,087
Why use a wooden sword to dust a comforter?

647
00:49:10,737 --> 00:49:11,797
Where is it?

648
00:49:11,797 --> 00:49:14,147
How could you just let him use the...

649
00:49:14,147 --> 00:49:16,027
I'm sorry.

650
00:49:22,977 --> 00:49:26,687
 It was a yellow envelope.

651
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:49,487
 What is this thing next to the cat here?

652
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:50,817
 Oh, this?

653
00:49:50,817 --> 00:49:52,157
 It's an MP3.

654
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:53,197
 An MP3?

655
00:49:53,197 --> 00:49:54,977
 Do you also happen to have it with you as well?

656
00:49:54,977 --> 00:49:57,537
 Mister took it back.

657
00:49:57,537 --> 00:50:01,147
 He said that's what he was looking for.

658
00:50:13,307 --> 00:50:15,987
I think I'll need some explanations.

659
00:50:24,847 --> 00:50:26,107
Please tell me.

660
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:28,577
Why do you have that with you, Director?

661
00:50:28,577 --> 00:50:30,657
Forget it. It's nothing.

662
00:50:30,657 --> 00:50:33,277
- What did you say? 
 - You want me to repeat it?

663
00:50:33,277 --> 00:50:35,597
I said forget it because it's nothing.

664
00:50:35,597 --> 00:50:37,977
Are you telling me to believe you?

665
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:41,957
It's what the Chief's killer was looking for, right?

666
00:50:42,857 --> 00:50:44,460
What the heck is that?

667
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,470
What is it that one would kill a man for it?

668
00:50:52,197 --> 00:50:55,557
Answer me because I'm really about to get pissed off.

669
00:50:57,797 --> 00:50:59,527
Prosecutor Jin...

670
00:51:00,277 --> 00:51:04,367
You asked about my family's whereabouts last time, right?

671
00:51:05,237 --> 00:51:07,787
They're dead. All of them.

672
00:51:09,797 --> 00:51:11,697
An incident disguised as an accident.

673
00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:14,607
There was nothing I could do.

674
00:51:20,697 --> 00:51:24,657
Is it the same one related to the incidents so far?

675
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,277
At the end of the day, you...

676
00:51:29,277 --> 00:51:33,807
knew about everything and didn't tell me.

677
00:51:33,807 --> 00:51:36,777
This isn't something for you to take part in, Jung.

678
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:39,367
This is something I have to do alone.

679
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,527
Don't even call my name.

680
00:51:43,797 --> 00:51:46,577
You almost died, you punk!

681
00:51:50,287 --> 00:51:52,617
Listen to a person when he tells you something.

682
00:51:52,617 --> 00:51:55,427
Do you think you're the only one like yourself here ever?

683
00:51:55,427 --> 00:51:57,177
Do you?

684
00:51:59,307 --> 00:52:03,707
He's not someone you can just go against, ever.

685
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:06,147
He can just kill you again if he tries.

686
00:52:06,147 --> 00:52:10,857
He can also make your mother and friends in there disappear without a trace.

687
00:52:16,407 --> 00:52:22,557
Prosecutor Jin, I'm telling you for your sake.

688
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:24,807
I decline.

689
00:52:24,807 --> 00:52:27,477
It's not like I didn't know from the beginning.

690
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,727
Pretending not to know something isn't my style.

691
00:52:54,307 --> 00:52:57,087
Snowball, have you been well?

692
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:50,387
This is Tae Hyeong Wook.

693
00:53:50,387 --> 00:53:54,487
 Among the bad people, there's a type I especially can't forgive.

694
00:53:54,487 --> 00:53:57,227
Jurks like you who killed people.

695
00:53:57,227 --> 00:53:58,907
Who are you?

696
00:53:58,907 --> 00:54:01,897
The person who has what you're looking for.

697
00:54:12,827 --> 00:54:14,177
What do you say?

698
00:54:14,177 --> 00:54:16,897
I haven't told anyone yet.

699
00:54:19,697 --> 00:54:21,947
I'm not going to wait long.

700
00:55:11,827 --> 00:55:14,057
Let's do it together.

701
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,317
Where's the item?

702
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:09,217
Where is it?

703
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:12,147
Too late.

704
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:19,287
It left my hands a long time ago.

705
00:56:19,287 --> 00:56:23,107

706
00:56:38,977 --> 00:56:41,107

707
00:58:22,637 --> 00:58:24,777
You'd better walk faster.

708
00:58:29,997 --> 00:58:31,307
Here.

709
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:33,147
This is it. Right?

710
00:58:44,257 --> 00:58:46,867
Gosh... why is it a knife?

711
00:58:50,137 --> 00:58:51,697
Come on in.

712
00:58:51,697 --> 00:58:53,337
Come on.

713
01:00:03,957 --> 01:00:06,407
Damn it...

714
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:10,777
Hey, where are you going?

715
01:00:42,527 --> 01:00:44,797
What the hell?

716
01:00:44,797 --> 01:00:46,597
What's this?

717
01:00:47,427 --> 01:00:49,387
What is this!

718
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:11,770

719
01:01:13,297 --> 01:01:19,937
♫  It feels like my blurry vision has become a little more blurred  ♫

720
01:01:19,937 --> 01:01:25,777
♫  After all, the world is always unkind  ♫

721
01:01:25,777 --> 01:01:29,787
♫  It was a huge illusion, it hurts quite a bit  ♫

722
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:32,467
♫  It's miserable, miserable  ♫

723
01:01:32,467 --> 01:01:39,407
♫  I believed that something would be a little 
 different from yesterday  ♫

724
01:01:39,407 --> 01:01:40,817
♫  Mistake, mistake, my bad  ♫

725
01:01:40,817 --> 01:01:46,677
♫  I just close my eyes indifferently  ♫

726
01:01:46,677 --> 01:01:48,757
♫  I want you to be quiet, but it's not easy this time  ♫

727
01:01:48,757 --> 01:01:50,647

728
01:01:50,647 --> 01:01:52,927
 Law Firm Kangsan? You've got quite the sponsor, Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan.

729
01:01:52,927 --> 01:01:55,427
 All of this might have started with the Seocho-dong murder case.

730
01:01:55,427 --> 01:01:56,497
 It's a stow-away company.

731
01:01:56,497 --> 01:01:58,047
 It doesn't matter whether it's the U.S. or Africa.

732
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:58,887
 We're going after no matter what.

733
01:01:58,887 --> 01:02:00,827
 I came to ask you something about Ms. Park Ye Young.

734
01:02:00,827 --> 01:02:04,137
 She asked me to introduce her to Chief Lee.

735
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,037
 - Change it right away today! 
 - Let go of me.

736
01:02:06,037 --> 01:02:07,487
 Or else, your family will die.

737
01:02:07,487 --> 01:02:11,207
 Why did he buy a deteriorating half-underground villa at a price higher than the market value?

738
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:15,307
 Did you really kill Park Ye Young? I'll give you three seconds. Three, two, one.

739
01:02:15,307 --> 01:02:17,867
 - Hey, burn them. 
 - I'll talk!

740
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:21,600
♫  Now you gotta know, yeah you gotta know  ♫
