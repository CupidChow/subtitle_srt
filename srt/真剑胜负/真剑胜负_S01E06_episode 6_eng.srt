1
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:40,770

2
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:51,150

3
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,120
Senior!

4
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:02,970
Are you hurt anywhere? Are you okay?

5
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,290
Yes, I'm all right.

6
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,120
Please do me a favor.

7
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,650
This is a ledger with the list of drug buyers.

8
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:18,230
They're all usernames.

9
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,650
The culprit is in there.

10
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,420
The one who killed Chief Prosecutor.

11
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,790
From two weeks before Chief Prosecutor's death until the day of the incident,

12
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,550
there were a total of five drug buyers.

13
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,810
Please confirm their identities.

14
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,580
All right. I'll look into it.

15
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,150
It's important, so please get this done as—

16
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,620
I think someone was on your tail.

17
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,550
Hey, you bastard!

18
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,530
- Get him! 
 - He's over there!

19
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,740
Hey, go block the exit!

20
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,760
The rest of you, come up!

21
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,990
Since when have you been tailing me?

22
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,200
Since you left the office.

23
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,790
Your lack of shame knows no bounds.

24
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,780
How can you be this brazen?

25
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,970
I should be the one saying this.

26
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,120
I heard Prosecutor General said that you...

27
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,200
should put all your effort into capturing Prosecutor Jin with me.

28
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,310
This is the end of your solo act, Shin Ah Ra.

29
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,690
We're a family, you know.

30
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,430
Family?

31
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,480
Us?

32
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,440
Don't even say that as a joke.

33
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,430
I'm disgusted just listening to it.

34
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,830
We'll see about that.

35
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,710
I'm sorry, Prosecutor.

36
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,930
I think we lost him.

37
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,720
That's interesting.

38
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,190
Hey!

39
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,120
 Hey, come this way!

40
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,540
 Where did he go?

41
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,390
Where the heck did he go?

42
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,880
Jung!

43
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,450
J-Jung...

44
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,700
Jung, get yourself together!

45
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,250
Jung!

46
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,460
Get yourself together.

47
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,670
Can you get up?

48
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,560
Let's go to the hospital.

49
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:10,710
Hang in there a bit longer. We're almost at the hospital.

50
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,510
We can't go to the hospital.

51
00:07:13,227 --> 00:07:14,690
The hospital will report me.

52
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,680
- We definitely can't— 
 - Is getting reported the issue here?

53
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,780
You're going to die!

54
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,170
 Who is it?

55
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,920
 Who's there?

56
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,600
He's bleeding too much.

57
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,170
Careful, careful now.

58
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,970
Luckily, he missed his organs.

59
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,990
The problem is that he lost too much blood.

60
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,540
His blood type is B.

61
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,860
What's your blood type?

62
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,850
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

63
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,720
- She's asking about your blood type. 
 - O-Oh, okay.

64
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,530
I-I'm t-type A.

65
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,500
Sitting around here won't solve anything.

66
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,260
- We should contact the hospital right away and— 
 - It's fine.

67
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,300
No need to do that.

68
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,990

69
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:28,220

70
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,080

You already know even if I don't tell you, right?

71
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,450
He needs to be at complete rest for a while.

72
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,880
Thank you.

73
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,530
Buy me a drink later if you're thankful.

74
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,660
Relationships are really a funny thing.

75
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,580
My law school student is working with you now.

76
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,360
It's ill-fated, you know.

77
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,650
You don't know what happened to him?

78
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,260
Thanks for your work. Get home safely now.

79
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,000
Hey, Park Jae Kyung!

80
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,680
It's not like I don't know what happened to you, but

81
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,230
isn't it about time for you to get back into things?

82
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,310
You didn't become a prosecutor to live like this forever, did you?

83
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,680
Wake up and pull yourself together.

84
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,930
Bye now.

85
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,560
What happened?

86
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,380
I'm not sure...

87
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,180
When I found him, he was already...

88
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,380
You must be tired. Get some sleep.

89
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,660
I'll look after that guy.

90
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,450
N-No, I'll keep nursing him.

91
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,690
You're Shin Ah Ra, right?

92
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,050
44th class of the training institute.

93
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,050
How do you know about me, Director?

94
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,570
How could I not know when you're next to Prosecutor General Kim Tae Ho?

95
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,110
Let's take our time with the talks later.

96
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,590
Get some sleep for now.

97
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,350
I'll bring you a blanket and a pillow.

98
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,420
Prosecutor Jin escaped the scene?

99
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,010
How?

100
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,990
I think Prosecutor Shin Ah Ra helped him.

101
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,850
Traces of blood were found at the scene,

102
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,880
but I think they were Prosecutor Jin's.

103
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,650
Looking at the shape and the amount of traces,

104
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,580
it seemed that somebody attacked Prosecutor Jin.

105
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,740
What?

106
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,820
Did you not know?

107
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,440
What about the attacker?

108
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,110
We're investigating right now.

109
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,800
 Thank you.

110
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:27,990
 I don't think your mom will stay quiet if she finds out you're the last in your class.

111
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,270
 That's why... you need to go in and be my shield, Dad.

112
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,650
 I'm scared of your mom, too.

113
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,010
 Okay then.

114
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:43,000
 I can sacrifice myself with no problem for my dear son.

115
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,330
 What do we do, son?

116
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,370
 I think I left my phone at the press.

117
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,560
 Stop lying.

118
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,500
 You're lying because you don't want to go in with me, huh?

119
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,000
 Hey, don't you know that your daddy's a journalist?

120
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,970
 Chasing only after the truth, Journalist Jin Kang Woo!

121
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,310
 Can't I come with you?

122
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,790
 I will be right back. Stay here and eat your ice cream.

123
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,840
 No, I want to come with you and look!

124
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,510
 - Stay put. I'll be right back. 
 - C-come on!

125
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,460
Prosecutor!

126
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,730
Prosecutor... Are you okay?

127
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,270
Prosecutor Jin!

128
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,490
How's your wound?

129
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,730
- Did you seal it? 
 - It's okay. Everything's done.

130
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,520
So why would you go there alone?

131
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,370
You can never act on your own from now on.

132
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,020
Never, never again.

133
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,430
- Why are there so many shoes? 
 - Did I make you all worry?

134
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,590
- You're here? 
 - I'm sorry.

135
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,740
Oh, I brought these.

136
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,800
All right...

137
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,240
What's this?

138
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,130
This is gunpowder and lighter.

139
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,200
Hey, why did you bring them?

140
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,860
- This is the best way to sear the wound. 
  - Sear where?

141
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,550
Don't do it! Do it when you get hurt.

142
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,620
- Who are those people? 
 - I'm okay.

143
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,550
- Look, it barely brushed against it. 
 - The three siblings.

144
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,500
I'm all better now.

145
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,680
Jin Jung and the three siblings.

146
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,430
Prosecutor... did you at least see...

147
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,530
the face of the one that stabbed you?

148
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,280
I couldn't see the face, but...

149
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,080
I saw sterile gloves on the hands.

150
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,650
It's probably the same person.

151
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,240
The one that left the syringe at my house.

152
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,420
Why would that bastard... keep trying to kill you?

153
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,360
There must be a reason for trying to stop the investigation.

154
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,450
Something that must stay hidden even by killing a person.

155
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:52,320
I haven't the slightest idea.

156
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,510
I'll just follow you.

157
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,640
It's easy. Don't make it too complicated.

158
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,410
We catch and beat the crap out of the stabber or the planner...

159
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,550
Either of them, for sure.

160
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,250
Even better if we catch both of them.

161
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,140
Let's move.

162
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,220
It's revenge from now on.

163
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,570

164
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,340
 I heard you met Prosecutor Jin. Why did you do that?

165
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,700
I'm sorry.

166
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,980
Fine.

167
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,440
Instead... this will be the last time you don't listen to me.

168
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,560
It's a warning, Prosecutor Shin.

169
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,060
In fact...

170
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,300
I also don't have the face to meet that kid.

171
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,670
What kind of Prosecutor General can't even cover up for a family member?

172
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,620
Prosecutor Jin probably understands.

173
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,780
I would be glad if that was the case.

174
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,060
How's Prosecutor Jin's body recovering?

175
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,390
Pardon?

176
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,950
Weren't you taking care of him?

177
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,050
Where is he right now?

178
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,910
How did you... know that Prosecutor Jin was attacked?

179
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,550
I got the report from Prosecutor Oh.

180
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,210
He said there were traces of Prosecutor Jin's blood at the scene

181
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,900
and that you took him to get him treated.

182
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:30,660
It'll be bad if the wound doesn't get treated and develop complications.

183
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,660
Never mind. Let's take Prosecutor Jin to the hospital right now.

184
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,470
That would be better.

185
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,370
Yes, it's me. Bring out the car.

186
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,120
What's the address?

187
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,590
 Senior!

188
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:03,830
 Don't tell anyone at the office about me being here.

189
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,400
 Not even the Prosecutor General?

190
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,980
 I don't trust anyone, but you, Senior.

191
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,120
Prosecutor Shin.

192
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,200
I'm sorry, Prosecutor General.

193
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,580
I can't tell you.

194
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,160
What do you mean?

195
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,670
I clearly gave you an order.

196
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,150
I can get the punishment for disobeying your order later.

197
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,660
After arresting everyone involved in this case.

198
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,110
How did it go?

199
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,820
There's no suspicious character in the call history.

200
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,650
They're all investigators or office-related people.

201
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,310
What about the mobile carrier location tracking?

202
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,600
About where they have been.

203
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,830
We did all that a long time ago.

204
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,210
But the broadcasting station's radius is too wide.

205
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,610
I don't think I can pinpoint a location.

206
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,990
 We placed one of Eun Ji's guys as a tail,

207
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,910
 but Prosecutor Oh is also, you know...

208
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,870
quite the player as well.

209
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,240
We really can't kidnap him?

210
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,080
No, we can't. Put away that idea.

211
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,000
It seems certain that there's a location where Prosecutor Oh meets the one behind the scenes.

212
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,550
The problem is...

213
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,710
 how to find out that location.

214
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,550
That's... with a location tracker.

215
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,600
Come on. What if things go wrong, and we end up at Incheon again?

216
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,520
Maybe we can put it on his car, but not on him.

217
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,300
 We can't even put it on his car, actually.

218
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,980
Wasn't his car smashed and is being repaired?

219
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,900
Hey, Go Joong Do...

220
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,800
Good job. You did well.

221
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,540
What about me?

222
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,870
You, too, Eun Ji.

223
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,040
I think we can find a way.

224
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,560
 The navigation.

225
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,470
 In 2.7 km,

226
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,660
 there's a tunnel ahead.

227
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,050
What? The navigation?

228
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,320
The navigation!

229
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,520
What about the navigation?

230
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,400
Look up the repair shop for Oh Do Hwan's wrecked car.

231
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,390
A black sedan. 1514.

232
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,740
- Whoa... 
 - Understood.

233
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,990
Wait...

234
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,620
Hey!

235
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,850
Aren't you guys going home?

236
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,000
We were going to go after breakfast tomorrow.

237
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,100
Breakfast tomorrow?

238
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,190
I'm going out right now.

239
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,570
Gosh...

240
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,760
Why are you leaving tomorrow morning?

241
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,070
I'll leave right after breakfast.

242
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,990
Hyeon Gyu,

243
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,360
you're putting me in a tough spot if you keep this up.

244
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,620
How could you do that to a prosecutor?

245
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,310
Let's say Lee Jang Won couldn't be helped because of the item, but

246
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,800
you went too far this time.

247
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,970
I beg of you, please, Hyeon Gyu.

248
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,450
Prosecutor Jin...

249
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,470
I'll also try my best to catch him as soon as possible.

250
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,120
So if you can wait a bit longer...

251
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,530
Trying your best...

252
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,880
it means nothing.

253
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,480
A person should do a good job to be useful.

254
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,040
Also, Tae Ho,

255
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,950
I shouldn't have to tiptoe around you to do my job. Don't you think?

256
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,740
Did you find the item?

257
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,030
Give me a new worm.

258
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,340
This one's not that good.

259
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,610
This is the identified list of the philopon buyer IDs.

260
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,620

261
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,830

What's this?

262
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,210
Law Firm Kangsan?

263
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,240
The name's Tae Hyeong Wook.

264
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,180
The CEO Seo Hyeon Gyu of Law Firm Kangsan's Chief Secretary.

265
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,950
Chief Secretary of the biggest law firm in our country?

266
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,700
There must've been some mistake.

267
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,310
Not at all. I checked many times already but it is correct.

268
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,700
Any past records related to drugs?

269
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,150
No criminal records.

270
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,450
This is the first time.

271
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,450
A person with no records bought drugs?

272
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,820
That's weird.

273
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,270
What's even weirder is

274
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,410
that the date of purchase is

275
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,580
one day before the Chief's death.

276
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,350

277
00:25:11,214 --> 00:25:14,144
I apologize. The meeting took longer than expected.

278
00:25:16,004 --> 00:25:18,874
Nice to meet you. My name is Seo Ji Han.

279
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:23,244
I'm Prosecutor Shin Ah Ra of the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

280
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:26,214
My reason for today's visit is none other than...

281
00:25:30,824 --> 00:25:35,594
None other than wanting to meet Tae Hyeong Wook.

282
00:25:35,594 --> 00:25:38,004
Chief Secretary Tae?

283
00:25:40,394 --> 00:25:41,794
I'm not sure.

284
00:25:41,794 --> 00:25:46,494
Asking for that without even telling us the reason is a bit...

285
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:47,994
It's regarding an internal investigation, so

286
00:25:47,994 --> 00:25:50,834
please understand that I can't tell you.

287
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:52,744
An internal investigation?

288
00:25:55,784 --> 00:25:58,374
I understand. I'll cooperate.

289
00:25:58,374 --> 00:25:59,534
Thank you.

290
00:25:59,534 --> 00:26:02,244
Instead, just let me know what it's about.

291
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:06,844
If it's enough to bring you here, then it must be a pretty big deal.

292
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:13,604
Just unload a bit more, please.

293
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:16,474
I'll make sure to pay you handsomely for the details.

294
00:26:17,304 --> 00:26:21,254
Is it just me, or are you actually interested

295
00:26:21,254 --> 00:26:24,074
in this more than you need to be?

296
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:29,854
It seems that I came on a wrong day.

297
00:26:30,684 --> 00:26:33,284
I'll visit again next time.

298
00:26:40,524 --> 00:26:46,180

299
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:11,284
Yes, Father. It's me, Ji Han.

300
00:27:11,284 --> 00:27:14,014
Someone came from the Prosecution.

301
00:27:14,014 --> 00:27:16,844

302
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:27,264
Shin Ah Ra of Central District Prosecutors' Office.

303
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:29,944
Bring me her background ceck.

304
00:27:29,944 --> 00:27:31,554
Okay.

305
00:27:34,974 --> 00:27:41,804
I thought he was a lone wolf but Jin Jung has a lot of friends.

306
00:27:48,854 --> 00:27:51,624
It's a background check report on the philopon buyers.

307
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:59,694
Tae Hyeong Wook is the most likely suspect so far.

308
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:01,174
Kangsan?

309
00:28:01,174 --> 00:28:03,274
The biggest law firm in our country?

310
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:04,674
It's not certain yet.

311
00:28:04,674 --> 00:28:08,264
It's just a little too suspicious.

312
00:28:12,354 --> 00:28:14,394
How are things for you?

313
00:28:16,574 --> 00:28:18,774
I'm still digging into Oh Do Hwan.

314
00:28:18,774 --> 00:28:21,104
- By tomorrow- 
 - Not that.

315
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:23,354
How are things for you?

316
00:28:28,234 --> 00:28:32,644
Now that I think about it I haven't told you that yet, Sunbae.

317
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:36,074
Thank you.

318
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:39,814
Treat me well if you're. All right?

319
00:28:42,924 --> 00:28:44,644
Now...

320
00:28:44,644 --> 00:28:47,744
get ready for my special doenjang jjigae.

321
00:28:53,494 --> 00:28:55,414
Ta-da!

322
00:28:57,954 --> 00:28:59,414
You should feel honored.

323
00:28:59,414 --> 00:29:02,094
Not anyone gets to taste my food.

324
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:07,104
Is that so?

325
00:29:07,104 --> 00:29:08,294
Thanks for the food.

326
00:29:08,294 --> 00:29:10,914
Okay, please enjoy.

327
00:29:19,864 --> 00:29:22,974
Snowball, come here for a second.

328
00:29:23,744 --> 00:29:25,444
Come here.

329
00:29:31,774 --> 00:29:33,554
Right?

330
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:35,474
It's weird, right?

331
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:38,934
Here.

332
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:40,624
"Hell no?"

333
00:29:47,134 --> 00:29:51,804
I didn't tell you that I'm allergic to bean paste, did I?

334
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,934
Let's go out to eat.

335
00:29:54,934 --> 00:29:57,414
Come on, let's go.

336
00:29:57,414 --> 00:30:00,094
Who has bean paste allergies?

337
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:07,434

Thank you.

338
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:09,124
Thank you.

339
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:17,464
I heard you gave me your blood.

340
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:19,714
It's the same blood.

341
00:30:19,714 --> 00:30:22,824
You share it and reuse it.

342
00:30:25,694 --> 00:30:28,004
I'll save you next time.

343
00:30:28,664 --> 00:30:30,284
That's fine.

344
00:30:30,284 --> 00:30:32,914
If you're going to save me, save me now.

345
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,874
The ox blood.

346
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:38,064
You want me to give you mine?

347
00:30:44,474 --> 00:30:46,544
Have all you want.

348
00:30:47,394 --> 00:30:50,084
Come on, man. Just one isn't friendly enough.

349
00:30:58,114 --> 00:31:00,374
One glass of soju as well?

350
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:02,924
A patient should...

351
00:31:05,894 --> 00:31:07,914
be sterilized, at least, right?

352
00:31:08,774 --> 00:31:10,534
Excuse me.

353
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,174

354
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:18,724
Hey.

355
00:31:19,564 --> 00:31:21,414
Put your cap on.

356
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:27,314
Hurry.

357
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:39,304

358
00:31:39,304 --> 00:31:41,154

Mr. Park.

359
00:31:41,154 --> 00:31:43,924
What's wrong with my Jung suddenly?

360
00:31:45,884 --> 00:31:47,524
Murder?

361
00:31:47,524 --> 00:31:49,944

362
00:31:49,944 --> 00:31:51,794
I mean—

363
00:31:53,874 --> 00:31:56,724
Hang up. I'll call back.

364
00:31:58,184 --> 00:32:00,150

365
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,780

366
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,034

367
00:32:19,914 --> 00:32:21,964
Did you order the public arrest of Prosecutor Jin yourself?

368
00:32:21,964 --> 00:32:22,884
Later.

369
00:32:22,884 --> 00:32:24,404
It's a hasty decision.

370
00:32:24,404 --> 00:32:25,834
If Prosecutor Jin is not the culprit—

371
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,014
Prosecutor Shin, later.

372
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:29,894
Please tell me right now!

373
00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:33,114
The evidence that proves he is guilty isn't clear, and there's a possibility of him being framed.

374
00:32:33,114 --> 00:32:35,864
Violating the presumption of innocence law and revealing his face means

375
00:32:35,864 --> 00:32:39,464
- you're branding him as the culprit— 
 - Shin Ah Ra!

376
00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:43,524
Don't ever raise your voice in front of me again.

377
00:32:43,524 --> 00:32:45,844
This is your last warning.

378
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,524
Hello and welcome.

379
00:33:22,524 --> 00:33:23,874
Yes.

380
00:33:23,874 --> 00:33:25,684
I would like to change my engine oil.

381
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:27,084
Okay. One moment, please.

382
00:33:27,084 --> 00:33:29,104
- Thank you. 
 - Sure thing.

383
00:33:33,454 --> 00:33:36,224
 A black sedan. The plate number is 1514.

384
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:02,874

385
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,270

386
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,110

387
00:34:34,654 --> 00:34:36,974
Same time...

388
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,984
same movement...

389
00:34:38,984 --> 00:34:41,194
there's nothing suspicious.

390
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:45,004

391
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:55,144
A wine bar?

392
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:19,644
- Gosh, thanks for having us. 
 - Welcome.

393
00:35:19,644 --> 00:35:21,054
- Gosh, hello. 
 - Hello.

394
00:35:21,054 --> 00:35:25,244
We're... detectives from the Seoul Police, Violent Crime Division.

395
00:35:26,454 --> 00:35:28,724
We're here to ask you...

396
00:35:28,724 --> 00:35:32,214
if you've... seen this person.

397
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,624
I heard he came to this place a few days ago with someone else.

398
00:35:34,624 --> 00:35:38,064
Oh, this person. I do remember.

399
00:35:39,154 --> 00:35:41,544
He also came two days ago.

400
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:44,824

401
00:35:57,924 --> 00:36:00,804

402
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,060

403
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,230

404
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,710

405
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:20,984
Stop.

406
00:37:04,044 --> 00:37:06,154
If you give us a call next time...

407
00:37:11,074 --> 00:37:13,104
G-Give us a call.

408
00:37:42,334 --> 00:37:43,454
 Did anyone come here?

409
00:37:43,454 --> 00:37:45,334
 They were here just now.

410
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:49,354
They just left, though.

411
00:38:12,394 --> 00:38:14,364
It doesn't seem like they're here.

412
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:16,604
Everyone, come up!

413
00:38:16,604 --> 00:38:18,654
 Spread out and check the rooms!

414
00:38:18,654 --> 00:38:20,304
- Okay. 
 - Understood.

415
00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:28,474
Hey, what do we do?

416
00:38:29,894 --> 00:38:31,624
- Jump. 
 - What?

417
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:34,724
Shit!

418
00:38:38,604 --> 00:38:40,214
Then hide!

419
00:38:41,494 --> 00:38:43,754
- Hey, are you okay? 
 - You can't stay there!

420
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:46,314
I can't jump. Never.

421
00:38:46,314 --> 00:38:47,874
Shit...

422
00:38:51,924 --> 00:38:53,894
This is too high.

423
00:38:59,564 --> 00:39:01,314
Hurry up and come down!

424
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,154
What was that sound?

425
00:39:33,154 --> 00:39:34,704
Goodness...

426
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:41,503
There!

427
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,380

428
00:40:04,384 --> 00:40:06,494
- Is that what happened? 
 - Yes.

429
00:40:07,634 --> 00:40:10,144
Prosecutor Hwang, long time no see!

430
00:40:25,171 --> 00:40:26,984
There's good food on the menu today.

431
00:40:26,984 --> 00:40:29,844
Enjoy your meal, guys.

432
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,314
Enjoy your food.

433
00:40:42,194 --> 00:40:44,544
The rumor did spread quite a bit.

434
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,594
That you're ignoring the Prosecutor General's orders...

435
00:40:47,594 --> 00:40:49,934
and helping Prosecutor Jin.

436
00:40:50,854 --> 00:40:54,604
Even so... what the heck are they doing?

437
00:40:56,304 --> 00:40:58,224
Eat up now.

438
00:40:58,224 --> 00:41:00,294
- Okay. 
 - Sure.

439
00:41:17,734 --> 00:41:19,274
Gosh, Prosecutor!

440
00:41:19,274 --> 00:41:21,184
Are you okay?

441
00:41:22,434 --> 00:41:24,274
I'm sorry, Senior.

442
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:27,274
You should've been more careful.

443
00:41:27,274 --> 00:41:29,544
You're now expelled from the class order, Senior.

444
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:31,284
You know the reason why, right?

445
00:41:31,284 --> 00:41:34,234
Higher-ups order and subordinates obey. Uniformity among prosecutors.

446
00:41:34,234 --> 00:41:36,904
Let's pay respect where respect is due, all right?

447
00:41:36,904 --> 00:41:39,244
People like you and Prosecutor Jin

448
00:41:39,244 --> 00:41:42,634
are the reason why other prosecutors are also in trouble.

449
00:41:44,144 --> 00:41:45,924
You guys are really crossing the line here.

450
00:41:45,924 --> 00:41:47,824
Are you guys in high school or something?

451
00:41:47,824 --> 00:41:50,784
What are you doing? Being so childish, like a kid!

452
00:41:50,784 --> 00:41:52,874
Hey.

453
00:41:52,874 --> 00:41:54,284
Investigator Park.

454
00:41:54,284 --> 00:41:56,854
- Have you gone mad? 
 - Have you gone mad!

455
00:41:56,854 --> 00:41:58,294
Are you crazy!

456
00:41:58,294 --> 00:41:59,754
Hey.

457
00:42:02,824 --> 00:42:06,744
Did you throw away your sense of reason in the waste bin?

458
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:09,684
Are you okay?

459
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:12,424
Yes, I'm okay... but how about you?

460
00:42:12,424 --> 00:42:14,424
I'm not okay.

461
00:42:15,394 --> 00:42:17,424
- Dan it... 
 - Clench your teeth.

462
00:42:17,424 --> 00:42:19,354
You'll bite your tongue.

463
00:42:19,354 --> 00:42:21,244
Wait, Prosecutor! Calm down!

464
00:42:21,244 --> 00:42:22,664
Calm down! Please!

465
00:42:22,664 --> 00:42:24,624
Come over here!

466
00:42:24,624 --> 00:42:26,594
- How dare you! 
 - Please stop!

467
00:42:26,594 --> 00:42:29,064
- Hey, you! 
 - Hold her down!

468
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:46,804
 Try then.

469
00:42:46,804 --> 00:42:50,454
 If it's suspicious, it's right to investigate until the end.

470
00:42:52,184 --> 00:42:55,514

471
00:42:55,514 --> 00:42:57,224

472
00:42:57,224 --> 00:43:00,034
 The reason why you're telling me to wrap up the investigations in a hurry...

473
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:02,834
 is it because of your Prosecutor General appointment?

474
00:43:02,834 --> 00:43:05,824
♫  I can't stand it any longer  ♫

475
00:43:05,824 --> 00:43:07,614
 Congratulations, Prosecutor General.

476
00:43:07,614 --> 00:43:12,714
♫  Look forward to the big picture I've drawn so far  ♫

477
00:43:12,714 --> 00:43:18,984
♫  As you did, no more than that, I'll give it back  ♫

478
00:43:18,984 --> 00:43:20,634
♫  No, you can't bring me down  ♫

479
00:43:20,634 --> 00:43:25,284

481
00:43:28,804 --> 00:43:30,654
 Hey, Chul Ki, this is not a mistake, right?

482
00:43:30,654 --> 00:43:33,984
 I'm keenly aware of the ones who are trying to stab my back.

483
00:43:33,984 --> 00:43:38,194
 And the reason why you assigned the Seocho-dong murder case to Prosecutor Jin.

484
00:43:40,064 --> 00:43:43,374

485
00:43:43,374 --> 00:43:49,554

486
00:43:49,554 --> 00:43:52,434
 There's no time. Please request a warrant first, Senior.

487
00:43:52,434 --> 00:43:55,034

488
00:43:55,034 --> 00:43:58,484
♫  Why is it natural to be twisted?  ♫

489
00:43:58,484 --> 00:44:01,404
♫  Open your eyes and look, look properly  ♫

490
00:44:01,404 --> 00:44:03,064
♫  On top of my head  ♫

491
00:44:03,064 --> 00:44:06,124
♫  You'll think there is  ♫

492
00:44:06,124 --> 00:44:08,184

Why would that bastard...

493
00:44:08,184 --> 00:44:10,664
 keep trying to kill you?

494
00:44:12,964 --> 00:44:15,854
♫  I'll turn you over  ♫

495
00:44:15,854 --> 00:44:19,354
♫  Deep in the dark  ♫

496
00:44:19,354 --> 00:44:22,884
♫  Burn myself out more  ♫

497
00:44:22,884 --> 00:44:24,394
Yes.

498
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:28,474
I just heard everything.

499
00:44:28,474 --> 00:44:30,754
Prosecutor Oh and the Prosecutor General are...

500
00:44:32,274 --> 00:44:34,344
Shouldn't we let Prosecutor Shin know?

501
00:44:34,344 --> 00:44:36,464
Once it becomes more certain...

502
00:44:36,464 --> 00:44:39,374
You all did a good job. I'll look into it now.

503
00:44:39,374 --> 00:44:41,654
You'll do it in person, Prosecutor?

504
00:44:41,654 --> 00:44:46,024
To catch a tiger... you need to step into its den.

505
00:44:51,684 --> 00:44:55,584

506
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,994
♫  You can't bring me down  ♫

507
00:46:43,854 --> 00:46:45,634

508
00:46:50,414 --> 00:46:52,524

509
00:46:58,911 --> 00:47:01,834
You're saying I can break through the login lock with this?

510
00:47:01,834 --> 00:47:04,684
Of course. Who do you think I am?

511
00:47:04,684 --> 00:47:07,144
What's the program password?

512
00:47:07,144 --> 00:47:08,654
zh...

513
00:47:08,654 --> 00:47:12,174
+i!...

514
00:47:13,381 --> 00:47:15,734
I'm kidding. I changed it.

515
00:47:15,734 --> 00:47:17,614
What is it? The password.

516
00:47:17,614 --> 00:47:19,584
It's 1004,

517
00:47:19,584 --> 00:47:21,804
which stands for "angel."

518
00:47:23,224 --> 00:47:25,510

519
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,250

520
00:47:55,934 --> 00:47:58,304

521
00:48:02,024 --> 00:48:06,174

522
00:48:09,064 --> 00:48:12,004

523
00:48:12,004 --> 00:48:15,154

524
00:50:46,664 --> 00:50:48,124
What's wrong with your face?

525
00:50:48,124 --> 00:50:50,264
Did something bad happen?

526
00:50:51,474 --> 00:50:54,084
Well, there are lots of bad news.

527
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,494
Never mind that.

528
00:50:55,494 --> 00:50:57,834
Did you find something out?

529
00:51:01,504 --> 00:51:03,874
Stop with the nonsense!

530
00:51:03,874 --> 00:51:05,714
I saw it.

531
00:51:05,714 --> 00:51:08,364
The conversation between Oh Do Hwan and the Prosecutor General.

532
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:20,544

533
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:22,894
Please help me, Senior.

534
00:51:24,034 --> 00:51:28,144
I need your help to capture the Prosecutor General.

535
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:34,024
I know that it's going to be very hard.

536
00:51:35,714 --> 00:51:37,934
But let me still ask this of you.

537
00:51:39,314 --> 00:51:45,594
What if I decide to turn a blind eye?

538
00:51:48,364 --> 00:51:50,644
I know you wouldn't do that.

539
00:51:50,644 --> 00:51:53,494
You already had some ideas as well.

540
00:51:56,074 --> 00:51:59,084
If you're still going to turn a blind eye, though...

541
00:52:01,504 --> 00:52:03,524
Never mind.

542
00:52:03,524 --> 00:52:05,854
Just don't do that.

543
00:52:05,854 --> 00:52:08,914
That's not why we get paid with tax money.

544
00:52:10,514 --> 00:52:12,394
Think about it and give me a call, please.

545
00:52:12,394 --> 00:52:14,604
I can't wait too long, though.

546
00:52:28,334 --> 00:52:30,724
This is Shin Ah Ra, Prosecutor General.

547
00:52:32,344 --> 00:52:34,664
I have something to tell you.

548
00:52:34,664 --> 00:52:38,054
May I come and see you in front of your house, please?

549
00:53:05,384 --> 00:53:07,194
What is it that you need to tell me?

550
00:53:07,194 --> 00:53:10,324
My thoughts were too hasty, Prosecutor General.

551
00:53:10,324 --> 00:53:12,104
I was wrong.

552
00:53:12,104 --> 00:53:15,414
I'll never go against your orders.

553
00:53:15,414 --> 00:53:17,124
How could I trust your words?

554
00:53:17,124 --> 00:53:19,964
You already have a history.

555
00:53:22,604 --> 00:53:24,444
Tell me.

556
00:53:26,354 --> 00:53:28,514
Shin Ah Ra, try and tell me.

557
00:53:28,514 --> 00:53:32,894
Tell me what you can do to let me trust you again.

558
00:53:44,494 --> 00:53:47,064
Prosecutor Jin's location...

559
00:53:48,464 --> 00:53:50,844
I'll tell you.

560
00:53:57,814 --> 00:54:04,914

561
00:54:04,914 --> 00:54:06,874
 Yes, Senior.

562
00:54:07,554 --> 00:54:08,644
Where are you?

563
00:54:08,644 --> 00:54:10,994
 At the stadium, where we just met.

564
00:54:10,994 --> 00:54:12,314
Wait there.

565
00:54:12,314 --> 00:54:14,694
I'll be there in ten minutes.

566
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:30,704

567
00:54:30,704 --> 00:54:32,764
 Prosecutor Jin!

568
00:54:35,354 --> 00:54:37,684
 What do I need to do?

569
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:46,684
Prosecutor Jin thinks that you're the one who framed him.

570
00:54:46,684 --> 00:54:50,154
So he suggested to you to capture me with him?

571
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:51,864
Yes.

572
00:54:52,734 --> 00:54:55,294
I thought it was nonsense...

573
00:54:55,294 --> 00:54:58,544
because you would never do that.

574
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:07,034
You didn't do that right, Prosecutor General?

575
00:55:08,184 --> 00:55:11,314
What should I even tell you?

576
00:55:12,634 --> 00:55:15,114
Before that, Prosecutor Shin,

577
00:55:16,284 --> 00:55:18,524
let's have your phone turned off.

578
00:55:21,104 --> 00:55:24,154
 Would the Prosecutor General trust me?

579
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,064
 He probably wouldn't.

580
00:55:26,064 --> 00:55:29,294
 He'll try to examine your phone, of course.

581
00:55:29,294 --> 00:55:32,324
 Then do you know what to do next?

582
00:55:46,604 --> 00:55:49,084
 This is too obvious, though...

583
00:56:02,604 --> 00:56:05,994
Don't make me do a body search on you, please.

584
00:56:22,764 --> 00:56:25,994
You haven't answered my question.

585
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:30,824
Please answer me, Prosecutor General.

586
00:56:31,844 --> 00:56:34,734
The one who framed Prosecutor Jin...

587
00:56:35,704 --> 00:56:38,264
was it really you, Prosecutor General?

588
00:56:40,454 --> 00:56:42,684
 Just do as it says here.

589
00:56:48,654 --> 00:56:52,464

590
00:56:54,934 --> 00:56:57,274
 As my Father orders.

591
00:56:57,984 --> 00:56:59,854
 Keep that in mind.

592
00:57:05,314 --> 00:57:07,964
Answer me, I said!

593
00:57:07,964 --> 00:57:11,284
I've served you for eight years

594
00:57:11,284 --> 00:57:12,884
because I respected you.

595
00:57:12,884 --> 00:57:17,024
You were my role model, and I wanted to be like you!

596
00:57:17,024 --> 00:57:20,624
Everything you told me and the actions you took on your junior prosecutors...

597
00:57:20,624 --> 00:57:22,644
Were they all lies?

598
00:57:22,644 --> 00:57:24,864
On top of framing Prosecutor Jin,

599
00:57:24,864 --> 00:57:28,294
did you also send a person to kill him—

600
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,294
Don't be hasty to run your mouth.

601
00:57:30,294 --> 00:57:33,174
Mind your manners in front of your superior!

602
00:57:33,174 --> 00:57:36,094
Mind your manners for your subordinate first, please.

603
00:57:36,094 --> 00:57:38,414
Please tell me.

604
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:40,974
Were they all parts of your plan?

605
00:57:40,974 --> 00:57:42,654
Did you really try to kill Prosecutor Jin?

606
00:57:42,654 --> 00:57:44,614
No, no, I didn't!

607
00:57:44,614 --> 00:57:45,684
I didn't do that!

608
00:57:45,684 --> 00:57:48,594
I didn't even know about such plans, and I—

609
00:57:55,084 --> 00:57:57,694
You're saying you did...

610
00:57:59,094 --> 00:58:01,704
frame Prosecutor Jin, then...

611
00:58:07,864 --> 00:58:09,704
Even if you hear the truth from me,

612
00:58:09,704 --> 00:58:12,134
there's nothing you can do.

613
00:58:12,134 --> 00:58:15,154
I decide whether I can do it or not.

614
00:58:15,154 --> 00:58:18,134
You just answer me, Prosecutor General.

615
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:20,634
I couldn't help it.

616
00:58:20,634 --> 00:58:22,924
This is my answer.

617
00:58:24,464 --> 00:58:26,954
You'll be sent to the disciplinary committee soon.

618
00:58:26,954 --> 00:58:29,644
Allegations of aiding and abetting a murder suspect's escape.

619
00:58:29,644 --> 00:58:33,264
After expelling, you'll be investigated with restraint.

620
00:58:33,264 --> 00:58:36,224
Thank you for all your work, Prosecutor Shin.

621
00:58:37,534 --> 00:58:43,594
I would like to thank you for everything.

622
00:58:43,594 --> 00:58:46,914
I'll bill you for the slap separately later.

623
00:59:17,454 --> 00:59:19,834
 This is too obvious, though.

624
00:59:19,834 --> 00:59:23,224
 It's fine if he finds out. Even better if he doesn't.

625
00:59:23,224 --> 00:59:26,154
 The real one is elsewhere, anyway.

626
00:59:26,154 --> 00:59:27,844
 What is it?

627
00:59:27,844 --> 00:59:30,284
 The real one is this.

628
00:59:30,284 --> 00:59:32,194
 Plan C.

629
00:59:36,274 --> 00:59:38,224
Excuse me for one moment.

630
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:45,384
Ta-da.

631
00:59:45,384 --> 00:59:47,244
You didn't know about this, did you?

632
00:59:49,314 --> 00:59:52,524
 You just answer me, Prosecutor General.

633
00:59:52,524 --> 00:59:54,345
 I couldn't help it.

634
00:59:54,345 --> 00:59:56,635
 That's my answer.

635
00:59:57,941 --> 01:00:01,594
I skip the honorifics to bad guys, Prosecutor General.

636
01:00:01,594 --> 01:00:04,074
I don't treat them as human beings, you see.

637
01:00:04,824 --> 01:00:06,864
You're done for.

638
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:26,440

639
01:00:42,241 --> 01:00:44,304

640
01:00:44,304 --> 01:00:46,344
 Put your guard up tight. It's your turn now.

641
01:00:46,344 --> 01:00:49,204
 Is there a reason why Chief Lee Jang Won's death has to be a suicide?

642
01:00:49,204 --> 01:00:51,474
 Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan, don't cross the line.

643
01:00:51,474 --> 01:00:53,234
 This is the only card we have left.

644
01:00:53,234 --> 01:00:54,754
 The one that can capture Prosecutor General Kim Tae Ho.

645
01:00:54,754 --> 01:00:56,644
 Fabricating the autopsy of Chief Prosecutor Lee Jang Won...

646
01:00:56,644 --> 01:00:57,684
 I did it alone.

647
01:00:57,684 --> 01:01:01,554
 It doesn't look good to have multiple prosecutors stuck to one culprit.

648
01:01:01,554 --> 01:01:03,434
 The medical examiner disappeared in the middle of transport.

649
01:01:03,434 --> 01:01:04,774
 You can just speak comfortably.

650
01:01:04,774 --> 01:01:08,164
 I'll write the contents, so you just need to sign if you want to save the two.

651
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,144
 - Let me go! 
 - If anything happens to them...

652
01:01:10,144 --> 01:01:12,674
 I'm going to kill you.
