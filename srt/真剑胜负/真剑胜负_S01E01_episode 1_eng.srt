1
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:38,796

2
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,590

3
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:48,200

4
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:52,596
You did well getting through the investigation.

5
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:58,096
I almost peed myself when you yelled at the prosecutors, saying

6
00:00:58,096 --> 00:01:00,746
"Do your job right!"

7
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:04,756
Just how highly do they think of themselves?

8
00:01:04,756 --> 00:01:08,370
At the end of the day, they're just salarymen, even if they claim to represent the public good.

9
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:18,100
 Do you know what the biggest weakness of those who exercise power with government money is?

10
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,650

11
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:21,579
They lack "this".

12
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:25,446
If you just feed them enough of this, you can

13
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:27,896
mess around while bossing them around.

14
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:28,996
Look at it this time, too.

15
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:30,716
They told me to come to get investigated,

16
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,906
but they sent an official car to pick me up.

17
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,996
Who are those guys?

18
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,096
Youâ€”

19
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,746
I'm from the police.

20
00:01:38,746 --> 00:01:40,476
The police, okay?

21
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:44,016
A toast for the victory of our CEO...

22
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:46,136
 Cheers!

23
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:50,686
CEO Kim Hyeong Gyun of Rich Fund?

24
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,136
This is the police.

25
00:01:57,046 --> 00:01:59,016
Please come with us.

26
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:22,176
- Take them in. 
 - Which precinct did you guys come from?

27
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,576
Do you not recognize us?

28
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,636
What the heck are you doing?

29
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:35,386
CEO... CEO?

30
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:36,946
Dear CEO...

31
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:38,906
One moment.

32
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:50,246
Why do the cops these days lack manners?

33
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:52,976
You don't bother even a dog when it's drinking.

34
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:54,646
Who the heck are you?

35
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:58,846

36
00:03:02,636 --> 00:03:04,796
You can read the air now, right?

37
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,876
We, at the prosecution, will be taking him in person.

38
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:10,976
Please come this way.

39
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,546
Come this way, it's okay.

40
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:16,176
If you feel this is unfair, submit your complaints to the prosecution.

41
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:18,046
Great job, everyone.

42
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:20,086
It was nice seeing you and

43
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:23,416
let's never meet again.

44
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,606
- Come this way, please. 
   - CEO...

45
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,406
CEO!

46
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:49,886
What's this about?

47
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:52,986
I apologize. There were a lot of eyes on us earlier.

48
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:55,026
Let me introduce myself formally.

49
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,586
I'm Jin Jung of Central District Prosecutors' Office Detective Team 3.

50
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:59,176
Forget the greetings.

51
00:03:59,176 --> 00:04:01,506
Can you explain to me the meaning of this situation right now?

52
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:04,946
Let's head down first. I'll explain to you on the way.

53
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:08,676
Damn it...

54
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:17,806

55
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:19,956
The court has issued an arrest warrant for you, CEO.

56
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:21,446
What?

57
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:25,896
The police and the prosecution are after you right now.

58
00:04:25,896 --> 00:04:30,146

59
00:04:31,343 --> 00:04:33,386
No one knows of my arrival here yet.

60
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:36,036
We need to flee this area before those guys catch on.

61
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:38,016
Let us go.

62
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:40,009
Damn it...

63
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:44,249

64
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:47,266
Your name's Jin Jung?

65
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:48,309
Yes, that's correct.

66
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:51,759
I couldn't ask you before because it was chaotic...

67
00:04:52,836 --> 00:04:56,596
but how did you know to come to me?

68
00:04:57,906 --> 00:05:00,576
To tell you the truth,

69
00:05:00,576 --> 00:05:02,606
I was waiting the whole time...

70
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:05,916
for the day when I would be able to help you, CEO.

71
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,556
Honestly, do you know how the life of a prosecutor is?

72
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:09,956
We only have fame and

73
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:12,566
there's no money for livelihood, so...

74
00:05:13,826 --> 00:05:15,456
I apologize...

75
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:18,546
What am I even telling you right now?

76
00:05:18,546 --> 00:05:20,776
You're asking me to be your sponsor?

77
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:25,256
No, not at all. How could I ask something like that of you?

78
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:26,806
If you could...

79
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:30,686
just remember the two letters of my name.

80
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:33,076
It'll be more than enough for me.

81
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,226
Thank you, Prosecutor Jin.

82
00:05:41,226 --> 00:05:43,856
I won't forget... what happened today.

83
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:45,876
No problem, Sir.

84
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:49,096
Right, CEO...

85
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:53,146
I think you'll have to resolve the issue at hand first.

86
00:05:53,926 --> 00:05:56,536
The secret ledger for your lobby to the Financial

87
00:05:56,536 --> 00:06:00,296
Supervisory Service that you did to hide the insolvency of your company's assets...

88
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:04,186
I think you'll have to change the hiding spot of that ledger before you get arrested.

89
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:07,816
If those guys back there find it out before you, CEO...

90
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:09,846
then things will get a lot more complicated.

91
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:11,656
I'll take care of that myself.

92
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:13,506
Okay, I understand.

93
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:17,526
Please take care, CEO.

94
00:07:12,406 --> 00:07:14,066
Gosh...

95
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:34,346
- How did you come here? 
 - What do you mean "how"?

96
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:36,216
I just followed you secretively.

97
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:38,856
You did smart thinking, dear CEO.

98
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:40,536
I was wondering where you hid it...

99
00:07:40,536 --> 00:07:42,686
and you had it buried here, huh?

100
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:48,176
What's this, then?

101
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,816
This is all an act that you planned from the beginning?

102
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:52,606
Well...

103
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:54,776
if you want to summarize it, I guess it is.

104
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:57,646
You're about to shoot lasers from your eyes.

105
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:59,916
Is it the deceiver's fault in this world?

106
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,066
No, it's the fault of the one who fell for it.

107
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,206
We'll talk about the specifics in the interrogation room.

108
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:05,636
Mr. Kim Hyeong Gyun,

109
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:09,206
you're being arrested for breach of trust, violation of the Free Market Law, bribery and

110
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:12,416
an attempted destruction of evidence...

111
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,836
right at the scene of the crime.

112
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:22,696
Why would you come to a place like this alone?

113
00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:25,596
You punk...

114
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:34,516
These bad bastards...

115
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:36,376
can never look a step ahead.

116
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:38,236
Excuse me, Mr. Kim Hyeong Gyun.

117
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:40,846
I never said that I came here alone.

118
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:43,006
- What? 
 - I'm a prosecutor.

119
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:45,556
You think I couldn't even predict something like this?

120
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:48,716
Chul Ki, come out.

121
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:50,676
My dear thug brothers, prepare yourselves.

122
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:53,376
This guy is known for his fists, among other things.

123
00:09:04,016 --> 00:09:05,996
Time out.

124
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:07,696
Gosh...

125
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:11,846
- Hey, where are you? 
  - Sorry, Prosecutor...

126
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:14,396
What are you saying? I told you to come right after me.

127
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:17,606
B-But... that's...

128
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:25,956
Where are you?

129
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:29,386
Hello? Jin Jung, where are you?

130
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:31,286
Well, that's...

131
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:35,836
- but why are you there, Senior? 
  - I came to get you, seriously!

132
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:38,816
What the heck are you doing right now?

133
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:41,426
Who are all these people?

134
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:46,096
I borrowed them from an acting school...

135
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:48,806
 We're the Criminal Division.

136
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:51,806
Why would you arrest him when the Anti-Corruption Team released him, declaring he is innocent?

137
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:53,646
That's why I came to find evidence...

138
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:56,036
I just found the evidence.

139
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,856
 Also, you know as well, Senior...

140
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:07,396
that the higher-ups are on the same side as those guys.

141
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:10,526
It's not that they couldn't get these guys. They just didn't want to.

142
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,306
Even so, you need to follow the rules.

143
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:15,166
 If you do this, things will be troublesome between the Anti-Corruption Team and us.

144
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,806
- What are you doing? 
   - Depending on the situation,

145
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:19,556
 - they might take this as a declaration of war.  
 - T-This person is a l-little scary.

146
00:10:19,556 --> 00:10:22,356
- Sorry. 
 - Return to the prosecution for now.

147
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,456
 Even the Deputy Prosecutor said not to meddle in other team's cases.

148
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:27,486
I refuse. I'm Jin Jung. Do I need more explanation?

149
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:30,806
H-Hello? J-Jin Jung... Prosecutor Jin!

150
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:32,486
You son of a...

151
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:37,106
Dismissed!

152
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,836
Personally speaking, though, using tools is cheating, no?

153
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:42,256
Hammers and all...

154
00:10:42,256 --> 00:10:43,846
You guys clearly held them up first, okay?

155
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:45,166
Don't give me shit later, all right?

156
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,986
Gosh... what are you doing? We're busy people.

157
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:49,966
Did you hide a gun in there or something?

158
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:52,006
Gun? I can't even shoot...

159
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:54,036
Did I leave it in the trunk?

160
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:56,166
Where is it? Shit... Oh, it's here.

161
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,576
- Hey, yoâ€” 
 - Goodness!

162
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:00,746
Head!

163
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:02,766
Gosh, that hurt.

164
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,496
Who's first?

165
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:13,306
What are you guys doing?

166
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:17,346
Gosh...

167
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,376
You're wasting your breath again.

168
00:12:20,376 --> 00:12:23,236
Put it down, or you'll get seriously hurt.

169
00:12:36,846 --> 00:12:40,456

170
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:45,486

171
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:49,386

172
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:51,606

173
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:11,346
Jin Jung...

174
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:16,796
what exactly is your job?

175
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,286
Well...

176
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:20,786
a prosecutor?

177
00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:22,426
A prosecutor...

178
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,846
You gave your sense of hierarchy, order, rule, and dignity to the dog.

179
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,246
And you say you're a prosecutor?

180
00:13:28,246 --> 00:13:29,726
Yes.

181
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,876
I'm indeed a prosecutor, though.

182
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,266
Central District Prosecutors' Office Criminal Division 3.

183
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:35,626
Do I not know that?

184
00:13:38,396 --> 00:13:39,756
It's a mystery, right?

185
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:42,276
It's really, really a mystery.

186
00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:44,486
How did a person like you become a prosecutor?

187
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:49,326
There's nothing special... it's all just talent and fate.

188
00:13:53,786 --> 00:13:56,306

189
00:13:58,236 --> 00:14:00,806
 When I witnessed the first injustice of my life, I told myself,

190
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:04,206
 "I need to reprimand that."

191
00:14:22,966 --> 00:14:25,166
This is great.

192
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:29,186
Why is it not going in?

193
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:30,806
Why?

194
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:33,726
Who is it?

195
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:35,256
Who did it?

196
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:37,226
- Who is it? 
  - Yes!

197
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:40,676
I really can't live because of you.

198
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:42,726
What are you trying to become when you grow up?

199
00:14:42,726 --> 00:14:44,916
Gosh, seriously!

200
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,826
I will become something!

201
00:14:46,826 --> 00:14:48,206
What? What is it?

202
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,466
I'm going to become a swordsman.
  (T/N: Same spelling as a prosecutor in Korean)

203
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:53,236
 It was cool, the Justice Protecting Swordsman.

204
00:14:53,236 --> 00:14:55,566
 - So I was going to become a swordsman, but...  
 - Head!

205
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:57,896

Great, great.

206
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:14,209
Head!

207
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:16,829
I did it, right?

208
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:25,736
What is this?

209
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:33,186
What signs are you exchanging?

210
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:35,166
Is he a friend of yours?

211
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:41,536

212
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:45,346
Shit...

213
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:47,776
 The only thing that was the same was that I held a sword,

214
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:50,156
 but being a swordsman was not the kind of swordsman I thought it was.

215
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:52,686
 It was far from protecting justice.

216
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:03,666

217
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:07,936
 "Being a swordsman is so childish..."

218
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:10,556
 "Let's just help out at mom's store," is what I thought.

219
00:16:10,556 --> 00:16:12,346
 At that moment, however...

220
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:14,540

221
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,550
 Fate came to me there.

222
00:16:16,556 --> 00:16:21,756
 The fate of a real swordsman who punishes all the bad guys.

223
00:16:21,756 --> 00:16:26,016

(T:/N Same spelling as prosecutor in Korean)

224
00:16:28,506 --> 00:16:34,426

225
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:39,546

226
00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:42,566

We'll now have the prosecutors taking an oath.

227
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,356

228
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:48,676

Representative of the new prosecutors, Jin Jung.

229
00:16:52,966 --> 00:16:56,646
Representative of the new prosecutors, Jin Jung, to the platform.

230
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:02,916
Prosecutor Jin Jung, are you not here?

231
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,136
I'm right here!

232
00:17:12,016 --> 00:17:14,036
I'm so sorry.

233
00:17:14,036 --> 00:17:15,826
I thought it was tomorrow.

234
00:17:16,506 --> 00:17:18,666
I'm sorry.

235
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:33,676
I'm taking the picture now.

236
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:37,156
One, two!

237
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,796
One more time, please.

238
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,996
 Yes, I did hear about it...

239
00:17:40,996 --> 00:17:44,856
 that there was a guy in a sweat suit who brought a wooden sword to the commission ceremony.

240
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,416
I thought it was just an urban myth.

241
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,176
It's more like a heroic fable than a strange story.

242
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:51,486
Something like being born with a fate to be a prosecutor.

243
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:55,236
So you should treat me well too. I'm not someone who you can be rude to like thiâ€”

244
00:17:55,236 --> 00:17:57,336
Seriously...

245
00:18:01,006 --> 00:18:03,766
I told you to leave CEO Kim alone, didn't I?

246
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:07,016
You did.

247
00:18:07,016 --> 00:18:08,776
Then what would be the meaning of this?

248
00:18:08,776 --> 00:18:12,226
Why do you keep not listening and make scenes, butting in here and there on your own?

249
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:16,906
When you're only a chick that just became independent and entered first grade!

250
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:18,926
A chick is yellow, though...

251
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:25,876
Let's... please...

252
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:27,876
not go overboard, Jin Jung.

253
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:31,016
Nowadays, I spring up from sleep whenever I think of you.

254
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:32,526
Also...

255
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:35,456
Why? Just why does a prosecutor carry a wooden sword? Why?

256
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:37,656
Because I can't exactly carry a real one.

257
00:18:37,656 --> 00:18:39,926
A real sword is dangerous...

258
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,656
Get out. Get out!

259
00:18:47,656 --> 00:18:50,376
Get out and write a letter of apology!

260
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:56,666

261
00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:01,816

262
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:04,666
They wouldn't know if I just changed the date, right?

263
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,386
They wouldn't know.

264
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:11,446

265
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:17,396

266
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:25,046
This is your allocation, Prosecutor.

267
00:19:25,046 --> 00:19:26,976
What's the use of allocations coming?

268
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:28,546
It's probably just small stuff again.

269
00:19:28,546 --> 00:19:31,566
Gosh... look here.

270
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:34,746
Obstruction of business, drunken disturbance,

271
00:19:34,746 --> 00:19:36,876
public urination...

272
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,506
How can I help but go outside on my own?

273
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:42,026
How could it be all stuff like this for a year?

274
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:47,806

275
00:19:49,136 --> 00:19:51,706
Hey, Chul Ki, this is not a mistake, right?

276
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,506

277
00:20:05,216 --> 00:20:08,416

278
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,376

279
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,106

280
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:14,336

281
00:20:29,616 --> 00:20:31,476
Anyone there?

282
00:20:33,036 --> 00:20:34,926
It's the police.

283
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:46,776
Hello?

284
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,316
Call for backup.

285
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:08,279
HQ, HQ. Asking for backup. 
  (T/N: HQ - Headquarters)

286
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:11,179
Calling for backup at 77 Beomil Street.

287
00:21:19,056 --> 00:21:21,616
Confirmed backup request at 77 Beomil Street.

288
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:25,876
Put your hands up.

289
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:47,866
Thank you.

290
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:51,446
Put that back in before I break your wrist.

291
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,476
Let's begin.

292
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:58,236
Mr. Kim Hyo Joon, you're currently being interrogated for allegations of assault and murder of the victim, Park Ye Young.

293
00:21:58,236 --> 00:22:00,386
According to Article 244 of the Criminal Code,

294
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:03,016
you have the right to refuse adverse statements at the time of interrogation and

295
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:06,846
your statements made after forsaking that right may be used as evidence of the crime in court.

296
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:08,176
Honorifics are up to here.

297
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:10,236
Did you get it? 
  (Said informally)

298
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:11,296
Yes.

299
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,076
Let me hear you out, at least...

300
00:22:13,076 --> 00:22:15,766
about why you're sitting here right now.

301
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:26,026

302
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,746
 Delivery.

303
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:42,176
 I'll leave it at your door.

304
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:47,956
 - Sorry... 
 - Shit...

305
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:50,136
 I'm sorry.

306
00:22:55,576 --> 00:22:57,266
 Apologize again.

307
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:59,576
 I told you that I'm sorry.

308
00:23:07,206 --> 00:23:09,066
 Be careful next time.

309
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:10,416
 Okay.

310
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:13,156
 So annoying, seriously...

311
00:23:16,206 --> 00:23:18,186
 - What did you just say? 
 - Sorry?

312
00:23:18,186 --> 00:23:19,786
 I asked about what you just said.

313
00:23:19,786 --> 00:23:21,866
 I didn't say anything.

314
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:25,486
 Let it go, please.

315
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:28,036
 - I'm calling the police if you keep doing this. 
 - Call the police, then.

316
00:23:28,036 --> 00:23:30,356
 Please helâ€”

317
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:37,116
 What did you say?

318
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,309
That's why you killed her?

319
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:41,269
Because you were offended?

320
00:23:42,196 --> 00:23:43,706
Well...

321
00:23:49,736 --> 00:23:52,646
You killed the victim and confessed the day after.

322
00:23:52,646 --> 00:23:54,286
Why?

323
00:23:54,286 --> 00:23:56,416
You could've confessed on the same day if you were going to.

324
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,006
I slept because I was tired.

325
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:07,686
I didn't know, but... a human can be more resilient than I thought.

326
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:30,516
So later... I was so exhausted...

327
00:24:33,546 --> 00:24:34,906
Why did you turn yourself in?

328
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:38,066
It's better to turn myself in since I'll be caught anyway.

329
00:24:42,506 --> 00:24:45,086
My circumstances will be considered, right?

330
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:13,108
I heard about it, the Seocho-dong murder case.

331
00:25:14,325 --> 00:25:16,198
What brings you here?

332
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:18,421
There's a company dinner for the entire Criminal Division.

333
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:20,151
Seven o'clock at Cheongsim House.

334
00:25:20,845 --> 00:25:23,658
- Today, I'm a littlâ€” 
 - You were the only one absent last year, too.

335
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:26,568
Since the Chief Prosecutor is also coming this time...

336
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,838
attend, no matter the circumstances.

337
00:25:31,718 --> 00:25:34,408
- But I have a case todayâ€” 
 - The circumstances and evidence are clear.

338
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,118
He even confessed.

339
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,788
You can just charge him, so what's the matter?

340
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,088

341
00:25:41,088 --> 00:25:43,078
That's true.

342
00:25:43,078 --> 00:25:45,188
But something keeps bothering me.

343
00:25:45,188 --> 00:25:46,968
Think about it coldly.

344
00:25:46,968 --> 00:25:49,028
All the contents are in the report.

345
00:25:49,028 --> 00:25:51,108
Don't believe anything, and just look at the documents.

346
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:53,948
That's what a prosecutor needs to do.

347
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,060

348
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:37,988
Gosh, what excuse can I make?

349
00:26:46,568 --> 00:26:50,018
Senior... I'm sorry.

350
00:26:50,848 --> 00:26:52,588
I left the...

351
00:26:53,518 --> 00:26:55,748
stove on at home.

352
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:57,408
Sorry.

353
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,248
You need to go to the company dinner.

354
00:28:08,178 --> 00:28:09,538
You've arrived.

355
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:12,508
 Hello, Chief Prosecutor!

356
00:28:14,598 --> 00:28:16,218
Let's go in.

357
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:28,308

358
00:28:34,898 --> 00:28:37,088
Everyone poured one, right?

359
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:39,018
We, the Criminal Division, what are we?

360
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,618
P. A. R.

361
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:41,708
Persevering!

362
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:45,278
 Audacious! Robust!

363
00:28:45,948 --> 00:28:47,638
One second.

364
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:53,828
This meeting is for the unity of the Criminal Division.

365
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:59,128
Then... isn't it also meaningful only when everyone does the toast together?

366
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:05,648
I'm sorry, I haven't had fish in a long time.

367
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:12,438
Deputy Chief Kim, I wasn't going to say this, but...

368
00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:14,388
Then you can just not say it.

369
00:29:18,438 --> 00:29:21,108
I'm sorry, I was just talking to myself.

370
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:28,028
Looking at you now, you are a vibrant prosecutor, Prosecutor Jin...

371
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:31,048
seeing that you talk to yourself this out loud.

372
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:34,448
Please don't mind him too much, Chief.

373
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:37,128
I'll make sure to reprimand him.

374
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:48,128
I'm sorry.

375
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:50,008
Sorry...

376
00:29:50,008 --> 00:29:52,198
Please excuse us.

377
00:29:52,198 --> 00:29:54,548
It's okay. No need.

378
00:29:55,518 --> 00:29:57,858
Is he the only one to blame here?

379
00:29:57,858 --> 00:30:02,378
Technically, it's all the of the overseer's fault.

380
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:05,668
That's not true.

381
00:30:05,668 --> 00:30:06,918
It's my fault.

382
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:10,078
- I should've trained him more thoroughlyâ€” 
 - Prosecutor Shin.

383
00:30:11,408 --> 00:30:12,758
I apologize, Chief.

384
00:30:12,758 --> 00:30:14,798
I'll make sure to correct it.

385
00:30:17,618 --> 00:30:20,208
Let's all have a glass.

386
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,678
For the Criminal Division!

387
00:30:21,678 --> 00:30:24,108
 Cheers!

388
00:30:33,928 --> 00:30:36,288
 You're a dead man now.

389
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:39,638

390
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:42,788
Did I tell you to bring me to a place like this?

391
00:30:42,788 --> 00:30:45,608
I'm already irritated because of my case.

392
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:20,888
Excuse me, sir, but the head of your watch's location is different from mine...

393
00:31:20,888 --> 00:31:22,358
why is it like that?

394
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:23,978
Oh, this?

395
00:31:23,978 --> 00:31:26,308
It's a watch made for left-handed people.

396
00:31:44,848 --> 00:31:46,198
Hey! Jin Jung, you come here.

397
00:31:46,198 --> 00:31:50,058
- How could you have no respect forâ€” 
 - Thank you, thank you, Senior.

398
00:31:50,058 --> 00:31:51,558
It's all thanks to you, Senior! I'm going now.

399
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:54,478
W-Where are you going? Stop!

400
00:31:55,898 --> 00:31:59,108
Don't you dare try to move an inch from that spot!

401
00:32:02,528 --> 00:32:04,058
Hey!

402
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:05,988
That idiotic bastard!

403
00:32:05,988 --> 00:32:08,718
Gosh, seriously!

404
00:32:49,198 --> 00:32:51,898
 Fingerprints found inside the house...

405
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,948
 There's nothing odd about...

406
00:32:58,948 --> 00:33:01,038
 the fingerprints being found.

407
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:04,878
 He stayed with the corpse at the scene.

408
00:33:24,138 --> 00:33:27,368
 The fingerprints found on the weapon were of a right hand.

409
00:33:28,438 --> 00:33:31,118
 Kim Hyo Jun is left-handed, though...

410
00:33:37,438 --> 00:33:39,888
But what was found was a right hand...

411
00:33:41,538 --> 00:33:43,708
This doesn't add up.

412
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:04,658
This is puffer fish sashimi, the special menu of the day.

413
00:34:04,658 --> 00:34:06,298
Whoa! Whoa...

414
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:11,108
Here...

415
00:34:11,108 --> 00:34:12,358
I'm sorry...

416
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:14,668
I can't handle alcohol that well.

417
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:17,068
Don't be like that and take it.

418
00:34:17,068 --> 00:34:19,208
It's a shot for your hard work.

419
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,458
Okay.

420
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,528
I'll just take your consideration.

421
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:26,108
Hurry up and take it, my friend. My arm hurts.

422
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,618
Okay.

423
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:34,888
You're supposed to take a shot with your right hand.

424
00:34:34,888 --> 00:34:38,648
I'm sorry, I'm left-handed.

425
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,188
How are you allowed to do that?

426
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:45,758
Take it with your right hand.

427
00:34:47,328 --> 00:34:48,748
I'm sorry.

428
00:34:48,748 --> 00:34:51,261
I've been using the knife with my left hand...

429
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:52,861
I apologize.

430
00:34:56,775 --> 00:34:59,808
This bastard... who do you think I am?

431
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:02,908
Hey, don't you know who I am?

432
00:35:03,718 --> 00:35:04,918
I'm sorry.

433
00:35:04,918 --> 00:35:06,608
He's at it again.

434
00:35:07,878 --> 00:35:09,598
I'm the Chief Prosecutor, you asshole.

435
00:35:09,598 --> 00:35:12,668
And who are you to ignore what I say?

436
00:35:12,668 --> 00:35:16,538
Are you having a power trip for making this shit?

437
00:35:18,678 --> 00:35:20,408
I'm sorry.

438
00:35:20,408 --> 00:35:24,058
You arrogant bastard, how dare you put down the glass?

439
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:26,118
You're quite drunk. Please stop now.

440
00:35:26,118 --> 00:35:29,798
L-Let me go. Let go of me!

441
00:35:29,798 --> 00:35:31,758
There are a lot of eyes watching...

442
00:35:31,758 --> 00:35:33,408
You've been pre-appointed as the Prosecutor General, so

443
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:35,938
you need to avoid having scandals.

444
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:41,948
Please watch the steps.

445
00:35:51,388 --> 00:35:53,578
 Please take care.

446
00:36:03,948 --> 00:36:06,818
- Whoa... 
 - Whenever he gets drunk, man...

447
00:36:06,818 --> 00:36:08,488
Prosecutor Shin.

448
00:36:08,488 --> 00:36:09,908
Yes, Deputy Chief.

449
00:36:09,908 --> 00:36:12,538
It's still a company dinner, but the kids

450
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:15,338
didn't even get to eat properly.

451
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:18,018
Take them elsewhere and let them feast.

452
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:19,688
Thank you.

453
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:21,478
I'm going, take care.

454
00:36:21,478 --> 00:36:23,948
Okay, please get home safe.

455
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,438
- Deputy Chief is leavingâ€” 
 - Hey, hey!

456
00:36:25,438 --> 00:36:27,818
Don't do it, okay?

457
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,338
What are you trying to gain from making your supervisor look like an old man?

458
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:33,708
D-Did it show a lot?

459
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,758
- I'm going. 
 - Okay.

460
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:37,318
- Don't drink too much. 
 - Okay.

461
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:39,448
Is beef also an allowed option?

462
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:42,088
That's not a company card. It's a personal card.

463
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:45,078
 Please take care.

464
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,278
Gosh, man...

465
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:52,108
 - He's so much better, you know? 
 - Seriously.

466
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:54,648
The investigative report?

467
00:36:54,648 --> 00:36:58,138
Yes. I wrote that report. Is there a problem?

468
00:36:58,138 --> 00:37:01,028
No, I just have something to confirm.

469
00:37:01,028 --> 00:37:02,278
Confirm?

470
00:37:02,278 --> 00:37:06,318
The suspect's fingerprints... that were found on the murder weapon.

471
00:37:08,138 --> 00:37:09,858
The suspect's right-hand fingerprints.

472
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:10,998
So?

473
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:12,578
Isn't that weird?

474
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:16,328
From what I know, the suspect, Kim Hyo Jun, is left-handed.

475
00:37:20,468 --> 00:37:22,668
The suspect's statement. He wrote this himself, right?

476
00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:28,708
- Yes, he did. Kim Hyo Jun wrote it himselâ€” 
 - Let me see the interrogation footage.

477
00:37:29,628 --> 00:37:32,408
Why are you suddenly asking for that?

478
00:37:32,408 --> 00:37:34,978
He probably didn't write the statement here, right?

479
00:37:34,978 --> 00:37:38,258
I just need to check which hand he wrote it with, left or right.

480
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:40,158
So bring me the footage, please.

481
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:47,838
Why are you not bringing it to me?

482
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:50,858
Well... I don't get paid enough for this shit.

483
00:37:50,858 --> 00:37:53,898
- What did you say just now? 
 - Huh?

484
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:57,188
Are you... saying that I did a botched investigation or something?

485
00:37:57,188 --> 00:38:00,078
Stay at your desk like a prosecutor should be

486
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,678
and stop butting in here and there unnecessarily.

487
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:04,138
What you're doing right now...

488
00:38:04,138 --> 00:38:07,148
it's making us, the police, very uncomfortable.

489
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,578
That's none of my business.

490
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:14,168
Just hand the footage over.

491
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:15,838
Where is the interrogation footage?

492
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:18,818
The hard drive... is being checked.

493
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:21,598
I'll send it after the check is done,

494
00:38:21,598 --> 00:38:23,218
so head back now.

495
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,388
Okay?

496
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:28,328
The police nowadays don't swallow these things, all right?

497
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,878
Head back before things turn ugly for you.

498
00:38:33,258 --> 00:38:36,288
Things shouldn't turn ugly for me...

499
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,288
but for you.

500
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:39,928
How much did you get?

501
00:38:39,928 --> 00:38:42,208
W-What?

502
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:45,208
For erasing the footage, how much did you get?

503
00:38:46,128 --> 00:38:48,028

504
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:49,798
About 80,000,000 won (57000 USD)?

505
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:53,338
5,000,000 won more?

506
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:54,988
How dare you, right now...

507
00:38:54,988 --> 00:38:56,238
You think you can just say whatever you want?

508
00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:59,688
I... bought it with my own money, why?

509
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:05,458
Of all the people who claimed to buy it with their own money, I've never seen a single one who actually did.

510
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:06,588
Let go.

511
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:08,178
- You won't? 
 - I won't.

512
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:09,698
- You won't? 
 - I won't!

513
00:39:09,698 --> 00:39:11,518
Why you...

514
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,798
Come on, quit it.

515
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:15,968
I said, let go!

516
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:20,328
Please go back now.

517
00:39:20,328 --> 00:39:21,698
I'm coming back for you.

518
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:23,868
- I'm coming back! 
 - Sure, come back.

519
00:39:23,868 --> 00:39:25,698
Do you know who I am?

520
00:39:25,698 --> 00:39:27,148
How old are you guys?

521
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:29,888
- How old are yoâ€” 
 - Please, hold it back.

522
00:39:29,888 --> 00:39:32,058
Be prepared. I'm coming back.

523
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,478
Shit...

524
00:39:40,218 --> 00:39:41,578
I didn't get caught, right?

525
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:44,618
 - You won't? 
 - I won't.

526
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:47,858
 Come on, quit it.

527
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:49,918
Send it to the forensics. As soon as possible, since it's urgent.

528
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:51,148
Okay.

529
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:57,338
- Where have you been? 
 - Oh, geez!

530
00:39:57,338 --> 00:39:59,238
What are you doing at someone else's office?

531
00:39:59,238 --> 00:40:01,838
- It's like you're a ghost... 
 - Shut it.

532
00:40:03,118 --> 00:40:04,488
What's this right here?

533
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,848
Why do you still have this?

534
00:40:06,848 --> 00:40:09,838
It's because there are still some questionable circumstances.

535
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:12,668
Please give me some time, as a favor.

536
00:40:12,668 --> 00:40:15,148
If I do you a favor, even things that would've worked will fail.

537
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:17,278
Process it as charged today.

538
00:40:17,278 --> 00:40:19,328
Come on, seriously.

539
00:40:19,328 --> 00:40:21,368
I said there are questionable circumstances.

540
00:40:21,368 --> 00:40:23,608
What questionable circumstances?

541
00:40:23,608 --> 00:40:26,808
Stay put for a bit. I'm looking into it.

542
00:40:26,808 --> 00:40:28,528
This won't do.

543
00:40:28,528 --> 00:40:31,288
Bring all the case files to my desk.

544
00:40:32,228 --> 00:40:33,288
Senior!

545
00:40:33,288 --> 00:40:36,078
Newbie, listen to me first.

546
00:40:36,078 --> 00:40:38,628
Anyone can whine using the circumstances.

547
00:40:38,628 --> 00:40:41,678
Do you have substantial proof to continue the investigations?

548
00:40:42,918 --> 00:40:46,058
I thought the lunch break was over a while ago?

549
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:55,798
You want more time for your investigation?

550
00:40:55,798 --> 00:41:00,198
Yes. There's a part that I need to clarify in order to close the case.

551
00:41:00,198 --> 00:41:02,548
That's not it, Deputy Chief. Please ignore what Prosecutor Jin is saying anâ€”

552
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:05,208
The suspect's fingerprints were found at the scene...

553
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:09,678
and the suspect even confessed that he was the one who did it,

554
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:12,358
but you still need us to give more time...

555
00:41:13,328 --> 00:41:15,138
to our problematic kid of the Criminal Division?

556
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:17,878
Yes. I think I do need it.

557
00:41:17,878 --> 00:41:19,528
What if I don't allow it?

558
00:41:19,528 --> 00:41:21,728
I'm still going to do it.

559
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:31,138
Try then.

560
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:36,068
If it's suspicious, it's right to investigate until the end,

561
00:41:36,068 --> 00:41:38,748
since it's the most fundamental principle of all for a prosecutor not to

562
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:41,008
leave even the slightest suspicion in a case.

563
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:43,488
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

564
00:41:43,488 --> 00:41:45,708
Go rampage to your heart's content.

565
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:47,048
Okay.

566
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:56,138
Try... rampaging.

567
00:41:58,718 --> 00:42:01,078
Why are the cables unplugged on this one?

568
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:02,738
I don't think we can use it.

569
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,318
I don't think it works.

570
00:42:12,388 --> 00:42:13,978
Come down.

571
00:42:58,498 --> 00:43:00,128
 Lee Chul Ki speaking.

572
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:05,848
 Okay, I got it.

573
00:43:05,848 --> 00:43:08,738
Prosecutor, the forensics results are out.

574
00:43:11,918 --> 00:43:14,708

575
00:43:15,858 --> 00:43:18,918
After the case was submitted, he talked with someone on the phone.

576
00:43:18,918 --> 00:43:22,118
The call lasted one minute, and the other number was a burner phone.

577
00:43:22,118 --> 00:43:23,648
What about the account?

578
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:25,788
There's nothing wrong with his account.

579
00:43:25,788 --> 00:43:30,338
Instead... I secured his text history with his wife.

580
00:43:31,638 --> 00:43:34,858

581
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:37,788

582
00:43:40,538 --> 00:43:42,648
Should I process his summons?

583
00:43:44,198 --> 00:43:47,278
It was illegally obtained, so it might backfire on us.

584
00:43:51,388 --> 00:43:53,488
Let's go with the textbook method.

585
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:01,728
- Detective, get on right now. 
 - What are you doing here?

586
00:44:01,728 --> 00:44:03,758
We don't have time, hurry!

587
00:44:03,758 --> 00:44:05,548
- Why...? 
 - Hurry up and get in!

588
00:44:05,548 --> 00:44:06,978
- Wait, why? 
 - Just come on and get in.

589
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,308
- What's the matter? 
 - Shut the door.

590
00:44:09,308 --> 00:44:10,688
By the way...

591
00:44:12,738 --> 00:44:15,838
- What the hell? 
 - Hey, why is he not passing out?

592
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:18,248
Hold him, hold him. Hold his head!

593
00:44:18,248 --> 00:44:21,048
- You bastard... 
 - Hold him tight.

594
00:44:21,048 --> 00:44:22,508
Strangle him!

595
00:44:22,508 --> 00:44:23,688
- Stay still! 
 - Strangle his neck!

596
00:44:23,688 --> 00:44:26,978
- Hey, wasn't he supposed to pass out from being hit in the jaw? 
 - I'm sorry.

597
00:44:26,978 --> 00:44:29,138
Shit! Stay still.

598
00:44:29,138 --> 00:44:30,978
 That was so close.

599
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:32,758
 Let's go now.

600
00:44:32,758 --> 00:44:34,478
 Why wouldn't he pass out?

601
00:44:34,478 --> 00:44:36,488
 Gosh, shit...

602
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:44,020
For the Seocho-dong murder case, why did you allow more time?

603
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,950
A person, a woman in her 20s, died.

604
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,860
Assault and murder...

605
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:54,330
The issues that the nation finds most outrageous are all in this case.

606
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,600
Don't you know what this means?

607
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,170
Even the bereaved family sent a petition against it.

608
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,890
Before things go bad, and a press conference is discussed,

609
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:07,880
close the case.

610
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:14,060
Hey, Deputy Chief Kim. Don't you hear me?

611
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,170
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can follow your order.

612
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,640
What?

613
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,300
As you said, this is a case that the nation is outrageous about.

614
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,380
So, shouldn't we approach it with even more caution?

615
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:33,430
You're... going to rebel even if I tell you to wrap it up right away?

616
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,420
If that's how you understood it, that's unfortunate.

617
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,180
Hey, Kim Tae Ho!

618
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:41,170
Before you speak anything else, let me ask you one thing.

619
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:44,330
The fact that you're telling me to wrap up the investigations in a hurry...

620
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:47,220
I'm curious about the real reason behind it.

621
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:53,430
Is it because of your Prosecutor General appointment?

622
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,170
If that's not the case, I'll have the investigations continue.

623
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:05,580

624
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,570
Did you wake up?

625
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,990
Y-You crazy bastard!

626
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,800
You! Who the hell are you?

627
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,890
Can you do this, being a prosecutor?

628
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,680
Yes, I can.

629
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,810
Especially to punks like you.

630
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:38,080
Do you know what I've learned while working in this field?

631
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,380
What is it?

632
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,570
That, to catch people like you,

633
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,850
I need to be more evil and more treacherous than you.

634
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,900
You guys are making a big mistake here.

635
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,480
If you get caught, it won't be over with just an apology.

636
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,270
Hey, if you untie me now, I'll pretend that nothing happened.

637
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,250
Gosh, you really lack common sense.

638
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,580
Excuse me, Detective.

639
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,250
If I were to untie you, why would I bring you here?

640
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,270
You're not the only ones who want to get away with things.

641
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:05,050
I'd also love it if I could get away with things.

642
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:06,510
Let's cut to the chase.

643
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,450
Who gave you the order?

644
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,560
I-I'm not sure what you mean...

645
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:23,120
This is the last time.

646
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,260
The interrogation footage of Kim Hyo Jun. Who ordered you to delete it?

647
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,270
W-Well, t-that's...

648
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,030
l-like...

649
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:40,090
I'm sorry.

650
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,480
What the heck?

651
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,850
I'm...

652
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,670
sorry, I'll try again.

653
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,240
W-Wait, h-hold on a moment.

654
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,530
One second, one second.

655
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:06,990
I r-really don't know who it was. I was just asked to delete the footage.

656
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,470
Kim Hyo Jun's handwritten statement.

657
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,450
Was it his left hand or right hand?

658
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,160
It... was...

659
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,930
I'm asking you!

660
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,670
Did he write with his right hand?

661
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,240
His left hand.

662
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,050
It was his left hand.

663
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,330
Okay. Where's the footage?

664
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:24,860
S-Sorry?

665
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,970
You must've not deleted it completely, at least to secure your future.

666
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:31,220
I burned everything... the hard drive as a whole...

667
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,410
Okay, I'll give you a chance.

668
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:40,760
An opportunity for you to do your best as a human being.

669
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,610
Y-Yes.

670
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:48,320
W-What shall I do?

671
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,840

672
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,590
Write it.

673
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,150
What?

674
00:48:56,317 --> 00:48:58,350
This case was messed up from the beginning.

675
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,190
Kim Hyo Jun is not the culprit.

676
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,530
I got it confirmed by the detective in charge.

677
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:06,020
I guess we'll need to re-investigate.

678
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,410
Where are you?

679
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,310
I'm re-investigating.

680
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:17,440

681
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,590
What brings you here?

682
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:49,320
I thought I'd see your face at the court.

683
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,660
How is your life in prison? Is it doable?

684
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,030
Whoa. Are you worried about me?

685
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:57,690
Yeah, right.

686
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,260
I don't worry about murderers.

687
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:04,170
But I do suspect if you're the one who committed the murder.

688
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:06,430
This guy is funny.

689
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,110
Are you saying that I'm not the culprit?

690
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,890
Why are you asking me that?

691
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:11,670
You know better than I do.

692
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:14,480
Listen well, Kim Hyo Jun.

693
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,970
A woman in her 20s was cruelly assaulted and murdered,

694
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:22,410
however, the suspect isn't even showing any sign of remorse,

695
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:24,580
and is constantly smiling.

696
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,810
I'm going to seek the maximum legal sentence for you,

697
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:35,150
since my duty is not letting bastards like you come back out into society.

698
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,650
But,

699
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,240
what if you're not the culprit?

700
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,700
This is what I got from your detective in charge.

701
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,310
Read it.

702
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:02,360

703
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:10,580

704
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,770
Are you still going to play games?

705
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:15,990
Who is it?

706
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,990
The one who wants you to stay in here quietly.

707
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,630
You're not the culprit, are you?

708
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,620
Who is that bastard?

709
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,690
Let me tell you one thing.

710
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,080
I am the culprit.

711
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:48,880
I... I'm saying I killed that woman.

712
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:51,980
Happy now?

713
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:58,510
Don't come to me ever again.

714
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,930
Let's go.

715
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,940
He's making me get competitive.

716
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:22,560
 The nation is hot with anger about the Seocho-dong murder case.

717
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,880
 Some are even suspecting that, even after arresting

718
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,780
 the most suspected person, the prosecution is not charging him.

719
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,070

Some are even saying that, since the police got the right to

720
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:34,480
 terminate an investigation from the recent Police-Prosecution Investigation Termination adjustment,

721
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,340
 that the prosecution is intentionally delaying

722
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,410
 the investigation, raising controversy.

723
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,940
You're Prosecutor Jin Jung, who is in charge of the Seocho-dong murder case, right?

724
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,620
What's your reason for still not having charged the suspect?

725
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:48,700
There's a controversy that you're intentionally delaying the investigation. A word about that, please.

726
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:52,920
The newspapers and the media are going crazy,

727
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,490
saying why we're sitting on a case that the police already investigated and sent off.

728
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:58,610
It's a case that Prosecutor Jin is investigating.

729
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,780
Please wait a little longer.

730
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,660

731
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:14,460

An order came down from above.

732
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:17,510
From this moment, you two get your hands off of this case.

733
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:20,790
Prosecutor Jin, you rest at home for a while.

734
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:33,140
I'm sorry for not having any power.

735
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,100
Why would you apologize, Deputy Chief?

736
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,730
The one stopping the investigation is someone else.

737
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:39,530
What are you going to do now?

738
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,490
I need to go meet him.

739
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:44,590
The new prosecutor in charge.

740
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:55,630
Yes.

741
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,270

742
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:09,590
Re-investigation of the case?

743
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:11,380
Yes.

744
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,260
This case was fabricated completely from the beginning

745
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:17,270
to frame Kim Hyo Jun as the culprit.

746
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:19,740
This is not just a simple murder case.

747
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:23,140
- There's definitely a person behind the scenes. 
 - Behind the scenes?

748
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,760
Someone who can plant fingerprints into the murder

749
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,160
weapon and pay tons of won for erasing footage.

750
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,470
He's probably quite high up the ladder and

751
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:34,440
related to the victim in one way or the other.

752
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,250
That's too much of a fiction.

753
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,130
It's not fiction.

754
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:41,530
- You can tell from the statementâ€” 
 - Prosecutor Jin,

755
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:44,520
let's not discuss the statement.

756
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,330
You clearly know that a statement made to be written by force

757
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:49,870
has no power in the court as well.

758
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:54,580
Of course, your story can be true.

759
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:58,570
It's common for the prosecution to have the wrong person.

760
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:02,690
Unfortunately, though, there's probably nothing that we can do.

761
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:05,100
The higher-ups already ordered quick processing of charge and

762
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,320
I can't help but follow that order.

763
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:12,440
In the end, we're just a part of an organization.

764
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,370
What can we do when we need to make a living?

765
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:17,000
We need to endure it, even if it's disgusting.

766
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:19,980
Why would you endure something that's disgusting?

767
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,990
A disgusting thing is to be removed, not endured.

768
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,740
If re-investigation is difficult, then please, at least postpone the trial date.

769
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:31,060
I absolutely can't let this case pass by like this.

770
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:35,120
I'm going to catch this bastard, no matter what.

771
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,260
Please help me, Do Hwan.

772
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:47,740
Why do you care this much about this case?

773
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,660
It's not like the suspect is related to you.

774
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,570
This matter of finding the truth... is it something like

775
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:59,250
the typical, "As a prosecutor, I won't let a single innocent person be arrested for what they didn't do"?

776
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,890
No.

777
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,580
It's nothing like that,

778
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:05,500
but he's just unlucky.

779
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,990
The real culprit, I mean.

780
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:11,820
Because he just had to be caught by me, of all prosecutors.

781
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,840
You're just as I heard.

782
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:23,260
Well, then... let's start with delaying the trial date.

783
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,460
Thank you, Senior.

784
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,150
Thank you!

785
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,690

786
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,750
 You take the Seocho-dong murder case.

787
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:48,980
 As far as I know, Prosecutor Jin is the one investigating that case.

788
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,180
 What's important, Prosecutor Oh, is that

789
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:55,890
 this case is the first and last opportunity for you.

790
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,980
 The Deputy Chief position at the Southern District offices is empty.

791
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:04,630
 The Financial Crime Department. It's the most important position out of all the important ones.

792
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,320
 How is going to be?

793
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,960
 From what I see,

794
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,190
 that position would be very fitting for you.

795
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:20,660
 I won't ask why you care so much about this case, Chief.

796
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,550
 Why would a simple case of murder...

797
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:26,490
 be a secret that needs to be hidden for someone.

798
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:30,650
 So what's your answer?

799
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:32,410
 Give me something bigger.

800
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:35,820
 For example...

801
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:43,990

802
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:55,330
 I guess I have been raising a tiger cub.

803
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:05,480

804
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,420
 Case number 2022KOHAB54,

805
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:17,670
 the court sentences the following regarding the suspect,

806
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:19,660
 Kim Hyo Jun's assault and murder allegations.

807
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,880
 Chief Prosecutor Lee Jang Won of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

808
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,850
 has been appointed as the next Prosecutor General.

809
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:26,060

Chief Lee Jang Won...

810
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,970
 Article 260 of the Criminal Code, guilty.

811
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:33,030
 Article 250 of the Criminal Code, guilty.

812
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:34,950
 Taking into account the cruelty of the crime,

813
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:38,430
 total lack of any sign of remorse,

814
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:42,670
 and the bereaved family's request for severe punishment,

815
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:47,610
 the suspect, Kim Hyo Jun, is sentenced to twenty years in prison.

816
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:04,770
There was enough room for re-investigation.

817
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,230
Why did you forcefully press charges?

818
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:10,170
Because it was an appropriate press of charges?

819
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,650
I guess you were promised quite a big thing?

820
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:17,710
From Chief Lee Jang Won.

821
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:32,450
Sorry, but you can't enter the premises during probation.

822
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,180
 Guard Han Dae Hun, please come to the security office.

823
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,990
Okay.

824
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,740
People are going to be surprised

825
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:50,700
to discover that the ace of our office, Oh Do Hwan,

826
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:55,780
is this rotten to the core...

827
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:59,570
making anybody a culprit just to climb up in his career?

828
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,170
You came all the way here to say that?

829
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,280
What?

830
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,370
I guess you have a lot of time nowadays, Prosecutor Shin,

831
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:09,190
to be nosy about someone else's case?

832
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,840
It's not being nosy, it's a matter of crossing a line, Prosecutor Oh.

833
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:18,840
If you're a Prosecutor who wears a suit of law, shouldn't you have some sense of conscience at leastâ€”

834
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:22,160
Why did you do that?

835
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:25,700
Answer me, you asshole!

836
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,480
Why did you do that?

837
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,390
Are you naive or just stupid?

838
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:35,980
What?

839
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:38,490
Hey.

840
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:40,680
What do you think the prosecution is about?

841
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,190
Justice? Truth? Human rights?

842
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:45,410
I hope that you're not seriously thinking that.

843
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:49,180
I swear that there's no one in here who wishes for those things

844
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:53,560
because this place is a place that can bury and rig any case

845
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,460
if that means you can get what you want!

846
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:58,730
A place that suspends prosecution on a crime if you know people and have a background.

847
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,100
A place that sacrifices the majority for the minority.

848
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,760
A place that strikes anyone who rebels against the profit of the organization.

849
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:07,810
A place where a defect like you, who rampages alone, can't ever survive!

850
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:13,280
That's... what the prosecution here is...

851
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,300
Prosecutor Jin.

852
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:25,420
Let's have a meeting with the Chief soon.

853
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:28,640
Just consider this as having paid your fees for a lesson.

854
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,750
Naive or stupid...

855
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,690
What?

856
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,420
Just what do you think of me?

857
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:46,010
Don't be mistaken. I know it all, too.

858
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:49,130
I know that you all call me a defect,

859
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:53,330
and that this place is rotten to the core, as you said.

860
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:55,730
Do you know what the problem is, though?

861
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:01,340
These assholes keep crossing the line because I keep pretending not to know.

862
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:04,310
Jin Jung, don't do it.

863
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,920
This time, you guys crossed the line way too far.

864
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:15,820
So this time, I'll... crush all the assholes like you guys.

865
01:02:53,090 --> 01:03:00,190

866
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,280

867
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,610
 I've been assigned to work here starting today. I'm Park Jae Kyung.

868
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:11,560
 You need to speak, or this one will really drop you.

869
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,570
 He's a guy who runs an entertainment establishment in Gangnam.

870
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:15,380
 I think he's connected to Chief Lee Jang Won.

871
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:16,810
 I'm going to call Jin Jung over.

872
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:18,530
 I don't treat a bad guy as a human being.

873
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:19,780
 It's a search and seizure warrant.

874
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,900
 How dare you, you arrogant bastard? Are you the Prosecutor General!

875
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,170
 Chief Lee Jang Won... let's get him together.

876
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,680
 Let's just make one thing clear.

877
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,140
 Every operation will be carried out as I see fit.

878
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:27,820
 Send Yoo Jin Chul off to China.

879
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,780
 It's the 10 AM plane to Shanghai. Go and secure Yoo Jin Chul.

880
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,320
 The plane already left, so this is it.

881
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,370
 There's still a way. Let's just do something crazy for once.
