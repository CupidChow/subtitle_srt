1
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,110

2
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,770
Just what do you think of me?

3
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:49,020
Don't be mistaken.

4
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,120
I know it all, too.

5
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,370
I know that you all call me a defect,

6
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,680
and that this place is rotten to the core, as you said.

7
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,120
Do you know what the problem is, though?

8
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,680
These assholes keep crossing the line because I keep pretending not to know.

9
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,030
Jin Jung, don't do it.

10
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,180
This time, you guys crossed the line way too far.

11
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,760
So this time, I'll... crush all the assholes like you guys.

12
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,970
Get up. I'm not finished yet.

13
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,450
What the hell are you doing!

14
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,030
How dare a rotten apple spoil the entire barrel! Where do you think you are?

15
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,220

16
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,120

17
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,570

18
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,870

19
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,700
♫  I can't stand it any longer  ♫

20
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,180
♫  You better run, run away  ♫

21
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,800
♫  Look forward to the big picture I've drawn so far  ♫

22
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,650
♫  As you did, no more than  ♫

23
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,860
♫  I'll give it back  ♫

24
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,530
♫  No, you can't stop me now  ♫

25
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,520
♫  I'm going off the deep end  ♫

26
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,630
♫  Even if I'm out of breath  ♫

27
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,250
Sir, where is the Civil Service Office?

28
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,910
I think it's that way inside.

29
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,760
Thank you.

30
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,740
♫  You can't bring me down  ♫

31
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,820

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,060

33
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,700
- Newbie? 
 - Yes.

34
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,410
I've been appointed to the Civil Service Office starting today.

35
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,060
- I'm Jin Jung. 
 - Welcome.

36
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,720
I'm Park Jae Kyung.

37
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,470
Oh, hi.

38
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,360
So, what do we do here?

39
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,470
It says right there. Civil Service Office.

40
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,950
I did see that, but... I had no idea such an office was here.

41
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,710
- What class are you in? 
 - Pardon?

42
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,200
What class year are you from? The Judicial Institute.

43
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,550
I went to Law School.

44
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,300
What did the newbie fresh off the boat do so wrong?

45
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,380
This place is much older than your length of experience. So be respectful.

46
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,400
So, where are the others?

47
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,280
- There's no one. They all quit. 
 - Pardon?

48
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,740
Let's talk details later.

49
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,400
Since you're here, you should start working.

50
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,940
Work.

51
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,850

52
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,880

53
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,020

54
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,590
Good evening!

55
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,080
Are you running an illegal taxi?

56
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,870
- No, no. 
 - No, right?

57
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,060
It's the eradication campaign.

58
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,250
- What's this about? 
 - I'm from the illegal taxi eradication campaign.

59
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,040
- Geez, we don't do stuff like that. 
 - Right?

60
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,190
Good evening.

61
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,990
This must be your first time on a Call Taxi? 
  (T/N: expensive cab service, used for illegal activities here)

62
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,320
How should I save your name on my phone?

63
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,040
You're a woman of few words.

64
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,900
I'll go straight to the store, okay?

65
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,510
It'll be 30,000 won in cash, please.

66
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,360
It would be nice if you could tip me, too.

67
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,310
Hello, I'm from the illegal taxi eradication campaign.

68
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,510
Damn it, what the hell is this all of a sudden?

69
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,220
Please open the window.

70
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,290
Lady, I'm really sorry, but...

71
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,410
let me ask you a favor.

72
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,940
Lady?

73
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,190
- Come. 
 - What the hell?

74
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,140
Geez!

75
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,930
Hey, hey, hey! Stop right there.

76
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,950
Hey, Call Taxi!

77
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,520
Let's take it easy, okay?

78
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,930
Hey, you can't go anywhere. Come here.

79
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,230
Hey, hey, don't go over it!

80
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,250
I said, don't go over it!

81
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,400
Shit! What the hell!

82
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,760
Hey, hey, hey!

83
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,000
Hey, Chul Ki!

84
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,530
Move!

85
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,120
Move, move, move!

86
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,010
Geez, I'm exhausted.

87
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,470
Geez...

88
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,000
Are you done running?

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,540
Come over here now.

90
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,540
Who the hell are you guys? Are you cops?

91
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,110
No. A prosecutor.

92
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,020
A prosecutor?

93
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,620
How dare you lie to my face?

94
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,150
Why would a prosecutor come out to crack down looking like that?

95
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,370
That's what I mean.

96
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't even know why I'm doing this myself.

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,450
Anyway, you've been caught. Come over here.

98
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,010
No.

99
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,740
Hey, hey, hey! Don't do that.

100
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,790
Not just anyone that can jump across the buildings.

101
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,870
You're going to be unlucky and die if you jump from there.

102
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,090
Come down. Come.

103
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,780
Come over here.

104
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,220
- Geez, finally. 
 - That's what you think!

105
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

106
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,080
Geez!

107
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,120
He jumped across?

108
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,140
Geez, you scared me!

109
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,500
Hey, are you okay?

110
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,800
- Call 911... 
 - I told you not to jump!

111
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,290
Call 911!

112
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,210
What the hell are you doing going around like that?

113
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,950
I sent you out to perform civil service. Why would you break a man's leg? Are you a thug?

114
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,990
And why is this guy here? Who the hell is he?

115
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,510
I'm Investigator Lee Chul Ki. I volunteered to be transferred here.

116
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,060
I'm Investigator Lee Chul Ki. I volunteered to be transferred here.

117
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,070
Damn it...

118
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,340
You've got such a marvelous minion, Prosecutor.

119
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,910
If you want to keep this up, just quit. No one will stop you.

120
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,060
Are you protesting right now?

121
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,740
"I'm a prosecutor. I can't do this crap." Something like that?

122
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,880
- Yes, that's right. I'm protesting. 
 - What?

123
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,000
Shall I be honest? I wonder what I'm doing here.

124
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,360
The things I have taken care of so far are...

125
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,870
 background investigation on an extramarital affair,

126
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,350

looking for a dog that ran away,

127
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,990
What the hell?

128
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,860
Come now. You should go home.

129
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,000
Please take care of him. Thank you.

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,500
 calling taxis for people,

131
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,450
 and trying to catch a runaway dog again.

132
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,750
These are all the things I've done.

133
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,020
The things that the neighborhood police stations don't even do.

134
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,010
And why do police stations file civil complaints with us?

135
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,250
And why are we taking care of those complaints?

136
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,350
- Like that Call Taxi? 
 - Yes, like that Call Taxi.

137
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,110
Why else?

138
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,990
This is where we do stuff like that.

139
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,030
I'm not trying to torment you, Prosecutor.

140
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,250
This is where we take care of complaints like that.

141
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,220
Until you're 63. Until you retire. All that time.

142
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,220
Do you know the real name of this place?

143
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,940
Waste disposal facility.

144
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,680
So someone like you, who doesn't listen, will quit of your own volition.

145
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,500
Since they don't really want to say it to your face.

146
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,760
What if I don't resign?

147
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,810
Then you just keep doing this. Continuing this.

148
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,210
Here are the complaints.

149
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,530

150
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,820

Another dog?

151
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,460
Another dog... Gosh...

152
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,540
The Call Taxi guy... he's going to sue you.

153
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,220
It'll cause a headache for a lot of people.

154
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,600
- Go to the Call Taxi guy and apologize. 
 - What?

155
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,650
Resign if you don't want to do that.

156
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,550
Hurry up and go. Go!

157
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,630
Go, go, go!

158
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,830
Is there anything else you found out about the victim, Park Ye Young?

159
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,520
There's nothing substantial so far.

160
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,900
I looked into all of her surroundings, including around the scene, but...

161
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,410
There's nothing, huh?

162
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,910
As if somebody deleted them intentionally?

163
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,400
Is Kim Hyo Jun still refusing visitors?

164
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,580
I do keep contacting him, but...

165
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,520
By the way, Prosecutor...

166
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,160
Yes?

167
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,580
Could I ask you one thing?

168
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,250
What?

169
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,220
The people sitting in the back...

170
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,440
That's just how desperate I am.

171
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,880
The case is not getting solved, and I'm living like this.

172
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,580
I should at least pray to the folks.

173
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,770
Today is Buddha.

174
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,170
Come on and pray for them to give us something, too.

175
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,030
Buddha, I'll be in your care.

176
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,260

177
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,700
What now?

178
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,170
Gosh, I'm in the middle of a meal.

179
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,670
If you have something to say, spill it and leave.

180
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,370
Looking at your state, it's not that bad.

181
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,920
That's for the doctor to decide.

182
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,680
I'll be sending the medical report with the complaint soon,

183
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,730
so check them out.

184
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,890
I'm sorry about...

185
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,730
- w-what happened— 
 - Just give me the phone there.

186
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,320
Over there.

187
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,460
Next to you.

188
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,810

What is it? 
  (T/N: Oppa is how a girl calls an older brother or older guy friend)

189
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,040
I said to give it to me.

190
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,850

191
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,000

192
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let me see it for a second.

193
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,850

194
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,840

195
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,850
What are you doing?

196
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:50,810
I said to give it to me.

197
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,390
Gosh...

198
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,840
What the heck?

199
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,610
Hey, Chul Ki, go and be on the lookout.

200
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,600

Wait, w-what lookout at a hospital...

201
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,200
I'm going to fall...

202
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,100
So you're saying that Park Ye Young worked at an entertainment establishment?

203
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,060
Y-Yes, that's right.

204
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,130
I'm just a delivery, no...

205
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,790
driver there and...

206
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,720
I really don't know anything else.

207
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,020
Who's the Mister in the text message?

208
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,710
Just a regular customer for Ye Young!

209
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,210
She said that there's a person who gives her an allowance and buys her food.

210
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,960
Who's the one that managed Park Ye Young?

211
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,050
- Sorry? 
 - You said she worked at an establishment.

212
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,870
There must be an establishment owner.

213
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,160
Who's the guy who introduced Park Ye Young to Mister?

214
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,020
Well... I don't...

215
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,620
know up to that part in detail...

216
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,920
Oops!

217
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,230
Careful, careful!

218
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,470
You need to say it, this one will really let go.

219
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,290
I'll say it!

220
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,480
Yoo Jin Chul...

221
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,460
Who?

222
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,410
It's Yoo Jin Chul, I said!

223
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,040
He's the CEO of the establishment.

224
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,880
Hurry and pull me up!

225
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,470
Yoo Jin Chul?

226
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,640

227
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,440
How's Prosecutor Jin doing?

228
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,490
He's living diligently, doing all the chores of the world.

229
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,880
I think it's better off that way for him.

230
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,600
That reckless punk... he needs to have some sense smacked into him.

231
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,000
The name's Yoo Jin Chul.

232
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,790
He's a guy who runs an entertainment establishment in Gangnam.

233
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,740
There's info that he sponsors higher-ups in finance and politics.

234
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:54,440
Above all, I think he's connected to Chief Lee Jang Won.

235
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,260
The Chief?

236
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,320
It's not a light matter.

237
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,620
You go and dig into it.

238
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,480
Okay, I understand.

239
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,270

240
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,900
The Call Taxi guy was right.

241
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,900
This is the guy.

242
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,120
He's the one who managed Park Ye Young?

243
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,060
I'll prepare for the operation.

244
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,410
We're working overtime today.

245
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,010
There's barely any time to operate, let alone prepare.

246
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,710
It's oddly realistic.

247
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,330
Let's call the men out, Chul Ki.

248
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,480
We need to pay back for being dirtied with shit.

249
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,700
How would you like it done?

250
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,800
Stay aside for a moment.

251
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,060
Move, move.

252
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,370
Miss, this is seriously a bit too harsh, yeah?

253
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,470
It ain't like this field be like a toilet where you go in 'n out.

254
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,020
Big Boss is lookin' for you, so cut yo' hair later and...

255
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,080
Miss, seriousl—

256
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,500
Beautifully.

257
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,080
Okay...

258
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,360

259
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,380
Yes, Prosecutor Jin.

260
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,550

You'll bore a hole in the paper.

261
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,690
Stop mulling things over and let's talk about it now. This...

262
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,700
What are you going to do about this?

263
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,750
Should I just send it to Death-patch via fax right now?

264
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,690
This girl right here.

265
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,310
If they were hugging and slurping,

266
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,920
when they were like, "I don't know about dating. It's scary."

267
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,940
- H-How much would you like? 
 - Come on.

268
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,010
That's something that you need to suggest first, CEO.

269
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,330
Up to how much did you consider?

270
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,080
Come out.

271
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,070
Why did you come out here?

272
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,720
Couple application.

273
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,300
Prosecutor Jin told me to keep a watch on you.

274
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,220
Come out, Prosecutor Jin is calling.

275
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,970
- Who is... 
 - Don't worry about her.

276
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,000
Mister, just...

277
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,140
Is it money or your livelihood?

278
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,070
- Hurry up and choose one of the— 
 - Mr. Joong Do.

279
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,780
♪ I respect your choice ♪

280
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,060
♪ But I reject your rejection ♪

281
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,020
♪ There is only one answer ♪

282
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,050
♪ The choice is up to you ♪

283
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,680
Thank you for your work this late at night.

284
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,340
The Madam here said she left something in CEO Yoo Jin Chul's office.

285
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,780
Could you open the door for us, please?

286
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,360
I'm sorry, but who might you be?

287
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,100
Viola Park.

288
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,520
She runs the Apgujeong Cheongdam Gallery.

289
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,930
What's your relationship with the CEO?

290
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,060
It's private.

291
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,130
I mean, do you need more explanation?

292
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,170
But why do you... keep answering, not her?

293
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,470
I'll make one confirmation call.

294
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,000
Oppa's with his wife right now.

295
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,360
He would be very uncomfortable if you called him right now.

296
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,560
I still need to confirm, though.

297
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,950
It'll take only a minute.

298
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,230
One moment, please.

299
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,450

300
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,760
This is CEO Yoo Jin Chul's phone.

301
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,740
May I ask who's the one answering?

302
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,840
I'm the new secretary and you?

303
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,340
 I see. This is the security.

304
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,570
It's nothing much, but the CEO's guests are here.

305
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:28,130
I called to confirm because the gallery Madam came to get one of her things she forgot.

306
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,000
CEO?

307
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,330
He said to let them in.

308
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,450
You stay here, Driver Kim.

309
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,130
What do you mean Driver Kim? We took the cab here.

310
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,050
Driver Kim is on standby here.

311
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,830
Thank you.

312
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,170
I'll help you find it.

313
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,250
It's okay.

314
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,850
It would be faster for two people to look instead of one.

315
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,190
Will you be able to take responsibility?

316
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,740
Sorry?

317
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,530
From here on,

318
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,370
it's a secret space between Oppa and me.

319
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,730
Be my guest if you're confident enough to bet your neck.

320
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,520
Please take care.

321
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,440

322
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,670

323
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,020

Password?

324
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,400
Should I kill him?

325
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,840
Z...

326
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,760
Where's my phone?

327
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,730
W-What?

328
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,080
What's this?

329
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,060
P...

330
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,030
Shit...

331
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,950

332
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,210
 Look for anything related to a woman named Park Ye Young.

333
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,380
 Pictures, videos, and whatnot.

334
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,010
I have no idea.

335
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:19,370

336
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,870
What brings you here today?

337
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,710
Oppa Jin Chul is inside, right?

338
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,250
He doesn't freaking answer his phone...

339
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,990
He's not here at the moment,

340
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,760
so I'll take your message for him.

341
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,570
May I have your name, please?

342
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,250
Viola Park.

343
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,080
Sorry?

344
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,910
I'm already annoyed, and this guy...

345
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,760
Viola Park is my name.

346
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,810
- Park Viola in Korean way. 
 - I see...

347
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,330
Ms. Park Viola?

348
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,160
There was another Viola Park, huh?

349
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,490
Whoa...

350
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,850
Are they different people with the same name?

351
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,950
Hey, you fraud!

352
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,660
Stop right there!

353
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,140
Stop!

354
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,460

355
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,380
Hello?

356
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,930
What's the matter out there?

357
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,660
I was about to cross the Styx River...

358
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,260
there was another Viola Park...

359
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,920
different person with the same name, gosh...

360
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,890
 You're speaking Korean, right?

361
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,300
I'm saying I was almost caught!

362
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,340
 I almost died, shit!

363
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,050
- What about me? 
  - What?

364
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,200
Hey... you...

365
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,140
didn't come out with me?

366
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,250
You didn't!

367
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,010

368
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,040
Don't move.

369
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,270
Viola Park?

370
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,930
- Viola? 
 - Hey, take cover!

371
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:12,000

372
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,350
Let's go.

373
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,100
Yes.

374
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,800
 Prosecutor Shin Ah Ra is proceeding with search and seizure of Yoo Jin Chul.

375
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,900
I understood.

376
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,440
What's all this?

377
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,770
Whoa... this is... not going to work at all.

378
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,460
Viola Park... gosh...

379
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,430
- You've arrived? 
 - Eun Ji.

380
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,970
Joong Do.

381
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,650
Long time no see.

382
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,760
You didn't hit up another trouble, did you?

383
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,420
What's the matter with you?

384
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,790
I want to hit your face, seriously.

385
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,430
Hit my face?

386
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,720
I said it in my heart...

387
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,670
I can hear it all, though.

388
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,110
Hit it, then.

389
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,490
Come on, hit it.

390
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,020
Prosecutor, I think we found it.

391
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,770

392
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,010

Open it up.

393
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,690

394
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,750

395
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,920
August 12?

396
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,990

The date of Park Ye Young's death?

397
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,880
This was the reason why... Chief Lee Jang Won tried to wrap up the case in a hurry.

398
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,470
 Who do you think you are to be clouding the water here?

399
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,220
 Is it because of your Prosecutor General appointment?

400
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,800
 From this moment, you two get your hands off of this case.

401
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,710
 I told you not to contact me.

402
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:40,990
Recently, the prosecution seems to be paying me a lot of attention.

403
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,610
I think I'll need you to cover for me a bit.

404
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,770
You're quite shameless for a beggar.

405
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,250
There's no reason for me not to be shameless.

406
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,400
You know it, right?

407
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:59,070
What will happen to you... if I open my zipper.

408
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,330
You're soon to take office as the Prosecutor General, right?

409
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,080
If you don't want to see me at the ceremony,

410
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,220
please make a move, Mr. Next Prosecutor General.

411
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,060
Find Yoo Jin Chul right now.

412
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,890
Where's the USB?

413
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,540
Let go.

414
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,300
Come on.

415
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,720
It's all in here, right?

416
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,420
Of course.

417
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,960

418
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,040

419
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,870

Gosh, I finally get rid of this slavery contract.

420
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,100
What am I, a slave?

421
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,920
Is this the Joseon era?

422
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,240
How many indictments do we have left?

423
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,220
We have 23 left.

424
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,910
Twenty three?

425
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,050
- There's a lot left. 
 - Trash.

426
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,400
Hey.

427
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,640
What about Yoo Jin Chul?

428
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,380
I tied up his legs.

429
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,830
Okay.

430
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,470
Shit!

431
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,540
Who the hell did this?

432
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,600
What the hell?

433
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,230
Who did this terrible thing?

434
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,400
Is it you?

435
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,820
Get in. I'll bring you to a good place.

436
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,060
Where is this place?

437
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,370

It says it there... Civil Service Division.

438
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,390
Something like that.

439
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:50,020
Now. Although you're older than me, Mr. Yoo Jin Chul,

440
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,280
I don't treat a bad guy as a human being.

441
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,840
Please understand if I skip the honorifics.

442
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,920
I looked at your history a bit.

443
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,590
Drug trafficking,

444
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,270
money laundering,

445
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,120
prostitution,

446
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,550
tax evasion...

447
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,360
you've been working hard.

448
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,410
Good job, Yoo Jin Chul, buddy.

449
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,740
Where did you get this?

450
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,700
I hope that you didn't ask me thinking that I would answer that.

451
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,160
It's not the time for you to be asking me that stuff.

452
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,520
With all this combined, it's at least ten years of prison for you.

453
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,270
It's 2022 this year, so...

454
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,630
even if you go in as soon as possible, it'll be 2032.

455
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,700
Whoa, cars would be flying around by then...

456
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,770
with androids walking around.

457
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,040
What do you want?

458
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,640
Now we're talking.

459
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,620
Seocho-dong murder case. Chief Lee Jang Won.

460
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,540
The last person to meet the victim on the day of the crime.

461
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,660
The most suspected culprit right now, who most likely

462
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,500
had killed Park Ye Young.

463
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,340
But investigating the current Chief of the Central District Prosecutors' Office is...

464
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,690
not going to work with just a picture like this.

465
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,550
An explosive cause is needed, is what I mean.

466
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:11,770
Such as the testimony of the person who took the picture at the time?

467
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,270
Write it down. The relationship between Lee Jang Won and Park Ye Young...

468
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,770
and the things you saw and heard at the time of the crime.

469
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,860
You grab a taxi and an opportunity when it's here, Yoo Jin Chul.

470
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,950
What's there to measure out here?

471
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,230
You need to survive first, before anything. Isn't that so?

472
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,330
Prosecutor Jin Jung?

473
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,650
It's a search and seizure warrant

474
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,050

475
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,380
What are the allegations?

476
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,220
Special assault and battery.

477
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,260
CEO Kim Hyeong Gyun of Rich Fund... has sued you, Prosecutor.

478
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,730
 Listen to what I say.

479
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,570
Start.

480
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,320
Who said you could start?

481
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,670
These bastards, how dare you barge in here in the middle of the night?

482
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,820
Don't you know that this is my territory?

483
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,880
What starts in the Civil Service Division ends in the Civil Service Division.

484
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,040
It's the Prosecutors' Office Rule that was established upon the creation of this place.

485
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,450
Same thing for people.

486
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,940
Whatever they did wrong, they're my kids as long as they're here, and

487
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,120
Whatever they did wrong, they're my kids as long as they're here, and

488
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,230
I don't hand my kids over to other people.

489
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,020
Get lost.

490
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,690
- Director... 
 - I always trusted you.

491
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,430
Okay.

492
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,500
They said that there's no such office rule.

493
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,060
Is that so?

494
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,380
Then that's too bad.

495
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,370
W-What do you mean, "too bad"?

496
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,880
Start.

497
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,480
Come with us.

498
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,300
Yes, you were quite violent.

499
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,180
Move aside so I can go.

500
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,900
Now...

501
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,570
Yoo Jin Chul.

502
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,200
We'll end up meeting again soon.

503
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,710
Do as you wish.

504
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,670
I'm serious.

505
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,770
I catch them when I say that I will...

506
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:18,150
because I don't pick and choose methods and means.

507
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,870
Let's go.

508
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,140
Send Yoo Jin Chul off to China.

509
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,450
So that neither Kim Tae Ho nor Jin Jung can find him again.

510
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,890
All right.

511
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,210
Kim Tae Ho, you bastard...

512
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,550
You're saying... Prosecutor Jin brought Yoo Jin Chul and

513
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,530
Prosecutor Oh let Yoo Jin Chul go?

514
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:25,050
Also, Prosecutor Oh is following Chief Lee Jang Won's orders.

515
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,560
I think what you said before was right,

516
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,650
that the current Chief Prosecutor is connected to an entertainment establishment CEO.

517
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,740
But why did Prosecutor Jin catch Yoo Jin Chul?

518
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,530
I don't think he was simply after Yoo Jin Chul.

519
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,550
He's also aiming at Chief Lee Jang Won?

520
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:49,140
I think Prosecutor Jin didn't give up on the Seocho-dong murder case yet.

521
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,660
I'll go meet Prosecutor Jin as soon as you're done.

522
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,380
Prosecutor Jin would know more in detai—

523
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,610
You arrogant bastard, how dare you do a targeted investigation without reporting?

524
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,640
Are you the Chief? Are you the Prosecutor General?

525
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,770
Tomorrow is your inaugural ceremony as the Prosecutor General.

526
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,360
I was going to report to you after investigating quietly.

527
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,220
This bastard... running his mouth...

528
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,540
Stop thinking I'm a pushover, you bastard.

529
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,710
The reason why you're looking into Yoo Jin Chul...

530
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,660
do you think I don't know?

531
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,720
Wait and see.

532
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,580
Once I become the Prosecutor General, I'm going to strike you down first.

533
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,360
I shouldn't be showing you these things.

534
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,930
Just pretend that you didn't see it.

535
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,730
I'm sorry, Prosecutor.

536
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:02,350
Prosecutor Oh had ordered not to let anybody in.

537
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:06,150
I guess I'm anybody to you, Investigator Kang?

538
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,670
Let me tell you again nicely.

539
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,610
Move aside.

540
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,260
I'll cut to the chase since it's urgent.

541
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,670
Chief Lee Jang Won... let's get him together.

542
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,670
Promise that you'll help the Deputy Chief and me.

543
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,720
Then I'll release you right away.

544
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,280
Let's just make one thing clear.

545
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,210
Every operation will be carried out as I see fit.

546
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,120
Deal!

547
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,480
Gosh, shit!

548
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,650

549
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,330
- Hello? 
  - Let us leave now.

550
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,870
There's one thing I need to check, though...

551
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,840
but don't make it noticeable.

552
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,710
Crap...

553
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,000
Ouch...

554
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,650
Ouch! Ouch!

555
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,700
What's wrong?

556
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,650
You can't breathe?

557
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,770
Why can't you breathe?

558
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,320
What's wrong?

559
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,670
I think I got better.

560
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,570
You're seriously my lifesaver.

561
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,880
Thank you...

562
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,130
I didn't do anything, though.

563
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,450
It makes sense now.

564
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,530
The reason why you caught Yoo Jin Chul out of nowhere.

565
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:09,470
What's the use of working hard to catch him? They let him go right away like this.

566
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,590
Since Yoo Jin Chul has been exposed,

567
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,760
Chief Lee Jang Won won't stay still, either.

568
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,110
He'll try to cover up the case and attempt to send Yoo Jin Chul overseas.

569
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,740
Don't even expect cooperation from the police.

570
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,240
He's set to become the Prosecutor General tomorrow, so who'd go against him?

571
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,350
Okay, let's make a call first.

572
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,770
A call?

573
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,730
There's no need to stall time. Let's make it quick.

574
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,590
- Hey, Prosecutor Jin. 
  - Hey.

575
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,160
We're on the way. Get him.

576
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,160
- Let's go. 
 - Now?

577
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,270
You got someone to follow him?

578
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,980
- That's an investigation... 
 - You're being stuffy already.

579
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,800
You said you won't object to the way I work.

580
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,070
You and I are too different.

581
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,260
All you need to do is change.

582
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,540
Let's just look forward for now.

583
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:34,138

584
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,500
Geez, seriously...

585
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,588
He already escaped?

586
00:42:10,058 --> 00:42:11,668
Hello?

587
00:42:13,258 --> 00:42:14,488
What?

588
00:42:15,018 --> 00:42:16,318
Yes.

589
00:42:17,658 --> 00:42:20,888
I think he noticed that we're after him.

590
00:42:20,888 --> 00:42:22,428
This was in the microwave.

591
00:42:22,428 --> 00:42:24,118
There was nothing else.

592
00:42:24,118 --> 00:42:26,828
He became so thorough all of a sudden.

593
00:42:26,828 --> 00:42:28,618
It's Oh Do Hwan.

594
00:42:28,618 --> 00:42:31,838
He probably needs someone to take care of stuff before he got out.

595
00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:37,108
 Initiated scanning for the target.

596
00:42:39,178 --> 00:42:40,928
By the way, who are these people?

597
00:42:40,928 --> 00:42:42,668
I'll explain later.

598
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:44,768
- Let's go with plan B. 
 - You have a plan B too?

599
00:42:44,768 --> 00:42:47,638
 The target entered Gyeongin Expressway.

600
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:52,158
 Yoo Jin Chul.

601
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:57,778
 We'll end up seeing each other again.

602
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:59,348
If you were going to track him like that,

603
00:42:59,348 --> 00:43:01,888
why did you send us here?

604
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,458
Gyeongin Expressway is Incheon bound.

605
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:10,228
- If he goes all the way to the end... 
 - Yeonahn Pier!

606
00:43:10,228 --> 00:43:11,958
He's stowing himself away!

607
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:14,858
Investigate the contents on the phone ASAP.

608
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,028
Call me if you find anything.

609
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:18,508
It's all burnt! What will we do with this?

610
00:43:18,508 --> 00:43:21,008
- I'll give you two bills. 
 - Three!

611
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,948
Two is okay.

612
00:43:44,548 --> 00:43:46,808
- Where is it? 
 - This way.

613
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:14,988
- Geez... 
 - What happened?

614
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,978
I can't even see a strand of hair.

615
00:44:16,978 --> 00:44:19,658
This is definitely the right spot.

616
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:26,028
 The target started moving.

617
00:44:28,128 --> 00:44:30,888
- It's that one! 
 - What?

618
00:44:30,888 --> 00:44:33,158
Geez, hold on!

619
00:44:33,158 --> 00:44:34,828
Wait!

620
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:40,478
What?

621
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:43,238
Let me check your vehicle.

622
00:44:43,238 --> 00:44:45,878
What? Is he not here?

623
00:44:55,648 --> 00:44:56,848
What?

624
00:44:56,848 --> 00:44:58,548
Geez...

625
00:45:00,538 --> 00:45:02,118
What?

626
00:45:06,098 --> 00:45:08,958
I mean, seriously...

627
00:45:17,498 --> 00:45:20,858
I'll call you as soon as the Chief is sworn in as the prosecutor general.

628
00:45:20,858 --> 00:45:22,218
Until then, please keep a low profile.

629
00:45:22,218 --> 00:45:25,248
So tell me!

630
00:45:25,248 --> 00:45:28,248
Why do I have to be out of the country?

631
00:45:28,248 --> 00:45:30,588
How am I supposed to trust you?

632
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:35,878
I need to talk to Chief Lee myself.

633
00:45:35,878 --> 00:45:37,498
Turn around.

634
00:45:39,148 --> 00:45:42,028
I said, turn around, you bastard!

635
00:45:45,218 --> 00:45:47,068
You... Geez!

636
00:45:47,068 --> 00:45:50,178
Listen carefully, Mr. Yoo Jin Chul.

637
00:45:50,178 --> 00:45:52,358
This isn't for Chief Lee's benefit.

638
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:54,298
It's for your benefit.

639
00:45:54,298 --> 00:45:58,558
I don't care what kind of relationship you have with Chief Lee. But,

640
00:45:58,558 --> 00:46:00,708
if I turn the car around here,

641
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:03,528
your destination would be...

642
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:06,188
heading to the prison.

643
00:46:07,558 --> 00:46:10,688
Geez! I talked too much.

644
00:46:11,578 --> 00:46:13,438
Let's get going.

645
00:46:21,818 --> 00:46:24,588
We must be missing something.

646
00:46:24,588 --> 00:46:26,018
What could that be?

647
00:46:26,018 --> 00:46:28,908
What if you request assistance?

648
00:46:28,908 --> 00:46:30,638
Like putting him on the wanted list?

649
00:46:30,638 --> 00:46:32,358
You think Chief Lee Jang Won will let that slide?

650
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:35,208
I need a warrant to put him on the wanted list first.

651
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:37,828
Right! The wanted list...

652
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:40,188
What's with you now?

653
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:41,688
There's no way we'll get a warrant for this.

654
00:46:41,688 --> 00:46:42,908
That's what I'm saying!

655
00:46:42,908 --> 00:46:45,818
We can't get a warrant, and he's not even wanted because of that.

656
00:46:45,818 --> 00:46:47,528
Why is he stowing himself away, then?

657
00:46:47,528 --> 00:46:49,488
Yoo Jin Chul has no reason to do that.

658
00:46:49,488 --> 00:46:51,028
Because he's not a suspect.

659
00:46:51,028 --> 00:46:53,408
We're the only ones who know that he's

660
00:46:53,408 --> 00:46:56,108
related to Park Ye Young's murder!

661
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:58,708
If he's not stowing himself away like you said...

662
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:03,508

I don't care if it's a text, a note, or whatever.

663
00:47:03,508 --> 00:47:06,048
Prioritize anything related to the airport.

664
00:47:06,048 --> 00:47:08,148
Hurry up. I'm nervous.

665
00:47:08,148 --> 00:47:10,428
Geez, I'm performing CPR as best as I can.

666
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:12,788
Just give me a moment!

667
00:47:23,018 --> 00:47:24,578
It worked!

668
00:47:24,578 --> 00:47:25,908
Hey!

669
00:47:25,908 --> 00:47:29,008
Anyway... 10 o'clock to Shanghai...

670
00:47:29,008 --> 00:47:31,658

671
00:47:36,928 --> 00:47:39,938
 The flight to Shanghai is about to take off.

672
00:47:42,098 --> 00:47:44,128

673
00:48:06,598 --> 00:48:08,458
Yes, here you go.

674
00:48:13,298 --> 00:48:15,078
- Hello. 
 - Welcome.

675
00:48:15,078 --> 00:48:16,378
Please come this way.

676
00:48:16,378 --> 00:48:19,618
- Hello, the boarding pass, please. 
 - This way, please.

677
00:48:19,618 --> 00:48:22,338
It's in here and to the right.

678
00:48:36,338 --> 00:48:38,198
It's the 10 o'clock flight to Shanghai.

679
00:48:38,198 --> 00:48:41,688
Please check the passenger list and locate Yoo Jin Chul.

680
00:48:41,688 --> 00:48:44,318
 He's a key suspect to a murder case.

681
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:47,068
I mean... No matter what you tell me,

682
00:48:47,068 --> 00:48:50,178
we don't have the right to stop him!

683
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:53,458
It's not like he's on the no-fly list!

684
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:56,278
Sir, I'm Prosecutor Shin Ah Ra of the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

685
00:48:56,278 --> 00:48:59,198
We have a situation. Could you make an exception?

686
00:48:59,198 --> 00:49:01,538
Well, if that's the case,

687
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:04,598
fax me the warrant, at least.

688
00:49:04,598 --> 00:49:06,118
There's no time for that!

689
00:49:06,118 --> 00:49:07,418
 I'm busy. I'll hang up.

690
00:49:07,418 --> 00:49:11,178
Sir... Sir... Hey!

691
00:49:11,178 --> 00:49:14,628

692
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,760

693
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:25,728
Please put the seatbelt on.

694
00:49:25,728 --> 00:49:28,258
Could you please pull up the table?

695
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:31,678

696
00:49:49,588 --> 00:49:52,018

697
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:58,158
Did the 10 o'clock flight to Shanghai take off?

698
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:05,318
Please check the status of flight JZ1852.

699
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:16,318
The plane is apparently heading to the runway.

700
00:50:26,338 --> 00:50:28,238
Let's leave.

701
00:50:29,118 --> 00:50:31,348
It's all over.

702
00:50:31,348 --> 00:50:34,368
How will you stop the plane? It's not like it's a taxi.

703
00:50:35,538 --> 00:50:38,148
The plane left. That's it.

704
00:50:38,148 --> 00:50:39,878
Let's go.

705
00:50:41,278 --> 00:50:43,568
There's still a way.

706
00:50:46,248 --> 00:50:48,568
Let's just try something crazy.

707
00:50:53,628 --> 00:50:57,398

708
00:50:57,398 --> 00:50:59,178
Yes, this is the information desk.

709
00:50:59,178 --> 00:51:01,118
How can I help you?

710
00:51:01,118 --> 00:51:03,598
I installed a bomb.

711
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:05,008
Pardon?

712
00:51:05,008 --> 00:51:07,228
Could you say that again?

713
00:51:07,228 --> 00:51:10,508
The 10 o'clock flight to Shanghai that just left...

714
00:51:10,508 --> 00:51:12,958
There's a bomb in there.

715
00:51:13,788 --> 00:51:15,908
Stop the plane right now.

716
00:51:15,908 --> 00:51:19,788
Otherwise, the airport will be covered in blood.

717
00:51:19,788 --> 00:51:20,878
Hello?

718
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,738
Hello?

719
00:51:22,738 --> 00:51:25,068
Call the security office.

720
00:51:25,068 --> 00:51:26,698
Hey!

721
00:51:26,698 --> 00:51:28,358
What the hell are you doing?

722
00:51:28,358 --> 00:51:29,398
Don't ask me.

723
00:51:29,398 --> 00:51:32,038
I don't know, either. Let's go.

724
00:51:35,628 --> 00:51:37,738
- Hey! 
 - Let's go!

725
00:51:37,738 --> 00:51:40,048
Hey, stop JZ1852 immediately!

726
00:51:40,048 --> 00:51:41,568
 We have an announcement.

727
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:46,688
 The flight JZ1852 is on its way back to the airport for security reasons.

728
00:51:46,688 --> 00:51:52,168
 In the meantime, please follow the flight attendants' directions and remain seated.

729
00:51:53,608 --> 00:51:57,368
 We have an announcement.

730
00:51:57,368 --> 00:51:59,718

For for safety reasons, all flights will be delayed.

731
00:51:59,718 --> 00:52:03,608

As soon as the problem is solved,

732
00:52:07,058 --> 00:52:09,048
 - I don't know what's going on. 
 - we'll help you to board your flight.

733
00:52:10,038 --> 00:52:12,928

734
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,410
 We have an announcement.

735
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:22,770
 For for safety reasons, all flights will be delayed.

736
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:27,330
 As soon as the problem is solved,

737
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:29,470
 we'll help you to board your flight.

738
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:32,548
 What's going on?

739
00:52:39,888 --> 00:52:41,258
How long do we have to wait?

740
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:42,508
What's the reason?

741
00:52:42,508 --> 00:52:44,208
Hold on, please.

742
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:45,168
What happened?

743
00:52:45,168 --> 00:52:47,048
I'm so sorry.

744
00:52:52,778 --> 00:52:54,568
 What's this?

745
00:52:55,758 --> 00:52:57,578
Let's go.

746
00:53:02,988 --> 00:53:06,608

747
00:53:06,608 --> 00:53:09,518
We'll do a quick search inside the plane.

748
00:53:09,518 --> 00:53:13,718
Please, calmly evacuate the plane.

749
00:53:13,718 --> 00:53:15,658
Let's evacuate.

750
00:53:15,658 --> 00:53:17,928
 What are you doing?

751
00:53:34,738 --> 00:53:37,808

752
00:53:37,808 --> 00:53:40,138
 What if there really is a bomb?

753
00:53:40,138 --> 00:53:41,938
 What should we do?

754
00:53:41,938 --> 00:53:44,018
 Seriously...

755
00:53:45,768 --> 00:53:47,378
So...

756
00:53:47,378 --> 00:53:49,598
They're coming out through here, right?

757
00:53:49,598 --> 00:53:51,048
I mean, the passenger on the flight.

758
00:53:51,048 --> 00:53:53,918
Yes, because they need time to search for the bomb.

759
00:53:57,408 --> 00:53:59,618
Look at your face! Geez...

760
00:53:59,618 --> 00:54:03,138
You completely forgot what you've done.

761
00:54:04,138 --> 00:54:06,708
He must have a plan.

762
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:09,968
Probably.

763
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:13,328
I really hope so.

764
00:54:13,328 --> 00:54:17,238
Otherwise, we're all screwed.

765
00:54:36,668 --> 00:54:38,348
There he is, bastard!

766
00:54:38,348 --> 00:54:39,808
Yoo Jin Chul!

767
00:54:39,808 --> 00:54:41,828
That punk...

768
00:54:45,995 --> 00:54:47,008
Move!

769
00:54:47,008 --> 00:54:49,558
Move! Move!

770
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:52,278
Move!

771
00:54:52,278 --> 00:54:53,488
Excuse me!

772
00:54:53,488 --> 00:54:54,668
I'm sorry!

773
00:54:54,668 --> 00:54:56,708
Excuse me!

774
00:54:56,708 --> 00:54:57,918
Excuse me, I'm sorry!

775
00:54:57,918 --> 00:54:59,588
- Excuse me. 
 - Pardon us!

776
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:00,728
Excuse us!

777
00:55:00,728 --> 00:55:02,578
Excuse us.

778
00:55:19,718 --> 00:55:21,668
Yes, Prosecutor Jin.

779
00:55:21,668 --> 00:55:23,698
Yoo Jin Chul disappeared. Look for him.

780
00:55:23,698 --> 00:55:25,818
Yes, got it.

781
00:55:39,648 --> 00:55:41,438
Don't come here!

782
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:03,948
Move!

783
00:56:14,828 --> 00:56:15,858
To the stairs.

784
00:56:15,858 --> 00:56:17,768
Hurry!

785
00:56:19,568 --> 00:56:21,088
Stop!

786
00:56:21,088 --> 00:56:24,760
- What's this now? 
 - Yoo Jin Chul!

787
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,860
Gosh!

788
00:56:29,038 --> 00:56:30,988
Seriously!

789
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:36,368
Don't come here.

790
00:56:36,368 --> 00:56:39,228
Don't come here. Don't come here!

791
00:56:39,228 --> 00:56:41,138
Hey.

792
00:56:41,138 --> 00:56:42,968
There's no point in fighting. It's over!

793
00:56:42,968 --> 00:56:45,258
I'm not kidding. She'll die.

794
00:56:45,258 --> 00:56:46,408
I'll kill her!

795
00:56:46,408 --> 00:56:49,128
- Don't come here! 
 - You're in serious trouble!

796
00:56:49,128 --> 00:56:50,278
Don't come here.

797
00:56:50,278 --> 00:56:52,638
Don't come here!

798
00:56:52,638 --> 00:56:56,058
That fellow is really angry right now.

799
00:57:07,648 --> 00:57:10,048
You don't just want to get arrested, right?

800
00:57:10,048 --> 00:57:12,048
Let's do it just once.

801
00:57:12,048 --> 00:57:14,968
Okay, you punk. You're dead!

802
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:18,458
You bastard!

803
00:57:34,308 --> 00:57:36,918
Come here. Come here!

804
00:58:05,988 --> 00:58:08,408
Last digits 0070.

805
00:58:08,408 --> 00:58:10,768
That's your phone number, right?

806
00:58:11,818 --> 00:58:13,488
Your timing is meticulous.

807
00:58:13,488 --> 00:58:16,478
You're going to have to come with us.

808
00:58:16,478 --> 00:58:17,768
 Why are they taking him?

809
00:58:17,768 --> 00:58:19,420
Hey, go.

810
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,420
No. No.

811
00:58:25,748 --> 00:58:27,598
 Why?

812
00:58:31,828 --> 00:58:34,038
What happened to Yoo Jin Chul?

813
00:58:34,038 --> 00:58:36,568
He disappeared at the scene.

814
00:58:38,608 --> 00:58:39,988
How about Prosecutor Jin?

815
00:58:39,988 --> 00:58:42,788
Open the door.

816
00:58:42,788 --> 00:58:43,928

817
00:58:43,928 --> 00:58:46,048
He's being held in the deportation processing room.

818
00:58:46,048 --> 00:58:47,738
That crazy bastard.

819
00:58:47,738 --> 00:58:50,408
What kind of prosecutor is he?

820
00:58:51,118 --> 00:58:55,158
We'll locate Yoo Jin Chul as soon as possible.

821
00:58:55,818 --> 00:58:57,798
Please do.

822
00:58:58,808 --> 00:59:02,238
Make sure the inauguration ceremony goes smoothly tomorrow.

823
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:03,968
Yes, Sir.

824
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:09,348
Congratulations!

825
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:12,108
Prosecutor General.

826
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:30,598

827
00:59:30,598 --> 00:59:33,888

828
00:59:33,888 --> 00:59:36,628

829
00:59:36,628 --> 00:59:40,078

830
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:47,898

831
00:59:57,598 --> 00:59:59,768

832
00:59:59,768 --> 01:00:05,048
The 63rd prosecutor general of the Central District Prosecutors' Office,

833
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:08,428
Mr. Lee Jang Won will deliver the inauguration speech.

834
01:00:08,428 --> 01:00:10,998
Please give a warm welcome!

835
01:00:19,488 --> 01:00:24,220

836
01:00:33,128 --> 01:00:36,858

837
01:00:36,858 --> 01:00:39,938
My fellow prosecutors, who I respect and think of as family.

838
01:00:39,938 --> 01:00:41,588
Today,

839
01:00:41,588 --> 01:00:46,888
I become the prosecutor general at Central District Prosecutors' Office, where justice is protected.

840
01:00:46,888 --> 01:00:50,138
I promise my family members here.

841
01:00:50,138 --> 01:00:52,468
From now on, the Prosector's Office...

842
01:00:56,308 --> 01:01:00,698
From now on, the Prosector's Office will be trusted by the people of the country.

843
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:04,278
We won't obey the power, and we'll draw the sword to fight the power.

844
01:01:04,278 --> 01:01:07,588
I promise you that we'll be honest and upright,

845
01:01:07,588 --> 01:01:09,808
from now on...

846
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:12,758
 What's going on?

847
01:01:20,758 --> 01:01:23,158
I'm so achy because I was hiding down here.

848
01:01:23,158 --> 01:01:25,528
Just stay there.

849
01:01:25,528 --> 01:01:28,388
T-That...

850
01:01:28,388 --> 01:01:29,448
Yes.

851
01:01:29,448 --> 01:01:32,578
Hello, reporters and prosecutors.

852
01:01:32,578 --> 01:01:34,398
I'm Jin Jung.

853
01:01:34,398 --> 01:01:35,818
Well...

854
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:38,018
The reason why I'm up here is

855
01:01:38,018 --> 01:01:45,668
to tell you that the Prosecutors' Office is way more corrupt than you think.

856
01:01:50,388 --> 01:01:53,908
They destroyed evidence that proved someone's innocence and manipulated a case.

857
01:01:53,908 --> 01:01:56,768
And they closed the case the way they liked.

858
01:01:57,508 --> 01:02:00,158
It wasn't done by anyone else.

859
01:02:01,428 --> 01:02:03,148
But it was

860
01:02:03,148 --> 01:02:08,708
done by the best legal office in the country, the prosecution.

861
01:02:10,718 --> 01:02:13,148
Take a good look, everyone.

862
01:02:19,828 --> 01:02:22,208
What the hell are you doing right now?

863
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:25,958
I'll let you know what I'm doing.

864
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:27,338
Lee Jang Won,

865
01:02:27,338 --> 01:02:31,838
you're under arrest as the key suspect in Seocho-dong Murder case.

866
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:33,618
What?

867
01:02:33,618 --> 01:02:34,658
 Bring it here!

868
01:02:34,658 --> 01:02:36,678
 What's this nonsense?

869
01:02:36,678 --> 01:02:39,368
 Seriously!

870
01:02:39,368 --> 01:02:40,978
Congratulations.

871
01:02:40,978 --> 01:02:43,198
You're done now.

872
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:57,560
