1
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:40,341

2
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:43,309

3
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,091
I'll be going, then.

4
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:46,815
It's really a promise, okay?

5
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:48,619
Don't try to do anything alone.

6
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:50,268
Okay, okay.

7
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:52,051
You're taking the MP3, too.

8
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,601
What can I do?

9
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:56,641
Hurry up and go. Your mom must be waiting.

10
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:58,428
Hey, Prosecutor Jin.

11
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:02,068
We've got tons of work to do starting tomorrow. Don't be late.

12
00:01:02,068 --> 00:01:03,738
Don't be late yourself.

13
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:07,438
It looks like Son Heung Min has a game tonight.

14
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:09,658
I'll only watch the first half.

15
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:11,895
Call me if he makes a goal.

16
00:01:11,895 --> 00:01:13,775
I'm going.

17
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:22,790

18
00:01:40,698 --> 00:01:42,668
Yes, CEO Seo?

19
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:47,838
The item you were looking for... I have it.

20
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:49,978
Come and get it.

21
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:13,480

22
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:04,738
You said you saw what's inside?

23
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:06,928
The Reporter Jin's thing?

24
00:03:09,048 --> 00:03:10,958
What do we do, CEO Seo?

25
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,788
It looks like you're doomed.

26
00:03:13,788 --> 00:03:16,328
What do you want from me?

27
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:22,228
My family.

28
00:03:22,228 --> 00:03:25,808
My son, Joon Soo, and my wife.

29
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:27,878
Give them back to me.

30
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:32,938
If you do that, I'll forgive you.

31
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:35,038
Prosecutor Park...

32
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,538
I'm really sorry about that—

33
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:41,288
I said the same thing before.

34
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:44,788
I said I was wrong...

35
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,878
That I'll never do it again...

36
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:50,318
and I won't even look at your face.

37
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:56,328
I was begging for the lives of my family.

38
00:03:57,118 --> 00:03:58,828
However...

39
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,818
what did you do back then, CEO Seo?

40
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,518
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Park.

41
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:20,888
What are you doing?

42
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:25,818
I know it's shameless of me to say this, but please spare me.

43
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:28,208
I was really wrong.

44
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:54,768
Write it.

45
00:04:55,561 --> 00:05:02,948
Write that you'll never show yourself in front of Prosecutor Jin and his friends.

46
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,768
If I write this, will you give me the item?

47
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:11,097
Should I call the reporters?

48
00:05:12,198 --> 00:05:13,978
Sorry.

49
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:16,508
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,898
Prosecutor Park, before this...

51
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:49,768
please give me a cup of water.

52
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,748
Don't try anything funny.

53
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:54,138
 Attorney Oh!

54
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:57,778
 I know you're there.

55
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,008
I'm going to speak comfortably to you now, Attorney Oh.

56
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:06,628
I'll give you an opportunity...

57
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:13,568
for our dear Attorney Oh to become one of my people.

58
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:21,118

59
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:50,428
Why did you cover him?

60
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:53,988
Let's go to the hospital.

61
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:57,048
He's still alive. I know it, so...

62
00:08:57,048 --> 00:08:59,268
take this off, and let's go to the hospital.

63
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:00,838
Mister...

64
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:03,538
open up your eyes. Please?

65
00:09:03,538 --> 00:09:06,358
Stop acting weak, and get up!

66
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,608
Stop kidding me, and get up.

67
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:13,198
Stop kidding me, and get up!

68
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:14,528
Mister!

69
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:18,168
Who said he's dead? Why would he be dead?

70
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:20,398
Mister, Mister!

71
00:09:20,398 --> 00:09:22,218
He's still alive!

72
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:24,938
He's still alive, bastards!

73
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:26,178
Mister!

74
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:28,068
Mister!

75
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,198
Mister...

76
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,580
 Mister!

77
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:42,108

78
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:48,120

79
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,060

80
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,598
I borrowed mourning clothes from the company.

81
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:07,778
- Thank you. 
 - And this... 
  (T/N: Armband worn by the oldest family member of the deceased)

82
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:19,788
The Director

83
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:25,650
♫  What are you to me?  ♫

84
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:31,288
♫  What exactly is this feeling?  ♫

85
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:34,548
I'll bring the Director's picture from his house.

86
00:10:34,548 --> 00:10:39,950
- I couldn't even get his portrait ready yet— 
 - I'll go.

87
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,190
Let's go together, then.

88
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:54,390
♫  Twinkling lights of the night  ♫

89
00:10:55,268 --> 00:11:05,210
♫  I look to you, who became one of those fleeting stars  ♫

90
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:14,388
♫  Getting far away and getting smaller  ♫

91
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:21,398
♫  Worried that I might not be able to see  ♫

92
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:28,648
♫  I catch my breath and beat my heart  ♫

93
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:32,410
♫  Until tears roll down  ♫

94
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:39,980
♫  You, the word I swallowed, is still bitter  ♫

95
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:52,940
♫  You, the word I swallowed, is still bitter  ♫

96
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,268
 Eat slowly.

97
00:12:11,268 --> 00:12:13,708
 I'm getting indigestion from just watching you.

98
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:21,988
 Look how happy you are. With a hole in your head.

99
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:24,078
 The kimchi tastes good.

100
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:25,778
 - What? 
 - The kimchi tastes good.

101
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,018
 - It tastes good? 
 - Yes.

102
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:28,801
 Is that so?

103
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:30,511
 Eat up, then.

104
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:57,488
 Hey, Prosecutor Jin.

105
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,598
 I'm about to...

106
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:04,398
 go on a walk with Snowball.

107
00:13:04,398 --> 00:13:06,078
 Have you seen my back scratcher?

108
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,888
 It's Coco, I said, not Snowball.

109
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,748
 Why do you keep calling him by a different name?

110
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,678
 Look for it. It must be here somewhere.

111
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:14,078
 There's something here.

112
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:15,031
 Where?

113
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:16,591
 You see it?

114
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:19,588
 Stop scratching yourself so much.

115
00:13:19,588 --> 00:13:22,168
 Where is the back scratcher? It's not here.

116
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,338
 Look for it.

117
00:13:23,338 --> 00:13:25,318
 - It's not here? 
 - No.

118
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:27,218
 It must be somewhere.

119
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,820

120
00:13:37,228 --> 00:13:38,868
Shall we go?

121
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:41,378
One second, please.

122
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:10,298
 I heard you gave me your blood.

123
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:12,988
 It's the same blood.

124
00:14:12,988 --> 00:14:15,968
 You share it and reuse it.

125
00:14:18,318 --> 00:14:20,848
 I'll save you next time.

126
00:14:23,768 --> 00:14:25,678
 I also can't stand to see that happen, either.

127
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:27,648
 Having something terrible happen to you, Ahjussi.

128
00:14:28,808 --> 00:14:30,778
 So let's do this together.

129
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,608
 They say to carry a burden together.

130
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:35,508
 Why are you trying to keep carrying it alone?

131
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,228
 You can only choose between these two options.

132
00:14:38,228 --> 00:14:39,918
 You can do it with me or

133
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:42,368
 leave everything to me.

134
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:45,238
 Also, I'm not going to lose anyone this time.

135
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:47,608
 I'm going to catch him before I do.

136
00:14:58,738 --> 00:15:00,678
Prosecutor Jin...

137
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,948
 Last night, at the Civil Service Division of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office,

138
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:10,228
 Prosecutor Park, the director, was found dead from a blunt weapon.

139
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:11,888
 According to the police officials,

140
00:15:11,888 --> 00:15:14,548
 there was no clue or witness at the scene, and

141
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:17,268
 the external CCTV wasn't working properly.

142
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:20,588
 So the investigation is expected to be difficult.

143
00:15:24,998 --> 00:15:26,648
Hello, it's Oh Do Hwan.

144
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:28,928
Yes, CEO.

145
00:15:33,138 --> 00:15:35,028
Thank you for this.

146
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:39,608
Didn't you get any sleep?

147
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:42,958
Your face doesn't look well...

148
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,948
No, I'm okay.

149
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:55,198
You did well.

150
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,938
You must've been shocked since it was your first time.

151
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:01,208
You wrapped it up nicely.

152
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:08,058
We're now accomplices.

153
00:16:17,218 --> 00:16:20,918

154
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:27,418
 How dare you come here?

155
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,918
Please leave right now.

156
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:48,488
You treat your guests pretty rudely.

157
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:50,598
I came to pay my regards, after all.

158
00:16:50,598 --> 00:16:52,218
Chul Ki...

159
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:54,848
make way for him.

160
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,478
May the deceased rest in peace.

161
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:38,698
Thank you for coming.

162
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:03,188
You don't need to walk me out this far.

163
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:07,648
They say to greet even your enemies at a funeral.

164
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:11,738
I'm done with the greeting, so listen to me clearly.

165
00:18:13,148 --> 00:18:15,838
I know you have the MP3.

166
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,258
Well, I just happened to somehow.

167
00:18:20,178 --> 00:18:22,438
I'll never forgive you.

168
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:26,768
So don't you ever regret or

169
00:18:26,768 --> 00:18:30,018
ask for forgiveness from now on.

170
00:18:30,018 --> 00:18:33,298
Don't get caught by someone else without my permission.

171
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:36,773
Just stay there where you are.

172
00:18:38,145 --> 00:18:41,518
I'll come to you and kill you.

173
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:43,468
I'll be rooting for you.

 The ramen is here.

210
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:01,378
 Is this real gold?

211
00:22:01,378 --> 00:22:02,668
 Made in Dongmyo.

212
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:04,758
 It cost 9,700 won.

213
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:07,158
 It's expensive. Put it down.

214
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,398
 My goodness. You'll learn only after losing your teeth.

215
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:17,848
 Come here and eat.

216
00:22:19,145 --> 00:22:21,028
 Okay, okay.

217
00:22:21,028 --> 00:22:22,568
 Ramen.

218
00:22:22,568 --> 00:22:25,008
 - I'll do it. 
 - No worries.

219
00:22:25,008 --> 00:22:27,478
 You should've done it earlier, then.

220
00:22:54,818 --> 00:22:58,170

221
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,448

222
00:23:09,448 --> 00:23:12,550

223
00:23:57,678 --> 00:24:03,098
Prosecutor Jin seems to have found a clue on the case.

224
00:24:03,098 --> 00:24:05,388
What clue?

225
00:24:10,518 --> 00:24:13,368
This is a subway CCTV footage.

226
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:18,338
It looks like one of the people from the Site Clearance Team is helping Prosecutor Jin.

227
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:23,308
He has a helper that no one knows about?

228
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,008
We have the results from the NFS (National Forensic Service).

229
00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:36,638
The fingerprints from the evidence are confirmed to be Seo Hyeon Gyu's.

230
00:24:36,638 --> 00:24:40,638

231
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:42,988
Seo Hyeon Gyu is the culprit.

232
00:24:42,988 --> 00:24:45,548
Thank you, Senior.

233
00:24:45,548 --> 00:24:47,578
Hey, where are you going?

234
00:24:48,498 --> 00:24:50,688
We need to catch that bastard.

235
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:57,100

236
00:25:16,878 --> 00:25:19,018
You can't come in here. Leave right now.

237
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,278
Where is he?

238
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:24,148
If you keep this up, we'll have to call the police.

239
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,568
- Leave when I'm asking you to— 
 - This punk!

240
00:25:29,868 --> 00:25:32,318
I said, where is Seo Hyeon Gyu?

241
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,838
Spill it.

242
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:38,438
We don't know the CEO's unofficial schedule, either.

243
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:43,018
Only Attorney Seo Ji Han knows.

244
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:51,828
Drink it.

245
00:25:58,628 --> 00:26:00,868
Man, who do we have here?

246
00:26:00,868 --> 00:26:03,078
It's the famous Prosecutor Jin, isn't it?

247
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:05,158
You two ladies leave, please.

248
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:08,878
Leave right now!

249
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:11,368
Sit down.

250
00:26:11,368 --> 00:26:13,438
I'm from the Prosecution.

251
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,778
It's okay, so please leave.

252
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,488
What are you doing right now?

253
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:28,468
Has this jerk gone mad?

254
00:26:28,468 --> 00:26:30,218
Where is he?

255
00:26:31,138 --> 00:26:32,158
What?

256
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:34,088
I won't repeat myself.

257
00:26:34,088 --> 00:26:35,598
Where is your father?

258
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:38,548
Gosh, you had me there.

259
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:39,838
Why?

260
00:26:39,838 --> 00:26:42,908
Are you trying to beg him now, at least?

261
00:26:47,718 --> 00:26:49,238
Spill it.

262
00:26:49,238 --> 00:26:50,858
Where is Seo Hyeon Gyu?

263
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:53,158
Why are you so angry?

264
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:54,298
Is it because of him?

265
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:58,838
I heard that Director guy died or something.

266
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:01,488
His head was beat up like this.

267
00:27:01,488 --> 00:27:03,348
You son of a...!

268
00:27:03,348 --> 00:27:05,608
Should've kept low when you could.

269
00:27:05,608 --> 00:27:08,618
This wouldn't have happened if you had kept yourself low.

270
00:27:08,618 --> 00:27:11,768
 What's going on inside? We'll open the door!

271
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:14,738
Just put a positive spin on it.

272
00:27:14,738 --> 00:27:18,398
He went to see his family. How nice is that?

273
00:27:19,265 --> 00:27:20,688
 Bring the keys.

274
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:23,188
I'll say my condolences, at least.

275
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:30,628
I told you I won't...

276
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:34,338
Hey, stop him!

277
00:27:37,968 --> 00:27:39,808
Let go!

278
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,808
Tell this to your father clearly.

279
00:27:46,808 --> 00:27:49,868
I have the evidence of him committing murder.

280
00:27:55,648 --> 00:27:56,878

281
00:27:56,878 --> 00:27:59,318
Is that so?

282
00:27:59,318 --> 00:28:02,508
Why did Jin Jung do that out of the blue?

283
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:05,108
No, not at all!

284
00:28:05,108 --> 00:28:09,958
How can I meddle in what the disciplinary committee needs to decide?

285
00:28:11,175 --> 00:28:13,378
I just...

286
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:19,228
want to ask that you do a proper job so things like this won't happen again.

287
00:28:19,228 --> 00:28:21,308
Yes, yes.

288
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:26,048

289
00:28:26,048 --> 00:28:32,698
♫  It feels like my blurry vision has become a little more blurred  ♫

290
00:28:32,698 --> 00:28:38,418
♫  After all, the world is always unkind  ♫

291
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:42,768

♫  Now you gotta know, yeah you gotta know  ♫

309
00:29:34,118 --> 00:29:37,868

I get to witness that rare dismissal here.

310
00:29:37,868 --> 00:29:40,568
Goodness, what a great feat, Prosecutor Jin.

311
00:29:40,568 --> 00:29:42,758
You finally did it, huh?

312
00:29:42,758 --> 00:29:44,648
You're worried, right?

313
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:46,658
How can you laugh?

314
00:29:46,658 --> 00:29:50,988
You're laughing when the office is about to close down, and you're to be fired?

315
00:29:50,988 --> 00:29:54,088
How did you end up beating him up there?

316
00:29:54,088 --> 00:29:56,958
I feel better inside, at least.

317
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:59,388
Well, my insides are rotting.

318
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:06,958
What are you going to do now?

319
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:09,108
I need to go see him...

320
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:12,138
The former right-hand man of Seo Hyeon Gyu.

321
00:30:16,488 --> 00:30:18,908
The Director was murdered.

322
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:25,178
I believe Seo Hyeon Gyu is the culprit.

323
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,738
I have relevant evidence, but...

324
00:30:30,738 --> 00:30:33,668
it might be difficult to get him with just that.

325
00:30:35,468 --> 00:30:38,858
I heard only you know something about Seo Hyeon Gyu.

326
00:30:40,665 --> 00:30:43,098
I'd like you to tell me what it is.

327
00:30:43,098 --> 00:30:45,818
You arrogant bastard...

328
00:30:45,818 --> 00:30:47,598
At this point?

329
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:50,598
Jae Kyung told me...

330
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:53,998
that you won't listen to him.

331
00:30:53,998 --> 00:30:58,068
He's scared to death about you becoming like him

332
00:30:59,168 --> 00:31:03,318
but he has a headache because you don't listen to whatever he says.

333
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,921
Had you listened to Jae Kyung, he wouldn't have ended up like that.

334
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:10,671
Do you understand?

335
00:31:11,602 --> 00:31:17,048
Your needless arbitrary actions and pride drove Jae Kyung and Chief Lee Jang Won to death!

336
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:19,998
It's all because of you. You know that!

337
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:24,338
I know.

338
00:31:25,838 --> 00:31:28,278
I was too reckless.

339
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:32,328
So I will not back down even more.

340
00:31:33,588 --> 00:31:35,768
If I give up here...

341
00:31:36,998 --> 00:31:39,698
I'd be making that foolish Ahjussi

342
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:42,768
into a real fool.

343
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:47,198
I can't let it end like this.

344
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:50,128
Even out of spite, I'll take this all the way.

345
00:31:50,128 --> 00:31:51,618
No.

346
00:31:52,908 --> 00:31:54,718
You stop here.

347
00:31:56,878 --> 00:31:59,608
That's the way for you and me to survive.

348
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:04,718
Why do you fear Seo Hyeon Gyu?

349
00:32:08,538 --> 00:32:11,178
I don't fear that man.

350
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:13,718
I'm a prosecutor and...

351
00:32:13,718 --> 00:32:16,288
the only things a prosecutor should fear...

352
00:32:17,658 --> 00:32:20,818
are justice and the people.

353
00:32:24,238 --> 00:32:26,738
A prosecutor's duty is...

354
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:29,298
to catch bad people.

355
00:32:29,298 --> 00:32:33,038
The criminals should fear a prosecutor...

356
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,248
but a prosecutor fearing them?

357
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:39,208
That should never be in this world.

358
00:32:41,598 --> 00:32:43,788
What about you, Prosecutor General?

359
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:47,068
Are you still a prosecutor?

360
00:32:49,978 --> 00:32:52,978

361
00:32:56,478 --> 00:33:00,228
 The reason no one dared to mess with Seo Hyeon Gyu

362
00:33:02,388 --> 00:33:05,628
 is because of the library he has.

363
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:11,208
 Seo Hyeon Gyu doesn't just let his clients get off.

364
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:13,568
 Forget the trial.

365
00:33:13,568 --> 00:33:16,558
 He makes it so that they don't even get investigated.

366
00:33:19,328 --> 00:33:23,798
 That's why so many people in power in this country

367
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:28,124
 went to Seo Hyeon Gyu to bury their sins and their families'

368
00:33:29,153 --> 00:33:31,538
 After burying the truths,

369
00:33:31,538 --> 00:33:34,648
 Seo Hyeon Gyu used the evidence of guilty crimes

370
00:33:34,648 --> 00:33:37,508
 to put a leash on each one of them.

371
00:33:38,818 --> 00:33:41,628
 They caught on later...

372
00:33:42,514 --> 00:33:44,854
 but it was already too late.

373
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:51,958
 That's how Seo Hyeon Gyu became the owner of people in power.

374
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:56,208
 Prosecutor Jin...

375
00:33:56,208 --> 00:34:00,918
 the true owner of this country right now is CEO Seo, not the people.

376
00:34:00,918 --> 00:34:04,378
The library is Seo Hyeon Gyu's weapon and power.

377
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:07,498
Unless you find it and expose it to the world,

378
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:10,168
that man can't be brought down.

379
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:12,798
Do you happen to know where that library is?

380
00:34:14,188 --> 00:34:16,888
He doesn't easily trust others.

381
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,538
But perhaps he might trust his own flesh and blood.

382
00:34:23,926 --> 00:34:28,796

383
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:43,348

384
00:34:46,995 --> 00:34:48,428
Hello?

385
00:34:48,428 --> 00:34:50,538
 This is Seo Hyeon Gyu.

386
00:35:05,925 --> 00:35:10,608
Prosecutor... I heard you found the evidence of the incident.

387
00:35:13,355 --> 00:35:15,618
You must be scared, CEO Seo...

388
00:35:15,618 --> 00:35:18,618
Giving me a chance to meet you alone for one piece of evidence.

389
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:21,638
What do you plan to do?

390
00:35:21,638 --> 00:35:24,888
You're suspended, so you can't even get me.

391
00:35:24,888 --> 00:35:27,478
Well, I'm not the only prosecutor.

392
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:31,448
I like everything about you,

393
00:35:31,448 --> 00:35:34,218
but there's just one thing that's lacking.

394
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:37,968
How should I say this? You're...

395
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:40,548
too good of a person.

396
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:44,394
So you have that much more weaknesses.

397
00:35:51,793 --> 00:35:53,373
Mr. Go Joong Do?

398
00:35:54,675 --> 00:35:56,828
You're Mr. Go Joong Do, right?

399
00:35:56,828 --> 00:35:58,538
No, I'm not.

400
00:35:58,538 --> 00:36:00,068
Hey, Joong Do!

401
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:01,441
Where did he go?

402
00:36:01,441 --> 00:36:03,471
He was just here.

403
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:07,858
You are.

404
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:09,268
We're from the police.

405
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:10,978
Please come with us.

406
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:12,648
Gosh...

407
00:36:14,878 --> 00:36:18,188
Okay, okay. I just moved.

408
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:23,218
Gosh, let go. I'm going.

409
00:36:24,918 --> 00:36:26,688
Ms. Baek Eun Ji?

410
00:36:29,278 --> 00:36:31,808

411
00:36:35,655 --> 00:36:37,608

412
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:40,258

413
00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:48,758
We're from the Inspection Team.

414
00:36:48,758 --> 00:36:50,698
Please come with us.

415
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,800

416
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,688
We're from the Supreme Prosecution's Inspection Team.

417
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,688
Please come with us.

418
00:37:10,068 --> 00:37:12,918
Gosh, this is nuts.

419
00:37:13,895 --> 00:37:16,588
Why don't we reconcile here?

420
00:37:16,588 --> 00:37:20,068
I think it's a win-win for both of us.

421
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:26,168
I'll promise you one thing for sure.

422
00:37:26,168 --> 00:37:28,788
If you refuse to work with me here,

423
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,698
your friends will serve more than 10 years.

424
00:37:34,675 --> 00:37:36,618
Don't say I can't do it.

425
00:37:36,618 --> 00:37:38,888
Because I can do it.

426
00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:43,235
You know who I am, Prosecutor.

427
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:47,878
Save your friends.

428
00:37:49,038 --> 00:37:51,858
I can also reinstate you to the Detective Team if you want.

429
00:37:52,928 --> 00:37:55,498
Or, while you're at it,

430
00:37:55,498 --> 00:37:58,098
you can just become one of my people.

431
00:38:05,798 --> 00:38:07,308
I understand.

432
00:38:09,338 --> 00:38:11,168
Did you think I'd say that?

433
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,118
I'd be disappointed if you said that.

434
00:38:16,118 --> 00:38:20,508
I wouldn't have come this far if I were to surrender to a silly threat like this.

435
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:22,868
Do whatever you want.

436
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:25,518
The sword is in my hand anyway.

437
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,938

438
00:38:40,058 --> 00:38:41,808
One moment, please.

439
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,318
It's me, Sunbae. Are you okay?

440
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:50,288
 How could I be okay?

441
00:38:51,338 --> 00:38:53,348
I'm about to be dismissed from my job.

442
00:38:53,348 --> 00:38:54,918
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

443
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:56,388
 That's true.

444
00:38:56,388 --> 00:38:59,348
I shouldn't have gotten mixed up with you in the first place.

445
00:38:59,348 --> 00:39:01,668
I'll tell you honestly.

446
00:39:01,668 --> 00:39:03,898
You might even end up sitting behind bars.

447
00:39:05,015 --> 00:39:07,408
 Your dream of becoming the Prosecutor General...

448
00:39:07,408 --> 00:39:09,748
 You might have to give it up.

449
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,778
I'm really sorry, but...

450
00:39:11,778 --> 00:39:14,368
I can't let go of CEO Seo here.

451
00:39:14,368 --> 00:39:16,148
I'll catch that man by any means and

452
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:19,258
 - bring out you and the others, so—  
 - Jin Jung.

453
00:39:19,258 --> 00:39:21,498
 Are you going to keep wasting your breath?

454
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:24,158
Hey. It'll only be a streak in my records.

455
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:27,248
Don't worry, and catch him no matter what.

456
00:39:29,985 --> 00:39:31,598
Just endure for a bit.

457
00:39:31,598 --> 00:39:33,508
It won't take long.

458
00:39:38,618 --> 00:39:40,408
Let's go.

459
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:16,528
You awake?

460
00:40:30,758 --> 00:40:32,728
Congrats, Prosecutor Jin.

461
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,568
You'll be meeting your director soon.

462
00:40:37,618 --> 00:40:40,228
I'm going to live until the 22nd century.

463
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,508
This guy's running his mouth to the end.

464
00:40:45,508 --> 00:40:47,828
The 22nd century?

465
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:50,218
Make sure you live until then.

466
00:40:58,438 --> 00:41:00,288
Prosecutor Shin.

467
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:06,818
The inspection team is indeed tough, for sure.

468
00:41:06,818 --> 00:41:08,428
How was it for you, Investigator?

469
00:41:08,428 --> 00:41:11,348
They'll finish the rest of it tomorrow.

470
00:41:11,348 --> 00:41:12,848
What about Joong Do and Eun Ji?

471
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:15,678
I heard they're at a detention center in a police station.

472
00:41:15,678 --> 00:41:19,688
However... I'm worried about one thing.

473
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:24,638
I can't reach Prosecutor Jin.

474
00:41:24,638 --> 00:41:26,518
Prosecutor Jin?

475
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:28,058

476
00:41:28,058 --> 00:41:32,318
Why is this happening to me again?

477
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:35,918
Gosh, my unfortunate life...

478
00:41:35,918 --> 00:41:38,748
Prosecutor Jin should be safe, right?

479
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:40,828
What a devoted wife. How faithful.

480
00:41:40,828 --> 00:41:44,288
Are you Sung Chun Hyang or something? 
  (T/N: Korean traditional story character known for her chastity)

481
00:41:44,288 --> 00:41:46,848
Gosh, seriously.

482
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:52,298
Hey.

483
00:41:52,298 --> 00:41:56,638
What do you like so much about Jin Jung to follow him around?

484
00:41:57,688 --> 00:42:00,848
Did you borrow money from him?

485
00:42:02,725 --> 00:42:03,988
I owe my life to him.

486
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,898
I see.

487
00:42:07,815 --> 00:42:10,448
- When I was held captive by another gang— 
 - Prosecutor Shin!

488
00:42:10,448 --> 00:42:12,358
Prosecutor Shin!

489
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:14,478
Prosecutor Shin! Excuse me.

490
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:15,908
What brings you here?

491
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,058
I'm Prosecutor Shin of Criminal Division 3 at the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

492
00:42:18,058 --> 00:42:20,738
We'll be in charge of those two from now on.

493
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,488
That won't work for us.

494
00:42:22,488 --> 00:42:24,818
What right do you have to take our suspects?

495
00:42:24,818 --> 00:42:28,111
They're core material witnesses for a top-secret investigation.

496
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:29,761
Please open up.

497
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:32,528
Even so, this is a bit...

498
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:35,618
What the hell do you mean, "this is a bit"?

499
00:42:35,618 --> 00:42:40,048
Do you guys... even know what we have to testify to?

500
00:42:40,048 --> 00:42:41,628
This is an obstruction of an investigation.

501
00:42:41,628 --> 00:42:43,438
Open it up right now before I sue you!

502
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:46,928
You can end up jobless while focusing on your performance.

503
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:50,528
Before the problem gets serious, take out your keys.

504
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:52,568
- Prosecutor Jin was kidnapped? 
 - By whom?

505
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:53,948
One of two things is certain.

506
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:56,448
It's either CEO Seo or ordered by CEO Seo.

507
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,218
We have to find Prosecutor Jin's location first.

508
00:42:58,218 --> 00:43:01,158
- The problem is how to find him-—
 - Here.

509
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:03,838
This is a couple's app.

510
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:06,438
- Are you dating Jin Jung? 
 - Not yet.

511
00:43:06,438 --> 00:43:09,398
You have this when you're not even a couple?

512
00:43:09,398 --> 00:43:10,478
You installed it secretly.

513
00:43:10,478 --> 00:43:13,848
From what I know, she also installed it on your phone, Joong Do...

514
00:43:13,848 --> 00:43:15,118
It's a two-timer.

515
00:43:15,118 --> 00:43:17,238
Very nice for now. You did great.

516
00:43:17,238 --> 00:43:19,208
Let's take off right away.

517
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:21,378
I installed it.

518
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:25,318
Hell!

519
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:28,388
This guy is finally looking down.

520
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:30,648
You lasted a long time.

521
00:43:39,688 --> 00:43:42,908
Your face is badly beaten.

522
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:52,458
In addition to the allegations so far,

523
00:43:54,128 --> 00:43:57,178
I'm adding kidnapping and instigated the assault.

524
00:43:58,018 --> 00:44:01,508
You really have no intention of changing your mind?

525
00:44:02,695 --> 00:44:05,268
I think you're too good to get rid of, Prosecutor.

526
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,238
Go f*** yourself.

527
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:12,513
I'm getting curious at this point.

528
00:44:12,513 --> 00:44:16,908
What drove you to this point, Prosecutor Jin?

529
00:44:16,908 --> 00:44:18,668
My family upbringing.

530
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:23,328
There's this saying that my father always used to tell me.

531
00:44:24,848 --> 00:44:27,688
I thought it was old-fashioned back then, but

532
00:44:29,658 --> 00:44:32,508
no other saying is more correct than that.

533
00:44:33,448 --> 00:44:36,358
"Anti-justice cannot beat justice." 
  (T/N:"Jung" means justice in Korean)

534
00:44:38,378 --> 00:44:40,648
Anti-justice cannot beat justice?

535
00:44:45,158 --> 00:44:48,728
Do you consider yourself just, Prosecutor?

536
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:55,548
It's what I realized from my experience in life,

537
00:44:55,548 --> 00:44:58,048
but what's really dangerous...

538
00:44:58,048 --> 00:45:01,618
isn't evil. It's justice.

539
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:05,788
Evil is followed by a sense of guilt but not justice.

540
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:07,708
As long as you're just,

541
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:11,088
you think you can do whatever you want to others.

542
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:13,278
You drive people to the edge and

543
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:16,788
you don't care how much you hurt them.

544
00:45:16,788 --> 00:45:19,628
Because you're just, you're right.

545
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:27,128
Do you know when a person becomes the cruelest?

546
00:45:29,058 --> 00:45:33,228
It's when you believe you're just.

547
00:45:34,448 --> 00:45:36,488
Thinking you're the only righteous person

548
00:45:36,488 --> 00:45:38,878
with a deviated sense of justice

549
00:45:38,878 --> 00:45:41,828
is arrogance, Prosecutor Jin.

550
00:45:43,178 --> 00:45:45,988
You're greatly mistaken, CEO Seo.

551
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,638
I've never thought that I was right. Not even once.

552
00:45:50,638 --> 00:45:54,198
I just can't forgive people like you and

553
00:45:55,078 --> 00:45:58,128
I'm sure about you being wrong.

554
00:46:01,168 --> 00:46:03,598
I'm in a lot of pain right now.

555
00:46:05,928 --> 00:46:08,418
I don't have the energy to talk, so leave.

556
00:46:12,158 --> 00:46:15,018
It was fun while it lasted.

557
00:46:21,388 --> 00:46:24,058
- Wrap it up and contact me. 
 - Okay.

558
00:47:06,188 --> 00:47:08,708
I want to have more fun with you,

559
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:10,658
but I'm kind of busy.

560
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:13,468
Goodbye.

561
00:47:13,468 --> 00:47:15,638
Okay, stop right there!

562
00:47:15,638 --> 00:47:18,408
I'm Prosecutor Shin of Criminal Division 3 at the Central District Prosecutors' Office!

563
00:47:18,408 --> 00:47:21,298
Including Seo Ji Han, everyone here is

564
00:47:21,298 --> 00:47:24,378
under emergency arrest on site for kidnapping and assault—

565
00:47:25,558 --> 00:47:27,328
Jin Jung...

566
00:47:32,055 --> 00:47:34,308
From this moment...

567
00:47:34,308 --> 00:47:38,948
I'll take responsibility for everything that's about to happen here.

568
00:47:41,575 --> 00:47:43,338
Please...

569
00:47:43,338 --> 00:47:45,408
kill 'em all.

570
00:47:46,528 --> 00:47:48,798
What the hell are you doing?

571
00:47:50,088 --> 00:47:52,668
Don't come! Don't come!

572
00:47:52,668 --> 00:47:54,258
Jin Jung...

573
00:48:07,478 --> 00:48:09,478
I said let's talk about this!

574
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,988
Let me go.

575
00:48:14,008 --> 00:48:15,988
I said let's talk about this, didn't I?

576
00:48:15,988 --> 00:48:17,408
Geez...

577
00:48:17,408 --> 00:48:20,138
Come on, beat them up!

578
00:48:20,138 --> 00:48:21,938
Not that guy!

579
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,248
Jin Jung, are you okay?

580
00:48:29,118 --> 00:48:30,708
Hey, pull yourself together.

581
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,518
Where did that bastard go?

582
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,075
- I need to get that jerk. 
 - Hey!

583
00:48:37,075 --> 00:48:38,615
Jin Jung!

584
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:00,098
Jin Jung...

585
00:49:00,098 --> 00:49:01,858
Will you be okay?

586
00:49:42,818 --> 00:49:44,388
Get out.

587
00:49:50,938 --> 00:49:54,028
Wait. One second, Prosecutor Jin.

588
00:49:55,088 --> 00:49:57,028
We're both legal professionals.

589
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:59,998
Calm down and let's use words.

590
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:01,088
Let's talk about this, okay?

591
00:50:01,088 --> 00:50:04,078
Do you know the problem with people who want to talk like you?

592
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:07,458
Words can't get through to them.

593
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:09,998
They can't think about how things got to this point.

594
00:50:14,148 --> 00:50:16,888
What's the medicine for punks like that?

595
00:50:48,968 --> 00:50:50,748
You bastard, where is this?

596
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:53,368
Where the heck do you think? It's the hospital.

597
00:50:54,088 --> 00:50:55,768
You were out cold for a few days.

598
00:50:55,768 --> 00:50:58,168
I guess you were hit pretty good.

599
00:50:59,218 --> 00:51:01,128
- A few days? 
 - Yes.

600
00:51:01,128 --> 00:51:03,218
It hasn't been that long.

601
00:51:03,218 --> 00:51:08,158
Since today's October 26 it's been about a week.

602
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:16,548
Also, your father has been caught.

603
00:51:16,548 --> 00:51:18,618
He's at the detention center right now.

604
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:21,828
 I'd like to express my welcome to the court's decision

605
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:24,818
 to issue an arrest warrant for CEO Seo Hyeon Gyu.

606
00:51:24,818 --> 00:51:25,944
 We, the Prosecution,

607
00:51:25,944 --> 00:51:30,158
 will proceed with the investigations according to the law and the principles.

608
00:51:30,158 --> 00:51:32,318
What are you going to do now...

609
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:34,628
There's one more piece of bad news.

610
00:51:34,628 --> 00:51:36,598
Your father said...

611
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:40,478
you schemed everything that happened so far.

612
00:51:41,308 --> 00:51:43,058
He's quite the man, CEO Seo.

613
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:46,368
He threw his son under the bus to save himself.

614
00:51:47,348 --> 00:51:49,208
Stop joking.

615
00:51:50,008 --> 00:51:51,668
Father would never do that.

616
00:51:51,668 --> 00:51:54,208
Your face says otherwise.

617
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,108
These are secured texts between CEO Seo and Oh Do Hwan.

618
00:52:00,108 --> 00:52:03,748
Take a look. There's a skillful man among us.

619
00:52:10,178 --> 00:52:11,660

620
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:24,388

621
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:27,440
No...

622
00:52:28,438 --> 00:52:30,358
This can't be.

623
00:52:31,845 --> 00:52:34,198
That's what you think.

624
00:52:34,198 --> 00:52:35,708
Let's go if you've come to.

625
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:37,808
You can get up, right?

626
00:52:38,578 --> 00:52:40,198
Wait a second.

627
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,378
One second, Prosecutor Jin.

628
00:52:45,188 --> 00:52:47,178
I really didn't do it.

629
00:52:49,338 --> 00:52:51,348
Park Ye Young was...

630
00:52:53,038 --> 00:52:55,118
Yes...

631
00:52:55,118 --> 00:52:58,178
I killed her. I admit. But...

632
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,378
I didn't do the other stuff.

633
00:53:02,378 --> 00:53:04,738
I really didn't do them.

634
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:09,278
I know as well, but what can we do?

635
00:53:10,658 --> 00:53:15,178
CEO Seo already massaged all the evidence that can back your claim.

636
00:53:17,745 --> 00:53:20,088
I mean, frankly, you're not the one to blame.

637
00:53:20,088 --> 00:53:23,168
It was all ordered by your father, right?

638
00:53:26,348 --> 00:53:28,778
Want me to tell you how to save yourself?

639
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:36,338

640
00:53:38,888 --> 00:53:41,428
What do you want?

641
00:53:41,428 --> 00:53:43,988
The location of your father's library.

642
00:53:45,298 --> 00:53:48,158
I'm not interested in underlings like you.

643
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:50,848
I only want one person.

644
00:53:52,618 --> 00:53:55,078
How can I trust you?

645
00:53:55,818 --> 00:53:58,300
Do you have any other way?

646
00:53:58,918 --> 00:54:01,958
I'm the Savior to you right now, Seo Ji Han.

647
00:54:03,738 --> 00:54:05,568
Write it.

648
00:54:10,478 --> 00:54:12,348
Forget it if you don't want to.

649
00:54:26,518 --> 00:54:30,918

650
00:54:36,908 --> 00:54:39,498
You'll be late for your flight.

651
00:54:39,498 --> 00:54:41,218
Leave.

652
00:54:44,158 --> 00:54:46,068
Take care.

653
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:52,548
Goodbye and stay healthy.

654
00:54:55,818 --> 00:54:57,808
I'll get you for this.

655
00:54:59,578 --> 00:55:01,328
What's this?

656
00:55:02,848 --> 00:55:04,528
What's wrong?

657
00:55:04,528 --> 00:55:08,698
 Since today's October 26 it's been about a week.

658
00:55:08,698 --> 00:55:12,518

659
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:20,198
Hey, look at this.

660
00:55:23,585 --> 00:55:27,758
♫  Dig all the hiding places with the magic of the real sword  ♫

661

You should always observe your surroundings.

Right?

665
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:42,168

Prosecutor Jin, you're the lucky type.

You're not quite lucky, on the other hand, CEO Seo.

 He's an important witness who will expose the truth about the case.
