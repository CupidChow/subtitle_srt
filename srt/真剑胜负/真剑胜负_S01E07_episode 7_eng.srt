1
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:38,065

2
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:53,220

3
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:59,695
 No, no, I didn't! I didn't do that! I didn't even know about such plans, and I—

4
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:05,395
 You're saying you did...

5
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:09,365
 frame Prosecutor Jin, then...

6
00:01:12,185 --> 00:01:16,475
Even if you hear the truth from me, there's nothing you can do.

7
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:19,565
I decide whether I can do it or not.

8
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:22,425
You just answer me, Prosecutor General.

9
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:24,985
I couldn't help it.

10
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:27,175
This is my answer.

11
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,565
Excuse me for one moment.

12
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:00,855
Ta-da.

13
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:03,005
You didn't know about this, did you?

14
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:07,985
 You just answer me, Prosecutor General.

15
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:09,655
 I couldn't help it.

16
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:11,875
 This is my answer.

17
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:17,085
I skip the honorifics to bad guys, Prosecutor General.

18
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:19,305
I don't treat them as human beings, you see.

19
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:22,065
You're done for.

20
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:27,395
With only this as evidence?

21
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:32,135
It's illegal for a third party to record a privet conversation.

22
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:33,705
In other words...

23
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:36,245
this is an evidence of your crime, not mine.

24
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:38,735
Of course, this won't even make it to the court.

25
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:41,235
Not even the press will care about this.

26
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:46,405
The penholders bark about freedom of speech,

27
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:49,995
but they all kneel before those who have power in the end.

28
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:57,135
You can't take me down.

29
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,675
Do you know why?

30
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:03,045
Because there's nothing you can do.

31
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:10,345
I'm impressed with your bravery in coming this far with Prosecutor Shin, so I'll give you one last chance.

32
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:12,385
Just hand over the recorder.

33
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:19,475
Answer it.

34
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:21,345
It must be an urgent call.

35
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:27,895

36
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,935
 I apologize for calling you at this late hour, Prosecutor General.

37
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:35,955
 I think you need to check our internal bulletin board.

38
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:41,425

39
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:45,965
 Even if you hear the truth from me, there's nothing you can do.

40
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:48,925
The full recording will be uploaded in five minutes.

41
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:51,165
Hurry up and ask me what I want.

42
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,855
Enough with your games

43
00:03:52,855 --> 00:03:56,355
I can just say that this is fake.

44
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:58,435
Sure, go ahead, then.

45
00:03:58,435 --> 00:04:01,315
Would people believe that after hearing the whole conversation?

46
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:04,095
It's not like prosecutors are fools.

47
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:10,135
This is how I roll, Prosecutor General.

48
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:14,135
Even if I can't kill them, at least I'll bring them to the brink of death.

49
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:18,085
I, Prosecutor Jin Jung of Central District Prosecutors' Office,

50
00:04:18,085 --> 00:04:20,255
will be cleared from my false public arrest order and

51
00:04:20,255 --> 00:04:22,885
I'll get back to work starting tomorrow.

52
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:36,245

53
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:38,335

54
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:46,035

55
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,195
You came out to greet me?

56
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:30,195
What are you plotting?

57
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:32,765
You guys really lack communication.

58
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,975
I'm too lazy to even explain, so call your master.

59
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:40,985
I know that you and Kim Tae Ho tried to framed me, so call him.

60
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:43,345
Don't you know his number?

61
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,600

62
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:59,355
Prosecutor Jin is in front of me right now.

63
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:05,935
Leave Prosecutor Jin alone.

64
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:09,460
- Wait, but— 
 - Just do what I tell you to do!

65
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,510

66
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:15,385
Is that mine?

67
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:18,405

A warrant for my immediate arrest?

68
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:20,815
As you must know, Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan,

69
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,405
I was beaten up a lot recently.

70
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:29,945
♫  I believe in me  ♫

71
00:06:29,945 --> 00:06:32,835
Get your guard up because now is my turn.

72
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:35,135
♫  No more  ♫

73
00:06:35,135 --> 00:06:39,575
♫  Everyone looks back at me, you know?  ♫

74
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:41,895
♫  I believe in me  ♫

75
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:44,705
♫  In me, yeah  ♫

76
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,825
♫  I'm not giving up  ♫

77
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:53,125

78
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:57,915

79
00:06:57,915 --> 00:07:01,215
Please look at the current balance sheet now.

80
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:04,905
The second and third quarter's short-term profits rose about five percent.

81
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:07,075
Considering the loans that need to be repaid by the end of this year...

82
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:10,175
 Prosecutor Jin Jung returned to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

83
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:15,245
However, as much as we expect difficulty in acquiring capital in the future,

84
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:18,405
we also have prepared a clear measure.

85
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:22,595
There also seems to be a need to empower our subsidiaries.

86
00:07:22,595 --> 00:07:25,355
 This is what I want to know, Prosecutor Oh.

87
00:07:25,355 --> 00:07:29,415
How in the hell did he know to come to me?

88
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,615
I'll go check this, Sir.

89
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:32,445
You'll go "check this"?

90
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:40,215
I guess you're right.

91
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:42,975
We must check things first.

92
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:50,575
However... what exactly is there to check after everything blew up in our faces?

93
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:54,925
What are you going to check, you idiot?

94
00:07:57,055 --> 00:07:58,425
Mark my words.

95
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:00,585
If this thing ends up sour,

96
00:08:00,585 --> 00:08:04,345
I might get hurt, but you'll die.

97
00:08:04,345 --> 00:08:06,255
I'm the Prosecutor General of the Central District, Oh Do Hwan.

98
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:08,815
Ruining your life is child's play for me.

99
00:08:08,815 --> 00:08:09,855
Do you understand?

100
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:12,885
Is there a reason why Chief Lee Jang Won's

101
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:14,845
death has to be a suicide?

102
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:20,965
As you said, my life is also on the line.

103
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:22,415
I think I have the right to know

104
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:25,025
-  the reason— 
 - Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan...

105
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:27,175
don't cross the line.

106
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:30,875
You just do what I order you to do...

107
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,175
for your own good.

108
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,905

109
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:44,495
Get out.

110
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:06,345
Yes.

111
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,755

112
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:23,915
Here we go.

113
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:25,705
You're here?

114
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:29,185
Where's the other guy?

115
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:31,615
He suddenly got an urgent civil service request.

116
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:33,935
So he went to take care of that. Yes.

117
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:35,245
Is that the truth?

118
00:09:35,245 --> 00:09:37,075
Pardon?

119
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:38,635
Y-Yes.

120
00:09:38,635 --> 00:09:42,105
W-Well, I'm not lying to you or anything.

121
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:46,055
It's not like Prosecutor Jin is actually d-doing something else.

122
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:48,185
Tell him to watch his back.

123
00:09:48,185 --> 00:09:49,515
Sorry?

124
00:09:50,475 --> 00:09:52,855
You said he went to take care of a complaint.

125
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:57,425
Tell him to take care. This one sounds like a malicious complaint this time.

126
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:58,645
O-Okay.

127
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:01,205
I'll tell him what you said.

128
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,775
Okay, let's take this off.

129
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:06,045
Snowball, did you enjoy your walk?

130
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:07,455
Good boy.

131
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:14,805
It's hard to prove the Prosecutor General guilty with just a recording.

132
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:16,975
We need one more piece of evidence.

133
00:10:16,975 --> 00:10:20,705
A solid one that can be used even in court.

134
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:23,225
All things aside, it's clear that the Prosecutor General—

135
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:28,455
That person is involved in the Chief's case.

136
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:30,365
We can start from there, then.

137
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:32,305
Do you have a plan?

138
00:10:32,305 --> 00:10:33,875
A case-related witness.

139
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,835
- A witness? 
 - In the back.

140
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,535
In the back— Oh, my gosh!

141
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:40,685
No, not those folks.

142
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:42,275
There's the document envelope in the back.

143
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,675
I forgot to put them away.

144
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:49,905

145
00:10:50,965 --> 00:10:53,585
This is the only card we have left.

146
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:55,545
The one that can capture Prosecutor General Kim Tae Ho.

147
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:57,795

148
00:10:57,795 --> 00:11:02,625
 What you see on both armpits... are not bruises but lividities. 
 (T/N: bluish-purple discoloration of skin after death)

149
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,435
Prosecutor General Kim Tae Ho himself ordered

150
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:08,305
them to fabricate the autopsy report?

151
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,255
That's the place.

152
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:33,475
This is the illegal gambling site where the medical examiner often shows up.

153
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,775
How did you get that information?

154
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:39,885
"Social media is a waste of time."  by Alex Ferguson.

155
00:11:57,695 --> 00:12:00,675
I'm not even going to mention that what you did is illegal.

156
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:02,465
What about the lack of a warrant?

157
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:05,005
We are going to arrest him for illegal gambling at the scene.

158
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:08,405
Separately from that, we are going to find out who is behind the fabricated autopsy report.

159
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:14,165
You, Jin Jung, really have a plan for everything.

160
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:16,715
It's just that you don't include following the law in your plans.

161
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,295
The problem is that I can play Hwatu, 
  (T/N: a Korean card game)

162
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:20,505
but I can't really play poker.

163
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:24,105
I've never even gotten one pair, it's like I'm cursed.

164
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:27,445
To read the air and catch him as quietly as possible,

165
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:29,405
you need to play a few rounds.

166
00:12:29,405 --> 00:12:31,565
Do you know how to play poker?

167
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:34,025
It's different from One Card, right?

168
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:37,885
Let's start with learning the poker hands first.

169
00:12:40,935 --> 00:12:43,355

170
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:48,395
Yes!

171
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:03,275
Gosh, it's so refreshing.

172
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,455
Didn't you say it's your first time?

173
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:23,915
Don't stop me. Today, I'll win enough to pay my rent for a year!

174
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:25,795
Hey, stop winning. Why are you winning so much?

175
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:26,945
We don't have time for this.

176
00:13:26,945 --> 00:13:28,655
Deal the cards!

177
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:32,335
Come on, come on...

178
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:21,475
All in.

179
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,605
Gosh, you really deal like crap.

180
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,795
Senior...

181
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:36,415
Senior.

182
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:39,265
Senior!

183
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:40,965
No!

184
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:47,805
It's my money!

185
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:49,545
It's mine!

186
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:01,625
Jung Jae Hoon!

187
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:42,105
Stop running away before you get in bigger trouble.

188
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:48,625
This is Prosecutor Shin Ah Ra from the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

189
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:52,445
These are the guys I was keeping a watch on.

190
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:55,125
Get in.

191
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:02,665
Please make sure to arrest every single one of them.

192
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,795
All right. Please give me a call again next time.

193
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:15,575
Wait...

194
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:19,315

195
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,275
You know who I am, right?

196
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:35,655
Why did you fabricate the autopsy report?

197
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:43,065
This is a statement of deposit and withdrawal of your account.

198
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:46,005
This is your credit card statement for the last month.

199
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,415
Your expenses were about three times larger than your income.

200
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,195
To be exact, this is right after the date of your autopsy on the Chief.

201
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:02,285
You made it too obvious that you made some money.

202
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:04,305
It seems that you've misunderstood.

203
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:08,345
- This is what I won from gambling— 
 - When you owe tons of won to the house?

204
00:17:08,345 --> 00:17:11,335
The house owner calls you a pushover.

205
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:15,835
What I'm really curious about is...

206
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,275
who ordered you to fabricate the report?

207
00:17:22,515 --> 00:17:24,645
It's Prosecutor General Kim Tae Ho, right?

208
00:17:29,145 --> 00:17:30,955
We're almost there.

209
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:36,205
You'll only lose out from remaining silent like that.

210
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:41,005
For fabricating a government document, the maximum sentence is five years, and you'll probably get that.

211
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:50,505
I'll help you.

212
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:52,235
Plea bargaining.

213
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:54,015
In simpler words, making a deal with a guilty plea.

214
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:58,045
A compromise policy where, if the suspect pleads guilty or provides a testimony that helps

215
00:17:58,045 --> 00:18:01,715
with an investigation, the sentence may be lightened or adjusted.

216
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:05,715
It's a policy that Korea doesn't officially accept yet.

217
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:08,665
Of course, I can't just make you completely innocent.

218
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:11,335
At the end of the day, you committed a crime and

219
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:15,215
it's common sense that you should pay for it.

220
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:20,055
Instead, I'll promise you this one thing.

221
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:23,025
I'm going to demand a reasonable sentence.

222
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,605

223
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:07,235
Fabricating the autopsy of Chief Prosecutor Lee Jang Won...

224
00:19:10,505 --> 00:19:12,715
I did that alone.

225
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:19,175
There was a mistake during the autopsy process, so

226
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:21,755
I couldn't help but fabricate the results.

227
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:22,825
Mr. Jung Jae Hoon...

228
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:25,625
I was never instigated by anyone, and

229
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,155
I have nothing more to say.

230
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:41,385
We clearly had him convinced.

231
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:43,595
Why did he change his mind?

232
00:19:45,015 --> 00:19:47,165
There must be a reason.

233
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,415
One we couldn't find yet.

234
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:50,435
Is there something wrong?

235
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:57,185
You must know well, too, Prosecutor General.

236
00:19:57,185 --> 00:19:59,505
Mr. Jung Jae Hoon, the medical examiner of Chief Lee Jang Won's autopsy.

237
00:19:59,505 --> 00:20:00,795
What about that person?

238
00:20:00,795 --> 00:20:03,295
It's an illegal gambling allegation.

239
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:04,905
That's all?

240
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:07,495
Really?

241
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:10,315
Then you take charge from here, Prosecutor Oh.

242
00:20:10,315 --> 00:20:11,825
Yes, Sir.

243
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,285
That's an abuse of power.

244
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:16,835
Even you, the Prosecutor General,

245
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:20,835
can't rob an ongoing investigation from us without a just cause—

246
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:29,345

According to an internal investigation, he was found

247
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:34,555

to have intentionally fabricated the Chief's autopsy report.

248
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:37,395
Of course, the two of you must've been totally unaware.

249
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,425
Prosecutor Oh.

250
00:20:44,165 --> 00:20:49,695
It doesn't look good to have multiple prosecutors stuck to one culprit.

251
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:52,295
Hand over all the data to Prosecutor Oh.

252
00:20:54,205 --> 00:20:57,125
You must be really on your wit's end

253
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,605
coming down to the fourth floor when you're on the 13th floor.

254
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:05,375
Laugh while you can.

255
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,125
You'll soon hit rock bottom.

256
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,515
Okay, I understand.

257
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:33,315
Thank you, Investigator.

258
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:37,865
They're going to transport the examiner to the detention center right away.

259
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:40,745
If he gets detained like this, it's the end.

260
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:44,395
Do you have any other plans? I'm okay if it's something weird.

261
00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:46,915
He'll be lucky if they only arrest him.

262
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:51,585
They can attempt to silence him, right?

263
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:56,625
It's the fastest and the most certain way to hide the truth.

264
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:05,505
Where is the examiner right now?

265
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:07,195
Mr. Jung Jae Hoon!

266
00:22:08,855 --> 00:22:11,135
Tell me honestly right now while you still can.

267
00:22:12,355 --> 00:22:14,965
- Don't you get it? 
 - You can't be doing this.

268
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:16,365
This is your last chance.

269
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:18,315
You think they're going to keep you alive?

270
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:20,165
To them, you're only a bomb.

271
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:22,165
It'll be all over if they could silence you, so why would they let you live?

272
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:23,165
I told you to let go of me!

273
00:22:23,165 --> 00:22:24,165
What are you doing? Get him in the car now!

274
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:25,915
I'm the only one who can help you!

275
00:22:25,915 --> 00:22:27,455
Cooperate with me!

276
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:29,115
Jung Jae Hoon!

277
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:31,745
Come on!

278
00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:33,635
Jung Jae Hoon—

279
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:04,265
What's this?

280
00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:17,435
Go outside and check.

281
00:23:17,435 --> 00:23:18,785
Okay.

282
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:25,745
Please go around to the front.

283
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:27,455
Okay.

284
00:23:27,455 --> 00:23:28,955
Hello?

285
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:35,925
Don't move!

286
00:23:58,005 --> 00:23:59,895
This is Eleven—

287
00:24:05,985 --> 00:24:07,925
Who are you?

288
00:24:13,615 --> 00:24:15,425
Who sent you?

289
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:43,495
Long time no see.

290
00:24:47,635 --> 00:24:49,395
Damn it, that hurts!

291
00:25:10,335 --> 00:25:12,055
Get up.

292
00:25:17,905 --> 00:25:20,635
- Where are we going? 
 - Shut up.

293
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:23,210
Get in.

294
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:25,835
Get in the car.

295
00:25:56,175 --> 00:26:00,765
The medical examiner disappeared in the middle of transport.

296
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,225
What?

297
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,295
Get off.

298
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:36,635
Are you still going to keep your mouth shut?

299
00:26:36,635 --> 00:26:38,375
You would've died if it wasn't for me.

300
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,035
Do you understand?

301
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:43,295
Talk.

302
00:26:43,295 --> 00:26:45,805
Who ordered you the fabrication?

303
00:26:50,695 --> 00:26:52,785
Before the two of you came,

304
00:26:53,785 --> 00:26:56,095
a person came to visit me.

305
00:26:56,095 --> 00:26:57,525
What?

306
00:26:59,315 --> 00:27:01,095
Who was that?

307
00:27:08,605 --> 00:27:11,895
 - What did you say? 
 - I said, if we happen to arrest you over Chief Lee Jang Won's autopsy report,

308
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:16,965
 you should take everything down with you alone.

309
00:27:16,965 --> 00:27:18,655
 Excuse me, Prosecutor,

310
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:21,985
 Go and tell this to your Prosecutor General, word for word.

311
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:24,545
 "If I get caught, it'll be over for you.

312
00:27:24,545 --> 00:27:27,235
 So be sure to take responsibility and protect me."

313
00:27:35,995 --> 00:27:39,625
 2017 NIS (National Intelligent Service) Agent Suicide Case.

314
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:44,335
 It ended only as a fabrication controversy because you were lucky back then.

315
00:27:44,335 --> 00:27:47,695
 But this time, it can go down for it.

316
00:27:47,695 --> 00:27:49,125
 What are you doing with me here?

317
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,165
 I'm giving you an opportunity to choose.

318
00:27:51,165 --> 00:27:55,775
 You can be you be a first offender with a lighter sentence, or a repeat offender with a heavier sentence.

319
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:03,705
 Do as you please, then.

320
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:07,415
 I have nothing to lose anyway.

321
00:28:08,435 --> 00:28:11,895
 If you're done talking, I'll be going.

322
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:14,865
 Please say hi to the Prosecutor General for me.

323
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:22,125
 - Let go. 
  - Mr. Jung Jae Hoon.

324
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:24,085
 I said to let go—

325
00:28:32,155 --> 00:28:34,685
 I ask of you, Mr. Jung Jae Hoon.

326
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:40,945
 Please don't... make me dig through your wife and son's underwear.

327
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:51,735
 The Prosecutor General told me this.

328
00:28:51,735 --> 00:28:55,255
 "Ruining a life is child's play."

329
00:28:55,255 --> 00:28:57,625
 I think the same way.

330
00:29:00,825 --> 00:29:04,065
 Don't underestimate public authority.

331
00:29:04,065 --> 00:29:07,255
 We can make anyone look guilty.

332
00:29:09,925 --> 00:29:12,295
I don't care about what happens to me, but

333
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:14,785
my wife and my son are innocent.

334
00:29:14,785 --> 00:29:16,875
Mr. Jung Jae Hoon,

335
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:21,055
we'll take full responsibility for those two people's safety.

336
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:30,955
All right, all right. So... what exactly do you want me to do?

337
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:32,545
Please help me, Hyeon Gyu.

338
00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:34,855
Please save me just this once.

339
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:38,165
You told me not to mind your business back then.

340
00:29:38,165 --> 00:29:41,705
You were the one who came at me not too long ago for poking Jin Jung.

341
00:29:41,705 --> 00:29:45,425
Just take care of it yourself, Mr. Prosecutor General.

342
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:49,165
I didn't say it, but I'm also ticked off by you, man.

343
00:29:54,235 --> 00:29:56,405
I was being short-sighted.

344
00:29:56,405 --> 00:29:57,815
I won't ever question you again.

345
00:29:57,815 --> 00:30:00,115
Please forgive me.

346
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:27,585
 It seemed that somebody attacked Prosecutor Jin.

347
00:30:28,385 --> 00:30:29,695
 What?

348
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,455
 Did you not know?

349
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,335

350
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:50,075
They'd probably be red-eyed from trying to look for the examiner.

351
00:30:50,075 --> 00:30:53,365
We have to protect him no matter what until we bring him to court.

352
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:54,745
You're sure this place is safe, right?

353
00:30:54,745 --> 00:30:56,895
Yes. It's my parents' business.

354
00:30:56,895 --> 00:30:59,335
They retired and settled here.

355
00:30:59,335 --> 00:31:02,975
It's off-season right now, so there are no customers and no one lives nearby.

356
00:31:37,545 --> 00:31:38,955
You came fast.

357
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:45,235
We had a difficult time because it's the countryside, but we found the way soon.

358
00:31:45,235 --> 00:31:46,808
Good job.

359
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:49,928
Gosh, what a crazy thing to do.

360
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:53,385
Seriously...

361
00:31:55,275 --> 00:31:59,015
But still... your teamwork is good.

362
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:01,165
Seriously, right?

363
00:32:01,165 --> 00:32:02,265
What's the matter with you?

364
00:32:02,265 --> 00:32:05,035
What? I mean, it's good.

365
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:09,435
You want to borrow my kid?

366
00:32:09,435 --> 00:32:11,485
Do you know where they—

367
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:19,995
Sometimes, I don't know why I keep you around.

368
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:37,915
What did you say Shin Ah Ra's parents do?

369
00:32:41,855 --> 00:32:44,235
Senior, please stay here with the examiner.

370
00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:48,175
Three of you, go meet his family and secure them first.

371
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,695
What about you, Jung?

372
00:32:50,775 --> 00:32:53,265
I got the sword handle, so I need to strike now.

373
00:32:54,285 --> 00:32:55,795
I'm going.

374
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,325
He was spying on us.

375
00:33:36,325 --> 00:33:38,085
He's an investigator.

376
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:43,405

Mr. Kang Shin Jo?

377
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:49,145
Did Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan order you?

378
00:33:55,945 --> 00:33:57,735

379
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,315
Hey.

380
00:34:06,315 --> 00:34:09,375
I was just about to call you, too.

381
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:11,115
Let's meet, shall we?

382
00:34:45,495 --> 00:34:46,715
You're here?

383
00:34:46,715 --> 00:34:49,135
Yes. Take a seat.

384
00:34:50,705 --> 00:34:53,155
You didn't eat yet, did you?

385
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:56,085
One more of the same thing as mine, please.

386
00:34:56,085 --> 00:34:57,795
No, it's fine.

387
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:00,465
I had some bread on the way here

388
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,775
because I get indigestion after eating with a criminal.

389
00:35:11,845 --> 00:35:14,655
What is it that you want?

390
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:18,375
Money and position don't seem to be to your taste.

391
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,645
Tell me without reservation.

392
00:35:21,645 --> 00:35:24,745
- Do you come to this place frequently? 
 - Sometimes.

393
00:35:24,745 --> 00:35:27,135
Especially when...

394
00:35:27,135 --> 00:35:31,175
I need to build a new relationship with someone I'm on bad terms with.

395
00:35:31,175 --> 00:35:32,765
I see.

396
00:35:34,085 --> 00:35:36,095
The night view is great.

397
00:35:37,075 --> 00:35:41,055
But I'd rather see the night view from the Prosecutor General's office.

398
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:47,745
Hand over the Prosecutor General seat, please.

399
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,975
And I can have a new relationship with you.

400
00:35:57,665 --> 00:35:59,815
I'm kidding. Eat up.

401
00:35:59,815 --> 00:36:02,175
Why spit out the meat? It's a waste.

402
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:07,235
I'll tell you what I really want.

403
00:36:07,235 --> 00:36:10,235
Let me ask the Prosecutor General as a prosecutor.

404
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:13,775
Who is it? The one who's behind you.

405
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:21,195
 I didn't do that! I didn't even know about such plans, and I—

406
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:22,945
 I couldn't help it.

407
00:36:22,945 --> 00:36:24,755
 This is my answer.

408
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:27,835
It meant that somebody else tried to kill me,

409
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:30,275
according to your words back then.

410
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:32,915
Also, the phrase, "I couldn't help it."

411
00:36:32,915 --> 00:36:35,445
It's a common phrase of the henchmen.

412
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,225
"I couldn't help it."

413
00:36:37,225 --> 00:36:39,765
"I just did as I was told."

414
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:44,945
Leader of our nation's largest prosecutors' office with more than 200 prosecutors

415
00:36:44,945 --> 00:36:47,575
and the representative of Central District Prosecutors' Offices,

416
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:49,665
which is also called the center of the Prosecution,

417
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,445
Prosecutor General Kim Tae Ho.

418
00:36:52,445 --> 00:36:54,915
You should be ashamed.

419
00:36:56,685 --> 00:36:59,895
I request of you with respect for the last time.

420
00:37:01,075 --> 00:37:03,055
Please tell me who it is.

421
00:37:06,505 --> 00:37:08,615
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Jin.

422
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:14,175
I don't understand what you're saying.

423
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:21,805
Okay.

424
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:25,295
You're not a prosecutor to me anymore.

425
00:37:27,405 --> 00:37:28,815
Yes, Senior.

426
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:30,845
Investigator Lee Chul Ki contacted me.

427
00:37:30,845 --> 00:37:33,145
He met the son without trouble.

428
00:37:36,085 --> 00:37:39,065
You can just speak comfortably.

429
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:40,825
Okay.

430
00:37:42,865 --> 00:37:45,065
Mr. Jung Jae Hoon says he's going to testify

431
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:48,355
about who ordered him to fabricate the autopsy report.

432
00:37:58,265 --> 00:38:01,295
I'll come see you with the warrant, Mr. Kim Tae Ho.

433
00:38:01,295 --> 00:38:03,205
Please enjoy your meal.

434
00:38:17,725 --> 00:38:19,295
One moment, please.

435
00:38:26,615 --> 00:38:28,135
Yes, Sen—

436
00:38:28,135 --> 00:38:30,685
 They got our location.

437
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,595
Hey, break it down!

438
00:39:04,905 --> 00:39:07,585
You go right, and you go left.

439
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:36,995
They're there!

440
00:39:36,995 --> 00:39:38,725
Run!

441
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:42,605
Hurry up and follow.

442
00:39:42,605 --> 00:39:44,315
Hurry up!

443
00:39:55,945 --> 00:39:58,815
You were more reckless than I thought.

444
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,685
I could be even more.

445
00:40:10,505 --> 00:40:13,805
I'll write the contents, so you just need to sign...

446
00:40:15,392 --> 00:40:17,595
if you want to save the two.

447
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:23,125

448
00:40:40,555 --> 00:40:43,395
Taxi! Please stop!

449
00:40:49,305 --> 00:40:52,095
Please start driving for now. Quickly!

450
00:40:55,575 --> 00:40:57,075
Sir?

451
00:41:06,955 --> 00:41:09,655
Prosecutor Shin Ah Ra once looked up to you.

452
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:11,605
But why did she end up like that?

453
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:14,835
This wouldn't have happened if she kept looking up to me.

454
00:41:16,985 --> 00:41:18,615
Don't look at me with those eyes.

455
00:41:18,615 --> 00:41:21,015
You guys asked for it.

456
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:24,135
If anything happens to them...

457
00:41:24,135 --> 00:41:25,805
I'm going to kill you.

458
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:27,625
Scary.

459
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:32,425
Should I give you a piece of advice?

460
00:41:35,355 --> 00:41:38,195
Don't bark if you can't bite.

461
00:42:01,615 --> 00:42:04,005
What do we do, Prosecutor Jin?

462
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,335
I think it's game over.

463
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:33,235
 Now, for example.

464
00:42:33,235 --> 00:42:35,435
 Let's say your opponent grabbed you like this.

465
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:37,145
 Then what would you do?

466
00:42:43,335 --> 00:42:45,375
 I'm sorry. Are you okay?

467
00:42:47,545 --> 00:42:49,175
 This much doesn't hurt.

468
00:42:52,525 --> 00:42:54,185
 You're good.

469
00:42:54,185 --> 00:42:56,335
 I think you can even beat up a cow.

470
00:42:58,035 --> 00:43:00,215
 Hey, let's try one more time.

471
00:43:00,215 --> 00:43:01,385
 I don't think you need to.

472
00:43:01,385 --> 00:43:02,825
 One more time.

473
00:43:02,825 --> 00:43:06,265
 - I don't think you need to. 
 - Hey, hey. Hey!

474
00:43:16,575 --> 00:43:18,035
Run!

475
00:43:21,085 --> 00:43:22,905
Go catch them!

476
00:43:28,475 --> 00:43:30,165
Let me go!

477
00:43:30,165 --> 00:43:31,745
Let go!

478
00:43:54,135 --> 00:43:56,915
Isn't it taking too long?

479
00:44:02,505 --> 00:44:05,005
Don't think that this is the end.

480
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:08,735
Don't leave the Prosecutor General position empty, either.

481
00:44:09,505 --> 00:44:12,005
I'll come visit again for sure.

482
00:44:12,915 --> 00:44:15,525
Excessive bravado is the same as ill-advised bravery.

483
00:44:15,525 --> 00:44:19,115
What can you do when you'll no longer be a prosecutor soon?

484
00:44:25,025 --> 00:44:27,555

485
00:44:56,825 --> 00:44:59,415
Call Prosecutor Jin! Quickly!

486
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:04,895

487
00:45:06,185 --> 00:45:07,745
 Where are you?

488
00:45:07,745 --> 00:45:09,325
You're with Kim Tae Ho, right?

489
00:45:09,325 --> 00:45:10,575

Get him on the phone right now.

490
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:13,215
I'm going to kill that jerk!

491
00:45:21,095 --> 00:45:22,895
What do we do, Mr. Kim Tae Ho?

492
00:45:22,895 --> 00:45:25,055
The game doesn't seem to be over yet.

493
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,005
Prosecutor Shin Ah Ra told me to tell you that...

494
00:45:27,005 --> 00:45:29,145
she's going to...

495
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:33,195
Never mind. Hear it from her directly later.

496
00:45:34,355 --> 00:45:36,305
Let's see.

497
00:45:36,305 --> 00:45:38,495
The Letter of Resignation.

498
00:45:40,275 --> 00:45:42,295
I think you'll need it before I do.

499
00:45:43,635 --> 00:45:45,415
Make sure to fill it out completely.

500
00:45:45,415 --> 00:45:49,885
You'll be wearing a jumpsuit, but it'd be inappropriate to still be a prosecutor.

501
00:45:49,885 --> 00:45:51,495
Please take care.

502
00:45:52,615 --> 00:45:56,185
Gosh, this is funny.

503
00:46:22,795 --> 00:46:24,035
Are you okay?

504
00:46:24,035 --> 00:46:25,575
A stroke of good luck among misfortunes.

505
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:28,125
The problem is the examiner. He'll be in danger if we don't find him soon.

506
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,345
How are we going to find him?

507
00:46:29,345 --> 00:46:32,325
We don't have time to stand around. Let's move.

508
00:46:32,325 --> 00:46:33,745
Sorry?

509
00:46:35,965 --> 00:46:37,635
What are you doing? Aren't you going?

510
00:46:37,635 --> 00:46:41,825
Prosecutor... how do you know where the examiner is?

511
00:46:45,015 --> 00:46:46,705
 - Let go! 
 - It's nothing much.

512
00:46:46,705 --> 00:46:50,155
 I left my phone inside the examiner's pocket.

513
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:53,595
Whoa...

514
00:46:56,885 --> 00:46:58,960
What are you doing? Get in the car.

515
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,950
♫  Wherever we are, a little start that shines alone  ♫

516
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:04,360
♫  Wherever you are  ♫

517
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,220
♫  Wherever we are, a little start that shines alone  ♫

518
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:12,460
♫  Wherever you are, wherever we are  ♫

519
00:47:26,515 --> 00:47:28,245
Tae Ho!

520
00:47:31,965 --> 00:47:34,445
- What's up? 
 - Are you a squid?

521
00:47:34,445 --> 00:47:36,665
You're so dry.

522
00:47:36,665 --> 00:47:39,435
Can't a colleague come to see another colleague?

523
00:47:39,435 --> 00:47:42,235
I'm tired so just get to the point.

524
00:47:46,165 --> 00:47:48,445
Was it CEO Seo

525
00:47:49,445 --> 00:47:51,405
who injured Prosecutor Jin?

526
00:47:55,032 --> 00:47:57,215
Tell CEO Seo this for me.

527
00:47:57,215 --> 00:47:59,765
Stop messing with him.

528
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:01,125
Why?

529
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:03,525
Did you already grow fond of him?

530
00:48:04,585 --> 00:48:06,675
Don't be like that, Jae Kyung.

531
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,705
What are you going to do if you end up like before again?

532
00:48:11,115 --> 00:48:14,755
Don't make unnecessary moves and keep living like that.

533
00:48:23,355 --> 00:48:25,075
Jae Kyung...

534
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:32,565
I'm still sorry for what happened to your family back then.

535
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:38,105
But I also warned you back then not to mess with Seo Hyeon Gyu.

536
00:48:39,685 --> 00:48:41,905
So listen to me this time.

537
00:48:41,905 --> 00:48:44,345
It's not for you...

538
00:48:44,345 --> 00:48:46,845
but for people around you.

539
00:49:20,945 --> 00:49:22,375
Get out.

540
00:49:56,045 --> 00:49:58,263

541
00:49:58,263 --> 00:50:02,377

542
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:15,365
Okay, that's enough!

543
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:24,045
Is your mask not smothering you?

544
00:50:24,045 --> 00:50:26,405
Why don't you show your face since we've met before?

545
00:50:29,455 --> 00:50:32,415
Never listens at once every single time.

546
00:50:32,415 --> 00:50:34,875
I'm telling you in advance, but it'll be different from last time.

547
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:37,945
There's no ambush this time, and above all, I-

548
00:50:39,945 --> 00:50:42,465
What is he doing? I was still talking.

549
00:50:43,245 --> 00:50:45,945
I never forget my enemies, you see.

550
00:50:45,945 --> 00:50:47,415
You!

551
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:52,270
♫  Dash off as soon as it starts  ♫

552
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:55,300
♫  Stopping at nothiing  ♫

553
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:59,130
♫  I run faster without hesitation, I move like no other  ♫

554
00:50:59,135 --> 00:51:00,630
Prosecutor Shin!

555
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:06,080
♫  It's tough to behold a piece of work like me for someone with a stubbornly obvious viewpoint   ♫

556
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:08,145
It'd be okay for us to be in here, right?

557
00:51:08,145 --> 00:51:09,695
Are you good at fighting?

558
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:12,455
I'm more of a brains type.

559
00:51:13,385 --> 00:51:14,805
I'm the same.

560
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:18,195
Let's just wait instead of butting in and causing trouble.

561
00:51:18,195 --> 00:51:20,945
Whoa... that's a prosecutor for you.

562
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:22,755
The brain type.

563
00:51:22,755 --> 00:51:26,710
♫  Nothing stops me, yeah, please call me a freak  ♫

564
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:29,750
♫  I'm the type who doesn't care about what others think  ♫

565
00:51:30,605 --> 00:51:32,625
It feels like we're in...

566
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:35,725
a car theater since it's just us two like this.

567
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,565
Be quiet.

568
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:42,220
♫  Even when others argue saying this or that, when everyone says no  ♫

569
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:48,960
♫  I say yes, I don't know when to give up, call, call me a freak  ♫

570
00:52:54,975 --> 00:52:56,805
Pull up!

571
00:52:58,865 --> 00:53:00,965
One, two, three!

572
00:53:05,425 --> 00:53:06,635
Mr. Jung Jae Hoon.

573
00:53:06,635 --> 00:53:09,255
Get yourself together, Mr. Jung Jae Hoon!

574
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,920

575
00:54:52,675 --> 00:54:54,375
 What's this?

576
00:55:06,585 --> 00:55:09,395
 I thought this was gone a long time ago.

577
00:55:10,295 --> 00:55:12,465
 How do you have it, Chief?

578
00:55:16,635 --> 00:55:20,575
 I guess your negotiation didn't go well with CEO Seo Hyeon Gyu.

579
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:23,365
 I only ended up showing my hand.

580
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:25,755
 Now he knows that I have it.

581
00:55:27,025 --> 00:55:29,405
 What you said a long time ago was right.

582
00:55:29,405 --> 00:55:32,125
 "A monster must be killed,

583
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:34,905
 not controlled with a leash."

584
00:55:37,675 --> 00:55:40,525
 Better realizing it later than never.

585
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:46,785
 By the way... why are you giving this to me now?

586
00:55:46,785 --> 00:55:48,895
 I'm a kite with a broken string now...

587
00:55:48,895 --> 00:55:51,145
 because one of your subordinates.

588
00:55:53,235 --> 00:55:55,585
 I'm going to resign tomorrow.

589
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:57,805
 You give it a try and solve it.

590
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:03,575
 You teamed up with Kim Tae Ho to create the Civil Service Division.

591
00:56:03,575 --> 00:56:05,485
 Then you shoved me in there and

592
00:56:05,485 --> 00:56:07,625
 ordered him to dry my soul to death.

593
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:09,965
 But what did you say just now?

594
00:56:09,965 --> 00:56:14,165
- Give it a try and solve— 
 - Well, you didn't die, so it's fine.

595
00:56:14,165 --> 00:56:16,055
 You sharpened your knife, didn't you?

596
00:56:16,055 --> 00:56:19,215
 To exact your revenge on Seo Hyeon Gyu for your family.

597
00:56:19,215 --> 00:56:22,075
 So you should be thankful to me actually.

598
00:56:24,045 --> 00:56:26,925
 What the hell is this guy saying... ?

599
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:31,115
 Anyhow, the sword handle is in your hands now.

600
00:56:33,335 --> 00:56:35,455
 Go ahead and give it a good swing.

601
00:57:00,015 --> 00:57:01,575

602
00:57:01,575 --> 00:57:03,835

603
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:09,475
 Did Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan order you?

604
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:21,815

605
00:57:33,795 --> 00:57:37,695
Whoa. Father, your form got even better than before.

606
00:57:37,695 --> 00:57:40,925
This one analyzes me like a ghost.

607
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:42,985
So I can only improve.

608
00:57:42,985 --> 00:57:44,445
The interior is nice here.

609
00:57:44,445 --> 00:57:46,875
It was a good thing to relocate your practice room.

610
00:57:48,585 --> 00:57:51,435
You know, I gave it a thought...

611
00:57:53,155 --> 00:57:57,675
but Jin isn't... a common last name.

612
00:57:58,345 --> 00:58:01,535
His face is oddly familiar, too.

613
00:58:05,535 --> 00:58:09,525
Fate is really... an interesting thing.

614
00:58:13,395 --> 00:58:15,475

615
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,915
Excuse me, you can't just barge in—

616
00:58:26,865 --> 00:58:29,025
It's okay. Just stay outside.

617
00:58:32,765 --> 00:58:35,925
I don't recall having agreed to meet you.

618
00:58:35,925 --> 00:58:38,365
I think you're being too rude.

619
00:58:41,825 --> 00:58:43,675
I'm leaving in five minutes.

620
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:48,385
There's a National Prosecutor Generals' Conference at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

621
00:58:48,385 --> 00:58:50,425
Hurry up and say what you need to say.

622
00:58:54,435 --> 00:58:55,875
This is Prosecutor Jin.

623
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:58,315
Call the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

624
00:58:58,315 --> 00:59:00,825
The Prosecutor General won't be able to make it.

625
00:59:04,145 --> 00:59:09,055
Mr. Kim Tae Ho, you are under immediate arrest for

626
00:59:09,055 --> 00:59:11,215
concealing murder, instigated fabrication of evidence,

627
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:14,515
threatening, abduction, and attempted instigated murder.

628
00:59:14,515 --> 00:59:16,005
What?

629
00:59:28,415 --> 00:59:29,765
 Mr. Jung Jae Hoon.

630
00:59:29,765 --> 00:59:32,085
 Get yourself together, Mr. Jung Jae Hoon!

631
00:59:43,885 --> 00:59:46,165
 She left, right?

632
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,115
 She left.

633
01:00:02,205 --> 01:00:03,775
 Gosh...

634
01:00:05,085 --> 01:00:06,855
 Although you weren't hurt this time,

635
01:00:06,855 --> 01:00:08,055
 you don't know about next time.

636
01:00:08,055 --> 01:00:10,405
 Make sure to wear this 24/7.

637
01:00:10,405 --> 01:00:13,125
 I think it'd be too obvious when you stab him.

638
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:15,115
 Let's add a gimmick.

639
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:18,615
 No one will figure it out. Right?

640
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,275
 Am I right, or what?

641
01:00:20,275 --> 01:00:21,915
 Gosh...

642
01:00:21,915 --> 01:00:23,815
 No one can tell. Could I try stabbing you once?

643
01:00:23,815 --> 01:00:26,335
 Your acting is good.

644
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:33,055
 You're alive, so get up now.

645
01:00:33,055 --> 01:00:34,825
 Why are you still acting dead?

646
01:00:34,825 --> 01:00:36,845
 Gosh, I'm so tired.

647
01:00:47,695 --> 01:00:49,575
I told you, didn't I?

648
01:00:50,215 --> 01:00:52,250
You're done for now.

649
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:59,920

01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,210
♫  It's a gangda that devours the green grass  ♫

658
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,110
♫  It's the same as holding a sword, that swordsman isn't a swordsman  ♫

659
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,840
♫  Full of ambition, up to the threshold of death drama  ♫

660
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,940
♫  Babies on a single rope wander as if to block card prices  ♫

661
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:28,560
♫  From time to time, your other comments are subtitles under the courtroom  ♫

662
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,800
♫  It's the same as holding a sword, that swordsman isn't a swordsman  ♫

663
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,170
♫  I put the fruit in the box, I'm afraid I'll see the soles all in a bag  ♫

664
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:35,300
♫  After blacking out, only dirty talk comes out  ♫

665
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:37,765

666
01:01:37,765 --> 01:01:39,775
 I just did my best to protect the organization.

667
01:01:39,775 --> 01:01:43,085
 I'll prove to you just how wrong that shallow conviction of yours is.

668
01:01:43,085 --> 01:01:44,635
 Don't you know where this is?

669
01:01:44,635 --> 01:01:46,435
 This is the Supreme Prosecution's Inspection Department, you jerk!

670
01:01:46,435 --> 01:01:49,105

Your name came up on the drug dealer's list, Director.

671
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,155
 I know nothing about that matter.

672
01:01:50,155 --> 01:01:51,345
 Why the heck would you do something that crazy?

673
01:01:51,345 --> 01:01:53,735
 - That's true. 
 - Your position at the Prosecution must be quite weak.

674
01:01:53,735 --> 01:01:54,925
 Try saying you're sorry with your head on the ground.

675
01:01:54,925 --> 01:01:57,415
 You're saying the blood on the boot is the same as mine, right?

676
01:01:57,415 --> 01:01:58,565
 RH positive, type B.

677
01:01:58,565 --> 01:02:00,245
 You almost died, you punk!

678
01:02:00,245 --> 01:02:03,318
 Listen to a person when he tells you something. I'm telling you for your sake.

679
01:02:03,318 --> 01:02:06,128
 Pretending not to know something isn't my style.
