1
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:40,599

2
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:43,390

3
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:51,220

4
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,439
You knew already.

5
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,449
I told you I would become... a swordsman. 
  (T/N: Same spelling/sound as prosecutor in Korean)

6
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:55,792
Then why didn't you tell me so?

7
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:59,132
You didn't tell me anything, either.

8
00:00:59,132 --> 00:01:01,599
You see, I'm a shy person.

9
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,089
Seo Hyeon Gyu is the one looking for this, isn't it?

10
00:01:07,089 --> 00:01:09,549
The CEO of Law Firm Kangsan.

11
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:13,249
I expected that much.

12
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:17,169
Everything that has happened so far since the Seocho-dong case...

13
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:20,689
there's no way for the Kangsan's Knife-cutter to have operated on her own accord.

14
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,039
Tell me now

15
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:25,859
everything you know, Mister.

16
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,769
It'll be a long story.

17
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,269
I'll listen to you clearheaded.

18
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:00,209
 Although the defendant was well aware that

19
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:02,439
 the product manufactured at his company

20
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:08,989
 could cause critical side effects on the human body,

21
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:13,699
 he hid this fact in the organization systematically and distributed his products to the market.

22
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,599
 Therefore, endangering the lives of many, which led to death.

23
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,439
 Additionally, to cover up this incident, the defendant

24
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,739
 destroyed the evidence, bribed, and threatened the victims.

25
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:26,079
 Which only shows the heinous nature of his crime.

26
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,809
 Hence, this court hereby sentences

27
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:33,699
 the defendant, Jo Byeong Soo, imprisonment for life.

28
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,100

29
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:07,899
 Mr. Seo Hyeon Gyu!

30
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:13,969
 What the hell are you doing right now?

31
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,499
 What do you think you're doing?

32
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:16,629
 Let go of me.

33
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,679
 Stop saying nonsense.

34
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:21,749
 Don't you think I know that he's a substitute?

35
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,299
 I don't think it matters that

36
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:27,969
 much whether he's the real one or not.

37
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:28,879
 What?

38
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,969
 Most people in this country can't distinguish between real and fake anyway.

39
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:40,019
 I create the truth my client wants and just received a payment for that.

40
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,619
 Truth isn't something you look for.

41
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:45,919
 It's something you create, Prosecutor Park.

42
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,299
 Don't you have...

43
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,069
 even the minimum amount of conscience?

44
00:03:58,069 --> 00:03:59,759
 Don't you?

45
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,269
 Prosecutor Park, you're a very naive one.

46
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:05,899
 What kind of attorney cares for a conscience?

47
00:04:05,899 --> 00:04:08,369
 We just work for money.

48
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:11,209
 The job of an attorney, you see...

49
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,809
 isn't to find justice or conscience.

50
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:19,039
 It's about protecting the client.

51
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,489
 That's why we get paid big money.

52
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:24,639
 You want us to care for our consciences in the middle of that?

53
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,539
 That behavior certainly lacks a sense of conscience.

54
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:29,419
 I'm going to...

55
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:36,429
 do whatever it takes to expose you.

56
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:38,379
 Good luck.

57
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:45,699
 Hey, Park Jae Kyung.

58
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,269
 Are you out of your mind?

59
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:50,459
 Why are you digging into Kangsan without my permission?

60
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:53,268
 Slush Fund Creation and

61
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:56,228
 Stock Price Manipulation Case of Daejung Group from three years ago.

62
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:57,339

63
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,399
 Taesung Motors' Sudden Acceleration Case.

64
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,062
 Joojung Construction's Department Store Collapse Case.

65
00:05:02,062 --> 00:05:05,022
 - And this is— 
 - Hey, you.

66
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:06,249
 the most recent one.

67
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:09,409

Humidifier Sterilizer Case. They're all...

68
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,179
 cases that Kangsan defended.

69
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:13,819
 These are cases ruled as guilty by the Supreme Court.

70
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,879
 They did get ruled for sure.

71
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,469
 The problem is that the core suspects of each case are still having a feast

72
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:22,939
 while the innocent substitutes are behind bars.

73
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:28,519
 Okay. Sure.

74
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,689
 Let's say your claims are true.

75
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:33,609
 Even though you have no evidence to back that up, let's just say that you're right.

76
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:38,519
 However, what will you do about cases whose trials are already over?

77
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,199
 I'll catch the architect first.

78
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,669
 CEO Seo Hyeon Gyu of Law Firm Kangsan.

79
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:46,559
 Appoint me to investigate him officially.

80
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,209
 You—

81
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:56,779
 Do you even know who he is to say something like this?

82
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:58,891
 That guy isn't just an attorney.

83
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:03,981
 Every authority in this country is dying to befriend him.

84
00:06:04,836 --> 00:06:07,319
 People from the Blue House and hotshot politicians

85
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,882
 are dying to have a meal with him.

86
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:12,453
 That's who he is!

87
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:17,449
 I don't understand what you mean.

88
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:19,919
 If he did something bad, we should catch him.

89
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,529
 Isn't that the purpose of our existence?

90
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:26,469
 The presidential election is coming up soon.

91
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,989
 Now isn't the right time, at least. Take your foot off the gas.

92
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,952
 Well...

93
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:35,792
 I'm saying I'll do my job. Why are you telling me to take my foot off the gas?

94
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:38,929
 I refuse.

95
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,389

96
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:01,679
 We're going to create a place called the Civil Service Division.

97
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:02,979
 Where you only have a title of a prosecutor,

98
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:05,729
 but you won't be able to do any real work.

99
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:08,879
 It's not a place of exile.

100
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,009
 It's a disposal room where you dispose of the defects.

101
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:15,759
 We also have one here in the Criminal Division, right?

102
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,569
 A prosecutor who's called a defect.

103
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,889
 This is an organization.

104
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:29,159
 If you keep up this act, I'll have no choice but to send you there.

105
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:34,439
 Understood.

106
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:36,759
 Send me there, then.

107
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,409
 - Hey, Jae Kyung! 
 - Instead,

108
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:41,969
 I'll be there after getting Seo Hyeon Gyu.

109
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:44,749
 Please appoint me to investigate him officially.

110
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:49,649
 Hey—

111
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,559
 I heard stuff went down between you and the Deputy Chief.

112
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,889
 Did rumors spread already?

113
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,549
 I know your character, but...

114
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:07,169
 you should be conscious of the higher-ups sometimes.

115
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,999
 You've got to sit in one of those executive positions as well, no?

116
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:11,759
 Hey...

117
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,549
 A country bumpkin from Sapgyo passed the bar exam and became a prosecutor.

118
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:19,199
 If I want anything more than that from here, then I'm being greedy.

119
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,339
 You do you, Mr. Righteous..

120
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:24,899
 There's no point in worrying about you ever.

121
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,379
 - Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

122
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,999
 So? Did you get anything?

123
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,179
 Why are you asking all of a sudden?

124
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:52,459
 What?

125
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:55,529
 I'm just curious.

126
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:58,409
 He passed the bar before us, you know.

127
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,009
 You stay out of this.

128
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,859
 Don't become a defect along with me.

129
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:07,839
 A defect?

130
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,182
 There's something like that.

131
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,725

132
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:15,685
 Anyway, you stay out of it. Okay?

133
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,759
 Yes, Reporter Jin.

134
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,539
 Yes, yes. Go ahead.

135
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:31,349
 Seo Hyeon Gyu?

136
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,979
 Okay, I understand. One second, please.

137
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,499
 What's up?

138
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:45,029
 I'll have to go first.

139
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:08,359
He said he had something to give me.

140
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,399
He said he found evidence to catch Seo Hyeon Gyu, however...

141
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,769
I couldn't get it at that time.

142
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:16,609
That reporter got into an accident, you see.

143
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:18,939
So I thought this was lost.

144
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:21,359
But...

145
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:27,709
I got it from the Chief one day before he passed away.

146
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:31,019
Do you know how he ended up with this?

147
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,839
I'm not sure.

148
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:38,619
Kim Tae Ho might be the one to know, though.

149
00:10:43,729 --> 00:10:46,679
That reporter who called you.

150
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,639
By chance was that person someone I know—

151
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:57,949
Who is it?

152
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,719
- Are you expecting someone? 
 - No, wait here.

153
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,719
Who is it?

154
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:15,989
Long time no see.

155
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:17,989
Do you have a guest?

156
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:19,779
I'll come back later—

157
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:47,549

158
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:52,869
We meet again, Prosecutor Jin.

159
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:55,602
Gosh, I kept saying I'll pay a visit...

160
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:58,132
but I only got to come now.

161
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:04,029
Who has the item I'm looking for?

162
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,309
How unfortunate.

163
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:12,939
It's a useless item anyway.

164
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:15,829
Neither of you was able to break the code yet.

165
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:17,589
Hand it over to me, Prosecutor.

166
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:18,809
It's a request.

167
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:20,689
Your ass must be on fire

168
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:23,849
for you to be coming all the way here to get a useless item.

169
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,849
What's inside must surely be frightening for you.

170
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:32,272
Wow...

171
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:36,939
He would've been about 30 by now...

172
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:38,539
if Joon Soo was still alive, right?

173
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:40,819
- This son of a— 
 - Prosecutor Jin!

174
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,299
Just go back.

175
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,239
You're soiling the taste of liquor.

176
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:53,559
Prosecutor Jin...

177
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:56,609
could you please excuse us for a moment?

178
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:06,309
You're not the obedient type, huh?

179
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:09,409
Your mother must've had a hard time.

180
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:14,029

181
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:32,409
Do you... call your mom often?

182
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:50,359

183
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,279
Answer.

184
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,459

185
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:00,189
Please answer.

186
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:01,869
Answer!

187
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:04,839
Mom, answer, please!

188
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:13,499
Mom!

189
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:15,709
Yes, Son!

190
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:21,579
The car behind you. The car!

191
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:29,889
- Oh, gosh... 
 - Are you okay, Mom?

192
00:14:30,756 --> 00:14:34,889
That damn bastard! How dare you drive like that?

193
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:36,969
- Come on, get up. 
 - Goodness, seriously.

194
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:39,109
- I-It hurts, it hurts. 
 - Why?

195
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:42,139
- Where? Do you think you got injured? 
 - Yes.

196
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:47,729
 I only told them to say hi...

197
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:50,419
for the sake of our old times.

198
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:52,279
Enough is enough.

199
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:55,429
I could just kill you here.

200
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,739
Then you would've done it already.

201
00:14:57,739 --> 00:14:59,269
If you're really capable of doing it,

202
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:02,789
you would've done it when you lost your wife and kid.

203
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:04,349
What?

204
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:07,729
Couldn't you just forget everything and live on?

205
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:12,679
I understand your desire to pay me back for what you got.

206
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:18,039
But Jae Kyung... it's not like your family will come back if you avenge them.

207
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:21,439
Let's just forgive.

208
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:24,909
Let's just forgive and forget everything and move on.

209
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:29,289
Bring me the item.

210
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:32,189
You tell Prosecutor Jin to give it to me.

211
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:36,849
There's no need for him to experience what you went through.

212
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:44,399
I said I'm okay. Why bother getting hospitalized?

213
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,339
They said you sprained your ligament, and your bone is fractured.

214
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:48,949
You're not okay at all, so just stay here.

215
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,399
I can just get outpatient treatment at home.

216
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,119
I have a group reservation tomorrow.

217
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,249
No, you can't go.

218
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:57,259
You have to take the day off. You need absolute rest.

219
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:59,999
Also, since you're here, get your checkup while you're at it and

220
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,869
take a break from the store for a few days. Is in it nice?

221
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:07,119
You need to live long to see your son get married.

222
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:09,219
I don't want to become an orphan.

223
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,059
Let's live long together, Mrs. Lim.

224
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:15,759
I'm going to live until the 22nd century.

225
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,439
Let's do that.

226
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:20,339
I'm off now.

227
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,839
Get better soon. I'll call you.

228
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,479
Seo Hyeon Gyu?

229
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:33,369
The CEO of Law Firm Kangsan?

230
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:34,429
 What about your mother?

231
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:35,949
 Is your mother okay?

232
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:38,249
Fortunately, she's okay.

233
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:40,849
The problem is that I'm not okay.

234
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,769
 - Where are you right now?  
 - On my way to meet Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan.

235
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:48,039
I need to secure the black box.

236
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:52,099
Seocho-dong murder case happened because of the MP3.

237
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:56,299
Whoever the real culprit is... he must also be connected to Seo Hyeon Gyu.

238
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:59,069
You're going to catch the culprit first to get to Seo Hyeon Gyu?

239
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:02,009
I'll put them in jail myself.

240
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:05,619
Seo Hyeon Gyu messed with the wrong guy.

241
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:08,279
 Jung, I understand how you feel but let's calm down a bit.

242
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,579
Even so, you can't just go to him without a plan—

243
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,999
♫  You can't bring me down  ♫

244
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,099
Jin Jung...

245
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,479
Next up is...

246
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:21,769
K-Co Labs' Additional Collection of Taxes by the National Tax Service.

247
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:25,439
It's being investigated by the joint task force at the Northern District Prosecutors' Office, isn't it?

248
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,219
What do you think, Attorney Lee?

249
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:28,569
You're a former prosecutor general.

250
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,969
You must know a lot of people in the joint task force.

251
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:32,759
I think it'd be better to pass on this case.

252
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:40,759
Attorney Oh... this isn't the Prosecutors' Office. Get yourself together.

253
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:52,389
The joint task force on Financial and Securities Crimes was formed ambitiously.

254
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:55,259
However, in contrast to its beginning,

255
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:58,679
it still hasn't produced any meaningful results

256
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,949
according to popular opinion.

257
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:04,659
The joint task force must be dead set on this case, right?

258
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:06,159
Exactly.

259
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:08,619
As you can see on the last page of the report,

260
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:11,129
the joint task force is currently doing an additional internal investigation

261
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:13,999
on the officers' embezzlement allegations of tens of billions of won.

262
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:15,709
Under the circumstances,

263
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:21,019
shall we protect the client while going as far as to make an enemy of the regime?

264
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:22,599
Please keep in mind that...

265
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,619
we might fall into the curse of the victor...

266
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,969
as well if things go wrong.

267
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,719
Attorney Oh.

268
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:39,529
What are you doing?

269
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,159
What do you mean?

270
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:43,049
The thing just now.

271
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:45,709
You didn't even share the information beforehand.

272
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,729
Are you messing with me on purpose?

273
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:51,159
Gosh. I apologize.

274
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:53,402
I'll be careful next time.

275
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:56,739
Hey!

276
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:02,769
You're laughing when I'm talking to you?

277
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:05,859
I heard you made a deal with my father using me.

278
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,089
You're making quite the scene thinking he's got your back.

279
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:14,429
Is it because you were born as a low-life?

280
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,159
You must've had a hard time...

281
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:20,349
being raised...

282
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:22,669
under a mother who's not quite a mother.

283
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:25,649
- Please cut it out. 
 - From the way I see it...

284
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:28,069
you take after your mom, Attorney.

285
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:31,649
- I heard your mom was the same. Sticking to this man and the other— 
 - I said to stop.

286
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:34,309
You should be the one to stop it.

287
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,269
Do you know... the difference between you and me?

288
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,969
Is that I'm allowed to do this.

289
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,479
Hey...

290
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:11,849
I got smacked in the face because of you.

291
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:14,089
Do you understand what I'm saying?

292
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:17,469
Because of a low-life jurk like you...

293
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:19,199
the son of a bar hostess,

294
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:22,318
I was smacked by Father, you punk!

295
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,029
Well...

296
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:33,509
what brings you here, Prosecutor?

297
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,639
I had something to say.

298
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:37,519
Please take your leave...

299
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,799
or you can come with me to the Prosecution right now.

300
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:54,279
Gosh, it must hurt.

301
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,839
Are you okay?

302
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,969
Just tell me what you want.

303
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:00,669
Memory card.

304
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:05,559
I know you have it. That's why I'm here.

305
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:07,239
Let's keep things easy.

306
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:10,159
Why do you want that all of a sudden?

307
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:12,469
I'm going to catch him.

308
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:14,539
Do I need a different reason?

309
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,692
I could just arrest you for allegations of destruction of evidence, Oh Do Hwan.

310
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:20,432
Bring it to me before that.

311
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:27,859
If you need it that badly...

312
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,899
The proof was filmed very well.

313
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:38,899
What?

314
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:41,079
Am I handing it over too easily?

315
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:43,519
It's simple.

316
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,369
Don't think too hard about it.

317
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:48,919
I don't need it anymore and

318
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:51,549
you need it now.

319
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:54,559
Cut the crap and say the real reason.

320
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:58,499
Because he crossed the line.

321
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,189
This is the end of what I can do for you.

322
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,769
Good luck with the rest.

323
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:45,899
 There was one more guy on that day who came to Ye Young's house.

324
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:47,179
 A fidget spinner?

325
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:51,819
 Yes! T-The thing that kids spin on their hands.

326
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:53,999
 A fidget spinner.

327
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:57,579
 You didn't see the culprit's face?

328
00:22:57,579 --> 00:22:58,879
 What about his voice?

329
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:02,889
 He had a mid-to-low tone and a soft voice.

330
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:07,009
Why did Oh Do Hwan willingly hand this over?

331
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:10,369
He never moves without a purpose.

332
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:18,059
 I got smacked in the face because of you.

333
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,369
 Do you understand what I'm saying?

334
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,749
We'll know when we catch the culprit.

335
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:27,069
Do you have an idea as to who?

336
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,829
- Yes, Prosecutor. 
 - Yes.

337
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:42,129
Attorney Seo Ji Han of Law Firm Kangsan...

338
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,409
Find out everything about him as soon as possible.

339
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:47,409
 Okay, got it.

340
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:17,369

341
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:23,819

342
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:41,009

343
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:48,859
Hurry up. We don't have time.

344
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:50,769
Stay put for a second.

345
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:54,219
Stuff like this get harder the more

346
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:56,619
you rush me.

347
00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:00,049
 I'm not even a locksmith.

348
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:02,929
 What the hell am I doing?

349
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:04,899
 He's coming.

350
00:25:09,629 --> 00:25:11,569
Damn it, what do we do?

351
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:12,759
What do you mean?

352
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,059
What else? Go stop him.

353
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,219
Make some time for me, all right?

354
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,169
How?

355
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:20,439
Gosh, you're driving me nuts.

356
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,679
Just stop him!

357
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,059
 Hey...

358
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:24,579
use your honey trap.

359
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:26,449
Just go at him.

360
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:28,799
Honey trap...

361
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:48,799
What's the matter?

362
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:56,309
I must've gotten the wrong person...

363
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,079

364
00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:20,909
Killing a person by beating her on the head with a knife rack...

365
00:27:22,236 --> 00:27:24,309
It's not easy to kill with just one blow.

366
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,229
Just as the autopsy report said,

367
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,799
he beat the victim at least a few times...

368
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,329
even after the victim died.

369
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:38,939
 While committing murder, he must also...

370
00:27:38,939 --> 00:27:41,609

have injured his hand.

371
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:43,119
 Check the list of all the ER patients

372
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,729
 on the day of the incident from all the hospitals

373
00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:50,139
 within a 5km radius of the scene.

374
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:53,002
I'm Prosecutor Shin Ah Ra from the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

375
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:56,272
Please cooperate with us regarding an investigation.

376
00:27:57,786 --> 00:28:01,679
Collect all the patient lists with a hand injury.

377
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,599
I'm sure Seo Ji Han will be among them for sure.

378
00:28:06,209 --> 00:28:07,879
Okay.

379
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:15,759
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

380
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,519
My head... What's wrong with me?

381
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:19,389
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm sorry...

382
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:21,699
I have sickle cell anemia.

383
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,939
Thank you so much.

384
00:28:22,939 --> 00:28:26,079
- Please look at me. 
 - You're so kind.

385
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,119
Could I be hospitalized?

386
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:46,570

387
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:02,220

388
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:14,649

Seo Ji Han!

389
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,229
Wait a minute.

390
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:37,319
The guy in the dashcam footage was wearing the same clothes.

391
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:40,311
If all of this is a coincidence, we can't do our job.

392
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:43,071
I'll ask for the arrest warrant for Seo Ji Han.

393
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,039
We got this bastard.

394
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:00,139
The prosecutor is acting cute.

395
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:15,139
Yes, it's me. CEO Seo.

396
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:33,120
♫  The sound of children playing  ♫

397
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:39,819
♫  The school grounds around dinnertime  ♫

398
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:46,919
♫  Tinged by the sunlight that is regretfully left behind  ♫

399
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,769
 I'm sick of this.

400
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:50,799
 It's always the same song.

401
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,299
 Can't we listen to something else?

402
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:55,249
 You don't know how to appreciate good music.

403
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:58,239
 Listen carefully to the lyrics. They're so touching.

404
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,549
 I like cartoon songs more.

405
00:31:02,229 --> 00:31:04,359
 You said you could put a lot of songs in here.

406
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:06,449
 Can't you also put the songs I like in here?

407
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:08,659
 I can't. It's daddy's.

408
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,169
 Whoa, you're so petty.

409
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:15,179
 Okay then.

410
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:18,469
 If you win first place at the dictation test this time—

411
00:31:20,689 --> 00:31:22,329

412
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:23,689
 Where are you?

413
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:25,949
 Mommy seems to be mad.

414
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:28,749
 She becomes King Kong when she's mad.

415
00:31:28,749 --> 00:31:32,559
 - Hey... let's go before she becomes King Kong. 
 - Let's hurry.

416
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,270
 Gosh...

417
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:41,929
♫  Do you think of me sometimes?  ♫

418
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:51,969
♫  The shy fluttering that I had felt for the first time  ♫

419
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:55,629
♫  Even now...  ♫

420
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:03,839
I used to come here often with my father.

421
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,929
We came to slack off, so we didn't have to help Mom out.

422
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:11,229
Your mom must've had it rough.

423
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:15,869
Mister...

424
00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:20,849
the reporter you mentioned last time...

425
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:25,079
The owner of this thing...

426
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:28,139
It was my father, wasn't it?

427
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:37,249
 A defect?

428
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,019
 There's something like that.

429
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:41,609

430
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:46,409
 Yes, Reporter Jin.

431
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,869
 It's me, Prosecutor.

432
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,982
 Seo Hyeon Gyu?

433
00:32:55,982 --> 00:32:57,732
Jung...

434
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:02,039
you should stop here now.

435
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:05,239
You're at it again.

436
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:07,249
You might experience what I went through.

437
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:09,769
Then you'll regret it for life.

438
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:15,979
You owe me one life, you know?

439
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:19,549
Couldn't you just stay out and call it even with that?

440
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:21,849
About what happened to your mother...

441
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:23,919
It won't end with a warning next time.

442
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,999
Do you plan not to listen—

443
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:31,889
- I'm a dog barking at a deaf tree. 
 - What did you say?

444
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:34,099
- What? 
 - What did you say?

445
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:38,089
Nothing. It's my bad.

446
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:42,619
You can only choose between these two options.

447
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:46,609
You can do it with me or leave everything to me.

448
00:33:47,689 --> 00:33:50,339
Also, I'm not going to lose anyone this time.

449
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:52,159
I'm going to catch him before I do.

450
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:54,689
What?

451
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:58,419
"Based on the collected evidence and the record of evidence collecting status,

452
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:02,959
factual evidence is lacking to admit the cause and need for the arrest warrant

453
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:05,749
as per requested by the Prosecution."

454
00:34:05,749 --> 00:34:07,389
That's what it says.

455
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,709
What kind of crap is this?

456
00:34:10,709 --> 00:34:12,939

457
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:22,629
Exactly why can't you issue the warrant—

458
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,669
It's a hearty harvest.

459
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:31,229
A hearty harvest of bullshit, both of you—

460
00:34:31,229 --> 00:34:33,449
Hey, Prosecutor Jin.

461
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:35,399
How dare you talk that way? How rude!

462
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:38,239
Cut the nonsense.

463
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,079
Was this the reason for rejecting warrant issuance?

464
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,899
Let's grab some food next time.

465
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:45,969
Please take care.

466
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:04,789
Mr. Seo Hyeon Gyu.

467
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:10,799
Your gift was well received.

468
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:11,939
I'm glad.

469
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:14,139
Did your mother like it?

470
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:16,249
I'll pay you back soon...

471
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:18,769
because I can't stand owing someone.

472
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:20,189
Sure.

473
00:35:20,189 --> 00:35:22,079
I'll be off then.

474
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:28,389
I'm not done talking.

475
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:30,589
I promise you.

476
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:33,359
I'm going to get you locked up, no matter what.

477
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,109
You can't even get a mere warrant issued.

478
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:42,229
Let me give you a piece of advice.

479
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:47,189
If I get serious about stopping you, Prosecutor...

480
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:50,889
you'll really die.

481
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:56,589
It's so weird.

482
00:35:56,589 --> 00:36:01,199
It's not the case in other countries, but Lady Justice's eyes are blindfolded only in Korea.

483
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,319
Do you know why that is?

484
00:36:06,529 --> 00:36:10,579
It's saying they should give sentences according to the person.

485
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:15,909
Also, the thing at the bottom. Do you know what that is?

486
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:21,219
People think it's the book of the law, but it isn't.

487
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,689
It's the list of names of powerful people.

488
00:36:26,549 --> 00:36:28,319
That's funny.

489
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,749
What number are you on the list?

490
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,299
I'm the one who writes the list.

491
00:36:41,169 --> 00:36:43,419
Attorney Oh...

492
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:45,159
Yes, CEO.

493
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:49,349
Is there something you know?

494
00:36:50,379 --> 00:36:54,699
About how Prosecutor Jin was able to apply for a warrant.

495
00:36:54,699 --> 00:36:57,469
If he did indeed apply for a warrant,

496
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:01,009
then it means he has a card up his sleeve.

497
00:37:02,779 --> 00:37:05,749
But I just can't figure out what it is.

498
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:12,529
A person named Yoo Jin Chul gave me the memory card.

499
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:15,879
I think that person must've had a copy.

500
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:18,239
Oh, my.

501
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,179
Why didn't you check when you were getting it from him?

502
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:24,299
I apologize.

503
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:27,339
Please be more careful from now on.

504
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:28,809
Yes, Sir.

505
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:38,109
I can't even fathom how deeply rotten this is.

506
00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:40,829
It'll never end...

507
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:43,469
unless we remove the root itself.

508
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,609
We need the herbicide, but there's no way.

509
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:51,319
Wouldn't something fall from the sky at a time like this?

510
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:55,339
There must be a way, whether it's a hoe or a pesticide.

511
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:57,919
Let's not give up and keep looking.

512
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:59,502
Who said I'm giving up?

513
00:37:59,502 --> 00:38:01,892
I'm just saying that's how things are.

514
00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:08,599
Yes, Investigator.

515
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,319
No.

516
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:11,599
Just photosynthesizing.

517
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,519
Yes, please go ahead.

518
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,439
What?

519
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:22,899
Yes, Judge.

520
00:38:22,899 --> 00:38:25,589
I mean, we just met. So what's up?

521
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:29,699
I'm sorry, Sir.

522
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:33,419
 I'm so ashamed.

523
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,559
He said the arrest warrant for Seo Ji Han was issued.

524
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:40,169
What?

525
00:38:40,169 --> 00:38:44,889
♫  You forget your true feelings and chase after the traces  ♫

526
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,499
Are you satisfied now?

527
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:49,499
Thank you for the help.

528
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:52,609
The thing you promised?

529
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,530
♫  I like it as it is  ♫

530
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:01,440
♫  Show me who you are now shining brightly  ♫

531
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,990
Good going.

532
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:07,369
A so-called judge having an affair.

533
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:11,879
Love... isn't a sin, is it?

534
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,209
Bullshit.

535
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:18,059
Your existence itself is a sin.

536
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:25,449
♫  Beautifully shining little star  ♫

537
00:39:28,469 --> 00:39:31,569
Thank you for helping out.

538
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:39,109
Jae Kyung...

539
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:42,459
I trust you.

540
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:48,279
Don't worry.

541
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:51,469
I won't make the same mistake and, this time...

542
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:54,879
there's a failproof card to catch that guy.

543
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:56,689
MP3?

544
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,419
Would it be enough with just that?

545
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:08,159
You know full well what kind of person Seo Hyeon Gyu is.

546
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:11,429
It'll be hard with just that alone.

547
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:17,699
It sounds to me...

548
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:20,659
like there's more stuff.

549
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:23,949
Something more substantial than the MP3?

550
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:31,149

551
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,229
What is this about?

552
00:40:44,229 --> 00:40:46,829
Gosh, these punks...

553
00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:49,269
The audacity of these guys...

554
00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:51,669
Do you even know who we are?

555
00:40:51,669 --> 00:40:53,999
We're the Prosecution, you punks!

556
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:55,519
Hey, Eun Ji.

557
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,549
Make them quiet.

558
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:01,769
I'm here to meet Seo Ji Han.

559
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:03,689

This is the arrest warrant for Seo Ji Han.

560
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:05,509
Please cooperate.

561
00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:07,699
One moment, please.

562
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,789
- Contact Attorney Seo. 
 - I got it.

563
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:12,249
Wait. One second. What are you going to do?

564
00:41:12,249 --> 00:41:14,239
Contact him?

565
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,539
You think we're here to escort him?

566
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:20,149
If you guys keep this up, it's an—

567
00:41:20,149 --> 00:41:21,509
It's an...

568
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:25,999
Move out!

569
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:28,059
I told you to wait here.

570
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:30,199
We're the Prosecution. The Prosecution!

571
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,969
- Move out! 
 - This guy, seriously...

572
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:33,439
I said to move—

573
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:34,669
Hey, let's break through.

574
00:41:34,669 --> 00:41:36,279
 Stop him!

575
00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:38,029
 Move out, move out!

576
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,229
E-Everyone, we have an arrest warrant!

577
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:41,339
We have an arrest warrant!

578
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:43,679
 - Move aside! 
 - Wait, wait.

579
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,649
 Hold them off!

580
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,880
 Come on now! Let go!

581
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:53,809
What do we do, Father?

582
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:56,179
They're right below, on the first floor.

583
00:41:56,179 --> 00:42:01,199
So why did you... do something stupid like that?

584
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,249
If you were going to do it, then don't get caught.

585
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:18,869
Go and suffer just a little bit.

586
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:21,869
Father...

587
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:27,299
No father in this world abandons his son.

588
00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:29,559
You're my son and...

589
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:33,269
the next CEO of Kangsan.

590
00:42:34,939 --> 00:42:39,209
Don't worry and trust me.

591
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:48,279
What the heck? You didn't run away yet.

592
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:49,499
You should've run away.

593
00:42:49,499 --> 00:42:52,309
I wanted to beat you up while catching you.

594
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:55,399
Is that something a prosecutor should say?

595
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:57,969
Let's go. You need to serve some time.

596
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,329
Let go.

597
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:10,379
I'll go on my own feet.

598
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,579
What is this jurk saying?

599
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:18,039
Take him.

600
00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:24,179
You're next in line.

601
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:39,159

602
00:43:42,249 --> 00:43:44,079
He won't talk.

603
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,249
It's not going to be easy.

604
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:51,549
To apply for the restriction warrant, we need one more thing whether it be evidence or a confession.

605
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:54,779
Our goal is Seo Hyeon Gyu, anyway.

606
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:58,409
If we just unlock the MP3, Seo Hyeon Gyu and Seo Ji Han...

607
00:43:58,409 --> 00:44:02,112
We'll be able to put them away for sure.

608
00:44:02,112 --> 00:44:06,042
That was his reason for committing murder in the first place.

609
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:09,469
We don't have time.

610
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:12,869
We need to hurry up and unlock it. Any luck with the password?

611
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,659
 Dad's password?

612
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:22,299
 Yes. I thought you might know something.

613
00:44:22,299 --> 00:44:24,369
 Maybe a number he used often?

614
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:29,209
I don't know exactly, but... this is for sure.

615
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:31,509
- Our family members' birthdays. 
 - Birthdays?

616
00:44:31,509 --> 00:44:35,429
 He was such a busy guy, you know.

617
00:44:35,429 --> 00:44:39,979
One time, he kept forgetting our birthdays, so

618
00:44:39,979 --> 00:44:45,269
I told him to use our birthdays for passwords from then on.

619
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:48,269
He didn't forget again after that.

620
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,709
 But why do you ask?

621
00:44:49,709 --> 00:44:51,599
No, I just got curious suddenly.

622
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,219
I'll see you later.

623
00:44:58,689 --> 00:45:00,639

624
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:03,509

625
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:20,299
My birthday...

626
00:45:22,909 --> 00:45:28,459

627
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:37,359

628
00:45:42,169 --> 00:45:44,519

629
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,259
Mom's birthday?

630
00:45:58,919 --> 00:46:00,589

631
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:02,399
Gosh... damn it!

632
00:46:04,752 --> 00:46:07,582

633
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,259
Coco...what are you biting on now?

634
00:46:18,259 --> 00:46:22,069
I told you not to eat random things.

635
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:25,529
Why are you chewing the motorcycle key?

636
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,309
 Will it be okay?

637
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:38,169
 What?

638
00:46:38,169 --> 00:46:42,249
 You're buying... this without letting Mom know.

639
00:46:42,249 --> 00:46:43,979
 Sometimes, asking for forgiveness

640
00:46:43,979 --> 00:46:46,839
 is easier than asking for permission.

641
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:48,699
 Remember today, my son.

642
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:53,539
 Today... marks the day men's dreams came true and

643
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:56,019
 the day of accepting a new member into our family.

644
00:46:56,999 --> 00:46:59,409
 The birthday of Elly.

645
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:01,149
 It's a foreign name.

646
00:47:01,149 --> 00:47:03,239
 Yes, she's from Germany.

647
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:05,479
 Guten Tag. Dokgo Tak. 
 (T/N "Good day" in German, Name of a Korean cartoon character)

648
00:47:05,479 --> 00:47:07,439
 Madong Tak. 
 (T/N: Name of a Korean comic character)

649
00:47:07,439 --> 00:47:09,239
 - Dad... 
 - Yes?

650
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:12,439
 Don't say that stuff in front of Mom.

651
00:47:12,439 --> 00:47:13,779
 Okay.

652
00:47:14,419 --> 00:47:19,479
 Well... everything works out if you're handsome.

653
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:30,949

654
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:45,309
It worked.

655
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:47,029
It worked!

656
00:47:51,279 --> 00:47:53,909
Father... this is a bit...

657
00:48:10,469 --> 00:48:12,979
Hey, aren't you going home?

658
00:48:12,979 --> 00:48:15,469
You won't get paid for overtime even if you do that.

659
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,009
Mister...

660
00:48:20,499 --> 00:48:22,849
I unlocked my dad's password.

661
00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:27,689
Take a look.

662
00:48:33,149 --> 00:48:35,909
 Do you come to the theater often?

663
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:37,329
 Not often.

664
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:40,439
 But I do come with my wife and son sometimes.

665
00:48:40,439 --> 00:48:42,359
 What about you, Executive Director?

666
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:46,499
 Why did you call us here?

667
00:48:46,499 --> 00:48:49,409
 You're quite impatient, Executive Director.

668
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:54,042
 About your company's humidifier disinfectant...

669
00:48:54,042 --> 00:48:57,852
 I think you two will have to take the blame for it.

670
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,069
 I noticed that you two did a great job raising your children.

671
00:49:03,069 --> 00:49:05,339
 Do your children know that, though?

672
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:07,689
 How you two merrily failed in a futures contract and

673
00:49:07,689 --> 00:49:10,429
 your houses are about to be levied now.

674
00:49:10,429 --> 00:49:12,229
 How do you know that, Attorney?

675
00:49:12,229 --> 00:49:15,389
 What do you mean, how do I know that?

676
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:16,939
 Because the one who gave me this job...

677
00:49:16,939 --> 00:49:20,539
 your chairman, told me. That's how I know.

678
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:39,839
 This is a good opportunity for you two, so

679
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,189
 please make a good decision.

680
00:49:42,189 --> 00:49:45,309
 And what if we refuse?

681
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:52,069
 Well... I didn't think that far.

682
00:49:53,149 --> 00:49:55,179
 I guess...

683
00:49:55,179 --> 00:49:58,839
 I'll find someone else.

684
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:02,049
 We do need someone to take responsibility.

685
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:08,239
 Honestly, though, that's too much of a hassle for me.

686
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:11,129
 Why don't you just say yes?

687
00:50:16,829 --> 00:50:20,149
 I'm sorry, but I don't think this is right.

688
00:50:20,149 --> 00:50:23,449
 I can't be imprisoned for something I didn't do.

689
00:50:23,449 --> 00:50:25,379
 I'd rather be an incompetent father

690
00:50:25,379 --> 00:50:28,519
 than to be a cowardly one.

691
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:34,549
 Okay then.

692
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,209
 If that's how you feel...

693
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:40,639
 Please don't come to me to talk about things like this ever again.

694
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:42,859
 I'll be off now.

695
00:50:42,859 --> 00:50:43,909
 What the heck? Let go.

696
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:46,279
 Let go! Let me go!

697
00:50:46,279 --> 00:50:48,099
 I said, let me go!

698
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:49,319
 What is this?

699
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:51,589
 Let me go, I said!

700
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:53,169
 Let go!

701
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:10,029
 Well, Manager Jo. So...

702
00:51:10,029 --> 00:51:11,709
 have you made up your mind?

703
00:51:11,709 --> 00:51:14,699
 Y-Yes. Yes, I did.

704
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:36,827

705
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:40,207
There was a reason Seo Hyeon Gyu was dying to find this.

706
00:51:44,939 --> 00:51:46,589
Prosecutor Jin.

707
00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:47,919
Yes?

708
00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:51,439
Stay out of this.

709
00:51:52,979 --> 00:51:54,799
This was my case from the beginning.

710
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:57,739
Hand over the MP3 to me and take your hands off of it.

711
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,739
We already said we'd do this together.

712
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:08,849
- This is enough to handcuff him— 
 - Listen to my order.

713
00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:10,099
I'm your superior.

714
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:11,509
This isn't that kind of a matter.

715
00:52:11,509 --> 00:52:13,009
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

716
00:52:13,009 --> 00:52:14,859
Did you get scared after watching the video or something?

717
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:17,979
Yes. I got scared.

718
00:52:20,389 --> 00:52:21,489
Leave.

719
00:52:21,489 --> 00:52:24,159
What's the matter? Really!

720
00:52:29,909 --> 00:52:32,229
Do you think this is a joke?

721
00:52:34,529 --> 00:52:38,049
You told me that... you don't want to lose anyone.

722
00:52:38,049 --> 00:52:40,439
I feel the same way.

723
00:52:40,439 --> 00:52:42,559
I can't stand to see that happen again.

724
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,999
So, Jung, trust me and

725
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:47,610
you stay out of this. Okay?

726
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:53,609
I'm glad... that we're on the same page.

727
00:52:53,609 --> 00:52:55,309
I also can't stand by

728
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:57,179
and watch something terrible happen to you.

729
00:52:58,569 --> 00:53:00,239
So let's do this together.

730
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:03,279
They say to carry a burden together.

731
00:53:03,279 --> 00:53:05,759
Why are you trying to keep carrying it alone?

732
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:10,259
Don't ever say you'll do it alone.

733
00:53:10,259 --> 00:53:11,609
Just say it one more time.

734
00:53:11,609 --> 00:53:14,069
I'm going to take you out of the case.

735
00:53:20,259 --> 00:53:22,799
He thinks he's the boss around here.

736
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:32,609
What's that?

737
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:37,299
It's my mom's birthday.

738
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:43,879
Go to your mom.

739
00:53:43,879 --> 00:53:47,209
Go where? We've got so much work to do.

740
00:53:47,209 --> 00:53:49,999
You said it's her birthday. It only comes around once a year.

741
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:53,769
She's not feeling well. How sad would she be if you didn't celebrate her birthday?

742
00:53:54,986 --> 00:53:58,269
The world won't end just because you take a break for a day.

743
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:02,669
Also... tell her you love her...

744
00:54:02,669 --> 00:54:05,079
while you help her recover from her injuries.

745
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:07,609
I regret that the most.

746
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,539
I'll be going, then.

747
00:54:25,539 --> 00:54:27,139
It's really a promise, okay?

748
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:29,039
Don't try to do anything alone.

749
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:30,709
Okay, okay.

750
00:54:30,709 --> 00:54:34,649
You're taking the MP3, too. What can I do?

751
00:54:34,649 --> 00:54:37,529
Hurry up and go. Your mom must be waiting.

752
00:54:37,529 --> 00:54:39,829
Okay. Oh, right...

753
00:54:40,899 --> 00:54:43,879
Thank you for the arrest warrant on Seo Ji Han.

754
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:46,029
I don't know what you're talking about.

755
00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:49,809
Never mind, then. I'll be going.

756
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:51,289
Hey, Prosecutor Jin.

757
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,579
We've got tons of work to do starting tomorrow. Don't be late.

758
00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:57,119
Don't be late yourself.

759
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,899
It looks like Son Heung Min has a game tonight.

760
00:55:00,899 --> 00:55:02,819
I'll only watch the first half.

761
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:05,279
Call me if he makes a goal.

762
00:55:05,279 --> 00:55:06,940
I'm going.

763
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,809
Yes, CEO Seo?

764
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:41,149
The item you were looking for...

765
00:55:41,149 --> 00:55:43,119
I have it.

766
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,889
Come and get it.

767
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:56,459
♪ Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you ♪

768
00:56:56,459 --> 00:57:01,259
♪ Happy Birthday dear Mrs. Lim ♪

769
00:57:01,259 --> 00:57:05,369
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

770
00:57:06,649 --> 00:57:09,946
- You saw that, right? 
 - Congratulations!

771
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:12,889
Why ask me to sing a song? Hurry up and blow it out.

772
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:16,819
You're getting the checkup tomorrow, okay?

773
00:57:16,819 --> 00:57:19,549
Okay. Thank you, Son.

774
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:22,989
How is it that your son is such a good singer?

775
00:57:22,989 --> 00:57:25,149
- Thank you. 
 - Is he a singer?

776
00:57:25,149 --> 00:57:27,969
Gosh, he's not just good at singing.

777
00:57:27,969 --> 00:57:32,099
He's also good at studying and sports.

778
00:57:33,939 --> 00:57:36,369
My son is a prosecutor.

779
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,989
- Oh, my gosh! 
 - A prosecutor? My goodness!

780
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:40,999
- He's a prosecutor? 
 - I'm so envious!

781
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,869
- He's so handsome. 
 - Also a good singer...

782
00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:46,769
I'd love a son-in-law like him.

783
00:57:46,769 --> 00:57:49,039
I have to answer this call. I'll be right back.

784
00:57:51,949 --> 00:57:53,439
Hello?

785
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:08,290

 You did well. We're now accomplices.

821
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:19,529
 How dare you come here?

822
01:00:19,529 --> 01:00:21,059
 May the deceased rest in peace.

823
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:22,169
 I'll never forgive you.

824
01:00:22,169 --> 01:00:24,659
 Prosecutor Jin seems to have found a clue on the case.

825
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:25,889
 He has a helper?

826
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:27,229
 Tell this to your father clearly.

827
01:00:27,229 --> 01:00:28,949
 I have the evidence of him committing murder.

828
01:00:28,949 --> 01:00:32,899
 Your needless arbitrary actions and pride drove Jae Kyung to death.

829
01:00:32,899 --> 01:00:35,229
 I'm getting curious at this point.

830
01:00:35,229 --> 01:00:38,559
 What drove you to this point, Prosecutor Jin?

831
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:39,889
 My family upbringing.

832
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:43,300
♫  Now you gotta know, yeah you gotta know  ♫
