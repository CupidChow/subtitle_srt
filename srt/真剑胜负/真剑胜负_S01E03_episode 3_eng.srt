1
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:38,497

2
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:40,577
Hey!

3
00:00:40,577 --> 00:00:41,877
Yoo Jin Chul!

4
00:00:41,877 --> 00:00:43,697
There's no point in fighting. It's over!

5
00:00:43,697 --> 00:00:45,797
I'm not kidding. She'll die.

6
00:00:45,797 --> 00:00:47,217
I'll kill her!

7
00:00:47,217 --> 00:00:48,437
Don't come here!

8
00:00:48,437 --> 00:00:49,707
You're in serious trouble!

9
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:50,927
Don't come here.

10
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:52,297
Don't come here!

11
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:56,467
That fellow is really angry right now.

12
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,527
Damn it...

13
00:01:05,087 --> 00:01:07,007
Seriously...

14
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:08,347
Damn it.

15
00:01:08,347 --> 00:01:10,737
You don't just want to get arrested, right?

16
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,787
Let's do it just once.

17
00:01:12,787 --> 00:01:15,377
Okay, you punk. You're dead!

18
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:18,877
You bastard!

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:28,930

20
00:01:33,617 --> 00:01:34,997
Give me that!

21
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:37,437
Come here, come here!

22
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:38,917
You...

23
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:07,027
Shit...

24
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:11,457
Last digits 0070. That's your phone number, right?

25
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:14,367
Your timing is meticulous.

26
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,380
You're going to have to come with us.

27
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,860
 Why are they taking him?

28
00:02:20,197 --> 00:02:22,787
 Wait, he's not the bad guy.

29
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:28,183
 What the hell?

30
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:30,333
 What is this?

31
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,673

32
00:02:32,673 --> 00:02:36,266
Which card should I play?

33
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:38,956
Here I go.

34
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,673
Right, it's a great play!

35
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:45,153
I stop here. I'm stopping.

36
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,043
I did one shaking, three Go's, Kante...

37
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:53,653
you're Gwang-bak 
  (T/N: A player with Gwang-bak gets his penalty doubled)

38
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:55,823
and Etu, you're pi-bak.
  (T/N: A player with pi-bak gets his penalty doubled)

39
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:57,053
Yes...

40
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:58,933
So it's 10 won per point and

41
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:01,553
three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

42
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:03,263
What the hell!

43
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:06,073
Kante and Etu, you two leave.

44
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:09,023
- Thank you. 
 - I love you.

45
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:12,213
You're seriously...

46
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:18,713
What about Yoo Jin Chul?

47
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:21,313
I left him where you told me to.

48
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:29,883
I must've been mad.

49
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:32,813
How could I agree to work with a person like you?

50
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:39,923
Okay, with all things aside,

51
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:42,823
let's say it's fine since we got Yoo Jin Chul.

52
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,093
What are you going to do?

53
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:48,473
Tomorrow is the inauguration. I have to get out somehow.

54
00:03:48,473 --> 00:03:50,143
So how, exactly?

55
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:52,063
You're going straight to the Incheon Prosecutors' Office from here.

56
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:53,483
How can you get out, and with what measure?

57
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,823
What's wrong with you again, Sunbae?

58
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:58,483
I have my methods.

59
00:03:58,483 --> 00:04:00,063
The thing I asked you for?

60
00:04:08,753 --> 00:04:11,503
What time is the inauguration tomorrow again?

61
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:15,283
At 11 a.m. Why...

62
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:19,683
Why?

63
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:23,273
It's nothing.

64
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:27,043

65
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:41,983
 We have the transportation vehicle ready.

66
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:47,633

67
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,713
W-Wait.

68
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:52,313
Let me use the restroom for a second.

69
00:04:52,313 --> 00:04:55,083
Use it later. We'll be at the Incheon Prosecutors' Office in no time.

70
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,833
I was going to hold it as much as I could, but

71
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,603
it's really bad. Seriously, I need to go.

72
00:05:00,603 --> 00:05:03,243
This is a disaster... w-wait, it's coming out!

73
00:05:03,243 --> 00:05:05,363
Wait, wait...

74
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:07,703
It's about to come out!

75
00:05:07,703 --> 00:05:10,643
My stomach hurts so much...

76
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:13,923
Hurry up now.

77
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:18,103
 It's the last booth, number six.

78
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:20,643

79
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:23,773
Gosh, it's coming soon, very soon.

80
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:25,533
Hurry, hurry.

81
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,383
The last one. I'm a shy pooper.

82
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:32,233
Hurry up, no one's there.

83
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,343
My stomach...

84
00:05:44,183 --> 00:05:47,083
Why does my stomach hurt so much?

85
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:54,893
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

86
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:56,953
My goodness...

87
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,803
I didn't know that we'd have to do this sort of stuff, too...

88
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:07,483
Escorting to the toilet...

89
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:09,523
Seriously, Sir...

90
00:06:12,593 --> 00:06:14,373
You know, I was called into the office the other day.

91
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,443
The superior was talking

92
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:20,743
about transferring me to the rural area, right?

93
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:22,943
- Transferring? 
 - Yeah, I was like...

94
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:26,123
Stomach virus, stomach virus.

95
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:27,683
I think it's a stomach virus.

96
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:32,973
I was trying to avoid it, and

97
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:35,013
he kept talking about it.

98
00:06:40,623 --> 00:06:42,513
I don't really know much about that.

99
00:06:59,663 --> 00:07:00,993
Excuse me.

100
00:07:00,993 --> 00:07:04,753
It's been a while, so come out now.

101
00:07:04,753 --> 00:07:06,113
Hello?

102
00:07:08,563 --> 00:07:11,423
Why are you not answering?

103
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,723
Shit.

104
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:20,933
Damn it!

105
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,693
Why?

106
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,863
- He escaped! 
 - Damn it!

107
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:26,573
Darn it!

108
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:10,543
What the hell?

109
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:16,743
Where did he go? Crap!

110
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:36,713

111
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:40,273
 Hey, Chul Ki, this is not a mistake, right?

112
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:44,913
 But, what if you're not the culprit?

113
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:50,413
 August 12? The date of Park Ye Young's death?

114
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:53,413
 The last person to meet the victim on the day of the crime.

115
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:56,783
 The most suspected culprit right now, who most likely had killed Park Ye Young.

116
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:02,513
 How dare a rotten apple spoil the entire barrel! Where do you think you are?

117
00:09:02,513 --> 00:09:05,183
 Take your hands off the case right now.

118
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:08,033
 What time is the inauguration tomorrow again?

119
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,263
 At 11 a.m.

120
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:11,483

121
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,783

122
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:19,903

123
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:26,883

124
00:09:36,523 --> 00:09:40,603
Inauguration my ass, attention everyone...

125
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:42,503
What's this?

126
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:45,483
- Ma'am, the inauguration here today... 
 - Gosh.

127
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:47,743
You must've missed the announcement.

128
00:09:47,743 --> 00:09:49,526
It was postponed by one hour.

129
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:50,786
Sorry?

130
00:09:59,603 --> 00:10:03,003

131
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,733
I came too early.

132
00:10:17,923 --> 00:10:20,673
I promise my family members here.

133
00:10:20,673 --> 00:10:22,713
From now on, the Prosector's Office...

134
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:25,053
 will be trusted by the people of the country.

135
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:28,833
 We won't obey the power, and we'll draw the sword to fight the power.

136
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,933
 I promise you that we'll be honest and upright,

137
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:33,753
 from now on...

138
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,890
 What's going on?

139
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,543
 What happened?

140
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:47,143
I'm so achy because I was hiding down here.

141
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:49,183
 Just stay there.

142
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:55,923
 Hello, reporters and prosecutors.

143
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,673
 I'm Jin Jung.

144
00:10:58,383 --> 00:10:59,863
Why is he coming out from there?

145
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:03,173
They destroyed evidence that proved someone's innocence and manipulated a case.

146
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:06,393
And they closed the case the way they liked.

147
00:11:06,393 --> 00:11:09,613
It wasn't done by anyone else.

148
00:11:09,613 --> 00:11:16,143
But it was done by the best legal office in the country, the prosecution.

149
00:11:16,723 --> 00:11:18,593
 Take a good look, everyone.

150
00:11:23,773 --> 00:11:26,053
What the hell are you doing right now?

151
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,683
Lee Jang Won,

152
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:32,593
you're under arrest as the key suspect in Seocho-dong Murder case.

153
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:36,383
Congratulations.

154
00:11:36,383 --> 00:11:38,373
You're done now.

155
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,923
Prosecutor Jin.

156
00:11:42,923 --> 00:11:44,033
Yes?

157
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:47,763
You just said that Chief Lee Jang Won is the suspect in the Seocho-dong murder case,

158
00:11:47,763 --> 00:11:49,653
but do you have any evidence to back up your claim?

159
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:51,053
Yes.

160
00:11:51,053 --> 00:11:53,103
He's on his way right now...

161
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:55,433
The core reference witness of the case.

162
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:58,593
How long will it take?

163
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,623
I'll hurry as much as I can.

164
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:08,733
Yoo Jin Chul will be coming, so stop him right now.

165
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,203
Okay, understood.

166
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:11,683
Follow me.

167
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:21,303
What's the matter?

168
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:24,123
We'll be checking your back seat for a minute.

169
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:27,233
What authority do you have to do this?

170
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:29,503
Hey, open it.

171
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:31,493
Open it right now!

172
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:36,823
When is the core reference witness coming?

173
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,693
What? He should be almost here.

174
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:40,233
He's almost here.

175
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,003
Come in!

176
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,073
I said to come in.

177
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,323
Just walk off.

178
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:53,683
Yoo Jin Chul is not coming.

179
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:04,023
Please resume.

180
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,343
There was a brief commotion.

181
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:11,393
- Yes. 
  - We'll wrap up soon.

182
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:14,173
This isn't Yoo Jin Chul.

183
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,643
Where is this place? Why did we come here?

184
00:13:20,643 --> 00:13:23,683
- Yes.
  - Going forward, the prosecution will...

185
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:25,403
 not obey the power

186
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:27,753
 and we'll draw the sword to fight the power.

187
00:13:32,663 --> 00:13:34,673
 What's going on?

188
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:42,023
Your manners suck.

189
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:44,443
I didn't even start.

190
00:13:53,593 --> 00:13:56,403
 - H-Hello? 
 - Yes, Jin Chul, it's me.

191
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,063
Can you hear me well?

192
00:13:58,063 --> 00:14:00,703
 Yes, I hear you well, Prosecutor Jin Jung.

193
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,213
These people here don't trust my words.

194
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:05,483
You go ahead and talk for me instead.

195
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:09,013
 Everything that Prosecutor Jin Jung...

196
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:10,853
 said is...

197
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:14,073
 all true and correct.

198
00:14:17,353 --> 00:14:22,693
 The victim of the Seocho-dong murder case is named Park Ye Young.

199
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:27,113
 She was an employee at a hostess bar that I run.

200
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:32,743
 She was... being sponsored by

201
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:34,613
 Prosecutor Lee, who's over there.

202
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:42,483
 On the day of the incident, I witnessed the two together.

203
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:48,523
 I'll... explain more in detail when I'm...

204
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:50,023
 summoned to the prosecution.

205
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,003
Okay, cut!

206
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:56,253
The witness in the footage is currently stored- no...

207
00:14:56,253 --> 00:14:58,163
Protected by me.

208
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,863
Too many people wish him gone.

209
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:07,263
You know, Oh Do Hwan,

210
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:11,043
I decided something after you got to me last time.

211
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:14,413
"I'm never going to fight a losing battle."

212
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:19,023
This is just the beginning for you and me.

213
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:20,773
I look forward to it.

214
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:35,453

215
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:39,503

216
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:41,473

217
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,053
At the inauguration ceremony of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office's Prosecutor General,

218
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:45,603
a shocking scene had played out.

219
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:48,263
Chief Prosecutor Lee Jang Won, who was to take office as the Prosecutor General,

220
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:50,833
became the key suspect in the Seocho-dong murder case.

221
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,943
Prosecutor Jin Jung made a national exposure as he barged into the ceremony,

222
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:55,333
which is an unprecedented event...

223
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:59,633
The Prosecutor General position of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office will remain vacant for a while.

224
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:02,213
Reporter Choi, are you really going to do this?

225
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:06,383
You heard what that bastard did at the airport!

226
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,703
My side is also going to make a statement of rebuttal.

227
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,623
So just hold it off until then-

228
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:13,983
Hello?

229
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:15,733
Reporter Choi!

230
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:22,563
What the hell were you doing, you bastard!

231
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:24,563
My apologies.

232
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:26,203
Apologies?

233
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:30,973
Apologies for causing this ruckus because you failed to do your job?

234
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:32,923
Hey, Oh Do Hwan.

235
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:34,983
Get your act together, you punk.

236
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:37,533
Do you know what guys like you misunderstand?

237
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:40,343
They think all they need to do is hold on tight to the rope of connections!

238
00:16:40,343 --> 00:16:43,263
While not making any efforts themselves!

239
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:47,013
Mark my words, Prosecutor Oh.

240
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:48,583
The rope?

241
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,783
It cuts more easily than you think.

242
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:53,233
A rope isn't for being pulled up!

243
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:55,263
It's for you to climb up!

244
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:57,553
Are you really not the culprit?

245
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:59,253
What?

246
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:03,313
The contents of Prosecutor Jin's claims...

247
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,673
That you're the key suspect who murdered Park Ye Young,

248
00:17:06,673 --> 00:17:09,563
the victim of the Seocho-dong murder case.

249
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,343
It's not too late to say everything was a lie.

250
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:46,673
Then I'll let you keep your job as a prosecutor, at least.

251
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:49,403
- What if I say no? 
 - Violation of the Aviation Law.

252
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,863
You'll be locked up for more than three years.

253
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,383
I'd like you to know that this meeting is the

254
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:57,833
last chance you have, Prosecutor Jin.

255
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,413
Just for your information,

256
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:02,453
we can wrap things up without your cooperation.

257
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:07,163
It's just the easiest and most efficient to have you cooperate.

258
00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:09,993
I have been curious about this thing for some time,

259
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:11,433
but are you not embarrassed?

260
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:14,433
What do you gain from being this loyal to that guy?

261
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:16,013
Going up the ladder?

262
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,603
Is there something up there?

263
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:19,543
Don't be like that, Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan.

264
00:18:19,543 --> 00:18:22,253
The higher you go, the more it hurts when you fall.

265
00:18:28,653 --> 00:18:32,423
Arrest Prosecutor Jin, I'll be in charge myself.

266
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:38,643
Don't be in charge. You don't need to.

267
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,380

268
00:18:44,843 --> 00:18:47,653

269
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,073
Let's go.

270
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:56,743
Bye, bye.

271
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:06,783
I heard Deputy Chief Kim Tae Ho drafted the Abbreviated Indictment for me?

272
00:19:06,783 --> 00:19:08,983
I know. It's a mystery to me, too.

273
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:11,863
As to why he'd cover for you this much.

274
00:19:11,863 --> 00:19:13,933
CEO Kim of Rich Fund also withdrew his case.

275
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:16,323
- Deputy Chief also did that? 
 - Yes.

276
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:19,873
By chance, does he like me?

277
00:19:19,873 --> 00:19:22,493
Stop talking nonsense and owe it up to him.

278
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:25,553
No one but the Deputy Chief takes care of you here.

279
00:19:25,553 --> 00:19:27,483
You do, too, Senior.

280
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:29,503
W-What...

281
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,853
the hell are you saying all of a sudden?

282
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:34,063
Never mind that...

283
00:19:34,063 --> 00:19:35,943
What are you going to do now?

284
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,353
The director.

285
00:19:43,353 --> 00:19:47,113
Oh, it's the Director. I'm S-Shin Ah Ra.

286
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:50,843
Hey, Prosecutor Jin.

287
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:52,573
Yes?

288
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:54,253
Come here for a second.

289
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:11,043
I feel like you've heard this a lot.

290
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,903
"What the heck are you doing?"

291
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:16,873
Yes, I get that a lot.

292
00:20:16,873 --> 00:20:18,883
Exactly.

293
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:20,293
What the heck are you doing?

294
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:23,003
This is not the Criminal Division. It's the Civil Service Division.

295
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:24,943
Why don't you take care of the complaints

296
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:26,393
but discussing an investigation instead?

297
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,713
Please let it go just for today. This is the only place I can do that.

298
00:20:30,383 --> 00:20:32,573
Am I the only one who feels that your story doesn't add up?

299
00:20:32,573 --> 00:20:34,853
I'm saying that the situation is urgent.

300
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:37,213
I'll work two or three times harder.

301
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:39,933
Heck, I'll just live here and not go home. Happy?

302
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,173
No.

303
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,573
I hate that.

304
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:46,033
Get rid of the person inside and get back to work while I go eat.

305
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:47,923
The dog ran away again.

306
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:51,893
Gosh, this is too much.

307
00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:56,003
What kind of a prosecutor are you?

308
00:20:56,953 --> 00:20:59,883
Other prosecutors call me a defect,

309
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:03,243
but I'm not ashamed.

310
00:21:03,243 --> 00:21:05,813
Because I'm honorable to myself.

311
00:21:06,543 --> 00:21:08,673
What about you, Director?

312
00:21:08,673 --> 00:21:11,973
Are you a prosecutor who's honorable to himself?

313
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:14,563
Or have you become a rotten prosecutor

314
00:21:14,563 --> 00:21:16,343
who can't call out something that's wrong,

315
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:18,043
ignoring the injustice in plain sight

316
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,253
only going after one's own benefits

317
00:21:21,253 --> 00:21:23,273
and unable to feel humiliated?

318
00:21:26,863 --> 00:21:29,313
I believe in you, Director.

319
00:21:29,313 --> 00:21:33,583
Although you're filling out ledgers in this run-down building now...

320
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,783
but I've always believed that

321
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:39,283
the firm convictions of fairness, truth,

322
00:21:39,283 --> 00:21:42,803
justice, human rights, and integrity

323
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,443
are dwelling deep in your heart.

324
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:47,113
Prosecutor Jin...

325
00:21:47,113 --> 00:21:48,843
Yes, Director.

326
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:53,193
What the heck are you saying? It's so cringy.

327
00:21:53,193 --> 00:21:56,343
That stuff doesn't work nowadays, man.

328
00:21:56,343 --> 00:21:59,043
You're quite an old soul.

329
00:21:59,043 --> 00:22:00,923
Clean up everything inside, okay?

330
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:06,703
It really doesn't work...

331
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:10,853
Whatever...

332
00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:23,893
 - Are you really not the culprit? 
 - What?

333
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:26,603
 The contents of Prosecutor Jin's claims...

334
00:22:26,603 --> 00:22:29,993
 That you're the key suspect who murdered Park Ye Young,

335
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:32,843
 the victim of the Seocho-dong murder case.

336
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:38,443
 The situation is serious.

337
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:42,513
 Please tell me honestly so that I can help you, Chief.

338
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:55,343
 Take care of Prosecutor Jin first.

339
00:22:55,343 --> 00:22:59,793
 Clean up the situation first... and get rid of Prosecutor Jin.

340
00:23:02,343 --> 00:23:04,803
 Truth comes after that.

341
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:11,933
How annoying.

342
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:19,053
Hey, Kim Tae Ho!

343
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:24,633
Abbreviated Indictment? Fines?

344
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:26,873
Have you lost your mind?

345
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:29,783
I got a call from the Incheon Prosecutors' Office...

346
00:23:30,503 --> 00:23:33,803
that Prosecutor Jin admitted to the charges and is remorseful,

347
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:37,743
and taking into account that most of the nation is supporting him.

348
00:23:37,743 --> 00:23:41,013
They suggested making a request through an abbreviated order.

349
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:44,643
Your college classmate is the Head of the Detective Team there, right?

350
00:23:44,643 --> 00:23:46,603
That's right.

351
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:49,643
So... you merely agreed to that suggestion?

352
00:23:49,643 --> 00:23:53,113
I thought that there was no reason to oppose it.

353
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:55,623
Although his methods were quite rough,

354
00:23:55,623 --> 00:24:02,543
all of that was eventually to get rid of the tumor within the Prosecution.

355
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:04,913
How dare you...?

356
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:10,953
My subordinate prosecutor was here last time, but no one's around now.

357
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:15,873
Fine.

358
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:18,813
You're finally showing your true colors.

359
00:24:18,813 --> 00:24:22,223
I'm... the Chief Prosecutor.

360
00:24:22,223 --> 00:24:25,563
I'm keenly aware of the ones who are trying to stab my back.

361
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:29,943
And the reason why you assigned the Seocho-dong murder case to Prosecutor Jin.

362
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:34,643
You hypocrite who acts like a decent, righteous person on the outside.

363
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:39,123
Look forward to it. Soon enough, I'll rip apart that

364
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:41,923
mask you're wearing.

365
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:02,553
Hello, Sir.

366
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:35,003
Hey, this is not the guy!

367
00:25:35,003 --> 00:25:37,023
Who is this?

368
00:25:37,023 --> 00:25:40,923
This is Coco. Prosecutor Jin's dog.

369
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:45,733
It's surprising that you have a dog.

370
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:48,833
What do you mean "a dog"? Don't say such an upsetting thing.

371
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,873
Coco is my family.

372
00:25:50,873 --> 00:25:52,803
He looked like a troublemaker.

373
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,903
Just like his "dad".

374
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:57,793
It's problematic that he only listens to me.

375
00:25:57,793 --> 00:26:00,953
Kind of like I'm the one and only person in the world?

376
00:26:02,653 --> 00:26:04,643
Yes, I'm on the way.

377
00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:21,193
Who are those gentlemen?

378
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:25,153
- My younger brothers. 
 - Younger brothers?

379
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:31,583
It's a big family...

380
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:34,323
Miss... we all thought it would be a war,

381
00:26:34,323 --> 00:26:36,973
but what's this? Making me a watchman...

382
00:26:38,403 --> 00:26:40,493
Because I'm bored.

383
00:26:43,563 --> 00:26:47,263
Big Boss has been looking for you. Asking where you are.

384
00:26:47,263 --> 00:26:49,903
So why did you have to retire out of the blue?

385
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:53,833
Retire... Retire?

386
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,543
Wait a minute.

387
00:26:55,543 --> 00:26:59,463
Miss... are the rumors true?

388
00:26:59,463 --> 00:27:02,826
Is it because of that Jin Jung or Jin Chang guy—

389
00:27:02,826 --> 00:27:04,616
Holy crap!

390
00:27:16,663 --> 00:27:18,573
W-Where are you going?

391
00:27:19,413 --> 00:27:21,273
Ice cream.

392
00:27:26,973 --> 00:27:30,613
It's hot. I should get a popsicle, too.

393
00:27:35,463 --> 00:27:39,603
Sir... is she the one that I only heard about?

394
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,673
Shut up.

395
00:27:45,383 --> 00:27:48,163
You shouldn't talk about her so carelessly like that.

396
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:54,413
It's getting cold. Why would you even want an ice cream?

397
00:27:54,413 --> 00:27:57,053
Ice cream, even if I freeze to death. What do you want?

398
00:27:57,053 --> 00:27:59,933
I don't eat unless I get to pick and choose.

399
00:27:59,933 --> 00:28:02,303
Do you want me to pick on you and beat you up?

400
00:28:12,613 --> 00:28:15,603
- Yes. 
  - We located Yoo Jin Chul!

401
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:33,153
I'm getting a bit hungry. Let's eat here.

402
00:28:33,153 --> 00:28:34,753
Hey, hey, you guys over there!

403
00:28:34,753 --> 00:28:36,333
- What the heck? 
 - Be quiet.

404
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,393
Get them.

405
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:46,373
 You bastard!

406
00:28:50,453 --> 00:28:52,433
Don't move.

407
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:56,943
It's been a while since I saw a gun. How scary...

408
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,613
Stop, don't come closer.

409
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,263
Halt!

410
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:03,533
Try and shoot.

411
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,893
Try and shoot.

412
00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:08,253
I said to stop!

413
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:10,343
You're going to get hurt!

414
00:29:15,933 --> 00:29:17,643
Prosecutor...

415
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:19,643
Put your weapon down.

416
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:42,223
What? Yes, right now...

417
00:29:42,223 --> 00:29:46,173
Things have kind of... went down the rabbit hole...

418
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:52,863
Like... Yoo Jin Chul is not here.

419
00:29:52,863 --> 00:29:54,823
Looks like he disappeared...

420
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:06,503
Jin Jung!

421
00:30:09,993 --> 00:30:11,433
It's Yoo Jin Chul!

422
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:14,233
One word about the Sponsorship Controversy of Chief Lee Jang Won, please!

423
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:17,463
How long have you known Chief Lee Jang Won?

424
00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:19,243
What was your relationship with the victim?

425
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:20,623
Is your statement true?

426
00:30:20,623 --> 00:30:22,643
One word, please!

427
00:30:23,993 --> 00:30:25,613
What I said...

428
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,733
during my call with Prosecutor Jin Jung are...

429
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:34,083
false statements I had made

430
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:38,823
because of the assault and threats.

431
00:30:40,203 --> 00:30:42,873
I sincerely apologize for

432
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:47,023
causing confusion for the people.

433
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:52,603
Also... I also sincerely apologize to Chief Lee Jang Won

434
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:54,873
who must've suffered emotionally because of me.

435
00:30:54,873 --> 00:30:57,143
 Are you saying there is no problem with Chief Lee Jang Won?

436
00:30:57,143 --> 00:30:58,433
 What is your reason for coming here today?

437
00:30:58,433 --> 00:30:59,723
 One more word, please!

438
00:30:59,723 --> 00:31:01,953
 Please give us one more statement!

439
00:31:01,953 --> 00:31:05,543
 The one who exposed Chief Lee Jang Won for sponsoring a woman in her 20s

440
00:31:05,543 --> 00:31:10,253
 is sending a shockwave by saying that the footage was coerced by Prosecutor Jin Jung.

441
00:31:10,253 --> 00:31:13,423
 Chief Lee Jang Won's party has decided to sue Prosecutor Jin Jung for

442
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:15,513
 allegations on spreading false rumors

443
00:31:15,513 --> 00:31:18,733

and defamation and malicious falsehood.

444
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:21,663

445
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:35,713
This was just delivered for you.

446
00:31:38,173 --> 00:31:42,493

447
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,393
Although for the sake of formality,

448
00:32:00,393 --> 00:32:02,813
you'll be summoned for interrogation for a few days.

449
00:32:02,813 --> 00:32:04,953
Sorry for what happened.

450
00:32:04,953 --> 00:32:07,563
I was trying not to get caught,

451
00:32:07,563 --> 00:32:10,883
- but the guy was quite a hitter. 
 - I completely understand.

452
00:32:10,883 --> 00:32:13,536
It's natural for a person to side with

453
00:32:13,536 --> 00:32:16,446
the ones with benefits and security.

454
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:23,293
I'm going to work under just you from now on, Prosecutor.

455
00:32:23,293 --> 00:32:25,923
Tell me anything you want.

456
00:32:25,923 --> 00:32:27,193
Money?

457
00:32:27,193 --> 00:32:28,603
Alcohol?

458
00:32:28,603 --> 00:32:30,393
Women?

459
00:32:30,393 --> 00:32:32,703
I'll organize everything for you.

460
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:35,343
There is only one thing I want.

461
00:32:38,543 --> 00:32:44,153
Chief Lee Jang Won's situation on the night of Park Ye Young's murder.

462
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:49,803
Anything is good, even if it's trivial.

463
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:52,573
Would you be able to tell me?

464
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:57,223
Why that, all of a sudden?

465
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:03,793
Because there can be evidence or witness that can work against the Chief.

466
00:33:04,663 --> 00:33:09,143
I... work for the Chief.

467
00:33:27,743 --> 00:33:30,183

468
00:33:31,903 --> 00:33:34,123

469
00:33:40,263 --> 00:33:42,073
Everyone's here?

470
00:33:45,053 --> 00:33:46,763
Please come in.

471
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:53,783
Does she have something against me?

472
00:33:57,693 --> 00:34:00,053
She does have something against me.

473
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:01,813
Please take a seat.

474
00:34:04,563 --> 00:34:06,283
Let's cut to the chase since there's no time.

475
00:34:06,283 --> 00:34:11,003
We're now... going to heist Chief Lee Jang Won's USB.

476
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:13,293
With the evidence and witness all taken from us,

477
00:34:13,293 --> 00:34:15,603
the situation is progressing like crazy.

478
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:20,073
The only way for us to turn the table... is the evidence that Chief Lee Jang Won has.

479
00:34:20,073 --> 00:34:21,503
Only the USB.

480
00:34:21,503 --> 00:34:22,853
Wait, Jin Jung.

481
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:25,533
You said you looked inside before Oh Do Hwan took it.

482
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:26,963
You didn't have it backed up?

483
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:28,363
Back up.

484
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:32,643
I didn't have enough storage, so...

485
00:34:32,643 --> 00:34:34,813
I couldn't store them.

486
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:39,643
You have all this storage space, but you couldn't have it backed up?

487
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:42,793
Anyone... has four or five porn videos

488
00:34:42,793 --> 00:34:45,696
in their hard drives, right?

489
00:34:45,696 --> 00:34:50,166
It felt like those ladies were asking me not to erase them.

490
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:53,923
Trash... Trash.

491
00:34:53,923 --> 00:34:56,143
Could you call it philanthropy?

492
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:59,303
So... where is the USB?

493
00:34:59,303 --> 00:35:03,473
13th floor of the Central District Prosecutor's Office... inside Chief Lee Jang Won's office.

494
00:35:05,243 --> 00:35:07,223
Chief Prosecutor's office...

495
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,833
- Chief Prosecutor's office? 
 - Yes.

496
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:15,433
Is it certain info that the USB is inside the Chief Prosecutor's office?

497
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:34,033

498
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,153
I need to go to the toilet—

499
00:35:55,483 --> 00:35:57,473
How do we get in?

500
00:35:58,383 --> 00:36:00,153
Wait.

501
00:36:00,153 --> 00:36:02,523
I'm saying this just in case,

502
00:36:02,523 --> 00:36:04,363
but don't even think about sneaking in.

503
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:07,153
That's not possible from the beginning.

504
00:36:08,843 --> 00:36:11,493
A female secretary guarding the entrance.

505
00:36:17,013 --> 00:36:21,053
 The only one who has the card key is Chief Lee Jang Won.

506
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,343
 Also, the biggest problem are...

507
00:36:23,343 --> 00:36:25,603
the hallway CCTVs.

508
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:39,773
Do you not understand why I'm saying this?

509
00:36:39,773 --> 00:36:42,493
I'm saying that your plan does not make sense from the start.

510
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:45,963
What kind of crazy man plans to heist the Chief Prosecutor's office?

511
00:36:45,963 --> 00:36:47,583
Of course.

512
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:52,233
This is really not right, Jin Jung. Let's think up of something else.

513
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:54,583
There's no way around it.

514
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:57,793
If we try to do everything according to the law, we won't be able to get him until he retires.

515
00:36:57,793 --> 00:37:01,523
I think the main issue will be not getting caught on camera.

516
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:04,483
Is there a way you have in mind?

517
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:06,353
Was it seven years ago?

518
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:10,453
There was an incident where the residents in a residential area had to evacuate.

519
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:13,273
 The one who was caught by the police and arrested was

520
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:16,193
 the employee in charge of the Prosecution's seized articles.

521
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,223
 The allegation was violation of inspecting firearms,

522
00:37:18,223 --> 00:37:19,933
 knives, and explosives.

523
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:23,123
He dropped something terrible in the middle of the night.

524
00:37:30,643 --> 00:37:32,963
Tear... gas?

525
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:38,573
Gosh... there was the basement under the rock bottom.

526
00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:44,293
Let's not stare at me that much, even if I'm that handsome.

527
00:37:44,293 --> 00:37:48,423
It's overwhelming even for me if it's in my face like this.

528
00:37:48,423 --> 00:37:52,983
This is on a different scale from stopping a plane.

529
00:37:52,983 --> 00:37:55,133
If things go south,

530
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:57,283
it's going to be at least five years in prison.

531
00:37:57,283 --> 00:37:59,573
It's not life if there is no risk.

532
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,463
Let's go... to catch the bad guy.

533
00:38:16,323 --> 00:38:19,463

534
00:38:23,423 --> 00:38:25,883

535
00:38:25,883 --> 00:38:27,813

536
00:38:27,813 --> 00:38:29,733

537
00:38:32,953 --> 00:38:35,773

538
00:38:51,153 --> 00:38:52,873
Gosh, hello.

539
00:38:54,003 --> 00:38:56,633
Did you... by any chance,

540
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:58,853
click on an email?

541
00:38:58,853 --> 00:39:00,993
About Mr. Kim's substance usage?

542
00:39:00,993 --> 00:39:02,103
W-Why?

543
00:39:02,103 --> 00:39:04,313
That's a code for a malicious virus.

544
00:39:04,313 --> 00:39:08,293
This whole building is under fire because of that email right now.

545
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:10,213
COMSEC, this is the 13th floor.

546
00:39:10,213 --> 00:39:12,533
 Desk in front of the Chief Prosecutor's office, infection confirmed.

547
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:16,003
Okay, just go in now. Everyone's waiting.

548
00:39:16,003 --> 00:39:18,493
Is there someone in there right now?

549
00:39:18,493 --> 00:39:19,813
Yes.

550
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:22,483
What about the Chief's office?

551
00:39:22,483 --> 00:39:24,583
Do you still not understand?

552
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:27,413
This is not an ordinary virus.

553
00:39:27,413 --> 00:39:29,493
Contact him right now. How do you do it? Is it this?

554
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,493
- This? 
 - Chief, someone's going in for a second.

555
00:39:31,493 --> 00:39:33,733
- I can go in right now? 
 - Yes, yes, you can.

556
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:35,133
I'm going in!

557
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:38,283

558
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:51,313
 Please speak.

559
00:39:51,313 --> 00:39:53,783
- One iced coffee, please. 
  - Sorry?

560
00:39:53,783 --> 00:39:55,543
 Okay.

561
00:39:58,903 --> 00:40:00,273
Two iced coffees, please.

562
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,253
 Understood.

563
00:40:02,253 --> 00:40:04,073
I'm fine.

564
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,883
One's canceled.

565
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:49,593
- Is it not done yet? 
 - Yes, not yet.

566
00:40:49,593 --> 00:40:51,943
It's almost done.

567
00:40:53,303 --> 00:40:55,283
Gosh, but this place...

568
00:40:55,283 --> 00:40:58,563
it's a lot hotter than I thought.

569
00:40:58,563 --> 00:41:03,173
I just have... a lot of body heat, so...

570
00:41:03,173 --> 00:41:05,793
could I pop up some windows?

571
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:10,523
Thank you.

572
00:41:15,793 --> 00:41:20,463
Goodness... It's finally a bit cooler.

573
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:40,123
Whoa, this is...

574
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,463
Are these fresh flowers?

575
00:41:43,963 --> 00:41:46,813
 Gosh, they smell so good.

576
00:41:49,243 --> 00:41:50,943
Chul Ki.

577
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:52,583
Let's go.

578
00:42:39,853 --> 00:42:41,533
The setting is complete.

579
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:43,903
Okay, this is the final stage, Go Joong Do.

580
00:42:43,903 --> 00:42:46,193
Prosecutor, it's all finished.

581
00:42:47,153 --> 00:42:50,333
I took care of all the big issues,

582
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:53,843
but if anything happens, if you just give me a call, I can—

583
00:42:53,843 --> 00:42:55,733
- What the hell? 
 - I-I'm so sorry.

584
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:57,983
- Seriously! 
 - I'll compensate you for everything.

585
00:42:57,983 --> 00:42:59,713
It's fine, it's fine!

586
00:42:59,713 --> 00:43:02,543
I'm so sorry, so sorry.

587
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:03,683
Prosecutor, I'm sorry.

588
00:43:03,683 --> 00:43:06,173
I'm sorry, Prosecutor!

589
00:43:06,173 --> 00:43:08,030
Sorry!

590
00:43:08,883 --> 00:43:10,543
Sorry...

591
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:13,713
Sorry.

592
00:43:16,443 --> 00:43:20,013
Whoa... I could be an actor, seriously.

593
00:43:20,013 --> 00:43:21,413
Hey, leave the item and get out.

594
00:43:21,413 --> 00:43:24,353
It's so windy outside!

595
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:26,823
Gosh, it's getting quite tiring.

596
00:43:26,823 --> 00:43:28,703
Can't I just throw it in?

597
00:43:28,703 --> 00:43:31,643
Gosh, okay, okay.

598
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,483
I'm on my way now.

599
00:43:39,513 --> 00:43:41,623
Gosh, seriously.

600
00:43:41,623 --> 00:43:43,683
Can't I just throw it in?

601
00:43:49,883 --> 00:43:51,643
I'm getting anxious.

602
00:44:03,783 --> 00:44:05,313
I'm leaving it and going.

603
00:44:05,313 --> 00:44:08,373
Since my face is all known now, the rest is-

604
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:21,533
What am I going to do with her?

605
00:44:32,113 --> 00:44:33,593
Damn it!

606
00:44:52,803 --> 00:44:54,813
 This is an emergency announcement.

607
00:44:54,813 --> 00:44:59,843
 A gas terror has occurred within the Prosecution building with no known cause.

608
00:44:59,843 --> 00:45:04,633
 Everyone within the Prosecution, please evacuate to the outside.

609
00:45:04,633 --> 00:45:06,543
 Repeating one more time.

610
00:45:06,543 --> 00:45:11,103
 A gas terror has occurred within the Prosecution building with no known cause.

611
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:16,473
What the hell is this?

612
00:45:16,473 --> 00:45:18,163
Who did this?

613
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:35,973
Please move on this way.

614
00:45:35,973 --> 00:45:39,113
Move on this way. This way, please.

615
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:40,883
This way.

616
00:45:40,883 --> 00:45:43,413
Yes, it seems quite spicy.

617
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:47,493
Hey, hey, Go Joong Do!

618
00:45:49,123 --> 00:45:50,383
Thank you.

619
00:45:50,383 --> 00:45:52,003
Take care.

620
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,313
Spicy, it is.

621
00:45:56,313 --> 00:45:58,883
Don't rub your eyes even if it's spicy.

622
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:15,280
Yes, it's me. Hurry and come to the 13th floor.

623
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,170
Hurry up and open up the door.

624
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,890

625
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:14,750
It's going to be hard to infer the suspect with the CCTV footage.

626
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:18,490
There is only one bastard who would do this crap

627
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,050
within the entire Prosecution.

628
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:25,120
Go and bring Prosecutor Jin to me right now.

629
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,530
Okay.

630
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:45,470
Shit... Damn it!

631
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,680
I deleted your entrance record to the Evidence Storage Room.

632
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,980
The tear gas that you fired...

633
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:08,450
was taken care of from the list of evidence..

634
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:10,370
That's my Senior.

635
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:12,330
This is why I like you. 
  (T/N: Said without the honorifics)

636
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:15,010
That's lacking the honorifics, you punk.

637
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,780
Gosh... anyhow.

638
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,820
This is my limit of cutting slack for you.

639
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,760
Absolutely not happening next time.

640
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,260
Okay.

641
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,020
Gosh... how did I seriously... end up becoming the Supervisor of someone like you?

642
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,510
Hey, tell me this honestly.

643
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:36,900
People don't think of you as a prosecutor, do they?

644
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,060
The world is quite crazy.

645
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,200
There has to be at least one person like me.

646
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,230
Chief Lee Jang Won is rampaging right now.

647
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:55,490
Oh Do Hwan is looking for you with furious eyes.

648
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,580
What are you going to do with that now?

649
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,180
I'm not sure.

650
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,210

651
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:17,120
 Chief, Prosecutor Jin Jung is here.

652
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,690
Gosh, what is this smell?

653
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,060
Oh, I heard the news. That there was a big happening here yesterday.

654
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:33,710
Who dared to do something so disgraceful at a holy prosecutor's office?

655
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:35,690
Did you catch the culprit?

656
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,130
You bastard.

657
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:44,990
Hey, how vulgar of you.

658
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:46,790
Let's use our words.

659
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,030
This is expensive leather!

660
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:53,080
Man... What kind of manners is this?

661
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,980
You're so savage.

662
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,690
You think you'll get away with what you've done?

663
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:00,350
Me? Why?

664
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,550
Don't spew such nonsense.

665
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:05,610
Who else would do something that crazy beside you?

666
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:10,030
Even if you hate me, making assumptions like that is a bit too much.

667
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,410
Do you have proof that I did it?

668
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:13,650
You think you can catch me by being like this?

669
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:14,900
You can't catch me.

670
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,580
- Nothing will change because you— 
 - Don't say such tacky comments such as nothing will change.

671
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:21,520
Why don't you take a look at this?

672
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,510
 Breaking news.

673
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:30,330
 Suspicions surrounding Chief Lee Jang Won of the Central District Prosecutors' Office regarding his sponsorship

674
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:31,950
 of a woman in her 20s has been revealed to be true.

675
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,200
 Our reporters have exclusively obtained the

676
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,640
 photos of Chief Lee Jang Won and Ms. Park's secret meeting.

677
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,450
 The more shocking truth is that Ms. Park, who is in the picture,

678
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:40,790
 Ms. Park, who is in the picture,

679
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:44,540
 is the victim of the Seocho-dong murder case, which occurred on the 12th.

680
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:48,110
 Also, the meeting date at the bottom of the picture

681
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:51,580
 matches with the date of the occurrence of murder.

682
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,160
 The controversy about Chief Lee Jang Won's lies about having

683
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,230
 no relationship with the victim,

684
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,740
 also, Prosecutor Jin Jung's claim that Chief Lee Jang Won is

685
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,510
 the most suspected culprit...

686
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:05,360
There's this quote that comes out in a drama.

687
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,540
"Evil is diligent."

688
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,470
It's a quote that I like.

689
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,820
Hitting it home. It's cool.

690
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,150
What is it that you want to say?

691
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:16,060
Evil is actually diligent.

692
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,940
There's one thing that they don't know, though...

693
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,130
that I'm multiple times more diligent than them.

694
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:27,060
I'll give you time to wrap things up.

695
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,080
I didn't kill that woman.

696
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,880
As you said,

697
00:53:36,707 --> 00:53:41,160
it's true that I was with that woman on the day of the incident...

698
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,040
but I didn't murder her.

699
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:51,470
Gosh, what a problem for you, Prosecutor?

700
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:54,800
You got the totally wrong destination.

701
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,770
Chief Lee Jang Won... isn't the culprit.

702
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,940
The real culprit is someone else.

703
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,610
When taking a picture of the two,

704
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,470
there's something that only I saw.

705
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,720
 I didn't kill that woman.

706
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,010
 It's true that I was with that woman on the day of the incident,

707
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:32,780
 but I didn't kill her.

708
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,240
 Do you have any proof of what you're claiming?

709
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,440

710
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,810
 August 12th, at 9 p.m.

711
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,120
 Park Ye Young's estimated time of death.

712
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,100
 Go and check the CCTV of the hotel restaurant.

713
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,320
August 12th?

714
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:56,270
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

715
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,730
Check the footage of my car's black box.

716
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,990
Yes. We really need to meet and grab something to eat, at least.

717
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,760
Why don't we meet tomorrow while on the topic?

718
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,290
That's too bad, then.

719
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,530
Let's have a drink sometime later.

720
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:53,210
Okay.

721
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:24,690

722
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:29,480
Yes.

723
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,440
This is Jin Jung.

724
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,940
I confirmed it, just as you said.

725
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,000
I'm glad.

726
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,890
Please tell me now.

727
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:45,150
What exactly happened on that day?

728
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,340
 - What are you doing? 
 - Nothing...

729
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,480
 What are you looking for?

730
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,920
 Have you seen a small thing... that fell around here, by any chance?

731
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,590
 Something small, what?

732
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:03,200
 Never mind.

733
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,910
 What is it?

734
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:10,590
 Wait a minute.

735
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,050

736
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,030
 I have an important matter, so I'm going out first.

737
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:21,780
 - You're leaving already? 
 - Yes, don't come out.

738
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:28,910
Do you actually... know who the real culprit is?

739
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,580
 When taking a picture of the two, there's something that only I saw.

740
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,980
 Oh, my…

741
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,750
 Let's meet briefly.

742
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,150
There's something I need to tell you.

743
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:35,260
It's something that you must hear as well.

744
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,610
Right now?

745
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:41,510
 At Banpo-dong, there's a new legal complex.

746
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:44,020
 It's still in the makings,

747
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:48,720
- but let's meet there. 
  - I'll be there right away.

748
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:31,080

749
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,190

750
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,680
 The person you are calling is not available...

751
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:24,670

752
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,760

753
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,990
 I'll find the evidence and bring it.

754
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:46,710
 You want to investigate... with murder as a possibility?

755
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:48,500
 - Is this confirmed information? 
 - It's just as you see.

756
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,680
 The results indicated it as a suicide, Prosecutor Jin.

757
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,930
 We can't let it end like this.

758
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:54,410
 You should be kneeling down for forgiveness, but what? Re-autopsy?

759
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,920
 You're going to do a secret autopsy?

760
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,867
 You're not scheming something weird again—

761
01:01:58,867 --> 01:02:01,030
 - Go in. 
 - You go in-

762
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:02,363
 You said you entrusted the Chief's autopsy, right?

763
01:02:02,363 --> 01:02:04,200
-  I entrusted it. 
 - Then what's that?

764
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,500
 Third one, third one, third one!

765
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,100
 - Prosecutor Jin! 
 - Why!
