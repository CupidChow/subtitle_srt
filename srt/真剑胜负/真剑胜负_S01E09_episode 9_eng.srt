1
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:39,638

2
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,210

3
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,070
You'd better walk faster.

4
00:01:13,258 --> 00:01:15,538
Gosh... why is it a knife?

5
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:19,718
Come on in. Come on.

6
00:02:57,818 --> 00:02:59,998
What the hell?

7
00:02:59,998 --> 00:03:01,738
What's this?

8
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:05,068
What is this!

9
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:06,968
You sneaky jerk...

10
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:37,678
Hey, Chul Ki...

11
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:41,618
come and get me, please.

12
00:04:56,618 --> 00:04:59,338

13
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:02,568
You eat well.

14
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:12,238
Hello?

15
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:16,298
 Father, Director Tae has been arrested.

16
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:23,308
Gosh, that's problematic.

17
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:26,028
Who's going to drive my car now?

18
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,738
I received what you sent me.

19
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:35,738
But I couldn't really tell what your intention is, Prosecutor.

20
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:47,968
That's the memory card of the dashcam from the Seocho-dong murder case witness.

21
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:52,988
I've already identified the prime suspect in the case.

22
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:56,168
I had hoped you wouldn't be blackmailing me.

23
00:05:56,168 --> 00:06:01,298
I expected you to be a smart fellow, but I'm disappointed, Prosecutor.

24
00:06:02,548 --> 00:06:05,078
I had fun talking to you, though.

25
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:10,198
Do as you'd like with that.

26
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:18,708
I'll give it to you, CEO.

27
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,438
What do you want from me?

28
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:24,338
I want to be by your side.

29
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:32,228
I'll be quite useful.

30
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:40,438
Please take it.

31
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:43,748
It's not even the original, anyway.

32
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:50,038
I've got to say you still have some guts, Prosecutor Oh.

33
00:06:53,578 --> 00:06:55,988
Are you a good driver?

34
00:07:01,698 --> 00:07:05,828

35
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,718
Are you always this quiet?

36
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:13,601
Or are you trying to wait it out using your right to remain silent?

37
00:07:15,128 --> 00:07:17,431
Do as you please. I don't care anyway.

38
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:21,011
I have more than enough evidence to prove your crimes.

39
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:25,258
I also know why you killed the Chief.

40
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:35,248
You went to take this from the Chief.

41
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:37,978
However, the Chief didn't have anything.

42
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:43,098
So you people killed him and made it look like a suicide.

43
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:45,548
How unfortunate for you, though?

44
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,018
It was me, of all people, that showed up there

45
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:51,058
You must've been annoyed.

46
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:55,818
Since a prosecutor suddenly started to dig into the case.

47
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:59,008
So you people framed me and

48
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:03,198
tried to kill me later because the framing didn't work.

49
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:04,878
Right?

50
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,718
You're good at writing novels.

51
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:13,108
You finally opened your mouth.

52
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:19,348
I guess my words did hurt.

53
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:35,228
A knife-cutter like you wouldn't have acted without an order.

54
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:40,808
Did the Law Firm order you?

55
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:45,278
Of course, I don't think so, either.

56
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:47,378
Of course not.

57
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:51,188
There's no way for the best law firm in Korea to kill...

58
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:56,758
the Chief Prosecutor of the Central District only to take this little thing from him.

59
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:01,628
Let's talk about the specifics later.

60
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:04,308
We'll start now.

61
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:06,068
Name.

62
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:17,918
Prosecutor, the attorney is here.

63
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:22,758
Let him in.

64
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:32,558
I'm Ms. Tae Hyeong Wook's attorney, Oh Do Hwan.

65
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:37,278
As of this moment, she'll use her right to refuse to answer any questions.

66
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,110

67
00:09:56,518 --> 00:09:59,048
The inspection of Oh Do Hwan was dismissed.

68
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,368
What's the reason?

69
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:01,868
Unable to confirm.

70
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,688
Even the Inspection Department seems shocked.

71
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,628
Prosecutor Oh has quite the sponsor.

72
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,748
I was sent here by CEO Seo Hyeong Gyu.

73
00:10:12,748 --> 00:10:14,948
How do you feel?

74
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,788
I'm fine.

75
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:18,078
I'm glad to hear that.

76
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,728
If you have anything to tell the CEO, I'll let him know.

77
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:25,268
Tell the CEO?

78
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:34,048
I'll tell him in person after I get out.

79
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:36,908
You won't be getting out, Ms. Tae Hyeong Wook.

80
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:38,438
I'll prevent that from happening.

81
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,858
And no one will hear what you have to say, Ms. Tae Hyeong Wook.

82
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:47,898
You think you can stop me?

83
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:52,258
Ms. Tae Hyeong Wook...

84
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:56,528
everyone eventually dies, and you're no exception.

85
00:10:56,528 --> 00:11:01,058
Just as you killed other people, other people can also kill you, Ms. Tae Hyeong Wook.

86
00:11:01,058 --> 00:11:06,398
As an attorney who was a former prosecutor, I know plenty of people like that.

87
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:16,958
I'll come visit you again soon.

88
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,308
Please take care until then.

89
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:41,778
I look forward to working with you.

90
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,198
That's just like you.

91
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:53,588
Law Firm Kangsan?

92
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,928
You've got into a good firm.

93
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:57,328
I'll see you later.

94
00:11:57,328 --> 00:11:59,568
You too, Prosecutor Shin.

95
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:15,718
C-Can I?

96
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:18,068
Do it.

97
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:20,888
I saw it in the movies where

98
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:24,848
things like these explode when you insert them.

99
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,178

100
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:35,401
I'll just do it.

101
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:37,621
I need to just do it.

102
00:12:45,228 --> 00:12:48,488
You're all such scaredy-cats.

103
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:57,868
What the heck?

104
00:12:57,868 --> 00:13:00,418

105
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:01,438
Interview?

106
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:03,718
What kind of interview could it be?

107
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:07,338

108
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:10,478

109
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,148
Prosecutor Jin!

110
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:16,538
Open it.

111
00:13:18,838 --> 00:13:22,108

112
00:13:29,068 --> 00:13:30,988
This is...

113
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:33,748
It's not working?

114
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:39,018
Geez, I'll need a code-compatible algorithm tool.

115
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,528
I can't even approach the lock source right now.

116
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:45,498
What does that mean?

117
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:46,868
What?

118
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,258
Well, so this program itself is old.

119
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:52,298
More than ten years, probably.

120
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,288
To break through this password...

121
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:57,018
I need to approach the lock source,

122
00:13:57,018 --> 00:14:00,258
which is inside, but...

123
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:04,548
the algorithm program is outdated.

124
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:09,038
Anyhow, I can't do it with this equipment.

125
00:14:09,038 --> 00:14:13,638
What's the use of the latest version key when the lock is an obsolete one?

126
00:14:13,638 --> 00:14:18,188
There's a bigger problem because this program has two-fold security.

127
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:20,768
After getting the password incorrect more than twice,

128
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:24,288
then everything inside will get erased, regardless of what's inside.

129
00:14:24,288 --> 00:14:27,778
Even Bill Gates can't figure this out.

130
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:32,078

131
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,868

132
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:39,978

133
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:41,718

134
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:44,738
♫  Many stars in the sky  ♫

135
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:47,168
♫  When I count them all  ♫

136
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:48,368
♫  What is my star?  ♫

137
00:14:48,368 --> 00:14:52,678
The Chief lost this MP3 at the victim, Park Ye Young's house.

138
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:56,168
 - What are you doing? 
 - Nothing...

139
00:14:56,998 --> 00:14:59,198
 What are you looking for?

140
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:05,288
 Have you seen a small thing that fell around here, by any chance?

141
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:06,818
 Something small, what?

142
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:08,888
After the Seocho-dong murder happened,

143
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:15,648
Han Soo Bin, the victim's friend, found this MP3 on the cat tower she got from her.

144
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:19,438
 Then she handed it to the Chief, who was looking for it.

145
00:15:19,438 --> 00:15:23,808
♫  Doesn't mean I'm not a star  ♫

146
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:28,158
All of this might have started with the Seocho-dong murder case.

147
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:31,368
The top priority we have to focus on is...

148
00:15:33,038 --> 00:15:36,288

finding the real culprit.

149
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:38,818
Finding out who killed Park Ye Young, the victim,

150
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:41,438
why they killed her...

151
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:45,540
and the identity of this damn thing.

152
00:15:47,178 --> 00:15:50,908
♫  Wherever you are  ♫

153
00:16:13,258 --> 00:16:16,788

154
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,918
I...

155
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:39,378
have a headache because of your son.

156
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:51,568

157
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:56,648

158
00:17:56,648 --> 00:17:59,988

159
00:18:11,448 --> 00:18:15,188
Attorney Oh Do Hwan of Law Firm Kangsan.

160
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:16,258
It's nice.

161
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:18,688
It has a way better ring to it than the word prosecutor.

162
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:21,478
Yes. Thank you.

163
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:24,068
How did you convince my father?

164
00:18:24,068 --> 00:18:28,598
You've got great skills, sticking to this side and that side.

165
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,738
What brings you here?

166
00:18:31,738 --> 00:18:36,538
We'll be one family from now so I thought I needed to say hi.

167
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:38,498
So it's being polite as the EP  (Executive Partner) .

168
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:41,418
Okay. I'll be in your care.

169
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,658
It was too bad back then.

170
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,448
I really wanted to see a prosecutor putting his head on the ground.

171
00:18:48,448 --> 00:18:50,888
But you suddenly left.

172
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,088
Gosh, how scary.

173
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:56,268
Relax your eyes.

174
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,608
I hate a person being disrespectful.

175
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:01,208
Then why don't you start respecting other people first?

176
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,628
Not everyone's on the same level, so I can't.

177
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:10,558
Are you thinking we're on the same level?

178
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:12,878
You and me?

179
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:23,548
I guess you feel big since you got Father's attention...

180
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:25,788
but don't be like that too much, Attorney.

181
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:29,968
You're just an attorney and Father's driver.

182
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:33,538
On the other hand, I'll eventually become the CEO of Kangsan.

183
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:50,188
You're laughing?

184
00:19:58,158 --> 00:19:59,908
I'm so sorry!

185
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:04,518
I apologize for not recognizing our Attorney Seo Ji Han,

186
00:20:04,518 --> 00:20:06,739
who's going to be the next CEO of Kangsan.

187
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:09,139
I offer you my sincere apologies.

188
00:20:16,278 --> 00:20:19,398
Attorney, where shall I put this box—

189
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:28,728
I'll see you later.

190
00:20:31,828 --> 00:20:33,198
Just leave it there.

191
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:37,768

192
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:05,298
Excuse me, Prosecutor.

193
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,708
Yes. Why?

194
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,768
It's already quite late.

195
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,678
Whoa, it's already this late.

196
00:21:12,678 --> 00:21:14,398
What about some Chinese food?

197
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,708
Sounds great!

198
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,888
You two choose the menus you want.

199
00:21:18,888 --> 00:21:21,508
I need to treat you that much, at least for your hard work.

200
00:21:21,508 --> 00:21:23,168
You're really the best, Prosecutor.

201
00:21:23,168 --> 00:21:24,578
I'll be taking orders.

202
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:26,538
- One gganpoonggi for me... 
 - Gganpoonggi and... 
  (T/N: Deep-fried Chicken in Hot Pepper Sauce)

203
00:21:26,538 --> 00:21:28,688
Just a jjamppong for me. 
  (T/N: spicy noodle soup, a cheaper dish)

204
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:32,788
Let's just go with three jjamppongs...

205
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:35,318
Okay then. Just three jjamppongs.

206
00:21:35,318 --> 00:21:36,998
I'm kidding. It's a joke.

207
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:40,108
Gosh! Prosecutor!

208
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:41,688
You'll take care of the bill, won't you?

209
00:21:41,688 --> 00:21:43,738
Of course.

210
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:48,228
Okay, one gganpoonggi, one yusanseul, and then? 
  (T/N: Stir-fried seafood and vegetables)

211
00:21:48,228 --> 00:21:50,038

- What do you think about tangsuyuk? 
 - Love it. 
  (T/N: Sweet and sour beef)

212
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:51,438
I'll order a big one then.

213
00:21:51,438 --> 00:21:54,818

214
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:04,118

215
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:17,548
Did Ms. Park Ye Young has another man?

216
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:19,498
Someone besides Chief Lee?

217
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:27,108
This car she's in...

218
00:22:27,108 --> 00:22:29,288
it's not the Chief's car.

219
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:32,268
All of the times and dates on the pictures

220
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,218
taken by Ms. Park Ye Young don't fit the Chief's schedule.

221
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,348
Before she started seeing Mister,

222
00:22:40,348 --> 00:22:44,418
she said she had a man she was acquainted with.

223
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:46,528
Who was that man?

224
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,078
I don't know the details because I only heard about him.

225
00:22:49,078 --> 00:22:51,198
Ye Young never told me because

226
00:22:51,198 --> 00:22:53,618
she said he wouldn't like to be known.

227
00:22:53,618 --> 00:22:55,428
Were they dating?

228
00:22:55,428 --> 00:22:57,478
According to what Ye Young said, yes.

229
00:23:00,978 --> 00:23:03,928
The victim, Ms. Park Ye Young, was dating someone else.

230
00:23:03,928 --> 00:23:05,578
I think it was omitted during the

231
00:23:05,578 --> 00:23:07,448
 police investigations because it was a covert relationship.

232
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:09,508
She had another man?

233
00:23:11,238 --> 00:23:13,138
Let's look into that man's identity first.

234
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:14,268
How?

235
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,578
We have nearly no information.

236
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:18,328
The one who introduced the victim, Park Ye Young, to the Chief.

237
00:23:19,308 --> 00:23:20,858
That guy would know for sure.

238
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,418
Who's that?

239
00:23:24,378 --> 00:23:26,108
Yoo Jin Chul?

240
00:23:39,808 --> 00:23:41,948
Jin Chul—

241
00:23:42,908 --> 00:23:44,408
What the heck?

242
00:24:12,548 --> 00:24:15,938

243
00:24:15,938 --> 00:24:17,088
What did you find?

244
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,588

An arrest warrant was issued for smuggling fake liquor.

245
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:24,768
He's currently publicly wanted and on the run.

246
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:26,958
 What about the sashimi restaurant address?

247
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,818
It's just a regular restaurant.

248
00:24:28,818 --> 00:24:30,898
There's nothing fishy about it.

249
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:34,647
Then there's no clue about where he's hiding.

250
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:36,967
We'll do our best, but...

251
00:24:38,008 --> 00:24:39,208
 Okay, for now.

252
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:42,578
Text me the district's police station and the name of the person in charge.

253
00:24:42,578 --> 00:24:45,838

Asking for their cooperation seems the quickest way right now.

254
00:24:45,838 --> 00:24:47,888
It's a stow-away company.

255
00:24:49,068 --> 00:24:50,418
- Stow-away? 
  - Yes.

256
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:52,968
It's the office disguised as a sashimi restaurant.

257
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:56,128
My family members used this place in the past as well.

258
00:25:00,508 --> 00:25:02,528
I won't ask you any further.

259
00:25:02,528 --> 00:25:05,388
Can you find the guys who do the stow-away work?

260
00:25:05,388 --> 00:25:09,418
They move their office once a month, so... it won't be easy.

261
00:25:09,418 --> 00:25:11,338
Even if I ask of you?

262
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:17,938
Was it a line... to blush over just now?

263
00:25:17,938 --> 00:25:20,678
It's not the line that matters.

264
00:25:20,678 --> 00:25:22,118
It's the messenger.

265
00:25:22,118 --> 00:25:24,298
Since it's you who's asking...

266
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:25,728
I'll look into it as quickly as possible.

267
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:27,218
Thank you.

268
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:31,858
By the way, Prosecutor, wouldn't it be too late if he had already left the country?

269
00:25:31,858 --> 00:25:33,508
It doesn't matter whether it's the U.S. or Africa.

270
00:25:33,508 --> 00:25:35,148
We're going after him, no matter what.

271
00:25:35,148 --> 00:25:36,899
Okay.

272
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:42,258

273
00:25:59,236 --> 00:26:01,096
Who's there?

274
00:26:01,096 --> 00:26:03,026
A prosecutor.

275
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:07,186
You know this guy, right?

276
00:26:11,546 --> 00:26:13,066
I'm not sure.

277
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:15,126
I don't think I know.

278
00:26:16,186 --> 00:26:18,126
You really don't know?

279
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:19,606
I came here knowing everything.

280
00:26:19,606 --> 00:26:22,296
I'm saying I don't know about what I don't know.

281
00:26:22,296 --> 00:26:26,096
How could a man be lying?

282
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:27,876
I've got no business...

283
00:26:27,876 --> 00:26:29,796
so go back to where you came from.

284
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:33,546
These guys never listen when I use words.

285
00:26:33,546 --> 00:26:36,186
Why are they all like that?

286
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:39,036
You're the one who's not listening.

287
00:26:39,036 --> 00:26:40,930
Guys!

288
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,150
Come on outside!

289
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:53,416
These lads here... have too much interest in our work.

290
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:56,286
Please let them know, so they can understand, okay?

291
00:26:56,286 --> 00:26:57,956
 Okay, Boss.

292
00:26:57,956 --> 00:26:59,616
Why do things always end up like this?

293
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:01,676
That's what I'm saying.

294
00:27:01,676 --> 00:27:03,366
Do I need to call a shaman for a ceremony or something?

295
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:05,376
Gosh, such a bother!

296
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:06,966
Trash them!

297
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:09,356
Kill them!

298
00:27:23,046 --> 00:27:25,026
They're just big in size.

299
00:27:25,026 --> 00:27:27,196
Gosh, my butt...

300
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,986
Excuse me.

301
00:27:29,986 --> 00:27:32,646
Are you going to listen now?

302
00:27:45,936 --> 00:27:48,226
Yes, yes. I know him.

303
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:50,296
Which country did you send him to?

304
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:52,036
But the thing is...

305
00:27:53,176 --> 00:27:55,296
I actually...

306
00:27:58,036 --> 00:27:59,606
sent him to Shinan coast.

307
00:27:59,606 --> 00:28:01,286
I sent him to the salt farm.

308
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:09,806
- 2001! 
 - G-gosh...

309
00:28:10,636 --> 00:28:13,936
 Wow... Great, great.

310
00:28:19,106 --> 00:28:23,736
I mean, he suddenly changed his mind after setting sails...

311
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:25,836
saying he won't pay up the balance.

312
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:28,896
So, since we also need to make a living,

313
00:28:28,896 --> 00:28:30,236
I had no other choice.

314
00:28:30,236 --> 00:28:32,806
I have to break even that way.

315
00:28:32,806 --> 00:28:38,346
But that guy apparently is really good with the work over there.

316
00:28:38,346 --> 00:28:39,996
After he started working,

317
00:28:39,996 --> 00:28:43,446
the salt harvest amount shot up.

318
00:28:43,446 --> 00:28:45,116
In the middle of all that?

319
00:28:45,116 --> 00:28:47,106
It was his fated career.

320
00:29:31,326 --> 00:29:34,306
Gosh, my Jin Chul...

321
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:37,916
you're finally looking like one.

322
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:41,246
This is all... thanks to you, Chief.

323
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,596
Thank you, Chief.

324
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:46,486
Gosh, so don't get caught running away like that time and get beat up.

325
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:49,006
Just do as you're doing now. Just this much.

326
00:29:49,006 --> 00:29:51,046
I ate only salt for one week...

327
00:29:51,046 --> 00:29:52,496
Gosh, this guy.

328
00:29:52,496 --> 00:29:54,496
Don't worry about a thing.

329
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:58,536
I found my lifelong job, Chief.

330
00:29:58,536 --> 00:29:59,566
Thank you.

331
00:29:59,566 --> 00:30:01,626
Okay, okay.

332
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:03,756
- Keep up the good work. 
 - Okay.

333
00:30:03,756 --> 00:30:05,866
Please take care!

334
00:30:23,186 --> 00:30:25,396
P-Prosecutor?

335
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:29,996
Jin Chul!

336
00:30:31,426 --> 00:30:34,096
Let's go home!

337
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:39,806
Prosecutor!

338
00:30:39,806 --> 00:30:46,106
Prosecutor!

339
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:48,816
Prosecutor!

340
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:52,446
The guy... seems to have lost half his weight.

341
00:30:52,446 --> 00:30:53,946
He needs to lose some.

342
00:30:53,946 --> 00:30:57,036
He was always too big.

343
00:31:01,146 --> 00:31:04,256
You said let's go home. What the hell is this? Seriously.

344
00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:06,646
That depends on you.

345
00:31:07,276 --> 00:31:10,266
We came to ask you something about Ms. Park Ye Young.

346
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:12,606
The victim of the Seocho-dong murder case.

347
00:31:12,606 --> 00:31:15,596
The female employee of the entertainment establishment you ran.

348
00:31:15,596 --> 00:31:18,846
What about the dead girl all of a sudden again?

349
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:20,946
You knew she had a boyfriend, didn't you?

350
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:21,966
Who was it?

351
00:31:21,966 --> 00:31:24,146
Boyfriend?

352
00:31:24,146 --> 00:31:25,596
You're at it again.

353
00:31:25,596 --> 00:31:27,536
- Again and again. 
 - No, wait!

354
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:30,246
Wait! Give me a second.

355
00:31:30,246 --> 00:31:34,006
I also just sensed that she had one.

356
00:31:34,006 --> 00:31:36,046
I really don't know who he is.

357
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:38,286
I swear! I swear!

358
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:41,046
You know as well, Prosecutor.

359
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:43,666
Checking on the girls isn't easy.

360
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:48,216
They gave birth even during the Korean War, so how can I control that?

361
00:31:48,216 --> 00:31:51,756
Ye Young was also the same case.

362
00:31:51,756 --> 00:31:54,146
And then, when she needed some money,

363
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:57,666
she asked me to introduce her to Chief Lee.

364
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,926
- What? 
 - Huh?

365
00:31:59,926 --> 00:32:01,017
K-Korean...

366
00:32:01,017 --> 00:32:02,036
W-War?

367
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:04,436
No, after that. Introducing the Chief.

368
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:06,646
Y-Yes, yes.

369
00:32:06,646 --> 00:32:12,036
S-She asked me to introduce her to Chief Lee.

370
00:32:12,036 --> 00:32:15,026
- You weren't the one who introduced him? 
 - Y-Yes.

371
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:18,236
S-She asked me one day, out of nowhere...

372
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:21,686
to be introduced to the Chief.

373
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:23,366
 What?

374
00:32:23,366 --> 00:32:25,476
 That guy you know, Oppa.

375
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:26,986
 Introduce me to him.

376
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,376
 Chief Prosecutor Lee Jang Won.

377
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:32,176
 Why all of a sudden?

378
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:34,626
 You don't like old men.

379
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:49,776
 Why did she want to be introduced to the Chief?

380
00:32:49,776 --> 00:32:51,806
Well, that's...

381
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:53,506
Wait, my voice is gone.

382
00:32:53,506 --> 00:32:55,616
I need to grease my neck...

383
00:32:55,616 --> 00:32:56,766
It's gone?

384
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,436
You haven't come to your senses yet.

385
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:01,766
Oppa! Oppa! I got my voice back.

386
00:33:02,626 --> 00:33:04,526
I heard it clearly.

387
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:05,506
Oppa.

388
00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:07,926
 I did as you said, Oppa.

389
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:15,376
 But Oppa, must I do this?

390
00:33:17,026 --> 00:33:19,826
 I'm not saying I don't want to do it...

391
00:33:19,826 --> 00:33:23,436
 but it's just that I already have you.

392
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:28,866
 All right.

393
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:30,566
 I'll contact you later.

394
00:33:30,566 --> 00:33:32,206
 Okay.

395
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,086
 Who were you talking so affectionately with?

396
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:43,076
 No, it's no one.

397
00:33:43,076 --> 00:33:45,266
 Just an oppa I know.

398
00:33:46,746 --> 00:33:49,596
 That's a-all I know.

399
00:33:49,596 --> 00:33:52,246
Really! That's it.

400
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:57,146
I told everything to Prosecutor Oh regarding Ye Young's death.

401
00:33:57,146 --> 00:33:59,976
What are you saying you've been telling Oh Do Hwan?

402
00:33:59,976 --> 00:34:02,146
Gosh, seriously. This is so frustrating.

403
00:34:02,146 --> 00:34:04,486
Don't you know? Huh?

404
00:34:04,486 --> 00:34:09,286
I already told Oh Do Hwan that Chief Lee isn't the culprit.

405
00:34:09,286 --> 00:34:11,066
Explain yourself.

406
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,566
On the day...

407
00:34:12,566 --> 00:34:17,896
I went to take a picture of the Chief and Ye Young going into the same house...

408
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:23,226
there was one more guy on that day who came to Ye Young's house.

409
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:36,516
 Where's the memory card of the dashcam?

410
00:34:36,516 --> 00:34:37,816
Memory card of the dashcam...

411
00:34:37,816 --> 00:34:40,276
I said, where is the memory card of the dashcam?

412
00:34:41,686 --> 00:34:45,826
I also gave it to Prosecutor Oh Do Hwan...

413
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:53,196
Why? W-Wait.

414
00:34:53,196 --> 00:34:55,036
- You see, I was... 
 - Just die. Die, you idiot!

415
00:34:55,036 --> 00:34:58,076
- trying to— 
 - Bury. Bury him!

416
00:34:58,076 --> 00:34:59,866
Somebody help me!

417
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:01,576
Help!

418
00:35:33,626 --> 00:35:35,826

419
00:35:40,376 --> 00:35:45,506

420
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:48,286
I keep asking you for favors.

421
00:35:48,286 --> 00:35:50,556
Tae Ho is doing well, right?

422
00:35:58,376 --> 00:36:01,296
It took you long enough.

423
00:36:01,296 --> 00:36:03,546
Long time no see.

424
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,596
Take a seat.

425
00:36:07,596 --> 00:36:09,876
Take a seat and talk.

426
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:16,396
You lost a lot of weight.

427
00:36:16,396 --> 00:36:20,446
I told the warden here to make it convenient for you, so—

428
00:36:20,446 --> 00:36:22,976
I want to get out.

429
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:27,196
I know it's not hard for you to do, Hyeong Gyu.

430
00:36:27,196 --> 00:36:31,016
Please let me out whether it be an arrest without restraint or something.

431
00:36:31,016 --> 00:36:33,976
The situation isn't good.

432
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:37,556
We can be dragged down if we make a hasty move.

433
00:36:37,556 --> 00:36:41,016
There's also a lot of attention on you right now, so

434
00:36:41,016 --> 00:36:44,166
let's just endure it a bit longer, Tae Ho.

435
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:51,936
Are you saying you got a new dog?

436
00:36:55,816 --> 00:37:00,236
So far, I have done everything and anything you ordered me to do.

437
00:37:00,236 --> 00:37:03,796
I got my hands dirty while doing things a prosecutor shouldn't do.

438
00:37:03,796 --> 00:37:05,826
However...

439
00:37:06,926 --> 00:37:10,326
is this the consequence of that loyalty?

440
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:12,956
In the few days I haven't seen you...

441
00:37:12,956 --> 00:37:16,526
you became quite rude, Tae Ho.

442
00:37:18,076 --> 00:37:19,936
Let's go.

443
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:25,576
I know everything you did.

444
00:37:30,536 --> 00:37:33,746
If I open my mouth, it's also over for you.

445
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:38,786
So let me out right now.

446
00:37:38,786 --> 00:37:40,876
If you don't...

447
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:45,486
I'll expose everything you did in the past.

448
00:37:45,486 --> 00:37:50,016
Tae Ho, let go of me.

449
00:37:50,016 --> 00:37:52,786
Or else your family will die.

450
00:37:56,196 --> 00:37:59,386
Do you want to become like your friend right now?

451
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:15,276
You...

452
00:38:17,776 --> 00:38:20,716
take a good look at me right this moment.

453
00:38:23,836 --> 00:38:26,756
You'll soon become like me.

454
00:38:33,176 --> 00:38:35,396
Please stay healthy.

455
00:38:46,246 --> 00:38:49,806

456
00:38:50,636 --> 00:38:53,256
 What if you're not the culprit?

457
00:38:53,256 --> 00:38:55,716
 I'm the culprit.

458
00:39:00,056 --> 00:39:04,546
 I... I'm saying I killed that woman.

459
00:39:05,706 --> 00:39:07,586
 Happy now?

460
00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:09,696
Why did you make a false confession?

461
00:39:09,696 --> 00:39:12,486

462
00:39:16,786 --> 00:39:18,646
I processed Yoo Jin Chul as arrested.

463
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:22,906
He was thankful to me, saying the detention center is better.

464
00:39:22,906 --> 00:39:26,316
Also, I do have one thing that bothers me about

465
00:39:26,316 --> 00:39:30,016
what you asked me to look into on Kim Hyo Jun...

466
00:39:30,966 --> 00:39:33,046
Where are the others?

467
00:39:34,426 --> 00:39:36,646
This is the people's Civil Service Division.

468
00:39:36,646 --> 00:39:38,716
So we need to do our job.

469
00:39:39,736 --> 00:39:40,986

470
00:39:40,986 --> 00:39:45,616
Please do our Green Mothers' Association's traffic volunteer service in our place.

471
00:39:50,196 --> 00:39:51,496
Stop laughing.

472
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:54,126
Hurry and go. All of you.

473
00:39:56,206 --> 00:39:59,436
Looking for a live croquis model.

474
00:40:17,086 --> 00:40:19,746
 He's so handsome...

475
00:40:22,996 --> 00:40:26,476
Please perform volunteer barber service for the homeless.

476
00:40:36,526 --> 00:40:40,146
Don't use the one you use for killing people,

477
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,636
use these instead, please...

478
00:40:42,636 --> 00:40:44,366
Your mouth.

479
00:40:45,656 --> 00:40:47,176
What's the thing that bothers you?

480
00:40:47,176 --> 00:40:48,966
Oh, the thing is...

481
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:52,816
he bought the house he used to live in via his attorney while serving his sentence.

482
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:54,316
It used to be monthly rent...

483
00:40:54,316 --> 00:40:57,776

but he bought it above market value.

484
00:40:57,776 --> 00:40:59,706
Isn't it fishy?

485
00:40:59,706 --> 00:41:02,126
Why did he buy a deteriorating

486
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,846
half-underground villa at a price higher than the market value?

487
00:41:04,846 --> 00:41:08,256
With that money, he can buy an officetel in that neighborhood.

488
00:41:08,256 --> 00:41:11,966

489
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:45,816
That's it.

490
00:41:50,356 --> 00:41:51,816
Let's go.

491
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:08,896
The clue must be here.

492
00:42:08,896 --> 00:42:11,346
The clue for why Kim Hyo Jun took the place for the real culprit.

493
00:42:11,346 --> 00:42:12,906
Let's start.

494
00:42:24,636 --> 00:42:28,156

495
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:04,976
Did you find anything?

496
00:43:04,976 --> 00:43:07,516
It seems he had financial problems.

497
00:43:14,043 --> 00:43:16,956

498
00:43:16,956 --> 00:43:18,666
Collection of debt?

499
00:43:32,596 --> 00:43:34,066
Why?

500
00:44:50,123 --> 00:44:52,083
Have you been well?

501
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,773
You said you had something to say.

502
00:44:58,773 --> 00:45:00,733
That's why I came out.

503
00:45:03,093 --> 00:45:05,953
You must have a lot of time on your hands.

504
00:45:07,633 --> 00:45:09,383
Please go back.

505
00:45:10,763 --> 00:45:13,683
A witness for the real culprit came forward.

506
00:45:32,673 --> 00:45:34,823
- What the hell is this? 
 - I'll ask you again.

507
00:45:34,823 --> 00:45:36,923
What the hell is this, you jerk?

508
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:42,853
Did you really kill Park Ye Young?

509
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:46,243
Just try touching that... I'll kill you. You understand?

510
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,703
I'm going to kill you.

511
00:45:48,703 --> 00:45:50,653
Sit down.

512
00:45:50,653 --> 00:45:53,273
Or you won't ever see me again.

513
00:45:57,513 --> 00:45:59,533
It was about two billion won.

514
00:45:59,533 --> 00:46:02,923
The one who paid you wouldn't have paid you at once.

515
00:46:03,623 --> 00:46:05,623
Is it the contract fee?

516
00:46:05,623 --> 00:46:08,953
If you're to be paid the same amount on the day of finishing your sentence

517
00:46:08,953 --> 00:46:12,043
it'd be 20 years... for four billion won.

518
00:46:12,043 --> 00:46:14,273
Damn... It's a billion won salary.

519
00:46:14,273 --> 00:46:16,333
What the hell do you want?

520
00:46:17,593 --> 00:46:19,623
The truth.

521
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:21,443
Truth...

522
00:46:24,193 --> 00:46:26,193
I don't think you should be laughing.

523
00:46:26,193 --> 00:46:28,923
Your hostage is in my hands.

524
00:46:28,923 --> 00:46:31,373
This crazy bastard...

525
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:32,833
Try and do as you please.

526
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:35,123
You'll be the first one I go to on my release day.

527
00:46:35,123 --> 00:46:37,873
You don't know me well enough yet, huh.

528
00:46:40,213 --> 00:46:42,243

Gosh...

529
00:46:44,503 --> 00:46:47,613

530
00:46:48,653 --> 00:46:51,093
 - Yes, Prosecutor.  
 - Hey.

531
00:46:51,093 --> 00:46:52,713
Burn all the money.

532
00:46:52,713 --> 00:46:55,663
- What are you doing? 
 - What do you mean?

533
00:46:55,663 --> 00:46:58,523
Talk then...  about what happened...

534
00:46:58,523 --> 00:47:00,493
at the Seocho-dong murder case.

535
00:47:00,493 --> 00:47:02,323
Stop annoying me.

536
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:13,673
Let's do it this way.

537
00:47:13,673 --> 00:47:14,786
I'll think about it a little more.

538
00:47:14,786 --> 00:47:17,956
- For now, don't touch the money. 
 - How did it go, Chul Ki?

539
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:21,213
 I'm ready, Prosecutor.

540
00:47:27,663 --> 00:47:29,183
I'll give you three seconds.

541
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:31,043
This is your last chance.

542
00:47:31,043 --> 00:47:33,523
Three, two, one.

543
00:47:34,723 --> 00:47:37,153
- Hey, burn them. 
 - I'll talk!

544
00:47:41,013 --> 00:47:43,043
I didn't...

545
00:47:45,293 --> 00:47:47,213
kill that woman.

546
00:47:50,103 --> 00:47:51,803
Give me more in detail.

547
00:47:54,993 --> 00:47:57,723
I-It wasn't me...

548
00:47:57,723 --> 00:48:00,553
I don't even know that woman.

549
00:48:17,883 --> 00:48:19,403
 What?

550
00:48:19,403 --> 00:48:22,013
 It's okay. Tell me honestly.

551
00:48:22,013 --> 00:48:25,933
 I had you on the old man to get his item. Did you grow feelings for him?

552
00:48:25,933 --> 00:48:27,093
 Or is it money?

553
00:48:27,093 --> 00:48:29,083
 How could you...

554
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:31,203
 How could you say that to me?

555
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:33,303
 Why can't I?

556
00:48:34,383 --> 00:48:37,033
 You're just a bar girl.

557
00:48:37,033 --> 00:48:39,023
 Yes, I'm a bar girl.

558
00:48:39,023 --> 00:48:40,243
 Then what about you?

559
00:48:40,243 --> 00:48:42,643
 What makes you so high and mighty?

560
00:48:42,643 --> 00:48:46,153
 All of your money and background aren't yours. It's all your father's.

561
00:48:47,243 --> 00:48:48,813
 Say that again.

562
00:48:48,813 --> 00:48:50,853
 What about my father's background?

563
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:54,673
 Say that again.

564
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:11,753
 Don't come closer. I'll stab you.

565
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:17,703
 Come here.

566
00:49:17,703 --> 00:49:20,313
 You're going to die today.

567
00:49:47,493 --> 00:49:49,773
You didn't see the culprit's face?

568
00:50:14,043 --> 00:50:16,383

(T/N: Number for police in Korea)

569
00:50:47,243 --> 00:50:48,793
 Hello?

570
00:50:48,793 --> 00:50:50,643
 Mr. Kim Hyo Jun?

571
00:50:57,293 --> 00:50:59,393
 W-Who is it?

572
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:01,563
 You saw me earlier.

573
00:51:02,723 --> 00:51:05,353
 I have a favor to ask of you, Mr. Kim Hyo Jun.

574
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:09,223
He had a mid-to-low tone and a soft voice.

575
00:51:09,223 --> 00:51:11,263
But he said something like this.

576
00:51:12,033 --> 00:51:15,463
"It won't take long. I'll let you out soon."

577
00:51:15,463 --> 00:51:18,083
 I asked him how I could trust him, and he said he could do it.

578
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:20,516
 He said not to worry because there are many methods like

579
00:51:20,516 --> 00:51:22,376
 suspension of sentence and such.

580
00:53:07,193 --> 00:53:08,863
Okay.

581
00:53:08,863 --> 00:53:10,353
I'll see you later.

582
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,793
Prosecutor!

583
00:53:13,793 --> 00:53:15,333
What about my money?

584
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:16,883
Nothing's free in this world.

585
00:53:16,883 --> 00:53:19,123
Cooperate with me from now on, no matter what.

586
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:55,033
What do I do? I think he told Prosecutor Jin everything.

587
00:54:02,103 --> 00:54:04,403
Where did Prosecutor Jin belong again?

588
00:54:04,403 --> 00:54:06,923
I think it was the Civil or something.

589
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:08,623
The Civil Service Division.

590
00:54:08,623 --> 00:54:10,383
Park Jae Kyung?

591
00:54:11,413 --> 00:54:17,153
By the way, Father... about Attorney Oh Do Hwan...

592
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:18,023
Yes.

593
00:54:18,023 --> 00:54:20,973
Why did you accept him all of a sudden?

594
00:54:39,063 --> 00:54:42,163
Father... Why?

595
00:54:42,163 --> 00:54:45,793
Why did you do that? What did I do wrong?

596
00:54:45,793 --> 00:54:47,903
You really don't know?

597
00:54:50,433 --> 00:54:54,753
It's an even bigger problem then.

598
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:56,283
Why...

599
00:54:56,283 --> 00:54:57,953
Father...

600
00:54:59,013 --> 00:55:02,723
If you keep leaving behind traces like that, Ji Han...

601
00:55:02,723 --> 00:55:05,523
I'll disown you.

602
00:55:08,823 --> 00:55:10,993
Father...

603
00:55:10,993 --> 00:55:14,093
Daddy is a man of his word.

604
00:55:16,033 --> 00:55:18,333
So let's keep things nice and clean.

605
00:55:48,343 --> 00:55:55,553

606
00:55:56,533 --> 00:55:59,943
 This program has a two-fold security.

607
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:02,543
 After getting the password incorrect more than twice,

608
00:56:02,543 --> 00:56:05,263
 then everything inside will get erased, regardless of what's inside.

609
00:56:05,263 --> 00:56:08,013
♫  It's miserable, miserable  ♫

610
00:56:08,013 --> 00:56:14,923
♫  I believed that something would be a little different 
 from yesterday, mistake, mistake  ♫

611
00:56:14,923 --> 00:56:16,443
♫  My bad  ♫

612
00:56:17,803 --> 00:56:22,893
 Prosecutor Jin... You asked about my family's whereabouts last time, right?

613
00:56:24,173 --> 00:56:26,053
 They're dead. All of them.

614
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:28,623
♫  Look carefully, look at me  ♫

615
00:56:28,623 --> 00:56:30,663
 An incident disguised as an accident.

616
00:56:30,663 --> 00:56:32,743
 There was nothing I could do.

617
00:56:32,743 --> 00:56:35,413
♫  The more you swallow, the stronger you become  ♫

618
00:56:35,413 --> 00:56:39,623
♫  I need just one bite, yeah, just one bite  ♫

619
00:56:39,623 --> 00:56:42,323

628
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,053
Who is it?

629
00:57:18,053 --> 00:57:19,783
 It's me.

630
00:57:43,123 --> 00:57:45,603
I heard you caught who killed the Chief.

631
00:57:48,273 --> 00:57:50,333
Good job.

632
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:54,013
You made your wish come true, so bring me the item.

633
00:58:00,823 --> 00:58:03,113
I checked the contents inside.

634
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:06,133
There's a file with a password on it.

635
00:58:06,133 --> 00:58:09,343
According to Go Joong Do, only the owner can unlock it.

636
00:58:09,343 --> 00:58:13,223
After three wrong tries, everything inside will be wiped clean.

637
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,253
You know what it is, don't you, Director?

638
00:58:16,133 --> 00:58:18,403
You know what's inside this.

639
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:23,063
As I told you, Prosecutor Jin...

640
00:58:23,063 --> 00:58:26,103
- I don't want you to become like me. 
 - Just tell me...

641
00:58:32,533 --> 00:58:34,193
Mister.

642
00:58:34,843 --> 00:58:37,803

643
00:58:39,343 --> 00:58:41,103
 Mister!

644
00:58:44,363 --> 00:58:46,543
 You left this.

645
00:58:46,543 --> 00:58:48,353
 I see.

646
00:58:48,353 --> 00:58:50,603
 Thank you.

647
00:58:50,603 --> 00:58:53,013
 By the way, Mister...

648
00:58:53,013 --> 00:58:55,473
 my mom said you're a swordsman. 
 (T/N: Sounds like "prosecutor")

649
00:58:55,473 --> 00:58:59,523
♫  It leaves me a countless questions  ♫

650
00:58:59,523 --> 00:59:03,153
♫  You forget your true feelings and chase  ♫

651
00:59:03,153 --> 00:59:05,393
 The Swordsman who Protects Justice?

652
00:59:05,393 --> 00:59:07,963
 This is you, right?

653
00:59:07,963 --> 00:59:11,703
 Why don't you carry your sword, Mister?

654
00:59:11,703 --> 00:59:15,583
♫  It's natural that you can be covered  ♫

655
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:19,143
 This is a secret, but...

656
00:59:19,143 --> 00:59:21,503
 I only use it to get the bad guys.

657
00:59:21,503 --> 00:59:24,323
 I hid it for now...

658
00:59:24,323 --> 00:59:26,123
 so no one knows.

659
00:59:26,123 --> 00:59:27,643
 Like a lightsaber?

660
00:59:27,643 --> 00:59:30,053
 That's right. If I just swing it around,

661
00:59:30,053 --> 00:59:32,503
 then people will be scared.

662
00:59:33,884 --> 00:59:36,044
 I also want to become a swordsman!
