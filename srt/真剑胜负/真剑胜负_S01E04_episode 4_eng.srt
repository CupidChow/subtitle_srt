1
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:39,698

2
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:44,098
 Let's meet briefly.

3
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:48,208
There's something I need to tell you.

4
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,348
It's something that you must hear as well.

5
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:52,628
Right now?

6
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:57,608
 At Banpo-dong, there's a new legal complex.

7
00:00:57,608 --> 00:00:59,988
It's still in the makings,

8
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:02,928
but let's meet there.

9
00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:04,718
 I'll be there right away.

10
00:02:11,658 --> 00:02:14,778

11
00:02:18,558 --> 00:02:21,268
 The person you are calling is not available...

12
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,138

13
00:04:10,638 --> 00:04:16,528

14
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:25,098

15
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,458

16
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:31,078
It's a check.

17
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:32,748
Escaped.

18
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,248
Check!

19
00:04:38,248 --> 00:04:40,518
It's too bad for you, Mr. Seo.

20
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:43,628
Looks like I won today.

21
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:49,558
He's a setting sun.

22
00:04:49,558 --> 00:04:52,898
Mr. Seo isn't as good anymore.

23
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:55,428
Did my opponent go somewhere?

24
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,468
Father.

25
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:59,238
Oh, you're here?

26
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:10,948
What's this? Is it a draw?

27
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:14,138
Mr. Seo didn't play yet.

28
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:17,258
So it's a draw in this case.

29
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:18,978
Gosh, what do we do?

30
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:21,398
Let's just call it a draw today.

31
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:23,938
But I was wining this game.

32
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:26,278
It's because my son's here.

33
00:05:26,278 --> 00:05:28,028
- Next time, okay? 
 - My goodness...

34
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,888
Come on, I was wining the game.

35
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:31,298
W-What?

36
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,848
Gosh...

37
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:35,018
Supreme Court Justice Shin Yong Woon contacted me, Father...

38
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:37,008
saying that he wants to meet you.

39
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:39,028
Why's that, all of a sudden?

40
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:41,488
He's been accused of sexual assault on a restaurant waitress.

41
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:44,978
The woman pressed charges, and the case is being investigated.

42
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,868
Gosh, that old man still got the stamina.

43
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:51,588
What's he been eating?

44
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:54,448
How much of his term is left?

45
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:56,668
About three months.

46
00:05:56,668 --> 00:05:58,858
What he has to gain at the end of his term,

47
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,118
for him to ask me to cover it up for him?

48
00:06:01,118 --> 00:06:02,618
We have nothing to gain here.

49
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:04,668
Don't even answer his calls.

50
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:05,978
Okay.

51
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,218
I think Minister Rim of the Department of Justice is

52
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:12,998
thinking of someone else for the Central District Prosecutors' Office's Prosecutor General.

53
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,118
Without even consulting you?

54
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:17,788
You go and have a word with Minister Rim.

55
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:22,458
His head got too big from getting spoiled by me.

56
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:30,408
 Chief Prosecutor Lee Jang Won, who has been the prime suspect

57
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:32,378
 in the Seocho-dong murder case was found dead.

58
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:35,448
 After analyzing the nearby CCTVs, the Prosecution

59
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:37,698
 stated against possibilities of murder

60
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:40,568
 and is now investigating further.

61
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:51,268
Don't you think there's more to the Chief's suicide yesterday?

62
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:53,368
Of course, we weren't born yesterday.

63
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:54,978
Just pretend not to know anything.

64
00:06:54,978 --> 00:06:57,378
You don't want to get caught up in this mess.

65
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:09,548
Prosecutor Oh, what are you going to do now?

66
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:11,128
What can he possibly do?

67
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:13,418
He's been left hanging.

68
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:16,208
I can't believe I'm pitying the golden boy, Oh Do Hwan.

69
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:22,238
You must have a bitter taste in your mouth.

70
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:23,448
Have one more cup on me.

71
00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:26,038
Let's do a farewell party for you on Friday.

72
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:27,668
I'll call you up.

73
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,858
So you're saying...

74
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:42,978
the Chief is not the culprit of the Seocho-dong murder case?

75
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:47,138
I confirmed his alibi. August 12 at 9 p.m.

76
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:49,088
The hotel restaurant's CCTV.

77
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:54,538
Then why? Why did he jump off the building?

78
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,758
I need to figure that out.

79
00:07:57,758 --> 00:08:00,328
The only thing I can tell you right now is

80
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:03,588
that he might not have killed himself.

81
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:05,698
He said there was something he needed to tell me.

82
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:07,858
That wa something that I must hear.

83
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:13,238
These are the people that the Chief contacted before his death.

84
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:15,548
The conversation was all the same.

85
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:17,408
"I've got new business cards as a lawyer now."

86
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:20,018
"Let's meet in the near future."

87
00:08:20,018 --> 00:08:24,298
He even ordered a present for his granddaughter's birthday next week.

88
00:08:24,298 --> 00:08:28,128
It doesn't make sense for him to kill himself.

89
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:31,798
There's a lot to look into.

90
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:33,968
We have to investigate this.

91
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,118
Fine.

92
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:39,748
I admit that you do have a point up to a certain degree.

93
00:08:39,748 --> 00:08:42,448
However... we can't investigate this.

94
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:46,478
- A Ra... 
 - I don't need to tell you that what you're doing is speculating right now.

95
00:08:46,478 --> 00:08:49,958
Or that we can't start an investigation based only on your words alone, without any evidence.

96
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:54,438
Also, you coming to talk to me is technically an abuse of power.

97
00:08:54,438 --> 00:08:57,918
You are crossing a line, Prosecutor Jin of the Civil Service Division.

98
00:08:58,758 --> 00:09:00,088
Return to the Civil Service Division.

99
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:02,608
Entrust the Chief's case to the Criminal Division.

100
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:05,518
All right.

101
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:10,338
For now, we'll take your words into consideration.

102
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:12,638
You stay there for a while and don't think about anythingâ€”

103
00:09:12,638 --> 00:09:14,648
I'll find the evidence and bring it in.

104
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:18,898
- Substantial evidence that you can't help but start an investigation. 
 - What?

105
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:21,788
Just sit tight and wait.

106
00:09:22,618 --> 00:09:24,868
I'll scoop the evidence and feed it to you.

107
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:28,498
H-How come I can never get through to you?

108
00:09:28,498 --> 00:09:29,578
Hey!

109
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:32,708
I'm not saying that I won't investigate because I don't want to.

110
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,318
The cause itself can't be established at all!

111
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:37,968
So I'm saying that I'll go and find it! 
  (T/N: Said without the honorifics)

112
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:40,598
You punk, you keep skipping the honorifics more and more!

113
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:46,088
Gosh, that little...

114
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:11,918
He has a daughter who is grieving his death.

115
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:15,528
Tell her that I'll be visiting her in person...

116
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:19,058
and process the Chief's death as a death in the line of duty.

117
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:20,528
All right.

118
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:26,078
Prosecutor Shin.

119
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,428
Would this not have happened if I had served the Chief a little better?

120
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:34,488
Deputy Chief...

121
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,208
That's what I started thinking about after hearing of his death.

122
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,838
That I...

123
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:47,118
might have aided in the Chief's decision to take his life.

124
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,498
How's Prosecutor Jin doing?

125
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:05,168
He's claiming that Chief Lee Jang Won might not have killed himself.

126
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:06,918
What is he talking about?

127
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:12,508
It's still only a speculation, but since this is a grave matter,

128
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:16,518
I think we shouldn't leave even the smallest stone unturned.

129
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:20,588
So you're saying...

130
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:25,348
you want to investigate this case as a possible homicide?

131
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:29,648
"A prosecutor mustn't leave behind any suspicion unchecked."

132
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:33,238
That's what you told Prosecutor Jin and me.

133
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:42,728
Please allow us to investigate Chief Lee Jang Won's case, Deputy Chief.

134
00:11:44,168 --> 00:11:45,768
Go ahead.

135
00:11:46,808 --> 00:11:49,978
I'll take responsibility for whatever the outcome is,

136
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:53,478
so you two do your best and focus on the investigation.

137
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,358
Let's go, buddy.

138
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:57,498
What's going on?

139
00:11:57,498 --> 00:11:59,378
You're here.

140
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:05,768
- Where did the other one go? 
 - Sorry?

141
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,008
Who?

142
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:09,018
Who could I be talking about but your owner?

143
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:10,908
Prosecutor Jin.

144
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:12,488
What...

145
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:14,618
That's true. Where did he go?

146
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:16,588
I think he was here just moments ago.

147
00:12:16,588 --> 00:12:19,318
Such a bullcrap.

148
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:20,958
Forget it, man!

149
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,218
One moment.

150
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:37,218

151
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,538
He's hanging up on me.

152
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:53,148

Why does he keep calling me?

153
00:12:54,928 --> 00:12:56,588
Can you do that?

154
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:57,948
What?

155
00:12:57,948 --> 00:13:00,128
One more yelling doesn't make a difference.

156
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:02,618
- Skip over to the next one. 
 - Okay.

157
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,328
He hung up again.

158
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:08,698
- Where the heck did he go? 
 - Well...

159
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,908
We also kept checking after this scene,

160
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:15,738
but he was the only one who went in.

161
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,968
Thank you.

162
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:26,848
Wait a second.

163
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:30,338
Why does the camera angle change here?

164
00:13:30,338 --> 00:13:33,748
That's obviously because the camera turned.

165
00:13:33,748 --> 00:13:35,818
The camera turned?

166
00:15:20,038 --> 00:15:22,618
 I checked all the CCTVs in the hallway.

167
00:15:22,618 --> 00:15:27,138
 No one entered the emergency exit after the Chief's death.

168
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:29,228
This is the only footage we have.

169
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,868
Following that exit is the underground parking lot.

170
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:33,518
What about the CCTVs there?

171
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:35,998
Perhaps, the black boxes on the cars?

172
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:37,308
Nothing.

173
00:15:37,308 --> 00:15:39,898
Because it's still before moving in.

174
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:45,258
Yes, Investigator.

175
00:15:47,818 --> 00:15:50,808
Okay, I understand.

176
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:52,428
The Warrant Judge is away at the moment.

177
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:55,138
It's going to take a while to get the Chief's call records.

178
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:58,758
Gosh... what's the use of doing things legally?

179
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:01,168
The law doesn't help me.

180
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:07,358
Why is he calling at a time like this?

181
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:14,308
 - Hello?  
 - Yes, Prosecutor.

182
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,008
Hey!

183
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:19,298
What's that? Have you gone mad?

184
00:16:19,298 --> 00:16:21,758
No, not you, Prosecutor.

185
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:23,588
Let's hack into a call record.

186
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:25,838
All of a sudden?

187
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:27,718
I'll text you the number.

188
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:30,678
I'm going to depart now, so have it ready for viewing.

189
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:36,898
- You... 
 - What now? You said he's away.

190
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:41,098
Let's go.

191
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:42,888
Okay, let's go.

192
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:51,888
I'd appreciate it if you could reconsider the next

193
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:54,648
Prosecutor General of the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

194
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,528
This is the list of candidates that we prepared.

195
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:13,848
I'm not sure...

196
00:17:13,848 --> 00:17:16,388
I understand the CEO's intentions, but

197
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:18,568
there is such a strong will from the higher-ups

198
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:22,468
regarding this appointment.

199
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:26,108
I think it'll be difficult to follow the CEO's appointments.

200
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:29,818
I'll visit the CEO soon and ask for his understanding, soâ€”

201
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:32,288
It wasn't just your head that got big.

202
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:37,488
Your balls also grew, dear Minister.

203
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:40,288
Even if you're the son of the CEO,

204
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:43,228
I would like you to mind your manners.

205
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,028
I work for the CEO,

206
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:47,818
not for you, Attorney Seo.

207
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:52,438
Okay, I understand for now. Let me apologize.

208
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,628
However, he next Prosecutor General should be this man.

209
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:00,928
You need to save your daughter, don't you?

210
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:05,188
Acute myeloid leukemia.

211
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:09,038
Your daughter is your only child without any siblings...

212
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:11,188
It's one out of 20,000, right?

213
00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:13,138
The probability of compatibility for non-family members.

214
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:15,028
Are you threatening me?

215
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,848
No, no.

216
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:18,508
How could I?

217
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:22,688
I'm giving you an offer.

218
00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:25,238
Your daughter's bone marrow donor...

219
00:18:27,568 --> 00:18:29,608
is under my custody.

220
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:35,448

221
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,948
Please answer.

222
00:18:37,948 --> 00:18:40,838
It's your one and only daughter.

223
00:18:43,978 --> 00:18:46,458

224
00:18:51,248 --> 00:18:53,948

225
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:56,458
Han Soo Bin...

226
00:18:58,198 --> 00:18:59,948
What about that person?

227
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:05,378
I'm going to confirm the list.

228
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,778
Please ask the National Forensic Service for an autopsy.

229
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:09,528
O-Okay, well...

230
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:11,068
Okay.

231
00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:15,888
Thank you.

232
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:18,908
Don't mention it.

233
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:24,258

234
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:39,028

235
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:47,628

236
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:54,618

237
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:56,458

238
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,318

239
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,128

240
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:04,428

241
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,828
Yes, I did get a call from him

242
00:20:21,828 --> 00:20:24,478
soon after Ye Young was killed.

243
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:26,108
He said he wanted to ask a few things.

244
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:27,678
Ask you a few things?

245
00:20:32,158 --> 00:20:33,778
 There was nothing special.

246
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:37,138
 It was stuff like, "Did you hear anything before Ye Young passed away?"

247
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:39,408
"Did you receive anything from her?" Stuff like that.

248
00:20:39,408 --> 00:20:42,428
What could you have received from Ms. Park Ye Young?

249
00:20:42,428 --> 00:20:44,698
It was mostly what Mister bought her.

250
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:47,728
Bags, shoes, and perfumes...

251
00:20:47,728 --> 00:20:50,658
Actually, Ye Young didn't really like those things.

252
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:54,038
That's why I was really surprised when Mister called me.

253
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:57,628
I was worried that he'd ask for me to return everything he had bought Ye Young.

254
00:20:57,628 --> 00:21:00,908
I also really got close to Kitty.

255
00:21:00,908 --> 00:21:03,608
Luckily, he didn't ask to have them back.

256
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:11,778
By the way, is it true?

257
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:14,738
- Is Mister really the one who killedâ€” 
 - One minute, please.

258
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:16,728
By "Kitty," do you mean Ms. Park Ye Young's cat?

259
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:18,628
Yes, that's right.

260
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:21,318
Do you happen to know where that cat is right now?

261
00:21:21,318 --> 00:21:23,628
She's at my house.

262
00:21:23,628 --> 00:21:27,078
I got her shortly before Ye Young passed away.

263
00:21:44,878 --> 00:21:47,168
What is this thing next to the car here?

264
00:21:47,168 --> 00:21:48,428
Oh, this?

265
00:21:48,428 --> 00:21:49,688
It's an MP3.

266
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:50,738
An MP3?

267
00:21:50,738 --> 00:21:53,298
There is a cat house on top of the cat tower.

268
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:56,378
I guess it must've been there. She was chewing on it one day.

269
00:21:56,378 --> 00:21:58,468
Do you also happen to have it with you as well?

270
00:21:58,468 --> 00:22:00,038
No, I don't.

271
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:02,598
- Mister took it back. 
 - Sorry?

272
00:22:02,598 --> 00:22:05,798
I also showed these pictures to Mister.

273
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:09,418
He said that's what he was looking for.

274
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:15,168
- An MP3? 
  - Yes.

275
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,848
Is there anything that came out of the Chief's belongings?

276
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:19,438
Wait a second.

277
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:29,708
Nothing, but why are you asking?

278
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,758
Chief Lee Jang Won was looking into the

279
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:34,348
Seocho-dong murder case on his own.

280
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:39,968
You're saying that his death is related to Seocho-dong?

281
00:22:39,968 --> 00:22:42,948
Yes, it's highly likely, although we can't be sure yet.

282
00:22:42,948 --> 00:22:44,868
The MP3 that you just spoke of...

283
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:48,298
I guess it could also be related to the incidents.

284
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:51,868
It's our homework to find out how it is related.

285
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:55,348
It's surely an important item if the Chief was looking for it.

286
00:22:55,348 --> 00:22:57,798
 The problem is its location.

287
00:22:57,798 --> 00:22:59,498
 What about your end?

288
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:07,448
 There are bruises and hemorrhaging from his head to his lower back.

289
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:09,798
 So he didn't fall on his head first vertically?

290
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:13,148
Yes, I think his upper and lower body fell at the same time

291
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:15,588
 while his body was parallel to the ground.

292
00:23:16,638 --> 00:23:18,368
He might not have fallen on his own, then.

293
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:19,798
Any other circumstances?

294
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,098
A bruise around his armpit.

295
00:23:22,098 --> 00:23:26,768
I think this is a sign of someone moving his body before he died and

296
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:34,278
there is a puncture wound on his neck...

297
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:36,558
like an injection needle.

298
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:37,948
What?

299
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:41,858
What about the autopsy?

300
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,548
We're going to do it now.

301
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,178
Please start.

302
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:57,778
Scalpel.

303
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:06,398

304
00:24:09,068 --> 00:24:10,818

305
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:12,928
Is this confirmed information?

306
00:24:12,928 --> 00:24:15,188
Yes. It's just as you see.

307
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:17,618
There was a bruise on the armpit.

308
00:24:17,618 --> 00:24:22,668
That means somebody moved the Chief before...he died, doesn't it?

309
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:24,638
What you see on both armpits

310
00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:26,498
are not bruises but lividities.

311
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,798
The trace of the injection needle around the neck

312
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:30,598
was a trace of extra-cervical nerve injection

313
00:24:30,598 --> 00:24:33,598
as you can see in the substance analysis report.

314
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,968
195th Article of the Criminal Code Reformation Proposal,

315
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:47,948
"A prosecutor and a judicial investigator must cooperate."

316
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:52,208
197th Article of the Criminal Code Reformation Proposal...

317
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:55,008

"A prosecutor may

318
00:24:55,008 --> 00:24:57,018
request a secure investigation from a judicial investigator

319
00:24:57,018 --> 00:24:59,848
and the judicial investigator may, without a proper cause..."

320
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:05,768
 The autopsy results of the NFS regarding Chief Lee Jang Won, who was found dead...

321
00:25:05,768 --> 00:25:08,878
 concluded that there were no signs of the possibility of murder.

322
00:25:08,878 --> 00:25:12,198
 The Prosecution, which stated that it respects the autopsy results of the NFS,

323
00:25:12,198 --> 00:25:14,998
 also stated that no sign of allegations for murder

324
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:17,218
 were found based on the investigation of the deceased.

325
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:21,098
 Expressing deep consolation and mourning to the bereaved family,

326
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:26,858
 the Prosecution stated the intention to conclude Chief Lee Jang Won's case as a suicide.

327
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:33,458
I'm worried... So worried.

328
00:25:43,728 --> 00:25:45,868
Tomorrow is the Chief's burial.

329
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:47,248
Go and express your condolences.

330
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:49,888
Why did the Chief call me out?

331
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:55,098
 There's something I need to tell you.

332
00:25:55,098 --> 00:25:58,528
 It's something that you must hear as well.

333
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,868
Even on the things that we thought we were right on...

334
00:26:00,868 --> 00:26:02,778
we turn out to be wrong sometimes.

335
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:05,468
The results indicated it was a suicide, Prosecutor Jin.

336
00:26:05,468 --> 00:26:08,708
Even if you can't understand it, it's the reality.

337
00:26:11,415 --> 00:26:14,198
We don't even have a cause to further our investigations.

338
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,718
The company seemed to have already finalized its positions.

339
00:26:17,718 --> 00:26:20,458
- So we should stop hereâ€” 
 - No.

340
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,368
We can't let it end like this.

341
00:26:22,368 --> 00:26:24,578
I can't let it end like this.

342
00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:26,418
I can't accept something that I don't understand

343
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,008
just because it's the reality.

344
00:26:29,008 --> 00:26:31,998
The evidence of suicide is clear. You're just being stubborn.

345
00:26:31,998 --> 00:26:34,188
It was the same with the Seocho-dong incident.

346
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:40,318
All the evidence pointed to deliveryman Kim Hyo Joon as the murderer of a woman in her 20s.

347
00:26:41,598 --> 00:26:44,308
But he's not the culprit.

348
00:26:44,308 --> 00:26:47,048
Reality and truth are different things.

349
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:50,168
I'm going to find the evidence of murder.

350
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:54,128
Okay.

351
00:26:54,128 --> 00:26:56,998
Let's say that there's something we didn't find yet.

352
00:26:56,998 --> 00:27:00,348
Something as substantial as the NFS's analysis report.

353
00:27:00,348 --> 00:27:03,458
What is that something exactly, though? How are you going to find it?

354
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:05,918
The case is going to be closed tomorrow as suicide,

355
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:09,938
so when and how are you going to find that unknown thing?

356
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:14,598
Starting now.

357
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:24,538
â™«  Deep, deep, the more you hide  â™«

358
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:28,068
â™«  I can see more clearly  â™«

359
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:29,778
â™«  Okay, hands off  â™«

360
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:31,578

361
00:27:31,578 --> 00:27:34,838
â™«  I can't stand it any longer  â™«

362
00:27:34,838 --> 00:27:38,208
â™«  You better run, run away, further away  â™«

363
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:41,778
â™«  Look forward to the big picture I've drawn so far  â™«

364
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:45,858
â™«  As you did, no more than that  â™«

365
00:27:45,858 --> 00:27:49,348
â™«  I'll give it back  â™«

366
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:52,828
â™«  Deep in the dark  â™«

367
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:56,128
â™«  Burn myself out more  â™«

368
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:01,908
â™«  Face the real one  â™«

369
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:05,478
â™«  No, you can't bring me down  â™«

370
00:28:09,158 --> 00:28:11,048
Do you want cup ramen?

371
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,000
Don't try too hard.

372
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,980
Honestly, it's not like you're avenging his death or

373
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,630
punishing his enemies, right?

374
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,480
Just live an easy life like the rest of us.

375
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,210
Nothing changes even if you strive.

376
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,800
You talk as if you've lived a life of strife.

377
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,710
I have no interest in your past, Director.

378
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,600
All I see is the "you" sitting in front of me right now.

379
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,440
Also, I don't even dream about following your footsteps.

380
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,710
So don't lecture me. I'm not going to listen anyway.

381
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,740
I just don't understand.

382
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:18,200
Why are you taking things this far?

383
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,220
Because no one else will.

384
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,040
Don't you know that those at the NFS are all on the same side?

385
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,710
Thanks for the meal.

386
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,750
Since you got up,

387
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,300
go throw out the paper garbage on that cart.

388
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,770
Gosh, I should go to sleep.

389
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,110

390
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:26,520
He always orders people around.

391
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,460
How did a person like him become a prosecutor?

392
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,260
Gosh...

393
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,750

394
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,690

395
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,730

396
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,280

397
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,790

398
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,150

399
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,730
Jung Jae Hoon...

400
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,540

401
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,280
- How old are you? 
 - I'm six years old.

402
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,520
- You're very young. 
 - No, I'm not.

403
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,760
Grandpa said that I'm a big girl now that I'm going to kindergarten.

404
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,230
Mister, do you know my grandpa?

405
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,850
I thought I did, but...

406
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,660
there's a lot that I didn't know.

407
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:15,200
Then... do you know when my grandpa is coming?

408
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:20,070
He promised that he would come to my birthday party.

409
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,960
May I help you?

410
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,560
You want to do a second autopsy?

411
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,810
I beg of you.

412
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,130
You're seriously a funny guy.

413
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,250
My father died because of you.

414
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,830
You should be kneeling down for forgiveness, but you are doing what?

415
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,750
Asking for a second autopsy?

416
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,500
This is the last day of my father's funeral.

417
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,280
I'll consider this your condolences.

418
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,260
Chief's autopsy report... might have been fabricated.

419
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,990
Besides that, there are too many

420
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,690
suspicious points to rule it as a suicide.

421
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,940
I know how hard it is to agree with a second autopsy, but...

422
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,710
I believe that we need to properly listen to the last words of a

423
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:21,360
deceased without any fallacy at the very least.

424
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,230
You can blame me for everything,

425
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,570
but, please, just don't avoid the truth.

426
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,420
I beg of you.

427
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,500
The NFS?

428
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,900
This is not a typical case.

429
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,770
There's something bigger behind the scenes, for sure.

430
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,530
The funeral cortege will take place soon, so there's no time.

431
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,800
Please request a warrant.

432
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,280
- What about you? 
 - I'll take care of the second autopsy.

433
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,000
Without anyone to meddle with it this time.

434
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,410
You're going to do a secret autopsy?

435
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,320
Don't tell me you're scheming something weird againâ€”

436
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,550
He's scheming... something weird...

437
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,480
Gosh...

438
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,560
Excuse us.

439
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,790
One moment, please.

440
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,740
I haven't seen you before. Who are you?

441
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,510
We're from the funeral home at Seorin Hospital.

442
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,020
The morgue there is completely full.

443
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,780
You must've not been contacted.

444
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,480
Please open up the coffin.

445
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,380
It's a simple confirmation process.

446
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,150
Please cooperate.

447
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,620

448
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,600
I can finally breathe.

449
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,910

450
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,000

451
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,550
Let's go.

452
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,080
W-Wait, what about me?

453
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,690
We pulled the plan in a rush, so...

454
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,210
- I think we forgot. 
 - Forgot what?

455
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,090
What is this?

456
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,000
- Get in. 
 - What?

457
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,270
You're taking too long, so I'm coming in.

458
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,370
Do you want everyone to die? Go back inside.

459
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,090
That can't be...

460
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:46,110
That's really not cool. I've done all the hard work so far.

461
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,400
I'm going in!

462
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,590
You go inâ€”

463
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,640
Isn't this way over the line?

464
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,800
How can you entrust an autopsy to the anatomy professor?

465
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,560
Especially a second autopsy?

466
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,390
We just have issues with the NFS.

467
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,720
We're going to bring the autopsy warrant anyway,

468
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,960
so do us this favor.

469
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,060
I can't do it. Bring the warrant first.

470
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,640
I want to do that,

471
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,430
but this can't wait.

472
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,760
Just this one time.

473
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,180
Please, help us.

474
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,270
Send in the official request and go through the procedures.

475
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,530
Here you go. It can't be done before that.

476
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,930
Whoa, what is this now?

477
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,640
I suddenly sense a wall between you and me.

478
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,400
A wall of perfection.

479
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,560
What?

480
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,020
Am I not right?

481
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,360
If you do this, I can't help but feel I'm hitting a wall.

482
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,350
The wall of perfection that you're putting between us.

483
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,840
Prosecutor, you are over the line.

484
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,220
Even I can't forgive something like that.

485
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,100
Gosh...

486
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,650
What the heck is that? Seriously.

487
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,330
Prosecutor Jin, are you an old man?

488
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:54,670
I can one for you, Professor.

489
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,640
Gosh.

490
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,760
Just this once, seriously.

491
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,730
Gosh, you're killing me here.

492
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,100
Just this once, okay?

493
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,640
Thank you.

494
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,950
I'll call you.

495
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,270
I don't get it, no matter how hard I think.

496
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,380
What?

497
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,180
The Professor.

498
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,280
How could she laugh at a joke like that?

499
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,100
Mark my words, Chul Ki.

500
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,900
When you're winning someone's heart, it's not the words that matter.

501
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,920
It's about who said those words that matter.

502
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,800
In this case, I'm a natural-born messenger.

503
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,530
It works every time.

504
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,810
- Isn't that so? 
 - Yes, Sir.

505
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,310
It works every time.

506
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,710
You need to learn to do these things, too.

507
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,860
- You can't keep working stiflingly like that. 
 - I'll remember that.

508
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,020

509
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,260
I'm asking for your authorization, Deputy Chief.

510
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,680
I understand the situation.

511
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,760
And Prosecutor Jin?

512
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,260
Prosecutor Jin convinced the family and is currently progressing with the second autopsy.

513
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:05,550

514
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,590
Good luck.

515
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,830
Thank you.

516
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,820
Please proceed with the funeral procession as planned.

517
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,720
If the funeral procession happens, how would you do the autopsy?

518
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,700
The autopsy will happen...

519
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:50,230
and an empty coffin will be used for the ceremony.

520
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,460
- Pardon? 
 - I'm sorry.

521
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,530
Since security is of the utmost importance,

522
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,030
I can't think of any other method.

523
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,850
I'll bring him as soon as we're done.

524
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,523
Please don't let people notice what we're doing until then.

525
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:04,223
Don't worry about it.

526
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,520
Thank you.

527
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,170
We're going to bring him back as soon as we're done.

528
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,120
- Be prepared. 
 - Okay.

529
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,260
Good job. Let's go eat.

530
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,620
I'll look for a good restaurant.

531
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,960
Me too.

532
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,420
Hey, but where's Go Joong Do?

533
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,840
That's right...

534
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,520
What?

535
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,340
Where is he?

536
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,350
Ye Ji, are you okay?

537
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,770
Yes.

538
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,320

The receiver is not available.

539
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,480
 Please try again later.

540
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,610

541
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,530
Why isn't she picking up?

542
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,450
Don't worry too much, Prosecutor.

543
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,630
It's not like there's no air inside.

544
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,770
He can endure for about two hours, probably.

545
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,370
Besides, they won't even bury him that deep.

546
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:15,180
- If we just dig him outâ€” 
 - Chief Lee Jang Won is not being buried.

547
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,620
- He's being cremated. 
 - What?

548
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,190
Why is he suddenly asking to meet here?

549
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,030
- I brought the warrant! 
 - Later, later!

550
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,750
W-What's going on?

551
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,060
What's the matter? Tell me the truth. Did you cause another trouble?

552
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,940
I don't have time to explain.

553
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:28,420
Jin Jung! You said you handled the Chief's autopsy, right?

554
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,180
Yes, I did just now. Why?

555
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,810
Then... what... what's that?

556
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:36,740

557
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,090
One, two, three...

558
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,300
Where's the other one? Wait, what was that guy's name?

559
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:10,248

560
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:13,768
Please stop Mr. Lee Jang Won's cremation right now!

561
00:44:14,745 --> 00:44:16,888
We're from the Prosecution. Please stop Mr. Lee Jang Won's cremation.

562
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:20,518
- What are you saying? 
 - A person's life is at stake. Hurry.

563
00:44:20,568 --> 00:44:23,438
- What does that mean? 
 - Why are you making me repeat myself?

564
00:44:23,438 --> 00:44:25,578
We don't have time. Stop it right now!

565
00:44:25,578 --> 00:44:27,498
Even if you say it like that,

566
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,668
we can't stop its operation from here.

567
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:32,438
Be clear so we can understand. Why can't you turn it off?

568
00:44:32,438 --> 00:44:35,858
The control panel is installed on the crematory furnace itself.

569
00:44:35,858 --> 00:44:40,378
If you want to stop its operation, you need to go to the third furnace yourself and...

570
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:42,328
Hurry... hurry, hurry!

571
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:46,038
The third one, the third one, the third one!

572
00:44:46,038 --> 00:44:49,158
Third one... one, two, three!

573
00:44:52,728 --> 00:44:55,208
Why is it in Chinese? I'm losing it.

574
00:45:00,578 --> 00:45:02,278
Gosh, it's so hot!

575
00:45:05,378 --> 00:45:06,538
The fire's coming out!

576
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:07,888
What are you doing? Hurry up and press it!

577
00:45:07,888 --> 00:45:10,558
- I-It's in Chinese! 
 - What?

578
00:45:10,558 --> 00:45:13,328
It's in Chinese, I said! What's "stop" in Chinese?

579
00:45:13,328 --> 00:45:15,328
"Stop" is "stop"! Why would it matter?

580
00:45:15,328 --> 00:45:16,768
Just press anything!

581
00:45:16,768 --> 00:45:20,558
Anything? Any... thing...

582
00:45:22,828 --> 00:45:24,708
- My goodness! 
 - What the hell are you doing?

583
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:27,678
- Wasn't the red one the power button? 
 - The red one is for more fire!

584
00:45:27,678 --> 00:45:29,368
Just hurry and press anything!

585
00:45:29,368 --> 00:45:32,668
Gosh... Okay, then.

586
00:45:35,098 --> 00:45:37,098
There's even more fire!

587
00:45:40,678 --> 00:45:43,828
What the hell are you doing? Just hurry and press anything!

588
00:45:46,145 --> 00:45:48,638
What's this?

589
00:45:48,638 --> 00:45:50,448
Gosh!

590
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:51,768
No way!

591
00:45:51,768 --> 00:45:54,308
This one really looks like the power button.

592
00:45:55,668 --> 00:45:57,538
No, no, no, that's for more fire!

593
00:45:57,538 --> 00:45:58,998
There's someone inside!

594
00:45:58,998 --> 00:46:02,188
I'm alive! Help me!

595
00:46:02,188 --> 00:46:04,568
Don't do it. Just don't press anything!

596
00:46:04,568 --> 00:46:06,238
- Press it, press it. 
 - Oh, no!

597
00:46:06,238 --> 00:46:08,548
- Press the open button. 
 - What do we do?

598
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:11,928
Please!

599
00:46:12,768 --> 00:46:15,178
Wait a second...

600
00:46:15,178 --> 00:46:17,968
The last one... really, this is the last try.

601
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,408
Gosh.

602
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,448
 One, two, three!

603
00:46:34,928 --> 00:46:36,558
Gosh.

604
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:42,028
Hey, are you okay?

605
00:46:43,518 --> 00:46:44,948
Shit...

606
00:46:46,068 --> 00:46:47,198
It's fine, it's fine.

607
00:46:47,198 --> 00:46:49,758
I'm going to kill you all!

608
00:46:49,758 --> 00:46:51,558
You jerks. Darn it!

609
00:46:54,398 --> 00:46:56,028
Hey, great job.

610
00:46:57,808 --> 00:47:00,668
Aren't you both seriously crazy?

611
00:47:00,668 --> 00:47:03,168
I was just about to burn to death

612
00:47:03,168 --> 00:47:05,638
back there without knowing what was going on.

613
00:47:05,638 --> 00:47:07,668
We forgot.

614
00:47:07,668 --> 00:47:09,248
You forgot?

615
00:47:09,908 --> 00:47:15,318
You forgot when a person was inside a coffin, huh?

616
00:47:16,608 --> 00:47:19,398
Forget it. I'm done.

617
00:47:19,398 --> 00:47:24,508
While you guys treat me like this here, others reallyâ€”

618
00:47:28,118 --> 00:47:30,278
It's understandable.

619
00:47:30,278 --> 00:47:32,858
You can forget things like this. Yes.

620
00:47:32,858 --> 00:47:35,688
- Yes, it's possible. 
 - He was in there?

621
00:47:35,688 --> 00:47:37,218
Yes.

622
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:44,718
I'll contact you as soon as the autopsy results come out.

623
00:47:44,718 --> 00:47:45,878
Okay.

624
00:47:46,815 --> 00:47:49,078
Now that I think about it,

625
00:47:49,078 --> 00:47:52,308
prior to the incident, Father went to meet someone.

626
00:47:52,308 --> 00:47:54,118
He said he needed to give him something.

627
00:47:55,768 --> 00:47:58,378
What did he need to give?

628
00:48:00,438 --> 00:48:02,928
 It was a yellow envelope.

629
00:48:02,928 --> 00:48:04,998
 Where are you going on the weekend?

630
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:07,538
 Well, I'm going out to see someone.

631
00:48:07,538 --> 00:48:09,728
 You should take a break on a day off.

632
00:48:09,728 --> 00:48:12,208
 It's fine. Don't come out.

633
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:14,908
 - Please take care. 
 - Okay.

634
00:48:16,308 --> 00:48:18,958
Sorry, I was too busy with the funeral.

635
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:23,278
Could it be related to my father's death?

636
00:48:23,278 --> 00:48:25,048
It's worth investigating.

637
00:48:25,048 --> 00:48:26,498

638
00:48:26,498 --> 00:48:29,568
 The Prosecutor General position is vacant once again.

639
00:48:29,568 --> 00:48:32,828
Then the only one left is Chief Prosecutor Park Jae Hyeon?

640
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:35,378
There's also Kim Joon Soo at the Suwon District Prosecutors' Office.

641
00:48:35,378 --> 00:48:38,488
- What about Deputy Chief Kim Tae Ho? 
 - It's not his turn yet.

642
00:48:38,488 --> 00:48:41,058
Besides, he's not someone who's greedy for positions.

643
00:48:42,788 --> 00:48:44,728
- Hello, Sir! 
 - Hello, Sir.

644
00:48:44,728 --> 00:48:48,858
Instead of chatting and fooling around, how about doing some paperwork?

645
00:48:48,858 --> 00:48:51,328
Should I give you more work if you don't have any?

646
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:54,108
No, Sir. My apologies.

647
00:48:55,078 --> 00:48:57,448
Let's just do our own tasks.

648
00:48:57,448 --> 00:49:01,318
Then no one will badmouth us. Okay?

649
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:13,018
 I'm sorry. I'm the one to blame.

650
00:49:15,098 --> 00:49:16,628
 Please forgive me this once.

651
00:49:16,628 --> 00:49:20,098
 Hey, man. If you do that, I'll die.

652
00:49:20,098 --> 00:49:23,618
 Hey, please, just once.

653
00:49:23,618 --> 00:49:26,248
 Get up, Jae Kyung. Stand up and talk.

654
00:49:26,248 --> 00:49:28,768
 Tae Ho, we're colleagues, right?

655
00:49:28,768 --> 00:49:34,258
 Let me go just this once. I'll do as you say if you do that.

656
00:49:34,258 --> 00:49:36,698
 Let me go just this once.

657
00:49:43,008 --> 00:49:44,528
I'm sorry.

658
00:50:02,408 --> 00:50:06,458

659
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:17,938
CEO.

660
00:50:19,078 --> 00:50:20,738
Why are you doing this?

661
00:50:20,738 --> 00:50:22,418
Gosh...

662
00:50:25,868 --> 00:50:28,248
Find the person who will give his daughter some bone marrow.

663
00:50:28,248 --> 00:50:32,298
- Grant whatever he wishes for and tell him not to come to the hospital. 
 - No, CEO.

664
00:50:32,298 --> 00:50:34,788
If she doesn't get the transplant now, my daughter will...

665
00:50:34,788 --> 00:50:37,978
Her bone marrow is already dead because the transplant procedure has begun.

666
00:50:37,978 --> 00:50:40,008
You can't do that! Never!

667
00:50:40,008 --> 00:50:42,488
What do you mean I can't do that?

668
00:50:42,488 --> 00:50:45,268
I'll just do it. I'll see you at the funeral.

669
00:50:45,268 --> 00:50:48,168
Wait! One moment, please!

670
00:50:50,728 --> 00:50:52,608
I'm sorry, CEO.

671
00:50:52,608 --> 00:50:55,218
Please forgive me just once.

672
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,958
From now on, I'll do anything...

673
00:50:57,958 --> 00:51:00,138
anything you tell me to do.

674
00:51:00,138 --> 00:51:06,728
So, please, spare Chae Rin... my daughter, at least...

675
00:51:13,018 --> 00:51:16,658
Let me give you an earnest warning, Minister.

676
00:51:17,948 --> 00:51:21,198
Don't try to stand up to me.

677
00:51:21,198 --> 00:51:23,198
What does anyone else's will matter?

678
00:51:23,198 --> 00:51:25,768
Only my will is important.

679
00:51:32,898 --> 00:51:35,598
Come visit the company with your daughter.

680
00:51:35,598 --> 00:51:37,688
I'll buy her some good food.

681
00:51:43,068 --> 00:51:44,638
 Yes?

682
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:54,728
Did we schedule a meeting?

683
00:52:02,078 --> 00:52:04,718
Were you this kind of a person, Prosecutor Oh?

684
00:52:04,718 --> 00:52:06,978
It's surprising.

685
00:52:06,978 --> 00:52:09,138
I'll work for you with all my loyalty.

686
00:52:09,138 --> 00:52:12,088
Please rescind my transfer order.

687
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:13,808
Why should I?

688
00:52:17,558 --> 00:52:22,188
Why should I do that for you, who tried to kill me as the Chief's sword?

689
00:52:25,648 --> 00:52:27,348
I'll probably be very useful.

690
00:52:27,348 --> 00:52:30,058
I'll become your sword, Deputy Chief.

691
00:52:30,058 --> 00:52:33,038
What is the worth of your words?

692
00:52:34,498 --> 00:52:36,868
I'll do anything you tell me to do.

693
00:52:39,778 --> 00:52:42,638
You'll do anything?

694
00:52:47,058 --> 00:52:50,568
I'm sure you are aware of the weight of those words.

695
00:52:58,338 --> 00:53:00,458
I promise you.

696
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:03,848
I'll definitely repay you for your kindness.

697
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:08,618
I know better than anyone about your capabilities, Prosecutor Oh.

698
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:12,858
However, they mean nothing to me.

699
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:27,438

700
00:53:49,908 --> 00:53:51,628
What's this?

701
00:54:01,198 --> 00:54:03,538
You try and solve it.

702
00:54:19,148 --> 00:54:26,630

703
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:08,398

704
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:12,878
Yes, Minister.

705
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:18,888
Me? How could I take such an important position?

706
00:55:18,888 --> 00:55:23,338
No. I'm thankful for your offer, but I'll respectfully decline.

707
00:55:24,128 --> 00:55:25,718
No, I don't think I should.

708
00:55:25,718 --> 00:55:28,378
I'm sorry. I'll hang up now.

709
00:55:31,488 --> 00:55:34,568
Isn't it tiring to live like that?

710
00:55:35,638 --> 00:55:39,488
Just say thank you and take it. The position is yours anyway

711
00:55:39,488 --> 00:55:42,118
I'm about to get indigestion just from watching.

712
00:55:42,118 --> 00:55:45,208
I should show him who the boss is.

713
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:48,088
If I don't gain dominance from the get-go, I'll keep getting dragged.

714
00:55:48,088 --> 00:55:52,658

715
00:55:57,698 --> 00:56:00,178
Just answer it next time.

716
00:56:02,668 --> 00:56:05,728
Congrats, Prosecutor General Kim Tae Ho.

717
00:56:05,728 --> 00:56:09,388
There's nothing I've done. It's all thanks to you, Hyeon Gyu.

718
00:56:10,728 --> 00:56:12,868
Thank you, CEO.

719
00:56:12,868 --> 00:56:16,348
This guy always calls me CEO at times like this.

720
00:56:20,748 --> 00:56:22,798
His death was really a waste, though.

721
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:27,408
Deputy Chief Lee, I mean. I saw on the news that his death is being ruled as a suicide.

722
00:56:27,408 --> 00:56:29,561
Lee Jang Won did kill himself, right?

723
00:56:31,428 --> 00:56:32,868
Why?

724
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:36,538
They said it's not suicide?

725
00:57:53,128 --> 00:57:56,128
Let's eat now.

726
00:58:05,278 --> 00:58:08,528
Why does my doenjang(soy paste) stew always turn black?

727
00:58:17,868 --> 00:58:19,918
 Mom's leaving you some side dishes.

728
00:58:19,918 --> 00:58:25,038
 Don't let these turn into waste and eat them.

729
00:58:25,038 --> 00:58:27,568
 It's good to have a hobby, but it's a nuisance at that point.

730
00:58:27,568 --> 00:58:30,558
 You have no talent for cooking.

731
00:58:31,588 --> 00:58:34,878
 Also, when are you going to get married?

732
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:37,608
 I'm the only one without a grandchild.

733
00:58:37,608 --> 00:58:41,548
 Bring someone when we come to see your dad. I'm fine if you date an older lady.

734
00:58:41,548 --> 00:58:44,828
She could just talk on the phone. Why did she do this?

735
00:58:46,598 --> 00:58:49,958
 You don't listen if I say this over the phone.

736
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:52,548
Gosh...

737
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:05,338

738
00:59:19,528 --> 00:59:22,898

739
00:59:26,858 --> 00:59:31,648

740
00:59:31,648 --> 00:59:33,238
What does it say?

741
00:59:33,238 --> 00:59:36,800

742
00:59:56,848 --> 01:00:00,508
We got it. Let's move on to the next step.

743
01:00:00,508 --> 01:00:01,808
Next step?

744
01:00:01,808 --> 01:00:06,288
We need to find out who killed the Chief and why.

745
01:00:13,938 --> 01:00:16,788
This place is not for just anyone to come in.

746
01:00:16,788 --> 01:00:18,608
Get him out, Chul Ki.

747
01:00:28,488 --> 01:00:32,458

748
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:36,668
Prosecutor General, congratulations.

749
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,218
- Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations.

750
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,058
Congratulations.

751
01:00:41,058 --> 01:00:43,038
- Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations.

752
01:00:43,038 --> 01:00:45,808
I just saw the announcement. Congratulations, Prosecutor General.

753
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,378
Thank you.

754
01:00:49,538 --> 01:00:53,538
- Investigator, now is not a good time. 
 - I look forward to working with you.

755
01:00:53,538 --> 01:00:56,038
- Thank you. 
 - Pardon?

756
01:00:57,678 --> 01:01:03,488
Prosecutor Jin Jung, you're under arrest for the murder of Chief Lee Jang Won.

757
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:26,330

758
01:01:53,298 --> 01:01:55,538

759
01:01:55,538 --> 01:01:58,688
 - Give up, Prosecutor Jin. 
 - It doesn't make sense. Why would he harm the Chief?

760
01:01:58,688 --> 01:02:00,858
 Does it make sense for you to do this to me?

761
01:02:00,858 --> 01:02:02,348
 Get him!

762
01:02:02,348 --> 01:02:04,468
 Focus on arresting Prosecutor Jin for now.

763
01:02:04,468 --> 01:02:07,008
 - Prosecutor General... 
 - Who's the scumbag who is framing me?

764
01:02:07,008 --> 01:02:08,908
 What could you do if you knew?

765
01:02:08,908 --> 01:02:11,018
 - There will even be public wanted notice. 
 - What are we going to do now?

766
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:13,308
 I'm going to find it and show them. that they messed with the wrong person.

767
01:02:13,308 --> 01:02:16,488
 It's owned by the Gangnam gang. I heard he has a dragon tattoo on his neck.

768
01:02:16,488 --> 01:02:18,678
 He's chasing after drug dealers now.

769
01:02:18,678 --> 01:02:20,621
 What should I do with this guy, then?

770
01:02:20,621 --> 01:02:23,271
 - Who the hell are you? 
 - A prosecutor.
