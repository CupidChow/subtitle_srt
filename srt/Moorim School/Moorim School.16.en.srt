1
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,650
- Wang Chi Ang.
- Soon Deok? What about Soon Deok?

2
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,640
She left.

3
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,200
The necklace that Soon Deok is wearing, you gave it to her, didn't you?

4
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,580
Is it really the key to the Cheon Ui Joo?

5
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,760
How do you know that?

6
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,270
How much do you know?

7
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,990
Everything. The fact you and Seon Ah are siblings. All of it!

8
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,200
So your Dad too...

9
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Yeah. My Dad also knows everything.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,280
Because of you, Soon Deok is in danger.

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,970
It's because of the necklace you gave her!

12
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,830
Who is really putting Seon Deok in danger?

13
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,470
Do you have the right to say this?

14
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,520
You wanted to make Soon Deok happy

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,720
by putting her in danger? Why couldn't you see the truth?

16
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,340
If something happens to Soon Deok,

17
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,600
I won't stay still,

18
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,550
whether you are a friend or not.

19
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,240
That

20
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,420
doesn't exist for me anymore.

21
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,400
Moorim School
- Final episode -

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,200
Immediately mobilize all of our manpower to find Sim Soon Deok.

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,340
The Chairman is putting his faith in you.

24
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,540
The woman Soon Deok is—

25
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,950
She has the key to the Cheon Ui Joo!

26
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,610
Listen closely to what I'm going to say.

27
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,260
If you find her, let me know without touching even the tips of her fingers.

28
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,270
If you act rashly like you did the last time, that'll be the end of you

29
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,750
and of my relationship with my father.

30
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,510
Dad!

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,620
Chae Yoon! What are doing you doing here with the headmaster... ?

32
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,010
Don't behave foolishly like this. Please leave this place at once.

33
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,300
Regardless of how long I was in that coma,

34
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:38,650
you don't think that I can't somehow handle even people like you, do you?

35
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,940
In any case, the Cheon Ui Joo

36
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,020
goes to the most powerful person.

37
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,260
And I am always prepared to stand behind whomever that person may be.

38
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,500
Professor Beop Gong!

39
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,000
For a long time, next to this friend,

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,390
waiting for an opportunity for Cheon Ui Joo,

41
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,050
it seems you're not aware of it's nature.

42
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,690
The Cheon Ui Joo, by nature, cannot be possessed by anyone.

43
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,510
The only reason it was kept by a powerful person

44
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,490
was that they could use their strength to block the negative forces from disrupting the world.

45
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,030
It's not that the powerful person possesses the Cheon Ui Joo.

46
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,990
He is protecting it! Do you get it?

47
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,700
Have ever heard of where Soon Deok lived when she was young?

48
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,100
I once heard that the place Soon Deok visits on the anniversary of her mother's death

49
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,880
is near Gangwon-Do.

50
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:10,020
♬ The countless tears which flowed past me ♬

51
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,130
Yoon Si Woo...
♬ were like the end of unknown darkness ♬

52
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,100
You're also here?

53
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,730
♬ Both when I take another step ♬

54
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,550
♬ and let out a long sigh ♬

55
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:30,010
♬ Where does the road end? ♬

56
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,820
♬ Good Bye Good Bye the words to me ♬

57
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,620
♬ Good Bye You Please  ♬

58
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,300
♬ Don't Say Good Bye ♬

59
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,750
♬ Baby, it looks like I was young then ♬

60
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,330
♬ Baby, it looks like I was a coward then ♬

61
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,950
♬ I knew just a connection was there ♬

62
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,610
♬ I thought I could just reach out to you ♬

63
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,280
♬ Goodbye, You Please  ♬

64
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,880
♬ Don’t say goodbye. Goodbye. ♬

65
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,670
♬ Goodbye. You please ♬

66
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,190
♬ Don’t say goodbye. ♬

67
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,830
Is it true that you killed my real father and fooled me all this time?

68
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,500
Seon Ah...

69
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,950
I don't want to see someone like you anymore.

70
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,670
Don't come back.

71
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,290
Dad!

72
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,770
Dad!

73
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,760
Do you see me, Dad?

74
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,130
Are you okay?

75
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,060
Dad! How can you come back like this?

76
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,970
I haven't been able to say sorry to you yet.

77
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,220
Sim Bong San went back to his dead wife's hometown.

78
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,060
Is that so?

79
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,520
I posted people in that area.

80
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,280
Until I get there, make sure that that Seon Deok does not know.

81
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,450
Don't let her escape.

82
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,020
Understood.

83
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,730
Institution of Moorim

84
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,360
You found it.

85
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,600
Yeong...

86
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,450
It's ironic.

87
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,530
I began this work to protect the world

88
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:07,510
and in reality couldn't protect my own precious family.

89
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,260
Do you regret it?

90
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:23,260
No. I finally realized

91
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,080
from the moment I woke up from the coma till now,

92
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,360
things like the Cheon Ui Joo

93
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,440
are not important to me.

94
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,380
I just wanted to find you guys again.

95
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,460
I missed you.

96
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,130
I heard from Dad.

97
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,020
He said that I should also leave this place,

98
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,720
that it was his last request.

99
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,170
Yes, I also feel the same.

100
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,140
I can't put you in danger like the last time.

101
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,350
This is something I have to finish.

102
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,150
Although I do understand both of your feelings,

103
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,300
I also want to protect it together.

104
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,440
Yeong.

105
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,950
Now I finally met you again

106
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,220
and I don't want to be separated like that.

107
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,360
It would've been nice if Si Woo also were together with us now.

108
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,040
I am filled with shame.

109
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,680
Let's go to the school this instant.

110
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,810
The last two parts of the key are there. What reason do we have to hesitate?

111
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,270
Chae Yoon might have gone to their side but the time to act is now.

112
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:25,430
Hwang Moo Song is gravely injured and Chae Yoon has only been conscious for three months.

113
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:30,410
It's not time yet, as one key is still outside the school.

114
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,970
Outside?

115
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,960
A girl called Sim Soon Deok has it.

116
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,800
My son is looking for her, so we should have some news soon.

117
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,960
From the start, it looks like you're reaping the benefits of using your son.

118
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,900
Using...

119
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:56,560
Then you must know how I treat those who lose their usefulness.

120
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,580
From now on, you stay out of this affair.

121
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,490
Chairman.

122
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:09,780
I won't repeat the same mistake that was made 18 years ago.

123
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,250
Gather some useful men.

124
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,090
Did you find Soon Deok?

125
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,970
Not yet.

126
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:25,680
Dad came to school.

127
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,730
Dad?

128
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,280
Both of them.

129
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,770
They came back together.

130
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,870
Really, that's a relief.

131
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,450
I think we need to prepare everything.

132
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:41,190
People from the Shanghai Group are here at Moorim and I don't think they will remain still any longer.

133
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,080
I'll come back soon, until then—

134
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,520
No, Si Woo,

135
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,710
don't come back if you find Soon Deok.

136
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,460
What?

137
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,060
If you come back to school with the key, you'll be at risk too.

138
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,800
Hide yourselves from everyone for the time being.

139
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,020
Don't say stuff like that.

140
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,210
I'll finish everything without anyone getting hurt.

141
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,360
But where are you going when it's cold?

142
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,900
I need to find a job.

143
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:29,360
I don't have to go to school anymore.

144
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,260
I'm going to look for a place where I can work all day long.

145
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,390
Soon Deok, I'm sorry.

146
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,110
Dad,

147
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,050
I don't resent you.

148
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,210
I know that incident changed your life.

149
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,780
I also know that you regretted it a lot and were very scared.

150
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,030
I'll come back.

151
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,170
Seon Deok, take this scarf with you before you go.

152
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,020
Where the heck are you, Sim Soon Deok?

153
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,860
♬ If I take your hand when I see you ♬

154
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:54,580
♬ My day will fly by too quickly ♬

155
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,760
Yes, this is the Chicken store.
♬  Love is.♬

156
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,960
Is this, by any chance, the chicken shop where Sim Soon Deok works?
♬  happiness rather than pain♬

157
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,140
Student Soon Deok stopped working here.

158
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,520
Thank you.

159
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,190
♬  is the love which I have learned.♬

160
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,340
Chi Ang!

161
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,810
- Get in.
- Young Master.

162
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,390
Wait here until I give you further instructions.

163
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,090
Yes, we'll follow him.

164
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,790
Let's go.

165
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:47,510
You're saying that this is a key to the Cheon Ui Joo?

166
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,260
Yes.

167
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:56,470
This necklace, which protected Si Woo from the flames as a baby...

168
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,820
Yes. That is now putting you in danger.

169
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,070
Come with me.

170
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,160
Where to?

171
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,750
I know who you have in your heart right now.

172
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:20,870
However, Yoon Si Woo is fighting a battle he cannot win.

173
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,950
What?

174
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:27,200
I have decided to stand with my father.

175
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,050
I have decided to inherit everything from my father, no matter what I have to do.

176
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:41,890
To me what I hear you saying is that you're going to hurt Si Woo.

177
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,580
I heard it wrong, right? It's not like that, right?

178
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,990
That's right. Yoon Si Woo or whoever!

179
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,860
Chi Ang!

180
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,710
So, run away with me.

181
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,290
I can do everything you want. Start with me.

182
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,220
Chi Ang!

183
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,110
If you say you want to come with me, I'll meet Dad.

184
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,880
I'll give the necklace to him,

185
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,880
I can't put Si Woo in danger and leave.

186
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,670
I told you I'd finish it without hurting him!

187
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:14,140
The way to finish it all without anybody getting hurt

188
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,160
is for you and your father to give up on the Cheon Ui Joo! You know this too!

189
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,900
It's impossible! My Father is someone who has to see everything from beginning to end.

190
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,110
So, I'm telling you to stop me before I start too!

191
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:34,930
If you go to Yoon Si Woo, he and everyone from school...

192
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,760
You could die.

193
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,670
If this is Cheon Ui Joo...

194
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,650
Si Woo must be looking for me too.

195
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,070
He probably thinks I might be in danger again.

196
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,890
He's probably worried.

197
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,020
- I have to go.
- Sim Soon Deok!

198
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,060
The fact that I am going to Si Woo

199
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,280
doesn't mean I am going to stay by Si Woo's side.

200
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,930
This is too shameless and greedy for me to do.

201
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,960
But, even if I don't go to Yoon Si Woo,

202
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,340
going to you doesn't make much sense either!

203
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,640
Why do you keep wanting to go down the path that causes the most hurt to people, Chi Ang?

204
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,630
What if...

205
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,290
I say that I have to have you, even if it's by force?

206
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,210
Then

207
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,360
I will die.

208
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,120
SIM SOON DEOK!

209
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,240
Let's go.

210
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,400
Yoon Si Woo.

211
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,450
If what you want so badly is the key, then take it.

212
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:10,730
But as for Soon Deok, I can't give her to you.

213
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,380
Aren't you taking this too lightly?

214
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,770
Your mom gave her life for it,

215
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,220
and your life became like this because of the key.

216
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,890
And you're able to let it go this easily?

217
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:31,740
Do you know what I was thinking on the way to here?

218
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,760
"Please don't hurt Soon Deok again."

219
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,350
I only wished for her safety. Also,

220
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,040
you too.

221
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:48,420
I only wanted the Wang Chi Ang I know, the Wang Chi Ang I prayed wouldn't have changed.

222
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:54,430
You're way more precious to me than the key to the Cheon Ui Joo!

223
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,630
Right.

224
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,390
Fine.

225
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,210
If I'm that precious to you,

226
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,330
prove it.

227
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,670
Give the key to me.

228
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,260
Time is running short.

229
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,600
Please take the kids and leave this place.

230
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,320
As you've requested, I will send the kids for the sake of safety.

231
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,600
However, I'll remain at school. The other professors and students—

232
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,320
No. I'll stay as well.

233
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:56,260
The headmaster is hurt and the school is in a state of emergency, however,

234
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,280
leaving isn't an option.

235
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,570
I'll stay here, too.

236
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,280
How about the student's bodyguard, Sam?

237
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,740
My job is to protect this school.

238
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,550
I'm the headmaster's right arm. I'll fight to the end.

239
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:21,880
There was a time when I told the headmaster that I was quitting school.

240
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,680
You said that?

241
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,410
But then, why did you stay?

242
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,910
The headmaster said

243
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:36,420
that Moorim School's goal was not to become a place where the students are the best at fighting with weapons.

244
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:41,140
But a place where time is given to the students to allow them to discover themselves.

245
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:46,460
You heard it too? All of you?

246
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:52,530
Of course. Did you think that the headmaster thought you were so special he only said those words to you?

247
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,410
I think I get it now.

248
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:59,060
Dong Goo asked us before, if we had Cheon Ui Joo, what kind of wish we would ask for.

249
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:04,190
I have to protect this place.

250
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,810
There is no school like this one in the world.

251
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,190
- But...
- Seon Ah.

252
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,160
Let's do it together. We won't know unless we fight.

253
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,650
I also don't want to run away again.

254
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,820
That was really no fun.

255
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,390
- Me too.
- Me too!

256
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,070
- Me too.
- Me too.

257
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,900
Let's go back.

258
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,080
- Yoon Si Woo...
- It's not your fault.

259
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:51,700
Me being abandoned in a forest and being all alone were not your fault.

260
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,190
It is not your father's fault either.

261
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,800
If your father hadn't taken me,

262
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,840
I don't know if I would still be alive.

263
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,200
Si Woo...

264
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:15,090
I couldn't think clearly, like there was a fog in my head.

265
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:22,310
Finally, I'm starting to see what's in front of me, but if you're not here what am I to do?

266
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:28,340
I'm sorry. Because of me, you're again...

267
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,930
Just stay by my side.

268
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,140
Just ...

269
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:42,290
Just as we are now, just us, you and me, like this,

270
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,850
is enough for me.

271
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,380
♬ If I take your hand when I see you ♬

272
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,220
Let's go back now.

273
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,160
Let's think about the future later.

274
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,990
Right now, just returning with you, is my only plan.

275
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:13,820
♬ That love is happiness rather than pain ♬

276
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,710
Okay.

277
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:21,700
♬  is the love which I have learned. ♬

278
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:30,200
♬  Even in a small room, always smelling only your perfume ♬

279
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,600
♬  When you the person I will love ♬

280
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,740
♬ are sad and cry again it is certain ♬

281
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:50,700
Right. Let's go until the end.
♬ you are my love ♬

282
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,240
♬ It’s okay if it’s unsaid. ♬

283
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,910
♬  It’s okay if it just must be hidden. ♬

284
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:05,710
If by chance... If by chance.
♬ Beneath an empty sky there is only you and I♬

285
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,960
Don't think about bad things.

286
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,740
Bad thoughts make bad energy.

287
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,640
The choices I made today, I may regret forever.

288
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,370
However, can you tell me I made the right choice?

289
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,240
Good job, Yoon Si Woo.

290
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,650
And you'll do well from now on.

291
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,300
♬ That's the love I've learned.♬

292
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:44,480
You don't think they'll attack as a swarm in the middle of the night, do you?

293
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,570
They did that 18 years ago too, I heard.

294
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:50,940
What the heck? You said you wanted to protect the school earlier. Where did your courage go?

295
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,680
Hey, hey. I uhm, wait a minute. I have to go to the toilet. The toilet.

296
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,620
This little...

297
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,400
- Oh!
- Sim Soon Deok? Yoon Si Woo?

298
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,310
Hey!

299
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,630
Seeing Soon Deok is great!

300
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,330
Soon Deok!

301
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,990
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

302
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,160
Why are you saying this?

303
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,260
You did well to come back.

304
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,260
Sorry to be late.

305
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,500
He's waiting for you.

306
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,170
I'm back.

307
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,490
I'm sorry.

308
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:31,120
for leaving you alone, for not recognizing you.

309
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,950
For being late...

310
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,240
I'm sorry.

311
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,920
I missed you.

312
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,740
I missed you so much, Father.

313
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:40,370
Did he really gave this to you submissively? That child did?

314
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,990
Si Woo still thinks of me as a friend.

315
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,670
A friend?

316
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:53,090
Yes, he's still at that age to think of friends.

317
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,730
And you.

318
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,760
You aren't thinking of betraying me, are you?

319
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,460
I always lost to Si Woo in competition.

320
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:16,800
The key to Cheon Ui Joo being our final match, I have no thoughts of letting Si Woo do everything he wants to do.

321
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:26,900
If you really lost everything to that kid, then you just have to get it back through the key to Cheon Ui Joo.

322
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:34,280
I will bring back the last piece of the key.

323
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,590
Sure.

324
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:50,000
You said you gave the key to Cheon Ui Joo to a friend. Are you talking about Wang Hao's son?

325
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:57,310
Also, I agreed to meet Chi Ang tomorrow morning at Moorim Peak and give him the last key.

326
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:02,430
But you could be betrayed and attacked by him.

327
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:08,650
You going there alone is too reckless.

328
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:13,570
If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have lasted here.

329
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:18,810
Also, if I could have left here so easily, the way it is right now,

330
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,920
I wouldn't be together with the people I care about.

331
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:30,680
Leave it to me. Please grant that request.

332
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:02,010
Tomorrow morning, I'm going to meet with Chi Ang.

333
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,120
I miss Wang Chi Ang.

334
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,800
When you see him, tell him I really miss him.

335
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,380
Okay.

336
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,410
But,

337
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,580
it's still hard for me to call you Noona.

338
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:33,010
I also still think it's weird that you're my younger brother. But, isn't that expected?

339
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:37,920
Give me some time. Later, I'll be sure to call you Noona all the time.

340
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:43,510
Cumulatively, all the things I couldn't do all this time, earnestly...

341
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,370
Okay, me too.

342
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,800
I'll do everything for you that I couldn't do for all that time.

343
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,740
I'll be back.

344
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,000
Are you really thinking of letting the young master go alone?

345
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,060
Isn't there a saying that even if a rock is too hard for anything else to go through,

346
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,740
a tiny drop of water will penetrate the rock?
(Constant perseverance yields success).

347
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,550
Pardon?

348
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:50,760
Everyone we've prepared to send to the school, send them to Chi Ang.

349
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:56,780
We should be prepared in case there's an unforeseen variable.

350
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,040
Wang Chi Ang.

351
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:35,910
Why are you here?

352
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,430
We were supposed to meet at Moorim Peak.

353
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,830
Did you really come alone?

354
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,970
Yeah.

355
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,480
I can betray you.

356
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,180
Isn't it the same for you?

357
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,760
You, of course, came here by yourself.

358
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,530
Let's go up.

359
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,610
Are you ...

360
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,950
really going to trust me?

361
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,050
Then,

362
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,440
for one last time again,

363
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,970
will you be able to trust me?

364
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,520
As expected, I see you came.

365
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,050
It's not that I couldn't trust you.

366
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,800
I only wanted to confirm quickly that the key is for the Cheon Ui Joo.

367
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,250
Where is Yoon Si Woo?

368
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,270
I know ...

369
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:16,860
you have hidden your people in the vicinity of Moorim School.

370
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,350
That's why I have met Si Woo on the mountainside.

371
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:26,000
So what about the key? What happened with the key?

372
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:36,090
Then, for one last time again, will you be able to trust me?

373
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:50,150
You really... I see you did it!

374
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,550
Good job! You surely are my son!

375
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,540
What do you think you're doing?

376
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,990
Take it.

377
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:29,000
I see you are going to make me feel wretched till the very end.

378
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,060
I'm not giving up on you.

379
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,980
Because you are the first and dearest friend I've met since I was born.

380
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:41,590
If this will do as proof of how I feel, then take it.

381
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,920
Just what are you saying now?

382
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,060
Let us

383
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,370
make this key disappear together.

384
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,040
That's the only way to stop this fight.

385
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,760
If I were to drop it into the darkness beneath this precipice...

386
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:07,500
I know that you would risk your life to grab it.

387
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,870
That's true.

388
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,630
I will certainly do it.

389
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,910
So are you saying that you're going to kill your own father?

390
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,960
Is there any way on earth,

391
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:24,100
any way to put a brake on your useless greed?

392
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:28,890
Even though thought about it again and again, there was no answer.

393
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,050
There is no such way!

394
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,390
I'm going to, without fail, have it in my hand!

395
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,590
There is only

396
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,610
one way.

397
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,990
What you want is to stop your father, right?

398
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:52,490
Just as your father searched out all three pieces the Cheon Ui Joo key was split into,

399
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,110
even if the key is broken into pieces,

400
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,330
he's not going to stop.

401
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,470
Did you already know what I was thinking of doing?

402
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:04,790
The same way that I want to protect my family and the school,

403
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,700
you also want to protect your father.

404
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:18,010
There's only one way—having the key disappear before my father's eyes.

405
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,200
Chi Ang!

406
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,290
If I were to fall from here with the key,

407
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,940
what are you going to do?

408
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,760
What?

409
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,410
Will you catch the key?

410
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,000
Or,

411
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:40,570
will you catch me?

412
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,920
Even if I fall down but become a lion cub that survives,

413
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,300
you told me you'd acknowledge me.

414
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,100
I will no longer be spun around

415
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,600
by your vain ambitions.

416
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,200
I'm going to end it here.

417
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,210
Chi Ang, no. Don't do this.

418
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,900
Tell me you will choose me!

419
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,420
Even now if you say the word I'll only throw the key.

420
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,730
Choose!

421
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,660
Wang Chi Ang!

422
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:33,210
Give it to me. Now, hurry.

423
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,480
Don't! Don't do anything foolish!

424
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,630
Think about your mom.

425
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,060
Mom...

426
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:51,050
She told me to do whatever makes me happy.

427
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:54,440
However, if you don't give this up,

428
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,370
I can never find happiness

429
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:01,730
because you will make everyone around me suffer!

430
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,110
So, please, Father...

431
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,010
Give up.

432
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:19,760
I see trusting you was a mistake.

433
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,690
I shouldn't have given you the key.

434
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,980
Your greatest mistake

435
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,980
was sending me to that school.

436
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:36,150
It's there that I learned what friends are,

437
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,320
what is precious,

438
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,870
and it's where I found things I wanted to protect.

439
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:51,850
Also, I want to find out who I am.

440
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:58,030
I was scared of the memories buried inside of me,

441
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,030
where my past would drag me...

442
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:06,680
I was worried it would be a cold, deep, dark place.

443
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,120
I was afraid that the real me that I'd find after following my memories

444
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:17,680
would be too ugly, despicable, and worthless.

445
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:24,600
However, when I'm with Soon Deok, I feel relieved.

446
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,960
That the me right now is enough

447
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,080
and is okay, that's the kind of feeling I get.

448
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,440
That's why I love Soon Deok.

449
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:46,230
She sees me as I am.

450
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:53,480
Chi Ang, I...

451
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,120
I...

452
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,960
There's no helping it.

453
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:07,140
I think I've been attracted to Soon Deok for the wrong reasons.

454
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:13,880
Her simplicity, warmth, naivety, and righteousness,

455
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,650
all the things I felt I was lacking.

456
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,290
These were the things I really wanted

457
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,650
but could never have.

458
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:36,400
Therefore, I must have always been lacking in front of Soon Deok.

459
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:43,650
There was no way I could have been sufficient in the way you, who were being just you, were.

460
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,450
Treat her well.

461
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,300
Don't make her cry.

462
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,470
Wang Chi Ang.

463
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:01,840
If you make her cry, I won't stay still.

464
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,510
Okay.

465
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:17,340
In that place, I met a lot of people who love me,

466
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:24,340
since love sees you as you are.
♬  When I look back, I was so young  ♬

467
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:31,600
Since I... Your love...
♬  In the last diary, just a child filled with worries  ♬

468
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:37,890
I yearned for it so much,
♬  I'm leaving everything here from the past which was difficult. ♬

469
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:41,470
since I and my mom
♬  Without even anyone I can go to ♬

470
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:44,270
♬  I want to run far away. ♬

471
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:50,790
have been very lonely.
♬  I will just for you. ♬

472
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:54,200
♬  I will be right there ♬

473
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,960
I will ask you one last time, Father.
♬  Believe in me. ♬

474
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,430
Is it me...
♬  I gotta run, run, run, I/i> ♬

475
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:03,410
♬  I gotta run, run, run ♬

476
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:05,120
Or is it this Cheon Ui Joo key?

477
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:10,800
♬  I must see you smiling widely when the day I dreamed of comes.  ♬

478
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:17,320
♬  The thing I don't know... My future. ♬

479
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:24,500
As expected, you can't give up Cheon Ui Joo.
♬ Even if I am tired and worn out. ♬

480
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:31,270
♬ The thing lost ( time passed by).
Everything right here (leave behind). ♬

481
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,600
I'm sorry, Father.
♬  Without even anyone I can go to ♬

482
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,800
♬  I will run far away. ♬

483
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:45,410
♬  I'm running to you, just for you ♬

484
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:51,500
♬  I will be right there, believe in me ♬

485
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,680
And, believe me for one last time.
♬  I gotta run, run, run ♬

486
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,120
If...

487
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:00,800
Even if your father doesn't choose you,

488
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,090
I and the people whom you care for

489
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,300
will save you for sure.

490
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,280
I'm putting my faith in you, Yoon Si Woo.

491
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,620
♬  If I truly want it,  ♬

492
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,880
♬ I won't be afraid and will run  ♬

493
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,870
♬ I can overcome with my own strength ♬

494
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:33,470
♬  I'm running, just for you ♬

495
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:39,520
♬ I will be right there, believe in me  ♬

496
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,800
♬ I gotta run, run, run ♬

497
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,650
♬ I gotta run, run, run ♬

498
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:52,910
♬  I will smile widely when the day that I dreamed of comes. ♬

499
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:56,340
♬ I gotta run, run. Yeah, yeah, yeah. ♬

500
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,370
♬ I gotta run, run. Gotta run. ♬

501
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,950
♬ I gotta run, run, run ♬

502
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:04,960
♬ I gotta run, run. I've got to run. ♬

503
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,690
♬  I've got to run. ♬

504
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:23,170
Do you remember those childish days we had together?

505
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:26,390
7 Years Later

506
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:30,810
Since we were together we were happy and gave each other strength.

507
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:33,850
And occasionally when we were in pain,

508
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,960
we all had the same thought.

509
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,610
Hello.

510
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:41,120
Our anxieties about our own existence

511
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:45,530
and big and small wishes.

512
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,420
This place is the same as when we were here before.

513
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:53,640
How is it where you are?

514
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,560
Professor Sim Soon Deok.

515
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:06,190
Hey, can't you see I'm in the middle of class?

516
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:10,290
What's with the "hey" to your headmaster?

517
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:12,970
Ah, yes, Headmaster.

518
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:16,090
Can't you see I'm in the middle of class? (Using formal speech)

519
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:24,360
I'm going to see Chi Ang now. If you have anything to tell him, let me know.

520
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,630
Come back.

521
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,650
How about Si Woo?

522
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:53,570
Again, this is an invasion of privacy.

523
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,990
For someone who is so worried about privacy, why are you here?

524
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:01,990
You don't even use your office all the time.

525
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:05,390
Why is your room and board here?

526
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:07,510
Are you asking because you don't know?

527
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:17,670
Because you got a full time job here, I can't leave this place anymore.

528
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:22,150
And not because you compose songs better when you're here?

529
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:27,170
That's the same thing. I can compose songs if you're around.

530
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:33,710
So, did you compose many songs?

531
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:47,210
Were you... writing a letter to Chi Ang again?

532
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,120
Yeah.

533
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,610
But that brat never replies.

534
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:58,130
I thought so. He has no reason to read your letters.

535
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:11,170
You're meeting Chi Ang so why are you putting on makeup?

536
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:15,070
Why are you picking on my daughter? She's pretty.

537
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,230
Dad!

538
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:21,630
Which Dad? Seon Ha, you have to tell us clearly which dad you are calling.

539
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:28,630
I didn't know you guys were coming too. Are you here to see Chi Ang?

540
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:32,540
Of course. It's an important day. Let's go.

541
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:35,210
Songwriter-Singer Yoon Si Woo is getting married to beautiful school teacher.

542
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:39,310
Wang Chi Ang!

543
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:43,510
Does that make sense? How could I find out about his wedding through the press?!

544
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,550
Why? WHY?

545
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:55,950
You're here? Take a seat.

546
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,260
Si Woo sent you an email, you didn't see it?

547
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,760
He sends tons of emails every day. How can read them all?

548
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,460
Am I his lover? Am I some kind music notebook?

549
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,690
I'm such a busy person. Why is he emailing so much?

550
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:17,350
He's saved your life twice over. You're being a little much.

551
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:20,990
If I had been a bad person, then Yoon Si Woo wouldn't be here right now.

552
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:27,910
Are you serious? When it rains, this still really hurts.

553
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:34,250
Secretary Choi, please bring in the expense report for the donations to Moorim School.

554
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:39,590
Highlight anything which increased 150%. Several times, one by one.

555
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,290
Let him be, he's trying this hard.

556
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:46,850
Chairman Wang, next time put in your donation by direct deposit.

557
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,510
We're also busy people. Do we have to keep doing this?

558
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:53,410
That's right. The former headmaster, the former former headmaster,

559
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:58,150
and the current headmaster, all gathered here together don't you think it's a little too valuable a gathering?

560
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:03,250
Hwang Seon Ha!

561
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:07,350
We even have a boss who's climbed up to Moorim Peak without any shoes,

562
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:10,530
but there's an elevator here. Isn't that fascinating?

563
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:14,250
That's the reason why I like you the best.

564
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,030
Love you right back.

565
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:28,810
Do you think Chi Ang's so mad he won't come to the wedding?

566
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,790
He'll come. Trust me.

567
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:36,880
How can two people have such unwavering faith in each other? It makes me jealous.

568
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,460
I'm the one who's jealous right now—of Seon Ha.

569
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,190
What?

570
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:54,010
This isn't some Romeo and Juliet story.

571
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:59,830
When do you think we can tell our parents about our relationship?

572
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:07,590
I'm sorry I made you wait so long.

573
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:12,970
Is your father doing well?

574
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:18,190
At first, he was in shock, but now he's given up completely.

575
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,350
He's in China living with your mom right now, right?

576
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:26,790
Even if there had been nothing like Cheon Ui Joo, to see my father going all the way to the end to protect something,

577
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:30,970
I thought that my father is, as I knew, not an ordinary person.

578
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:34,130
For the power that will grant all one's wishes,

579
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,370
in the end, it's up to love to decide this.

580
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:41,870
That's my Hwang Seon Ha.
♬ (cause you’re my girl)♬

581
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:47,130
You are forever awesome and smart.
♬  Wherever I go, whatever you do  ♬

582
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:49,930
What's this? It's so unlike you.
♬  Being with you is only thing I feel  ♬

583
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,010
♬ Wherever you go whatever you do ♬

584
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:58,270
I haven't told anyone, but on that day, Si Woo and I
♬  being with you would be so great  ♬

585
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:04,010
saw Cheon Ui Joo, before the key was destroyed.
♬ Even if I was offered the world, ♬

586
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:07,120
Seriously?? What did it look like??
♬  I wouldn't trade you.♬

587
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:11,450
No wait! Did it really have all that legendary power?
♬I will be okay even if I lose everything♬

588
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:14,370
Right??
♬  What should I do now?  ♬

589
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:19,630
Why are you so curious? It seems like you already know the answers to your questions.
♬  I fell for you hard.♬

590
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:25,890
Huh? What are you saying? Wang Chi Ang! Is it for real?
♬  It was annoying to lose to you ♬

591
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:29,830
Is it true? What is it?
♬  You made everything easy work.  ♬

592
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,610
♫ Whatever the heck did you do  ♫

593
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:37,570
Ah, I'm so happy.
♫ to a nobody like me? ♫

594
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:42,470
I proposed to you a while ago but you really played hard to get for too long.
♫ You've changed everything I try my girl♫

595
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:48,390
Sim Bong Seok, my dad, said not to marry someone who is more capable than I am.
♫ Wherever I go whatever I do ♫

596
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:51,770
Huh?
♫  I only want to do it together with you. ♫

597
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:58,350
You mean that you've been delaying it all this time in order to save up money for your marriage fund?

598
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:02,730
Well, uh, it's not quite exactly like that...
♫ If you say we'll do it together, than it's great.  ♫

599
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:06,050
No I'm totally right, seeing how you're stuttering.
♬ Even if I was offered the world, ♬

600
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:08,670
I caught you!
♬  I wouldn't trade you.  ♬

601
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:12,270
You wanna go? Fight me!
♬I will be okay even if I lose everything♬

602
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:19,350
Yea! Let's go, let's totally go!
♬  What should I do now? I fell for you hard.  ♬

603
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:23,250
Do you really want to go?

604
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,890
Hey!
♬  Wherever you go whatever you do ♬

605
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:31,830
-Yoon Si Woo, we're at school. Ah, my head. Calm down, since we're in school.
- Are you okay?

606
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:34,410
♬ Even if I were offered everything, I wouldn't trade you.♬

607
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:39,630
Miss Soon Deok, shall we go under the blankets?
♬I will be okay even if I lose everything♬

608
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:43,150
I said we are in school.

609
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:47,110
The strength that I put forth to rescue Chi Ang,

610
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:54,410
saved him and his father ,and the key to the Cheon Ui Joo was destroyed.

611
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:59,950
Cheon Ui Joo will forever be hidden in the cave at Moorim.

612
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:05,630
As for the Cheon Ui Joo Chi Ang and I last saw,

613
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:11,690
we still aren't sure if it has all the power in the world to grant anyone's wishes.

623
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:53,220
Thank you to edtors, cont:
joysprite, jefftiger96, and gyabo

624
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:57,130
Thank you to English modertors:
lupita311, KorkyKDiver220, cara_liisu, and kristensgem

625
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:10,190
However, the only thing we did confirm

626
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:16,670
was that reflected in Cheon Ui Joo was our faces.

627
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:21,210
Even if we weren't able to possess the Cheon Ui Joo,

628
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:24,370
the fact that we had been looking at each other wordlessly

629
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:30,350
means that we were able to understand the meaning of the Cheon Ui Joo.

630
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,870
Ah that's right! We didn't forget to give anyone the invitations right?

631
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,830
Of course not!

632
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:50,690
♬ I can't get any sleep♬

633
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:53,950
Let's go to Mommy! One, two, three!
♬ Why are you always caught in my heart? ♬

634
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:56,690
We already gave one to Teacher Yoo Di and Teacher Dae Ho.

635
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:57,830
Wow!

636
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:03,150
Sam, Teacher Daniel, etc. I gave one to everyone at school.

637
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:04,590
You have to say hello.

638
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:07,890
Ah, right. Hyung Sang Man asked us to send the invitation to court.

639
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:09,350
Manager Go!

640
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:12,770
Y-Yes Prosecutor. Here, I'll help you with your coat.

641
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:15,550
And as for Dong Goo wanted us to send one to the police station.

642
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:18,510
I heard that Dong Goo is really great at being an undercover cop.

643
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:21,550
He was always complaining, saying he was invisible.

644
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:25,130
Now he's like a ghost, and catches bad guys.

645
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:29,520
As for Shannon, I sent the invitation to the chicken place where I used to work.

646
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:34,360
Her recipe sold more than mine did.

647
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,250
That's right! I told you our chicken was delicious. At times like this, having a can of beer

648
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:41,010
instead of cola with that chicken would be perfect, but you only got us cola—

649
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:44,250
Beer? You are so funny. Close your mouth and stay still.

650
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:47,290
Do you think Nadet will be able to come from Thailand?

651
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:49,830
How high will it go?

652
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:57,500
At present, the door to the armory is opened to its widest.

653
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:00,100
♫ I'm waiting for only you. ♫

654
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,430
♬ Unlike myself♬

655
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:03,250
♬ Baby you baby only you ♬

656
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:07,670
♬ Baby you After meeting you♬

657
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:12,930
♬ Everything is unlike myself ♬

658
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:16,950
It looks like Jenny has a lot of upcoming filming.

659
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:18,110
I'm not sure if I can even contact her.

660
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:20,090
Cut! Okay!

661
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:22,730
Good job everyone! You've worked hard!

662
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,410
Yeop Jeong will probably come, right?

663
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:29,550
Of course! Don't you know what kind of person he is? Everyone will come because it's our wedding.

664
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:35,230
No matter how busy everyone is, they will come for sure.

665
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:37,790
Hey!

666
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:44,830
It's been a while.

667
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:50,590
A while? Then who was the guy I was drinking with just the other day? Another Yoon Si Woon?

668
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:55,220
The next morning I felt like I was dying. My hangover was...

669
01:01:55,220 --> 01:02:00,050
Is that so? I didn't feel anything at all. I even did my morning workout.

670
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:06,250
Ah, you strong drinkers. How come a busy person personally came here?

671
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:08,590
I had some business with the current headmaster.

672
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:10,310
You had a date with your girlfriend, didn't you?

673
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:14,590
Well, you could say it that way.

674
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:19,050
Be good to my sister. Don't make her cry.

675
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:23,430
If you make her cry, I won't leave you alone.

676
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:29,090
Yeah. Hey, I heard your new song.

677
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:30,630
You listen to my music?

678
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:36,830
It was a bit common for my high-class ears but it seems like it's going to be popular.

679
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:38,630
If you're jealous, just say you're jealous, geez.

680
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:43,610
But that song... Is it about us?

681
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:46,110
No.

682
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:51,650
Oh really? Did you have another friend where

683
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:58,270
you climbed a mountain together and rescued each other through trust?

684
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:02,050
Know that it's an honor that you are the star of my song.

685
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:10,390
Do you still remember the first time we came here?

686
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:17,050
Of course, how could I forget that moment?

687
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:20,840
It was really an unbelievable moment.

688
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:26,830
Compared to then, our Wang Chi Ang, you have become much cooler now.

689
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:29,830
The one who's really transformed for the better is you.

690
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:37,310
I'm glad that we are able to improve ourselves together.

691
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,660
It's been a while. Let's spar.
