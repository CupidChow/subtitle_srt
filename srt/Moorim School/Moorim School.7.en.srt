1
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,990
Alright, let's leave.

2
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,170
What kind of alcohol is this that I'm getting completely drunk?

3
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,660
My head, my head.

4
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,200
This is a plant root.

5
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,650
A plant root?

6
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:31,130
This is something like the bloodwort Xin Shi Wang used to brew and drink. For insomnia-

7
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,510
It works well.

8
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,860
Hey, Sim Soon Deok.

9
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,320
You fall asleep anywhere.

10
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,580
Moorim School
- Episode 7 -

11
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,820
What is it?

12
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,780
How did this happen?

13
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,760
Hey, Sim Soon Deok. Are you okay?

14
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,760
Hey, Wang Chi Ang.

15
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,370
What is it? I fell asleep?

16
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,890
Why am I here?

17
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,250
It must have been that plant root! But, why would the teacher give us something like that?

18
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,090
This feels kind of weird.

19
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,340
It's locked.

20
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,400
What is this? Why did they trap us in here?

21
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,960
The test hasn't ended.

22
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,000
If you've all gotten some good sleep, I'll now tell you what the final comprehensive test is.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,180
The last test is an escape mission.

24
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:09,150
You must leave this place safely, and the grade will be based on the order of arrival.

25
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,840
By order of arrival?

26
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,240
An escape mission?

27
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,270
What does that mean?

28
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,920
Escape? Are they kidding?

29
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,940
They even locked all the windows. Where do they want us to escape through?!

30
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,910
They said all we had to do was have fun. I knew this would happen.

31
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,490
Don't worry. Escaping from a place like this will be a piece of cake.

32
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,840
Don't get nervous. Don't get nervous.

33
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,660
Ah seriously, Professor Kim Dae Ho you left out the most important part.

34
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,670
Soon, this room is going to be engulfed in flames.

35
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,600
- Use your skills you've sharpened so far to escape. 
- Flames?

36
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,810
Okay then, I hope to meet all 6 of you safe and sound outside.

37
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,930
Look around.

38
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,510
Is it already starting?!

39
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,300
Yoon Si Woo. Are you okay?

40
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,330
Exactly where do they want us to escape from?! Hwang Seon Ah, are you okay?

41
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,350
A bit.

42
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,030
I'm going crazy.

43
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,100
Don't worry.

44
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,720
I think this is my mission because I have a trauma with fire. There's no need to worry.

45
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,520
This is no joke. He's usually not that ruthless.

46
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,450
So, does this mean that all we have to do is watch over them?

47
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:00,240
No way. In an escape exam, shouldn't there be at least one obstacle?

48
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,200
Let's go.

49
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,100
Hwang Seon Ah, think objectively. There's no way this is real smoke and

50
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,690
there's no way your dad would have started a fire to really kill us.

51
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,970
Calm down, and don't worry.

52
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,400
We have to find the hole from where the smoke comes out and block it.

53
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,770
- What?
- That way I will be able to think.

54
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,340
Okay. I'll look for it.

55
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,310
How did you think to use the trauma?

56
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,110
The reason a trauma exists is so it can be conquered.

57
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,680
The smoke will give an illusion of a fire; it's not a real fire.

58
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,080
The real fire is the terror inside of them.

59
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,730
That's what you must mean.

60
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,990
What are you going to do?

61
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,630
You take yours off too.

62
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:11,900
Let's make a bomb. If you mix ice cream and cola, you can make a good enough bomb.

63
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,520
You're saying that to make me less tense.

64
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,340
Where's ice cream here? Use cosmetics instead.

65
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,890
You can use cosmetics?

66
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,570
There are three ways to get out of here.

67
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,490
- It's this way.
- Get out.

68
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:47,580
Are you okay?

69
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,800
No matter how you see me, I'm still a singer. My lung capacity is probably better than yours.

70
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,950
I'll help you.

71
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,590
The first one is the entrance door.

72
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,140
Then should we break down the door?

73
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:05,680
No, I'm sure that's the first thing they blocked off. It's impossible.

74
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,300
Something else.

75
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,580
Second one, there's a vent in the ceiling.

76
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,510
Why did we come this way?

77
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:23,520
This corridor is connected with the ventilation to the testing area. Seon Ah probably knows about this.

78
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,980
And last, the window.

79
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,470
There was a window?

80
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,030
There's one window that at least one person can leave through.

81
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,720
From my memory, this is the third floor.

82
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,690
Right.

83
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,980
We have no choice. Let's go for the vent.

84
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,770
What are you doing? Are you just going to watch?

85
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,520
Hey, get out of the way.

86
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,390
It seems like the smoke has subsided a little bit.

87
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,930
You blocked the hole where the smoke was coming from?

88
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,730
You blocked it? Oh, idol you're pretty good.

89
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,800
- Yeop Jeong instead of being that way, let's all work together.
- What?

90
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,060
If we build a tower together, we can reach the vent.

91
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,850
Right. We can get out easily if one person goes up and pulls us up one by one.

92
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,150
Don't joke with me. Didn't you hear them say by order of arrival?

93
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,520
Forget him, let's just do it among ourselves.

94
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,260
I called this one first, you jerk.

95
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,940
There has to be at least two at the very bottom.

96
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,550
I'll go up. Seon Ah, you're good at jumping so go up on the very top and get to the vent.

97
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,300
Choi Ho, what are you going to do?

98
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,180
I'll... I'll...

99
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:19,610
Even if Yeop Jeong goes up first, do you think he'll take you along?

100
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,890
I'll hold from the middle.

101
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,380
- Go up.
- Then I'm going.

102
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,970
Hey, Yeop Jeong!

103
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,710
Ariel!

104
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,600
Ariel, are you okay?

105
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,120
Are you okay?

106
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeop Jeong!

107
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:20,580
Wang Chi Ang's words were right. Do you think I'll take you all along?

108
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,070
That jerk!

109
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:29,130
This is a competition. Anyway, good luck. Losers.

110
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:54,360
It seems that the kids have blocked the smoke. Do you think they went out through the ventilation system?

111
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,560
If they think that's the easiest way, that's a miscalculation.

112
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,370
What is this? Yeop Jeong, it's only you?

113
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,090
What are you doing here?

114
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,600
By chance, did you betray the kids and leave by yourself?

115
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:25,410
Professors, it seems I won't even be needing this bo stick.

116
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:32,080
I thought it might be six against three, but it seems I will be fine on my own.

117
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,750
Yeah, it seems like it. I'll be going first.

118
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,860
I'll leave it to you.

119
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,820
Yeop Jeong. Should we start?

120
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,390
That's all that's left.

121
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,950
Let's go through the window.

122
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,220
Let's find a rope.

123
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:16,430
That jerk, Yeop Jeong, is really setting my insides on fire.

124
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:21,610
The fire that the professor was talking about was Yeop Jeong, that bastard.

125
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,400
This should do it. I'll go first.

126
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:40,070
By chance, you're not going to abandon me too, right?

127
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:46,070
You think Seon Ah is the same as Yeop Jeong? You should be choosy about friends.

128
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,550
- Ariel, I'll see you there.
- Yeah.

129
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:54,870
♬  In the deep pitch-black darkness
like a child who lost his way. ♬

130
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,990
♬  Even if I scream♬

131
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,220
- Is your arm okay?
- My arm?
♬  No one will hear♬

132
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,550
Yeah, it's nothing serious. I'm going up.
♬  Buried deep in my heart♬

133
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,030
Be careful.

134
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:12,690
♬  Faint consciousness barely holds onto me ♬

135
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:19,310
If he has overcome his trauma, then it is not just military training for oneself,

136
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,100
It's a group effort where everyone needs to help.

137
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,280
It's what this mission is for. And it's the thing that this school wants to teach.

138
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,550
Then, shall we go to the final destination and wait for them?

139
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,160
♬  Yeah I am alive, watch over me.
Now close both eyes and feel me ♬

140
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,520
I think we should be able to go down now. I'll go first. Come back safely.

141
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,700
♬  In front of everyone♬

142
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,890
I don't think we can do it.

143
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,780
What are you doing? You're not going?

144
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,080
- I'm going!
- You can do it. Go.

145
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
You're acting like you're so cool.

146
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,480
♬  Yeah I am alive. Look straight at me.
I will get up once again for dozens of times.♬

147
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:05,720
Be careful, Ariel.
♬  Yeah I am alive, watch over me.
Now close both eyes and feel me ♬

148
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,910
Will you really be okay?
♫ In front of everyone. ♫

149
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,300
♬  I'll show more of myself♬

150
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,770
This won't do. Wait here.
♬  I'm alive and breathing, I'm newly born. ♬

151
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,620
Get on my back.

152
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,740
What?

153
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,990
I told you to get on my back.

154
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,760
No but...,

155
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,810
It's about time they should come.

156
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,450
Here they come. They're coming.

157
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,720
Oh, as expected Seon Ah is first.

158
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,330
Ah, my legs.

159
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,150
You all worked hard.

160
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,130
Dad!

161
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,590
Where is Yeop Jeong?

162
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,850
Yeop Jeong is still not here?

163
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,540
He left by himself. He probably tripped and fell somewhere.

164
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,530
You deserved it, you jerk.

165
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,060
Stop it! It's over!

166
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:11,090
If they had all come out through the ventilation shaft, I would have just attacked for a little while and then let them go.

167
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,840
But since I found it despicable that he was the only one to come out, I had fun with him for a long time.

168
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,580
Here, take it.

169
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,580
This really is the end of your mid-terms.

170
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,100
However, there is one thing I would like you all to remember.

171
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,490
If, by chance, this had been for real,

172
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,890
to the person who set the fire to capture the lot of you,

173
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,660
you would have lost your comrade, Yeop Jeong.

174
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,990
What comrade? He was first to betray us and escaped.

175
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,830
If he betrays you, does that make him not your comrade?

176
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,090
Even if he betrayed you, he's your friend and your comrade.

177
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:07,270
I hope that you don't forget that and hold some responsibility for his betrayal as well.

178
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,800
What is this? I feel bad even though I won.

179
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,910
I'm so angry.

180
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,270
She startled me. Hwang Seon Ah!

181
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,710
What is wrong with her?

182
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,440
Of course she'd be mad.

183
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,500
Her own father stuck his child in the middle of a fire.

184
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,210
I don't think that's the reason for her anger.

185
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,530
Then?

186
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,240
She's mad because she can't refute it.

187
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,270
Everything the headmaster said is true.

188
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,950
If someone betrays you, are they not your comrade?

189
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,130
In any case, I lost this time, Wang Chi Ang.

190
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:06,190
Hwang Moo Song... Does he know that I'm in this place?

191
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:11,320
Everyone at Moorim thinks that you're dead,

192
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,210
since we don't know when the destructive force will attack again.

193
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,200
The only people who know that you're alive

194
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,940
are myself and the international chairman of Moorim.

195
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,100
How is he doing now?

196
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,440
He is the headmaster of Moorim School.

197
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,940
Moorim School?

198
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:36,010
Even the international Moorim committee still hasn't been able to find out the destructive force that attacked you.

199
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:42,200
Do you possibly have any ideas about the identity of the "destructive force"?

200
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:55,040
As you know, recently, the movements of Moorim have been suspicious.

201
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,260
Are you talking about the "destructive force"?

202
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,530
Having the power to control the world...

203
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,930
of course, anyone would covet it.

204
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,570
Do you have any ideas about what the "destructive force" is?

205
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,520
The "destructive force" is anywhere.

206
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,150
Having that feeling of coveting something you can't have,

207
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:26,990
if they are human, wouldn't anyone have a "destructive force" growing inside of them?

208
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,950
I must figure out the identity of the "destructive force",

209
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,790
and I will change the person who has that power.

210
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,370
You...

211
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,080
Are you alright?

212
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:51,400
You... You should leave secretly, with the key.

213
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,450
Sir...

214
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,940
Yoon, please take care of the Cheon Ui Joo key.

215
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,660
You cannot leave like this. I will go find the "destructive force with you".

216
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,880
Your colleague and partner who you trained in martial arts with, Hwang Moo Song...

217
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,920
Yes.

218
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,020
Don't trust him too much.

219
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,820
Hwang Moo Song!

220
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,010
Have you heard?

221
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:33,730
The Moorim Committee chose Chae Yoon to be the successor.

222
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,150
What?

223
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:40,410
And Se Ryeong went to him too... The guy who has it all is getting everything.

224
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:26,410
Yoon Si Woo, Wang Chi Ang, you're 1:1 mentoring ended yesterday.

225
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,150
Well, since the midterms are over, it was a given anyway, right?

226
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,950
Mentoring over! Leave. Go out and have some breakfast.

227
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,150
Sir...

228
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,810
My skills are still, um, they are still very undeveloped.

229
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,670
I need to change my partner and have Soon Deok as my mentor.

230
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,690
If I could get Soon Deok's guidance,

231
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:51,670
I think I could become a bright ace of Moorim.

232
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,410
I don't think you guys need mentors anymore.

233
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,810
Because you're not allowed to mentor classmates.

234
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,330
Excuse me?

235
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,600
Congratulations on getting first on midterms, Hwang Seon Ah.

236
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,790
As expected, my roommate.

237
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,100
What? You did well too.

238
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,340
This test was really fun. Right?

239
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,580
I tried mentoring for the first time too.

240
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,960
Like Dad said, I think mentoring was rewarding.

241
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,190
Wang Chi Ang actually works really hard.

242
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,670
He's a surprisingly model student.

243
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,550
Well,

244
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:41,340
Yoon Si Woo is also pretty amazing.

245
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Anyway, I'm a bit bummed 1:1 training is over.

246
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
I'll say.

247
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,680
Yay! We did well.

248
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,900
Sang Man hyungnim, you're in the lower level class again.

249
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,780
Choi Ho, it's okay.

250
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,190
If you play because you'r heart is at ease since the exams are over, that's foolish.

251
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,290
Temporarily, study while playing moderately. Understood?

252
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,670
Got it.

253
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,220
Why are Yoon Si Woo and Wang Chi Ang in the advanced class when I'm the only one in the lower-class?

254
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,000
We escaped together so why...

255
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Escape? What escape?

256
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,950
Hey, your comrade was in danger

257
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:36,660
so last night, we inhaled smoke and scaled building walls. How could you sleep?

258
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,760
Are you really my comrades and friends?

259
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,750
- Hey, what are you talking about?
- Did you have a dream?

260
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,320
It's because your stomach is empty. Let's go eat breakfast.

261
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,900
There, there...

262
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,180
Hey, but Yeop Jeong...

263
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,400
Were you like this all night?

264
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,320
Let's at least grab a bite.

265
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,800
Eat it yourself.

266
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:22,670
Ariel! Can't you just mentor me? I like you better than being in the advanced class.

267
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,430
What are you even saying?

268
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:29,110
Wang Chi Ang! If you're like this, your previous mentor will be sad.

269
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,490
I taught you so much and made you advance to this class.

270
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,470
So, this is your first day in the advanced class?

271
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,490
Today, we will learn some real Hapkido.

272
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,850
Professor, Sim Soon Deok was injured yesterday. I think she should go to the clinic.

273
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:48,210
Hey, that's not true! I'm alright, Professor Daniel.

274
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,490
Really? Let me see.

275
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,390
I'm alright!

276
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:02,590
How can you practice sparring like this? Sim Soon Deok, you're prohibited from sparring class for a month.

277
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,970
Professor!

278
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:07,540
Yoon Si Woo, Soon Deok isn't the type to just listen to what I say,

279
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,900
so drag her to the clinic.

280
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,970
Heard that? Let's go.

281
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,790
I can go alone.

282
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,680
Let's go.

283
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:27,190
Wang Chi Ang, you were ahead of Si Woo at the escape mission this time.

284
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:31,390
You were always whining because you couldn't win against him. How do you feel now?

285
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,710
Even though I won, I feel like I've lost.

286
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,350
What?

287
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,760
It's nothing. Since it's my first day here, please teach me.

288
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:53,440
Where's the first aid kit?

289
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,190
Oh, there it was.

290
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,300
Here you go.

291
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,020
My butt! Even my butt hurts. My arm hurts too, is this how I'm supposed to do it?

292
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,930
Does seeing an idol up close make you nervous?

293
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,670
What?

294
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,580
This will be fine.

295
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:46,200
Uhm, uh, I'll do it myself. Or ask Seon Ah to do it after class.

296
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,500
Or I can just ask Professor Yoo Di to do it.

297
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,100
When did I say I'd do it for you?

298
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,150
Hey.

299
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:03,190
I was going to do it myself anyway.

300
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,200
Since we're already skipping class,

301
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,980
let's get some fresh air outside.

302
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,650
It's weird.

303
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,100
What?

304
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,170
Back in the day, before an album release,

305
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:40,700
I couldn't come up with any good songs and I was going crazy.

306
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,760
I was so hysterical with my members and manager, too.

307
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,510
You know it too, right? I was really lacking.

308
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,610
- But here...
- Do songs come to mind?

309
00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:01,580
Then, won't you have composed dozens of hits by the time you graduate?

310
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,100
Graduate?

311
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,590
Oh, you're here because of your hearing.

312
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:18,650
Since I came here, my migraines and ear problems are almost gone. It's kind of interesting.

313
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,650
That's a relief.

314
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,330
Why are you attending this school?

315
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:41,430
I originally wanted to graduate high school and go to college

316
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,030
but the tuition fees were too much.

317
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,120
I'm the only one making money in our house

318
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:58,300
so I had to choose between studying while being buried in debt or go straight into work.

319
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,860
And as I was wondering about that...

320
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,180
Oh, this Moorim school is really strange,

321
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,440
but the strangest thing is that it has no tuition fees, right?

322
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,440
That's right.

323
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,180
So that's why I'm studying here, without my dad knowing.

324
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,580
- Your dad doesn't know?
- Yeah.

325
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,260
He explodes upon just hearing the word, 'Moorim'.

326
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,640
He's really sensitive about that, but

327
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,090
he must think it's a school that only teaches you to brawl.

328
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:41,360
Your first advanced class... How was it?

329
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,290
It was fun.

330
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,720
- Can I ask you something?
- What is it?

331
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,730
What was your wish?

332
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,730
It's not that you don't have confidence?

333
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:57,330
- Who says I don't have confidence?
- That's good. Negotiation finished.

334
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,710
Then you have to listen to my wish.

335
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:04,040
- Then what's your wish that you're like this?
- A date.

336
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:11,230
What was the wish that you wanted Soon Deok to grant if you beat Si Woo?

337
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,600
- That?
- You worked really hard because of that.

338
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,410
That's true.

339
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,170
A date. A date with me.

340
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,880
It was that.

341
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,880
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- I can't tell if it's real or if you're kidding.

342
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:39,800
I'm kidding. Watch a movie and eat something good.

343
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,890
A date is good.

344
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:46,480
Why do you keep looking at me like that? Go.

345
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,200
Isn't this something that Yoon Si Woo should have done for you?

346
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,250
- You don't want to do it for me?
- What did you two do? You even missed class.

347
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:29,620
- We just talked about this and that.
- It's done.

348
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:39,080
- Didn't you say you quit working part time at the chicken restaurant?
- Is a chicken restaurant the only place you can work part time?

349
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,630
Working part time is my life. I'm going.

350
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,730
Work hard.

351
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,000
It seems complicated.

352
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,390
- Where are you going?
- Because the test ended, I'm going to my new part time job.

353
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:07,180
- I will—
- You're going to tell your dad and get me a good part time job?

354
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,870
I'm fine.

355
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,220
- Your arm is hurting, what part time job?
- It's fine.

356
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,490
Isn't that a soft cast? Rest for today.

357
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,420
There's nothing to worry about. I'm going.

358
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,890
Hey, Sim Soon Deok.

359
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,630
Why are you like this?

360
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,740
You're a bit strange today.

361
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,070
Fine. It's weird if I'm serious.

362
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,780
Go.

363
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,610
Well, goodbye.

364
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:10,310
It will take time for Chae Yoon to recover his energy.

365
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:17,760
I'm sure it will, since he lay like a living corpse for more than ten years.

366
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,840
However, I feel bad watching him try to dig up the events from eighteen years ago.

367
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:32,060
He must be doing that because he wants to regain the forgotten fragments of his memories.

368
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:37,590
Then, our side needs to prepare that fragment of memory.

369
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,420
Yeong! Joon!

370
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:16,230
Hwang Moo Sung. Perhaps, you?

371
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,940
Of course.

372
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,190
He's amazing, considering he almost became the heir of the International Moorim Association.

373
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,480
His will is impressive.

374
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,650
He lay in bed for eighteen years, so I can see why.

375
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,990
I have to go to Korea.

376
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,480
Get ready to leave.

377
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,830
Oh my back! This house is so big.

378
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,760
Work seems endless.

379
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:11,790
Today, I'll work up to here and leave.

380
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,240
What is this?

381
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:21,940
She has so many accessories, she must not know if one falls off.

382
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:26,010
Omo. It's so pretty.

383
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,030
Oh no, oh no! (*calling for her husband)

384
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:44,050
And lead me not into temptation...

385
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:48,760
Son. Why did you call me all of a sudden?

386
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,120
What do you mean all of a sudden? I need to hear your (Madam Wang) voice to stay strong.

387
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:59,680
My Madame Wang's voice is like a multivitamin to me. It's cool, refreshing, and increases my energy.

388
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,390
- Is there something going on?
- Of course there is!

389
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:06,680
I made it to the advanced class! I made it in the shortest time.

390
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,070
I'm a high-pass honor student.

391
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:12,960
Really? You're working hard, Son.

392
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,640
Just wait and watch. I'll do really well this time and gain recognition from Father.

393
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,310
So I'm going to take you to the main house in China. Just wait.

394
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:27,170
Whether it's the main house or an annex, what does it matter?

395
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:31,580
Second or whatever, I just need my son.

396
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,620
Second?

397
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:40,650
Then my charging is complete. I'm hanging up, Mom.

398
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,020
He must be having a hard time, but he isn't even showing it.

399
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,920
Did you come home?

400
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,090
- Oh, you startled me.
- I was more surprised.

401
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,460
What are you doing there?

402
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,370
- Haven't you left yet?
- Yes... Here...

403
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,670
This was on the ground... This one.

404
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,110
Did you hear everything?

405
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:37,370
Yes, I heard everything.

406
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:55,160
Our Chi Ang, pretending to be happy, is all because of me.

407
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,310
Because of you, Madam?

408
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:01,360
As soon as he was born, I sent him to the main house in China.

409
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:06,160
There's no way they would look kindly upon an illegitimate child at the main house,

410
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,340
and he would run away to Korea once in a while to see my face.

411
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:17,900
Whenever he got dragged away, I cried and sobbed.

412
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,920
At least when he would say silly things, joke, or act cute,

413
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,500
I would laugh.

414
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,490
♬  When I look back  ♬

415
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:44,500
♬  I was so young  ♬

416
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,820
Follow after me. Mer.
- Mer.
♬  In the last diary  ♬

417
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,790
- Little Mermaid.
- Little Maremaid.

418
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,850
Don't do it, just don't. Sheesh.

419
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,450
You're the first person who has treated me this way.
♬  The times that were tough in the past ♬

420
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:56,640
That's why I like you more.
♬  I'm leaving everything here  ♬

421
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,970
♬  I'm running far away to where no one else could go  ♬

422
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,080
If you need to cry from now on,
♬  I'm running  ♬

423
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,980
come here. This is a really good place.
♬  Just to you  ♬

424
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:15,910
What was your wish? The wish you were going to ask of Soon Deok if you beat Si Woo?
♬  I will be right there, believe in me.  ♬

425
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:20,240
♬  I gotta run, run. Run. I gotta run, run. Run.  ♬

426
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:25,620
♬  Run, run, I will see you smile brightly  ♬

427
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:29,240
♬  When the day I've dreamed of comes  ♬

428
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,700
It was just a joke. It was a joke.
♬  I gotta run, run. I gotta run, run.  ♬

429
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,890
It wasn't sincerity.

430
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:55,680
But his Father doesn't even know that, and says that the child is immature and is always joking around.

431
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,970
When he's such a good and considerate child...

432
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:02,350
Oh my, so he's considerate, too.

433
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:08,100
He grew up so well too. He's tall and handsome.

434
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,020
Isn't he?

435
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:15,990
Of course, of course! It would be worth being a mistress to have a son like that.

436
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:23,170
When a woman grows old, there are three things that she needs.

437
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:27,170
Kids, money and friends.

438
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,830
But I have none of that.

439
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:34,630
Soon Deok is not your daughter?

440
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,840
She's from her dad's first marriage.

441
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,570
I see...

442
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:48,390
You're old and have no kids or money, but at least you do have something now.

443
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,970
What are you thinking of?

444
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,430
Friends.

445
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,390
Friends?

446
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:55,750
Do we need a reason to be friends?

447
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,930
Are we... friends?

448
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,590
That's right! Friends.

449
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:05,350
Okay, friends!

450
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:09,670
Then should we create a union? The union of mistresses?

451
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,690
Can you not use that word?

452
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:16,080
I bet hearing the word 'concubine' really drove you up the wall for so long, didn't it?

453
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:21,310
Then, a union for married women

454
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:24,760
- who dress and act as classy as young singles.
- Right!

455
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,540
- For the union of singles!
- Cheers!

456
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,090
Bottoms up!

457
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,580
Chairman Wang.

458
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,190
My son seems to be calling often these days.

459
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,470
Wait!

460
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,820
I'll wait.

461
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:46,970
I'll be around in Korea for a while, so I thought you should know that.

462
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,820
Korea? By chance, are you coming here?

463
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,740
Of course. Where else would I go?

464
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,140
Honey.

465
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,230
Now you know about it. I'm hanging up.

466
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:07,830
But why would he stay here for a while?

467
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,790
He hasn't done this before.

468
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:13,260
Hey! Just tell the kid to come.

469
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,770
- Tell him to come!
- Okay, okay.

470
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,410
- Just a sec.

471
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:19,710
Tell him to come and have a drink with us.

472
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,630
- Going to play the piano again?
- Yeah.

473
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,870
- Is there any booze left from the welcome party?
- Booze?

474
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,080
I guess Yoon Si Woo won't be able to sleep since you aren't playing the piano tonight.

475
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:44,550
Oh, right. Hey, I'll only play it for five minutes and come back.

476
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:47,230
Don't be like this either.

477
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,500
You're quite weird.

478
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:57,620
I'll only be weird today. From tomorrow, I'll be the usual Wang Chi Ang.

479
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,160
So you weren't fooling around.

480
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:14,880
Soon Deok's a really nice girl. She's bright and cool. Even as a girl, I find her really pretty.

481
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:21,110
But you're pretty cool too! Bright and tenacious.

482
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,650
Why did you stop? Are you trying to say I'm not pretty?

483
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,770
You're pretty too.

484
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:43,830
And because you are, can't you mess up Yoon Si Woo a little bit?

485
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:49,870
You like him. Your Oppa Si Woo.

486
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:57,310
Oppa Si Woo ... I mean, I don't like Yoon Si Woo like that.

487
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,770
So it's not romantic love.

488
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:07,160
No. I only like him as a fan, a bit aggressively, but still.

489
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,840
Like a fan?

490
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:15,010
He makes me worked up in a weird way, but no, I don't see him as a man at all.

491
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:28,930
Hiring part-time worker

492
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:32,970
Man, if you found someone at least take the sign off.

493
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,730
How can you order five chickens and now refuse to eat them?

494
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:45,710
Well take them to someone else then.

495
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:50,670
Oh, really. Come on, pay up before I call the police.

496
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:53,200
Give me the money!

497
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,970
I'll buy one.

498
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:01,990
Soon Deok!

499
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:08,710
Why don't kids these days know what it's like to be hungry?

500
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:13,090
It's a lie that people cannot find a job. A lie!

501
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:16,990
It's because you don't pay overtime, Ahjumma.

502
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:23,020
Then, if I match the highest hourly wage, will you come back?

503
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,390
You'll have to apologize first.

504
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,770
Oh my, have I not apologized yet?

505
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:35,160
No, you haven't. Please adjust my pay and working hours.

506
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,870
Then I'll come starting tomorrow.

507
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:41,830
But the extra pay for night hours... can't I give you chicken instead?

508
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:44,140
Of course not!

509
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:56,980
That's not it.

510
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:03,030
You'll have composed dozens of hits by the time you graduate, then.

511
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:23,500
Various notebooks

512
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,750
This one's nice...

513
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,110
Music Note

514
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,560
A trip?

515
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,830
Yes. I received a call from Chairman Wang Hao this morning.

516
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:31,020
He said he'd cover all the costs.

517
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:36,250
The exams are over, and both the professors and the students seem quite tired.

518
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:39,620
I think it would be a good idea.

519
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,340
What kind of power does Chairman Wang have?

520
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:47,810
Why is he sponsoring our school and the Moorim International Association?

521
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:52,510
It looks like he's a businessman who handles more than just money.

522
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:58,120
Even if the president of the International Moorim Association has agreed upon our school.

523
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:04,180
Frankly, since the school hasn't given back much,

524
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:07,500
he could have stopped supporting us.

525
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,390
Regardless, since it's a sponsoring company...

526
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:14,380
He must be a very considerate and generous person.

527
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,360
We should set up a meeting sometime.

528
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,690
He is even sponsoring a field trip, so I can't refuse as much as meeting him.

529
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:25,900
Well, he also said that he feels bad

530
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:30,770
for just leaving his son here without as much as a greeting, so he said he would like to pay the school a visit.

531
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:34,970
He cannot enter the school premises. Don't you know?

532
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:40,560
As much as you are concerned for the school's safety, denying even a sponsor...

533
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:45,200
The rules don't bend for anyone.

534
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,040
He won't allow me to enter?

535
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,870
First of all, though, he agreed to meet you.

536
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:58,830
A school that won't even let its sponsor in...

537
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:12,490
"There is nothing that reveals itself better than something that is hidden,"

538
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:16,530
"And there is nothing that can be seen better than something small." Is that the saying?

539
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:24,090
It's about time we found out what Hwang Moo Song is hiding in there.

540
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:50,420
Curry, first thing in the morning after drinking. Is fate messing with me?

541
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,140
I guess.

542
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,660
I suggested we eat it.

543
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:02,190
He knows I drank last night, doesn't he?

544
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,510
Are you still on bad terms with the principal?

545
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:05,920
Yeah.

546
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,200
I hate him to death.

547
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,130
Who did you drink with?

548
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,880
It was me.

549
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:16,040
Sim Soon Deok, I don't want your curry.

550
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:23,760
Sim Soon Deok? Weren't you his eternal Ariel?

551
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:29,170
I don't know. He was weird yesterday too. It's for the better, I was tired of him calling me Ariel anyway.

552
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:32,610
What do you mean? You're in trouble.

553
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:34,340
Why?

554
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,760
Do you know what the worst type of attack is?

555
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,260
What is it?

556
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,750
Frontal attack.

557
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:46,890
Frontal attack? Is it today's lesson?

558
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,050
Forget it, Soon Deok.

559
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:03,830
What is this? Are you writing something?

560
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:09,600
Yeah. I spent ages on that, I had no inspiration.

561
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,450
Were you awake?

562
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,330
It's been a long time since I stayed up all night that I'm frazzled.

563
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:22,180
You couldn't sleep without that piano lullaby?

564
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:26,720
Now that you mention it, there was no piano yesterday.

565
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,810
The piano player was with me.

566
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,110
The piano player? Who is it?

567
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,610
Sim Soon Deok?

568
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,940
It's not her!

569
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:44,150
Why do you have to yell?

570
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,370
Do your ears hurt still?

571
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,840
With that yelling even a healthy person wouldn't feel well.

572
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,720
I've gotten a lot better.

573
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,190
- Don't smile like that.
- What?

574
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:59,100
Stop smiling like that. I'm starting to like you.

575
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,530
Why did it take so long (to remove it)? I hated seeing this.

576
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:12,940
I know, right. Let's go clean some bathrooms or something.

577
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,140
Let's do that, lower-class guy.

578
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:23,680
Hey, read this announcement first. It will give you a lot of strength?

579
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,510
What's this?

580
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:27,370
Training Trip Notice

581
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,030
A camp?

582
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:31,430
Isn't that kind of like a field trip?

583
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:34,950
That must be it! Wow, how come?

584
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,140
Where will we be going?

585
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,100
It won't be one of those exhausting training camps, right?

586
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,900
I doubt it. Since we've studied this much,

587
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,120
isn't this kind of a special vacation?

588
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:49,380
I'm so excited! Where are we going?

589
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,840
Did something just pass by?

590
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,160
I think so.

591
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,370
- Dad, Dad!
- You startled me!

592
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:08,480
Is that announcement for real? We're going off campus? Together? Really?

593
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,020
Weren't you mad at me?

594
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:17,570
Dad... I mean Headmaster, how did you come up with such an amazing plan?

595
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:23,640
You made us stay there every day to practice. But we're going on a trip... Yeah!

596
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,850
Hey, one might think I'm holding you hostage in here.

597
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:32,530
Well there's not much difference. I've been living here since I was born.

598
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:36,860
As the principal's daughter, you had no choice.

599
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:41,070
So that means I can go too?

600
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,010
Aren't you a Moorim student too?

601
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,160
Then will the school be empty?

602
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,860
That can't happen. I'll stay behind to protect the school.

603
00:54:54,860 --> 00:55:00,750
What's so precious to steal in here that you're always secretive and won't let anyone in?

604
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,340
Do you want to stay behind?

605
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,760
No. No way, never.

606
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,900
If you're done go. I'm busy. Go.

607
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,500
The others asked me to find something out for them, what was it?

608
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,640
The location?

609
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,040
Oh yeah! Where are we going?

610
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:32,870
Seoul? The camp is in Seoul?

611
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:37,910
My ears aren't hurting. Did I hear well?

612
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,280
I think you did.

613
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,690
I love it that we're going there.

614
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:42,970
Country girl.

615
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,850
I can't agree with you this time either.

616
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:50,030
I was born in Sillim-dong.

617
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:52,920
- I'm from Hapjeong-dong.
- I'm from Gangseo-gu.

618
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,930
Should I visit my parents?

619
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:57,270
I feel like I shouldn't have told you.

620
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:01,930
Why, Hwang Seon Ah? You've never gone to Seoul either.

621
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:04,940
Shut up. I'm excited too.

622
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:09,380
I'm only holding back because the others will get angry.

623
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:14,010
We'll have free time, too, right?

624
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:16,550
Let's go to the 63 building.
(one of the biggest skyscrapers in Asia)

625
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:20,290
- Right, right!
- Ah, that hurts.

626
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:25,070
They sure don't look like the country girls they really are.

627
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:26,960
That's what I was thinking.

628
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:34,110
Oh my, I'm late. Baek Joo, sorry I'm late. Wow, you're so stylish today!

629
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,980
There was a lot of traffic on the way, sorry.

630
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,820
You arrived?

631
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,960
Well, yes, I have...

632
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,260
What's the use of being formal between friends?

633
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:51,790
Should we form a union of concubines?
Look at you, madam, so confident and independent.

634
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:56,890
So elegant and graceful, just like a crane bird.

635
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:00,410
Like a crane bird! Elegant and graceful!

636
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:03,080
Right, right!

637
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:12,980
Oh, I black out a lot whenever I drink.

638
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:19,370
Please draw me a bath. And put these in water.

639
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:21,950
And take whatever is left over.

640
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:28,390
Sure, sure, sure. But are you telling me to put these roses in water?

641
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:35,010
- Is it okay for you to take it off?
- My wrist keeps itching.

642
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,430
- You're going to work?
- Yeah. Ow...

643
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,760
Hello? Is Soon Deok coming home tonight?

644
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,470
- Why?
- Just answer me when I'm asking.

645
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:54,880
She said she found a night part-time job.

646
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,520
Then...

647
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,030
Wait for me at home. Don't fall asleep!

648
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:04,680
What are you blabbing about?

649
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,370
Just wait for me and don't fall asleep.

650
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:11,060
Yang Guifei (beautiful consort of an emperor of China) may come and visit you.

651
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,830
Yang Guifei, nonsense. I'm hanging up.

652
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,800
She's telling me this kind of stuff... Something must be up.

653
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,520
I'm having chills too.

654
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,850
I'll be waiting then...

655
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:32,380
I won't sleep...

656
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:44,310
Seon Ah changed the song, didn't she?

657
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:54,650
I know I'm late in saying this, but thank you.

658
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:08,050
Hey, Yoon Si Woo!

659
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:12,960
Didn't you send me this dress?

660
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,810
It wasn't me.

661
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:33,260
Ah, why are you hiding, Sim Soon Deok?

662
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,870
Why did she stop?

663
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,990
No, this is weirder.

664
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,480
Sim Soon Deok!

665
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:06,780
I was going to practice, but I heard the piano so I came in.

666
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:10,900
Why hide then?

667
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,810
Who said I was hiding?

668
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:21,510
My bag's strap got loose, so I wanted to pick it up.

669
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:24,620
Then why not just get up after picking it up?

670
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,660
This is a music notebook, right?

671
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:45,750
No, it's not!

672
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:48,170
Didn't you buy this to give it to me?

673
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,710
No, I didn't!

674
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:05,020
So, um, I just... I was passing by this stationery store,

675
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:11,150
and when I entered, they had so many notebooks, you know?

676
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:13,820
It was so fascinating, after such a long time, you see.

677
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:19,000
After graduating from high school, I haven't really seen this kind of notebook too often,

678
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,660
and I just...

679
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:35,310
♬ Baby it looks like I was young then ♬

680
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:38,940
♬  Baby, it looks like I was a coward then  ♬

681
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,910
♬ I thought you would always be there ♬

682
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:45,890
♬ I thought I could just reach out to you ♬

683
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:50,090
♬  Baby, I will take care of you.  ♬

684
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:53,580
♬  Baby, I'm not afraid of anything.  ♬

685
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:57,170
♬  Will you stay by my side?  ♬

686
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:00,090
♬  Will you hold me tight?  ♬

687
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:01,640
Sorry.

688
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:05,660
Well, it's not that...

689
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:10,180
I have to go to work.

690
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:13,660
♬ You Please Don't say goodbye.  ♬

691
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:31,170
Sim Soon Deok!

692
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:36,820
What's wrong? What happened?

693
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,700
It's nothing.

694
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,060
Hey, Sim Soon Deok!

695
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,480
What's up with you two?

696
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:57,210
I'm late for work. I'm off.

697
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:00,990
Sim Soon Deok, wait!

698
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,160
What's going on?

699
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,860
Wang Chi Ang.

700
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:22,110
Yoon Si Woo.

701
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:39,400
♬  Yeah I'm alive, watch me, I'll get up again dozens of times  ♬
