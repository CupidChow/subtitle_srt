1
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,400
This is a music notebook, right?

2
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,490
No it's not!

3
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,920
Didn't you buy this to give it to me?

4
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,620
No I didn't!

5
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:57,460
So, um, I just... I was passing by this stationery store,

6
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,960
and when I entered, they had so many notebooks, you know?

7
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,690
It was so fascinating, after such a long time, you see.

8
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:09,890
Since graduation from high school, I haven't really seen this kind of notebook too often,

9
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,990
So I just...

10
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,580
♬  Baby, it looks like I was a coward then.  ♬

11
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,080
♬  Baby, it looks like I was a coward then.  ♬

12
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,680
♬ I knew just a connection was there. ♬

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,450
♬  I thought I could just reach out to you. ♬

14
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,130
♬  Baby, I will take care of you.  ♬

15
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,590
♬  Baby, I'm not afraid of anything.  ♬

16
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,350
♬  Will you stay by my side?  ♬

17
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,460
♬  Will you hold me tight?  ♬

18
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,790
Sorry.
♬ Goodbye. ♬

19
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,830
It's not that...

20
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,650
♬  Goodbye. Goodbye. ♬

21
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,220
I have to go to my part-time job.

22
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,370
♬ Please don't say goodbye ♬

23
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,300
Sim Soon Deok!

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,330
What's wrong? What happened?

25
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,230
Nothing.

26
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,460
Hey, Sim Soon Deok!

27
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,880
What's with you two?

28
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,720
I'm late for work. Bye.

29
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,400
Sim Soon Deok!
Wait a minute.

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,480
What happened?

31
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,530
Wang Chi Ang.

32
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,830
Sorry?

33
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,300
Sorry?

34
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,190
Moorim School.
- Episode 8 -

35
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,810
While you were asleep, Seoul has gone through many changes.

36
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,300
I secured a place for you to stay in Seoul.

37
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,020
For now, please stay there.

38
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,000
I have to meet Moorim's headmaster.

39
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,500
Chae Yoon is going to meet Moorim's headmaster?

40
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,160
Yes.

41
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,840
He seems to be in rush. For now, quietly stay close to him.

42
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,590
Yes.

43
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,150
How far have you gotten in finding the children?

44
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,140
It's not certain yet but according to a reliable source,

45
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,540
it seems that person's child is at Moorim School.

46
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,890
Inside Moorim School?

47
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,930
This special technique was inspired by the Big Dipper,

48
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,320
just like individual stars are linked to form a constellation,

49
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,710
it is a martial art skill that requires coordination and cooperation.

50
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,250
In a word, the number of people who can excel at this skill is very small.

51
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,510
Okay. Get into position.

52
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,930
Where's Soon Deok?

53
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,020
She's sleeping in late. She must be tired from all her part-time jobs.

54
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,900
Sleeping in?

55
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,990
It's the first time since she started at this school.

56
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,740
What are you doing? Focus!

57
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,800
If you lose your focus, this technique will fall apart.

58
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,360
What do I do?

59
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,640
What's that? What in the world does that mean?

60
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,630
Sorry.

61
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,790
Why was he sorry?

62
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,420
Why is it so difficult?

63
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,410
Sim Soon Deok, are you there?

64
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,880
Sim Soon Deok! Let's talk.

65
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,860
Wait. Why am I hiding?

66
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,260
What did I do? Did I commit a crime?

67
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,390
Is kissing a sin?

68
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,170
It was a first kiss.

69
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,260
Me? Yesterday?

70
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,150
First kiss...

71
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,610
Make sure you eat.

72
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,680
It's good that you're working hard at your part-time or at studying but don't overwork yourself.

73
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,590
It's supposed to be cold today. Make sure you dress warmly.

74
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,830
What's with you that you're eating without Ariel?

75
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,720
Well...

76
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,610
How about Si Woo?

77
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,810
I don't know.

78
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,620
You don't know?

79
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,560
Did you two fight?

80
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,060
You fought.

81
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,300
Let's eat.

82
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,210
Hey, you are not kids anymore. Do you guys really have to fight?

83
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,810
Just relax a little...

84
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,810
Professor Kim, this tea smells very good.

85
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,750
It's coffee.

86
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,110
Thank you.

87
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,230
Will the field trip... be alright?

88
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,800
They're grown up kids. They'll be fine.

89
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,570
Since this is the first time a trip has been planned outside of the school, I hope there are no accidents.

90
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,900
The kids' security is my number one priority.

91
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,850
As long as I'm here as the guard, nothing bad will happen.

92
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,260
The kids haven't been able to focus in class since the end of mid-terms.

93
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:41,140
It's also probably because of the trip. You know how we're all excited the day before going on a picnic.

94
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,460
Since we are also going on the trip, do you think we'll also have free time?

95
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,260
Free time for the kids will mean free time for us as well.

96
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:56,340
It's been a while since they have gone out of the school. The kids will probably be amazed and curious.

97
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,820
I feel like I'm flying right now!

98
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,610
I haven't gone anywhere else than to this school.

99
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,310
So excited!

100
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,020
If we go to Seoul we'll have to eat spicy rice cakes!

101
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,070
So, Shannon is MSG (mono sodium glutamate) and Seon is MLC (modified low carb).

102
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,490
Should I go to Saipan?

103
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,640
Nadet! Let's go together.

104
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,950
Leave me out. I'm developing a new drone.

105
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,800
If I go to Seoul, I'll have to go to the electronic store.

106
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,290
They're telling us we are going on a trip, but are they going to take us to some place weird and make us train?

107
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,880
You don't have to worry about that.

108
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,240
They said the place we are going to is Wang Chi Ang's premier hotel!

109
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,290
- For real?
- Really?

110
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,220
Oh, our property has an aquarium, a water park, and an amusement park.

111
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,650
Everything is there. Just tell me and I'll take you wherever you want to go.

112
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,470
For real? Where should we go?

113
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,980
Amusement park!

114
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,560
No, the aquarium would be better.

115
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,330
Oh, Soon Deok!

116
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,090
Oh!

117
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,660
We were planning what to do during the field trip. What are you going to do?

118
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,700
It looks like I can't go.

119
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,100
- Why?!
- You wanted to go though.

120
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,160
Yeah, it doesn't make sense if you don't make it, Soon Deok.

121
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,690
I just started my part-time job.

122
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,390
Something is going on with Ajumma, so I have to take care of my dad's meals.

123
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,490
How is that possible? Let's go together!

124
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,870
Have fun!

125
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,100
Who doesn't have confidence?

126
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,810
Fine. End of the negotiation.

127
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,330
You'll have to grant me a wish.

128
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,800
What wish do you want me to grant?

129
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,200
Let's go on a date.

130
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,660
Oh, son! You seem to call often these days.

131
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,910
You said Soon Deok's Ahjumma is your housekeeper, right?

132
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,750
Yes, so what?

133
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,400
I have a request.

134
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,630
I made doubly sure that he understood that Moorim School

135
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,450
does not let outside visitors in.

136
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,490
I will try to arrange a meeting with President Wang Hao.

137
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,360
Alright.

138
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,230
Headmaster, you plan on staying at the school during the trip?

139
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,050
Of course.

140
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,460
All parts of the key to the Cheon Ui Joo have been found.

141
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,760
Now, we will prevent the person who possesses the Cheon Ui Joo

142
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:57,030
from using this power against the weak.

143
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,940
You... You should leave secretly with the key.

144
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,910
Sir.

145
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,330
Can you hear my voice?

146
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,910
How are things at Moorim lately?

147
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,690
After all parts of the key to the Cheon Ui Joo disappeared,

148
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:02,290
Moorim almost lost all of its power.

149
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,630
What do you plan on doing with the Cheon Ui Joo in the future?

150
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:15,930
As planned from the start, the person who will be the successor of the International Moorim School

151
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,590
will be the one keeping all the parts of the key to the Cheon Ui Joo.

152
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,610
It's too dangerous for just one person to keep them.

153
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,780
Would it be better if we separate the key into 3 parts and have multiple people guarding them?

154
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,560
What do you think about that?

155
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,710
If it is the true successor of Moorim, he will be able to protect the Cheon Ui Joo.

156
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:42,140
Is there someone in particular whom you have selected as the successor?

157
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,870
What is this?

158
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,850
Since Soon Deok saved my son's life,

159
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,410
I was upset not being able to greet her all this time.

160
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,500
Oh my! These are tickets for a cruise!

161
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,320
Just think of it as a vacation and go have fun.

162
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,560
Regardless, when the Chairman comes home tomorrow, there won't be anything to do.

163
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,450
So, you want to be alone with your husband.

164
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,670
It's not that!

165
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,190
I was just sorry because I've never really greeted her.

166
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,350
Still, you didn't have to give me this.

167
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:19,270
Then, I'll buy a huge bouquet of roses before I leave.

168
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,650
I told you it's not like that.

♬ The countless tears  ♬

170
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,140

What's the matter? 
♬  of unknown darkness ♬

174
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,600
What is it? What in the world is it?

175
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:59,910
♫Even though I take another step, even though I let out a long sigh

176
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:06,910
♫Where does the road end? ♫

177

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:19,600
♬ Goodbye. Please don't say goodbye. ♬

00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,900
♬  I worried a lot too. ♬

188
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,200
- I thought you left without saying goodbye. Why didn't you leave?

189
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,300
It's because of you.

190
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:03,210
♫ Without your smile, without your love. My life.

194
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,770
♬  Will you just take my hand?  ♬

195
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Ah, I'm really sorry. I'll deliver it again.

196
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,290
Soon Deok! Sorry, you'll have to do another delivery.

197
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,170
What?

198
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,710
Oh! I received an order for half seasoned and half fried chicken.

199
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,450
But I only sent the seasoned one. I made a mistake. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

200
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,440
Does saying sorry fix everything?

201
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,150
What?

202
00:19:54,150 --> 00:20:00,260
I pushed so hard to deliver it on time. Does saying sorry fix everything?

203
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,640
This job is a bummer, right?

204
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,000
Watch the counter. I'll go deliver it.

205
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,560
Here.

206
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,540
What is this?

207
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,370
It's a trip coupon. It's a cruise coupon.

208
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,350
Where did you get this?

209
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,210
Wang Chi Ang's madam gave it to me.

210
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,910
Did you go there expecting to get something like this?

211
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,870
I can't even see in front of me. How can I go on a cruise?

212
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,230
Don't be like this, and let's go.

213
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,700
You can go once I'm dead. Do what you want, I'm not going though.

214
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,820
All you have to do is get on the boat, and they give you food and clean after you.

215
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,840
Why can't you just relax and breathe the ocean air?

216
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,830
Can't you do that?

217
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:05,080
I stayed by a widower who can't even see for twenty years—

218
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,980
I was wondering why you weren't saying that.

219
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,910
If you took care of me, you took care of me.

220
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,570
This is different. Take it back right away!

221
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,830
I don't want to! I don't want to give it back!

222
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,930
I don't know what you want!

223
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,550
I know that it's not your fault that you're blind.

224
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,230
Still this—

225
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,240
This person!

226
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,220
- Ah, really...
- Seriously!

227
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,560
You know dad's personality well. Why did you accept something like this?

228
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,230
Why? It's because I have a miserable spirit! Why?

229
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,750
Tell him to return it himself,

230
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,760
or cook the ticket and eat it. Tell him to do whatever he wants!

231
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,380
Oh, my fate!

232
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,980
Really.

233
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,170
You really...

234
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:11,890
You take it. Give it back to Wang Chi Ang.

235
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:17,690
No. Then you'll have to go to Moorim School.

236
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:21,330
No, it's fine. I'll give it back to that house.

237
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:27,110
This ticket is for today. If will just be scrap paper if you return it.

238
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,970
Whatever.

239
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,250
They gave it to us because I saved their golden child.

240
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,400
I won't be able to send you on an expensive trip like this.

241
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,050
Who said to send me on this kind of thing?

242
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,170
Go.

243
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:49,890
When you go on a trip, I want to refreshingly go on a trip with my friends.

244
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,630
A trip with your friends? You?

245
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,750
Yes.

246
00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:00,530
Because of you, I haven't been able properly go on a trip in high school.

247
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,160
Go, Dad.

248
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,860
Dad.

249
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,790
It would have been nice if the headmaster had come with us.

250
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,460
That's true.

251
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,350
Professor Beop Gong couldn't come either. He suddenly got sick.

252
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:41,900
He's too busy taking care of his mind, not his body.

253
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,980
Is this the child?

254
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,140
Yes. It's a child called Hwang Seon Ah.

255
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,570
Hwang Seon Ah?

256
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:03,200
She is known as Headmaster Hwang Moo Song's daughter, but there are a lot of questions.

257
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:12,180
After Chae Yoon's house was burned down in a fire, Hwang Moo Song hid for three years.

258
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,110
He then set up Moorim School.

259
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,330
He called the president of Moorim.

260
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:23,230
At that time he was with that child.

261
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,960
With just that—

262
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,750
She has had a fire trauma.

263
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,780
Fire?

264
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:40,500
I'm positive she remembers a scene from 18 years ago as if she were there.

265
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:50,000
If this girl is really Chae Yoon's daughter, Chae Young,

266
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,280
Then the lost key of Chae Yoon

267
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,620
is most likely with that child.

268
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,660
I'm talking about one of the three keys.

269
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,170
When you give this information to us,

270
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,850
you must be wanting something.

271
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:24,900
I heard that you have one of the parts with you.

272
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:54,390
Why do I keep getting a bad feeling?

273
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,060
Why?

274
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:07,930
Of course, we have to find the two other keys.

275
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:14,190
You will be able to possess the Cheon Ui Joo someday.

276
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:32,530
What I want, I don't think it would be too late to tell you after you've found all three keys.

277
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,050
That's good.

278
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:39,400
It looks like I've found an amazing ally.

279
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,790
Now, what are you going to do?

280
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,320
For sponsoring the field trip,

281
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,650
there must have been a specific reason,.

282
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,090
From now, it's free time.

283
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,960
Yeah!

284
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,830
Don't cause trouble. If there are incidents outside of the school...

285
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,040
Don't worry.

286
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,440
Are we kids?

287
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,270
This is our territory.

288
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:20,840
That's good. Then, you're dismissed.

289
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,000
Soon Deok!

290
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,500
Oh yeah. Hwang Seon Ah and Nadet.

291
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,450
Yes.

292
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,020
You two stay behind.

293
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,800
Since we are all out, let's enjoy ourselves.

294
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,930
Everyone disperse.

295
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:40,340
Yes!

296
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:59,910
What is this?

297
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,530
It's a smart watch that Nadet's drone follows around. We asked to borrow it.

298
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,170
Smart watch?

299
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:11,050
There is a tracking chip in it. If anything bad happens, you can make an emergency call.

300
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,050
Emergency call?

301
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,250
Why are you giving this to me?

302
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,450
It's difficult for the headmaster to watch over everywhere, so

303
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,550
he gave this for the trip.

304
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,490
Since God cannot watch over everything,

305
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:29,630
he sent us mothers. Are you copying that phrase?

306
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,310
I said that first.

307
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:37,160
Anyway, the headmaster did not allow you any free time.

308
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,330
You have freedom in the hotel.

309
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,470
Excuse me?

310
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,270
What? I...

311
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,860
Omo.

312
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,060
I don't care if you think that I'm overreacting or if you say that I'm a "daughter-stupid". Just listen to me.

313
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,650
So why? Why do you have to be like this?

314
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,810
Then, have fun in the hotel.

315
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,410
Dad. Dad.

316
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:09,610
Why is it like this after I came all the way here?

317
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,900
Yeong!

318
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,990
Yeong!

319
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,430
Yeong.

320
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,310
Hey!

321
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,850
So this was your doing?

322
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,560
Where is the Cheon Ui Joo key?

323
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,700
No way.

324
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:35,790
That day... The memory of the day when Cheon Ui Joo key disappeared...

325
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:40,720
No matter how hard I try. I can't remember.

326
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,000
What are you going to do?

327
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:57,370
Seon Ah said she couldn't go out, so I'm thinking of resting in my room.

328
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,380
Don't do this. Let's go on a date.

329
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,210
Since I won at the exams, you have to grant me a wish.

330
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:08,330
Do you want to go to the aquarium to look at the fish?

331
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:13,450
Ah right, you're Ariel. It's been a while since you saw fish. Let's go say hi.

332
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,440
Don't joke around.

333
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,240
Joke?

334
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,920
Wang Chi Ang,

335
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,880
thanks.

336
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,270
What for?

337
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:35,330
I know that your're the one who sent my dad and ajumma on vacation.

338
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,780
It's because you want to make me come here, right?

339
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:43,660
No, I don't know anything about that.

340
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:51,150
Ah, my mom must have done it. You know, I'm a very precious son to my mom.

341
00:31:53,750 --> 00:32:01,800
I'm very thankful to you, but I'm a bit burdened.

342
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:11,760
I hope this is the last time I receive this kind of money from you.

343
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,210
Last time?

344
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,460
Sorry.

345
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,410
I'm more sorry that it's not the last.

346
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,540
I haven't started yet.

347
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,020
From now on, I'm planning on starting for real.

348
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:39,530
So you can't say this is the last. Don't draw a line here.

349
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,870
Even if you were to draw a line, it's not as if I would listen.

350
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,060
Wang Chi Ang, I'm...

351
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,560
Stop it. You don't have to say it.

352
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:40,280
Did I come all the way here to be stuck in the same room as you?

353
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,410
Let's have a talk.

354
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,130
Talk?

355
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,430
About what?

356
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:07,540
I don't care about what happened between you two.

357
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,470
Wang Chi Ang!

358
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:12,690
How could you... For all this time Soon Deok...

359
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,630
While knowing it...

360
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:21,610
For all this time I thought that a jerk like you was my friend.

361
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,980
For the first time in my life, I found a friend.

362
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,540
That's what I thought.

363
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,790
- It was the same for me.
- But you still did it?!

364
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:37,710
Then do you think I would just raise my hands in defeat?

365
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,760
I'm sorry.

366
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,970
Sorry? Sorry?

367
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:04,840
I don't have a reason to hear those words from you yet.

368
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,970
Don't mind me. Go out.

369
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:45,180
I'm okay. I'm really okay.

370
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,760
I don't really want to go out.

371
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,750
I want to go outside.

372
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,000
Then, can't you just take off the watch and go outside?

373
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,960
If I don't move, then our teacher will come to check up on me.

374
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,520
If you get caught, then just get punished, that's all.

375
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:19,280
There's a reason for Dad to say this.

376
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,370
Then just give up.

377
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,290
Why is my dad always so anxious when I go out?

378
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:33,500
You might be Moorim's School top student

379
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,920
but you're still a fragile girl to him.

380
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,150
Should we just go out?

381
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:45,760
No, no, no, Dad will be angry. Should we go out?

382
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,260
No, no, no. I knew there was some reason.

383
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,770
This is already complicated to death for me.

384
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,420
Do you really have to add more?

385
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:07,330
I'm going to look around the hotel, so stay put.

386
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:11,880
Sim Soon Deok. Will you really stay at the hotel?

387
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,390
Yeah.

388
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,340
No.

389
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,110
Yes.

390
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,170
Follow me.

391
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:51,230
Don't run away. I told you I haven't started yet.

392
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,150
Sim Soon Deok, what happened that day...

393
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,960
What are you doing?

394
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,890
Who's doing what?

395
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:42,590
I'm just in my room.

396
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,880
What if I tell him I'm in my room and he comes looking for me?

397
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,880
Ha! Why would he come here?

398
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,500
Don't get ahead of yourself, Sim Soon Deuk!

399
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,510
Listen to this when you are bored.

400
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,520
Listen to this when you are bored?

401
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:31,180
♬ The countless tears which flowed past me ♬

402
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:37,240
♬ were like the end of unknown darkness ♬

403
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:44,680
♬ Even when I take another step ♬

404
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,660
I'm sorry, Wang Chi Ang.
♬ and let out a long sigh ♬

405
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,790
♬ Where does that road end? ♬

406
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:58,380
♬  Goodbye, goodbye this word. To me...  ♬

407
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,900
♬  Goodbye. Don't say goodbye.  ♬

408
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,260
Are you going to give this to me?

409
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:09,430
No I'm not. 
♬  Baby, it looks like I was young then.  ♬

410
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:13,180
♬  Baby, it looks like I was a coward then.  ♬

411
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,050
♬ I knew just a connection was there ♬

412
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,500
♫ I thought I could just reach out to you. ♫

413
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,210
♬ Baby, now I will take care of you. ♬

414
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,990
♬ Baby, I'm not afraid of anything. ♬

415
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,650
♬  Will you stay by my side?  ♬

416
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,310
♬  Will you hold me tight?  ♬

417
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,430
♬  Goodbye.  ♬

418
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:40,870
♬  Please don't say goodbye.  ♬

419
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:44,770
♬ Goodbye, goodbye.  ♬

420
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:48,500
♬  Please don't say goodbye.  ♬

421
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,600
Even though it seems childish, I was thinking about renting out the whole amusement park and confessing,

422
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,070
or renting a yacht and setting off fireworks over the Han river.

423
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:16,830
Or I was even thinking about just kidnapping you and taking you to China.

424
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,220
However, these all seemed too weak.

425
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:26,780
Today, I just want for you to acknowledge my heart.

426
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,040
Even though it might have seemed like I was kidding around before, it's going to be different from now on.

427
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,600
You're going to have to watch out.

428
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,560
Why are you standing like that?

429
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,510
What's wrong?

430
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:55,700
Hwang Seon Ah?

431
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,540
Oh, sorry.

432
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,790
Ah, I received your confession myself.

433
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:05,830
If I just pass along your confession...

434
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:06,860
I guess that won't work, right?

435
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,590
Why are you wearing Soon Deok's clothes?

436
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:11,220
There was a reason for it.

437
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,780
Ah, the night view here is amazing.

438
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,670
So this is Seoul? Let me see. Wow.

439
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,610
It looks like Seon Ah is doing well and the other kids shouldn't be having any issues.

440
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:38,810
Why? Did you think they would be starting fights?

441
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:42,000
I didn't teach them to be that way.

442
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,380
- Wow! You used to live in this neighborhood?
- Yeah.

443
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,390
This neighborhood really hasn't changed one bit.

444
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,320
If you go all the way there, you'll find amazing spicy rice cakes.

445
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,470
Spicy rice cakes are good!

446
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,460
Hey Choi Shuttle!

447
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,840
You're Choi Shuttle, right?

448
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,770
Wow, it's been awhile. How have you been?

449
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,750
You disappeared one day. Did you know how sad our hyungnims were?

450
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,550
Let's hurry up and go.

451
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,340
Where are you going?

452
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:25,070
Why? You don't want us to embarrass you because your friend is here?

453
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,880
You make friends who look the same as you.

454
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:33,320
It's been a while since we've seen each other, can't you give us money just like you used to?

455
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,150
Let's go.

456
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:39,140
Shouldn't you at least try to fight them even though you are in the lower class?

457
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,800
Is it that since we haven't seen each other for a while that you've become braver or that you've lost your mind?

458
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,500
Let's resolve this through words. Let's do this through words.

459
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:54,530
That's how it should've been in the first place.

460
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,660
Get lost.

461
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,720
Yeop Jeong? Where are you appearing from?

462
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,240
Are you really students from Moorim School?

463
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,660
Do you have to say such hateful things even after helping us?

464
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,880
I don't want you guys to disgrace our school.

465
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,640
Choi Ho, running around and doing their bidding, were you living like that?

466
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,450
It's not only your grades that are disgraceful but you were living like this?

467
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:47,270
Hey, Yeop Jeong!

468
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,870
Ah, that jerk, really.

469
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,900
Drink.

470
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:09,480
The night view is good here but it's a bit cold.

471
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,980
Later, when you bring Seon Deok, it would be good if you take her to a coffee shop with a nice view.

472
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,150
Somewhere where it's warm.

473
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,050
That doesn't seem like a thing that a person who ruined a confession should say.

474
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,740
Right? I was also fretting about whether I should say something or not.

475
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,990
What happened to your hand?

476
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,110
Don't laugh.

477
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,280
It hurts.

478
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:50,260
Are you still cold?

479
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,060
No, I'm okay.

480
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:57,850
♫Why am I like this? I can only think of you.♫

481
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:01,450
♬I keep smiling, even during the hard times♬

482
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:06,710
♬  What did you do to me? ♬

483
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:09,060
♬  Everything seems so weird now  ♬

484
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,160
Let's go.
♬  Everything seems so weird now  ♬

485
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,010
Can't we stay here... just a little bit more?

486
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:18,570
I still have some coffee.

487
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,150
Let's go once I'm done drinking it.

488
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,310
Okay.

489
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:28,240
♬ All day long is filled to the brim with you  ♬

490
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:34,500
♬  Now I just can't stop, my girl  ♬

491
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:39,340
♬  'Cause you are my girl  ♬

492
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:44,200
♬  Wherever I go, whatever you do  ♬

493
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,350
♬  being with you would be so great  ♬

494
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:54,400
♬ Even if I was offered the world, I wouldn't trade you.♬

495
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,470
♬I will be okay even if I lose everything♬

496
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:06,450
♬  What should I do now? I fell for you hard.  ♬

497
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,260
Hey!

498
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:18,740
What's that? Aren't those Hwang Seon Ah's clothes?

499
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:26,740
I'm Seon Ah. Seon Ah.

500
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,400
What?

501
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,610
What's that?

502
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,420
Nadet gave it. It's a GPS that tracks me.

503
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,870
A GPS that tracks you?

504
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:43,030
Who's monitoring you?

505
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,450
It's not me-- no.

506
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,950
It's Seon Ah's.

507
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,470
Seon Ah received the order from the headmaster not to leave,

508
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,390
so I'm pretending to be Seon Ah in her place.

509
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:56,330
Am I the weird one here?

510
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:59,050
The more I hear, the more I don't understand what you're saying.

511
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:01,360
You don't need to understand everything.

512
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,340
I also don't know why I'm doing this.

513
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:15,540
But why are you still at the hotel instead of going out?

514
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:23,550
I was worried that there was a person who wouldn't want to run into me, so that's why I stayed.

515
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:27,520
In the end we met like this.

516
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,880
For the first time in a long time, let's have a hot bath.

517
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,190
Shall we?

518
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,060
Where are you two going?

519
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,050
Well, we're just on our way to the movie theater.

520
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,130
Both of you?

521
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:54,590
Well, there's not much to do.

522
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:57,690
Oh great, we were also on our way to the movie theater.

523
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,500
Really? I thought we were on our way to the Sauna...

524
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,200
There's a bug.

525
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:09,670
Why? Is there a reason why I shouldn't come?

526
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:14,070
Is there a reason why just the two of us shouldn't go?

527
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:25,990
I feel like I'm suffocating.

528
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,630
What is that?

529
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:34,690
Did it stop?

530
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:41,460
Yes I'm really sorry. The system seems to be broken.

531
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,540
We'll restart it soon.

532
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,570
Start.

533
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,650
- Actually
- Actually

534
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:09,910
I'm sorry for that day. It's--

535
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,230
I understand everything.

536
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:15,060
As we live, we can, unexpectedly, ki--

537
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:20,450
You can kiss.

538
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,490
Kiss... It's not that big of a deal.

539
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:27,830
I forgot everything. No need to be sorry.

540
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:31,230
The reason why I'm sorry,

541
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:35,410
I mean, I'm sorry that I said sorry that night.

542
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:40,850
It might mean nothing to you, but

543
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:45,330
I wasn't fooling around.

544
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,110
Are you okay?

545
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,710
Yeah, I'm okay.

546
00:50:57,310 --> 00:50:59,430
Joking...

547
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:01,470
He wasn't joking?

548
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:22,930
Eh, Sim Soon Deok! Sim Soon Deok are you inside?

549
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:25,010
Hey Sim Soon Deok!

550
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:32,310
Hello?

551
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,390
By chance, is Soon Deok with you?

552
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:37,090
Soon Deok? No.

553
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:39,010
What's wrong?

554
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:41,530
You can't find Soon Deok?

555
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,910
She suddenly disappeared. Something's weird.

556
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,550
What do you mean Soon Deok disappeared? She promised to stay at the hotel.

557
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:50,070
Where could she go?

558
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,810
Give me that.

559
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:55,570
What are you saying, Yoon Si Woo? What do you mean Soon Deok disappeared?

560
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:58,330
What the heck are you saying?!

561
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:02,630
Probably nothing has happened. I'll call you after looking for her further.

562
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,890
We have to go.

563
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:12,470
By any chance, nothing is happening to the kids, right?

564
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,730
The air-con seems to be off as well.

565
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:21,150
This is taking way too long.

566
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:25,450
Nadet! Trace the GPS on Seon Ah, hurry!

567
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,290
I need to know where she is.

568
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:29,190
Wait.

569
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:47,250
She does not have the item you were talking about.

570
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,350
She's not at the hotel?

571
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,150
Where is that place then?

572
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:59,610
Can you fly your drone?

573
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:12,890
It seems, as you expected, that the clue is within the school.

574
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:14,110
Understood.

575
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:17,850
What about the kid? Should I take her to him?

576
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:20,990
Him?

577
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:22,810
No.

578
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:24,750
Get rid of her.

579
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:47,650
Excuse me, you are Yoon Si Woo, right?

580
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:48,770
Where is the 63 building?

581
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:52,350
- Give me a sign please.
- It's really Yoon Si Woo!

582
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,230
Excuse me.

583
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:58,190
Excuse me, I have to go.

584
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:04,470
Sorry.

585
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:07,290
Sorry, please move out the way.

586
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:42,650
I've told the chairman so execute his order.

587
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:44,350
Get rid of her.

588
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:47,550
Yes, I understand.

589
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:50,010
To get rid of me?

590
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,390
Where am I?

591
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:31,290
Stay still.

592
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:36,550
The energy in your body is the same as Earth's energy.

593
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:04,470
Are you feeling better now?

594
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:10,070
Looks like this powerful energy you're unable to control

595
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:14,570
is inside your body.

596
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:20,650
If you can't overcome this energy by yourself

597
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:23,390
the pain might never go away.

598
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:27,290
By chance,

599
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:29,910
are you someone from Moorim?

600
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,330
You know about Moorim?

601
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:01,750
I'm...

602
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:08,350
- Yeah, Hwang Seon Ah.
- Where are you right now?

603
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:09,490
I'm almost there, and you?

604
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:12,130
We just arrived. Hurry up.

605
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,670
Okay, I'll be there soon.

606
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,380
Oppa, are you all right?

607
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,330
Soon Deok!

608
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,830
Sim Soon Deok!

609
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:37,390
Soon Deok!

610
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:39,890
Soon Deok!

611
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:41,590
Soon Deok!

612
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:46,090
It'll be better to leave this place.

613
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:48,870
Take care of it.

614
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,670
Yes.

615
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:09,530
Neither of us can run into Young Master.

616
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,830
Soon Deok!

617
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,610
Wang Chi Ang!

618
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,330
Go find Soon Deok.

619
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,990
Yoon Si Woo!

620
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:20,070
Hwang Seon Ah! Where's Soon Deok?

621
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:22,590
They got Chi Ang.

622
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,960
This jerk.

623
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:00,800
Wang Chi Ang...

624
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:37,600
Wang Chi Ang! Wang Chi Ang!

625
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:41,430
Endure it a bit more.

626
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:06,180
Soon Deok!

627
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:10,870
Sim Soon Deok!

628
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:22,390
Chi Ang!

629
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:27,950
♬  Yeah I am alive, look straight at me♬

630
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:30,790
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?
♬  For dozens of times I will get up once again♬

631
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:33,390
♬ Yeah, I'm alive. Watch me.♬

632
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,400
♬  Now close both eyes and feel me ♬

633
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:43,160
♬  In the deep pitch-black darkness
like a child who has lost his way ♬

634
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,900
That's a relief.

635
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,730
♬  Even if I scream♬

636
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:50,500
It's such a relief.
♬  No one will hear♬

637
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:54,830
♬  Buried deep in my heart♬

♬  In the memory of a shout directed at me
Faint consciousness♬
