1
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,030
I helped you when you were trembling because of those hooligans, but

2
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,090
what? I received money?

3
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,590
Looking at your level of thought, I think it's okay to call you a loser.

4
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,930
Talk properly. Who ordered you?!

5
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,890
Won't you let go of that hand?

6
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,890
Oh my, oh my, oh my.

7
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,130
Professor Kim! Where are you?

8
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,830
Don't tell me it's happened ...

9
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,810
The barrier has been removed.

10
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,870
What is this place?

11
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,730
Moorim School?

12
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,450
♬  Yeah I am alive ♬

13
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,040
♬  Look straight at me.♬

14
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,830
♬  For dozens of times I will get up once again♬

15
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:55,130
♫ Yeah I'm alive. Watch over me. Now, close both eyes and feel me♫

16
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,090
Safe!

17
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,870
I almost didn't get in.

18
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,890
But how did the barrier get removed?

19
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,450
The barrier has been removed.

20
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,930
Headmaster, I brought some new students.

21
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,630
Didn't you say there was one new student?

22
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:53,130
I came just because I wanted to meet the headmaster.

23
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,730
Everyone back to your own places. For now, you two follow me.

24
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,370
Now, everyone to your own places. Hurry.

25
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,670
Moorim School
Episode 2

26
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:36,570
Moorim School was founded to secure world peace.

27
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,230
It is the only school built by the UN Peace-keeping organization.

28
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:47,330
For the last ten years running, we've come in first both in the team and individual categories at the world martial arts tournament.

29
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,370
For twelve years in a row, the school has been ranked as the number one martial arts academy.

30
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,830
For fifteen years in a row, the school ranked number one for best student satisfaction.

31
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:03,190
Although Moorim School has trained some of the finest students in the world,

32
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,090
it doesn't appear in any official records.

33
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,370
Isn't this sort of strange?

34
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,210
You're the most strange.

35
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,250
Why did Mobius's Yoon Si Woo come here?

36
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,950
He has a ton of popularity.

37
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,590
Hey, Wang Chi Ang is the son of Shanghai Group in China.

38
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,930
He's very rich and everyone knows him.

39
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,230
Why would such great kids come to our school?

40
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,550
Oh my god! My drone!

41
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,530
Who removed the barrier?

42
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:05,560
Wasn't it the headmaster who opened it beforehand? It's possible if it was planned since new students were coming.

43
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,050
I definitely felt another force.

44
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,630
Perhaps, it wouldn't be those kids?

45
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,010
Those two kids removed the barrier? Is that even possible?

46
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,880
It's impossible. It doesn't make sense.

47
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,920
How did Yoon Si Woo and Wang Chi Ang come here?

48
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,510
I somehow ended up guiding Wang Chi Ang and

49
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:34,820
Yoon Si Woo... I met him in front of the school.

50
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,590
Did you remove the barrier for them?

51
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:42,580
No. Well, that was sort of strange.

52
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,150
Couldn't it be that the headmaster opened it beforehand?

53
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,610
Perhaps... Did they really remove the barrier?

54
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,820
Our Oppa Si Woo?

55
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,420
Headmaster Hwang Moo Song

56
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:19,090
Is my question hard? I asked what you came to learn.

57
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,720
Because it's Moorim School, isn't it martial arts?

58
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,110
Martial arts?

59
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:33,040
Truthfully, I came because my father sent me.

60
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,400
I like that you're truthful.

61
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,740
And you?

62
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,610
I want to tell you separately.

63
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,480
The entrance ceremony is planned for next week but classes will start tomorrow.

64
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,650
Wang Chi Ang, it's late. You should rest up in the dormitory today.

65
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,650
Headmaster, everything is ready.

66
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,930
Please escort this friend first.

67
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,320
This is the dorm you will stay in.

68
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,330
Oh right. What you need to know is the first rule of Moorim School.

69
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,590
- You do everything yourself.
- Pardon?

70
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,720
Raising, cutting, dicing, boiling, eating, clothing, washing, erasing, and throwing away.

71
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,440
You do everything on your own.

72
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,810
Why would I wipe and clean? Is there no cleaning staff here?

73
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:38,860
There's no cook either. Professors, students, and most importantly, security.

74
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,060
That's me.

75
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,600
What you see is what you get.

76
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,810
The school has no money.

77
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,540
Don't worry. I can just tell my father to sponsor this school.

78
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,020
It's not because we don't have money.

79
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:01,050
Kids these days only know about wearing, eating, buying, and studying.

80
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,850
That's a given. If we sweep and wipe, when will we study?

81
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,040
Hey, man. That's real studying.

82
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,750
Don't think of not doing what you haven't done.

83
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,120
The more I see of this school the stranger it gets.

84
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,760
Even the security guard is strange.

85
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,600
Are you still not ready to tell me?

86
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,470
Although this may sound crazy—

87
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,350
Can you not hear?

88
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,330
How did you know?

89
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,920
If you came because of that—

90
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,930
Can you fix it for me?

91
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:59,040
Do you think your situation is the one which needs to be changed first ?

92
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,200
I have to hear for me to set the situation straight or whatever.

93
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,140
Do you think your problem is because of your ears?

94
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,130
The problem

95
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,950
seems to be in there.

96
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,350
If you want to study here,

97
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,120
I will accept you.

98
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,970
Study?

99
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,370
Are you telling me to study martial arts here or something?

100
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,510
Do you understand under what circumstances I came here—

101
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,310
Never mind.

102
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,630
I found the interviewee who said I ran away.

103
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,000
I'll bring that Sim Soon Deok or whatever to Seoul immediately.

104
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,220
Set up an interview.

105
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,340
Will it be solved just because you do that?

106
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,460
Do you know how much the company lost because of you?

107
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,580
Event cancellation fees and CF contract cancellation fees, it's chaos because the company is about to shut down.

108
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,490
Can't you make an exception?!

109
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,990
Do you also lose your sense of awareness if you can't hear?

110
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,940
What?

111
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:21,350
You should know that if the situation unfolds like this, you need to be aware and leave on your own. That's how you can live.

112
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,590
The president sent a certified letter to your house, so read it and send it to your lawyer.

113
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,880
I have to use a place smaller than my room's bathroom?

114
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,010
Mermaid princess?

115
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,050
Soon Deok?

116
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,300
What is it?

117
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,640
Here's the schedule of all the classes. It's from the professor.

118
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,680
But where is Yoon Si Woo?

119
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,540
I don't know. Why would you ask me that?

120
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,900
There's no set schedule. It's a free system where you just go to the lectures that you want to hear.

121
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,400
We're in the same dorm, so we have to do introductions.

122
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,440
- This is Shannon from England.
- Hello.

123
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,860
Korean: Jenny, Dong Goo, and Sang Man. He's much older than us.

124
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,520
Nadet is from Thailand.

125
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,250
How are you?

126
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,460
- That's his introduction, just accept it.
- It hasn't been a long time since he came to Korea so his Korean is a bit stiff,

127
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,680
but if you keep listening to him you can hear.

128
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,080
How did you remove the barrier?

129
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,300
Barrier?

130
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,550
What's the barrier?

131
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:51,510
Oh, I'm Choi Ho. Nice to meet you, friend.

132
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,240
Sorry but I choose my own friends based on my level.

133
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,540
What's with him?

134
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,940
- I expected this but...
- He's even more incredible than what we expected.

135
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,180
-Let's go to Seoul.
- What? Hey!

136
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,850
Go and tell the truth, whether you received money or whether someone ordered you.

137
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:34,360
I already told you that I only helped because it looked as if gangsters were bothering you.

138
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,570
When did I ever ask you for help?

139
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,070
I didn't run away that night.

140
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,940
Cameras were filming us, the paparazzi were filming us.

141
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,000
If those pictures start to circulate strangely, if a strange scandal starts,

142
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,200
Da Rim will suffer great losses.

143
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,090
You should have just said so...

144
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,070
Do you think they'll believe me if I tell them when the situation is like this?!

145
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,050
So go and tell them with your own mouth.

146
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,770
Tell them that I didn't run away!

147
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,620
Okay, fine. For now, calm down.

148
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,880
Calm down and...

149
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,850
let's go after my chicken delivery part-time job ends.

150
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,830
Wait,

151
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,790
I have to stop by my father's place after that. It's too late then.

152
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,370
Oh, this weekend—

153
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,260
Ah, that won't work either. I have a part time job on the weekends too.

154
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,930
Hey.

155
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,570
Are school and your part time job important right now?

156
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,970
I'm about to lose everything because of your thoughtless interview!

157
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,360
- Let's go right now.
- Ah!

158
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,000
Is your life the only one that's important? I can't go right now.

159
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,700
As expected, did President Choi really order you to do it?

160
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,870
- How much did you receive?
- What?

161
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,300
How much did you receive to say a lie like that?

162
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,460
How much did you sell your conscience for?

163
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,570
You really haven't become a human being yet.

164
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,310
What?

165
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,470
If you're going to ask a favor, do it properly.

166
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,490
It's the proper order to thank me for helping you out that night.

167
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,400
Asking me a favor to go with you to Seoul to help you clear your name comes after that.

168
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,450
I already told you but I'm not thankful at all.

169
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:17,180
Clearing my name is not a favor, it's something you should do as a given.

170
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,580
I'm sorry but I

171
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,700
must leave now for my part-time job.

172
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,960
Young Master Chi Ang arrived at Moorim School safely.

173
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,480
Madam, it seems you don't have to worry about much.

174
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,860
How could I not worry?

175
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,010
It's his first time in an environment like that. Our Chi Ang is picky with what he eats and he's sensitive so—

176
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,090
Do it in moderation.

177
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,100
- Let's leave now.
- Yes.

178
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,770
You're planning to leave already? It's late, you should sleep over and leave tomorrow morning.

179
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,490
I'm fine.

180
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,770
Yoon Si Woo.

181
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,630
♫ If I look over, I was really young.♫

182
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,990
♫ Past events are annoying♫

183
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:00,650
♫ Just a worrisome child ♫

184
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:05,250
Yoon Si Woo? You're the kid who uploaded your singing on the Internet, right?

185
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,600
Nickname: Mobius.

186
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,440
Who are you?

187
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,670
Do you have any thoughts of working with me?

188
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,500
#1 this week is

189
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,230
a team that rose up quickly as soon as they debuted.

190
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,450
It's Mobius who became #1 just three weeks after their debut!

191
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,200
♫ I will be there. Believe in me ♫

192
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,700
♬  I gotta run, run, run,  ♬

193
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,690
You did well, my son!

194
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,500
President...

195
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,200
♫If that day comes ♫

196
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,950
You did well.

197
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,930
You said you don't know your father's or your mother's faces, right?

198
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:51,720
Although I can't be your mom, I'll play the role of your father.

199
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,420
♫ I have to run.♫

200
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,290
What father? Money was your goal from the beginning.

201
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,920
Stay still.

202
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:37,130
A person's energy is the same as this world's energy.

203
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:46,010
If you cannot hear, it means that one of your energy points is malfunctioning.

204
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,950
Finding what that is

205
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,290
won't be a problem.

206
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,800
If you're going to return now, I'll escort you out to the gates.

207
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,920
Our school security system is somewhat unique.

208
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,220
I can't leave right now.

209
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,360
Is it not because you don't have a place to go to?

210
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,340
I'm not leaving by myself. No, I can't go by myself

211
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,600
because this entire situation unfolded due to a female student at this school.

212
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,780
You blamed your ears in the beginning. Are you blaming one of the students at our school now?

213
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,810
Why?

214
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,520
Did you question yourself in here?

215
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:55,590
Isn't it telling you to stay here?

216
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,150
What?

217
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:03,920
There's no guarantee that you'll get better just because you stay here.

218
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,290
However, you could get better if you spend time and train.

219
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,740
Everything is up to you.

220
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,040
♬  Yeah I am alive ♬

221
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,420
♬  Look straight at me.♬

222
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,630
♬  For dozens of times I will get up once again♬

223
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,130
♫ Yeah I'm alive. ♫

224
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,890
♬  Watch me. ♬

225
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,030
♫Now, close both eyes and feel me  ♫

226
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,580
Let's go!

227
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,800
♬  In front of everyone♬

228
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,740
♬  I'll show more of myself♬

229
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,320
♬  I'm alive and breathing♬

230
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,020
What's the reason you suddenly changed your mind?

231
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,590
I know that you don't trust me.

232
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,880
I'll really do it properly this time.

233
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,010
On the condition that when I return to China, I can take my mom—

234
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,730
If this is about your mom, we already agreed to do that.

235
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,930
Yes, I can do it.

236
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,260
If I put my mind to it, I can do it.

237
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,800
♬  I'm newly born♬

238
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,230
What? He agreed to accept Yoon Si Woo as a new student?

239
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,870
Couldn't it be that he wants to know exactly how the barrier was removed?

240
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,200
Isn't enduring the school even more of a problem than admission?

241
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,570
I'm more worried about the student named Wang Chi Ang than I am of Yoon Si Woo.

242
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,300
Kids these days have no perseverance.

243
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:57,990
When I was a student here, this school became an addiction, I couldn't help it.

244
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,450
Was it a different Kim Dae Ho who went out and cried about not wanting to come back?

245
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:09,650
The person who wanted to run away together and dragged me to the terminal must have been Oh Di not Yoo Di.

246
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,620
Please do your lovers' quarrel somewhere else.

247
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,430
Why do you fight like that every day?

248
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,210
We broke up yesterday.

249
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,480
No... Didn't you two break up last time and start seeing each other again—

250
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,090
Professor Daniel, that's not what's important.

251
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,920
The important thing is I'm single now.

252
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:39,860
It seems that two kids arrived here today.

253
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:47,040
Wasn't the entering student originally supposed to be just Wang Chi Ang?

254
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,290
Yes.

255
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,150
What are you planning to do?

256
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,420
He must be in need of something if he sought us out.

257
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,200
Kicking out someone who is in need of help goes against the code of martial arts.

258
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,080
It's possible...

259
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,880
that that child didn't come to find Moorim School,

260
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:15,940
rather that this school called him.

261
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,140
Yeah, just for a while.

262
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,890
Let's just stay here

263
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,070
until the problem is resolved.

264
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,010
- You again?
- You're here again?

265
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,790
Ah, Jeez.

266
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,470
They say that you meet your enemy on a bamboo bridge.

267
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:25,050
It's a wooden bridge not bamboo bridge you idiot.

268
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,750
Why are you here?

269
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,990
Si Woo also enrolled here.

270
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,170
Was this a school that accepted anyone?

271
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,930
Please change me to a different room.

272
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,940
I can't stay with this noisy guy.

273
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,930
I should be the one saying that. You want me to share a place smaller than my bathroom with him?

274
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,500
Isn't there a suite room in this dorm, something that VIPs use?

275
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,930
What suite room nonsense.

276
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:53,610
It's fine. I can just tell my father to build another building.

277
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,970
There is no special treatment in this dorm.

278
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:00,250
I can't tolerate you two disturbing everyone else living here with reasons like this.

279
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,850
Both of you, go back to your room.

280
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,990
If we really have to use the same room, you take this bed. It's right in front of the bathroom.

281
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,320
This view is the sole thing I liked in this room.

282
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,340
I thought we had absolutely nothing in common but we have one.

283
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,370
This is the only view that I liked in this school.

284
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,790
I sat on that bed and farted earlier.

285
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,970
I changed the sheets as soon as I came in.

286
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,030
This rude jerk.

287
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,520
Hey! I'm sensitive when I sleep

288
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,420
so if you snore, you'll die.

289
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,940
Ah, he's seriously such a rude bastard.

290
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,290
Who's playing the piano so late at night?

291
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,800
Is it also mandatory in this school for us to listen to lullabies?

292
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,970
Hey! Go down and argue with them.

293
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,540
He said he was sensitive so what is this?

294
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,680
I don't like him.

295
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,160
Mom.

296
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,660
Just wait for a bit.

297
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,220
You guys!

298
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,910
Your lectures are by choice but morning exercise is mandatory.

299
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,350
Hurry, hurry, get up! Hurry, get up and wash up!

300
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,810
Hurry, hurry!

301
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,480
Now, attention. Bow.

302
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,420
Raise your fists. Block, twist,

303
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,780
push, and finish it off here. Okay?

304
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,940
Do it properly. Work hard.

305
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,210
- What is he doing?
- What are you doing?

306
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,700
Oppa Si Woo.

307
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,760
What are you two doing?

308
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,860
Aren't you going to pull yourselves together?

309
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,350
It's you, right? You're the one who saved me at the concert, right?

310
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,190
Why did you do that?

311
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:22,950
What?

312
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,900
You said that if I came to Moorim School—

313
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,570
Can you not hear? Does it hurt?

314
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:31,360
Come to Moorim School. The headmaster will be able to cure it for you.

315
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,230
Ah, that.

316
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:38,590
Y-You saw him yesterday too, right? The headmaster here

317
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,120
is very skilled and

318
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,280
the air is really fresh here...

319
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,700
And the cafeteria food here is really delicious. So...

320
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,100
Anyway, I welcome your enrollment in Moorim School.

321
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:03,480
Then, I'll be going. See you later.

322
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,640
Yoon Si Woo.

323
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:23,510
How is it? Is this school to your liking?

324
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,700
No. I don't really know.

325
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,280
You don't really know?

326
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,000
You came here for a reason and I don't know that reason yet.

327
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,730
Anyway, you came here to this school by yourself because you wanted something.

328
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,500
What is the reason?

329
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,690
What's the real reason you came to this place?

330
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,180
I can't tell you.

331
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,250
I don't want to either.

332
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,790
What?

333
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,120
Shanghai, China

334
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,470
Did you have a good trip from Korea?

335
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,920
Did anything happen?

336
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,910
That condition of the person in the hospital is still the same.

337
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,480
Is it possible that he could wake up?

338
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,120
From what I heard, the chances are really low. But since he has a very great life energy—

339
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,050
I'm sure.

340
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:51,770
Take care of the matter well. If something happens, report to me immediately.

341
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:47,380
Where did our Ariel disappear to as soon as gym ended?

342
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,170
Ariel!

343
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:11,470
What are you doing to your friends?

344
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,330
My friends? What are you talking about?

345
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:18,620
What are you, the mermaid princess, doing to your fish friends?

346
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,710
If you're going to call me that, say it properly. It's not "Mare-made Princess" it's "Mer-maid Princess".

347
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,500
- Repeat after me "mer". - Mer

348
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,150
- Maid.
- Maid.

349
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,000
- Mermaid princess.
- Maremaid princess.

350
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,130
Don't do it, don't do it. Aish. If you call me that one more time, I'm not going to let you go.

351
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:41,640
That's why I just call you Ariel. The mermaid princess's name in the cartoon is Ariel.

352
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:46,560
I don't know if her name is Ariel or Cereal but my name is Soon Deok.

353
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,110
Ariel, you're even prettier when you get angry.

354
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:56,750
Oh my god... I'm in charge of breakfast today. I have to clean these really quickly.

355
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,810
I have to go to class after this and then I have to go to my part time job,

356
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:04,850
so leave and don't bother me anymore.

357
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,690
Ariel, today is the last day you have to do anything like this.

358
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,490
I'll tell my father to hire cleaning staff and chefs at this school

359
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,830
so you can just study.

360
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:23,330
Would you please get lost when I'm still being nice?

361
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:31,250
Do you know that you're the first person to treat me like this.

362
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,590
I think I like you even more because of that.

363
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,330
Hey! Go!

364
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:04,310
Fishy smell. Ariel is so aggressive.

365
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:11,810
Yesterday, you came here together with the chicken-head girl, right? Do you know her?

366
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:15,850
Chicken-head? Ariel?

367
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:20,330
Mind your own business. How dare you call my Ariel "chicken-head"?

368
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,490
Are you saying she's a chicken-head?

369
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:28,330
Wasn't it an old-fashioned name like Soon Deok or whatever?

370
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:31,410
Well, anyway. You know her contact information, don't you?

371
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,790
If I knew, do you think I would tell you?

372
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,210
Of course he wouldn't know.

373
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,910
Hey, forget it. Get lost.

374
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:43,170
I'm clearly telling you this now. My Ariel isn't a woman you can covet.

375
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,370
I already marked her as mine.

376
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,750
I saw Yoon Si Woo in person this morning and his looks aren't that great.

377
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,130
Did they really enroll in our school? Both of them?

378
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:08,490
I thought Wang Chi Ang would go home crying yesterday but he's enduring.

379
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:11,410
I told you that he would endure for at least a day.

380
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:15,090
Anyway, you have to clean our room for a week because we won the bet.

381
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,170
I'm happy so I'll laugh.

382
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,550
When is the entrance ceremony?

383
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,630
Usually, if you survive a week, you will have the entrance ceremony.

384
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,650
So, that means they won't have an entrance ceremony.

385
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:31,010
- Still, the barrier was removed—
- I said it was a coincidence.

386
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,930
The barrier cannot be removed that easily.

387
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:37,670
Well, Wang Chi Ang didn't even know what the barrier was.

388
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,110
Then, is it possible that Yoon Si Woo removed the barrier?

389
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:45,730
Yoon Si Woo is the same. Just wait a bit.

390
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:50,270
I'm gonna make them cry and go home like a baby.

391
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,670
You are what you eat.

392
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:03,670
The food you eat forms you.

393
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:13,570
The kitchen is a very dangerous place where hot oil, fire, and knives—careful—

394
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,890
reside.

395
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:20,910
In the event that you can't lose your nervousness, cooking and martial arts are two that can't be separated.

396
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,470
Today's menu is specially fried food.

397
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,150
Aish, why do I have to be your partner?

398
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:31,670
Not all fried food is the same. Based on the country, ingredients,

399
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:35,770
and the person who makes it, a different food will be assembled.

400
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,830
During the process, you will learn how to work together and be creative.

401
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:43,470
Feel how the food enters your body, reacts, and leaves.

402
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:48,310
- Feel how the food leaves? Is he talking about pooping?
- If you put ice in the frying mixture, the finished food will become crispier.

403
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:51,850
However, be careful to prevent

404
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:55,890
ice from going into hot oil unless you want an explosion.

405
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,230
You're quite good at this.

406
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,850
You're not going to do anything?

407
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:15,290
Isn't tasting food also an important aspect?

408
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,130
Here.

409
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:34,330
Hurry. More.

410
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,970
Hey, you put in too much!

411
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:40,090
The time of truth has come.

412
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:44,110
To find out what they really are about.

413
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,870
What?

414
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:55,410
The professor told us to cooperate. We have too much batter so I just want to give some to you.

415
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,670
I quite like you.

416
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,610
I think it's all done...

417
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,210
Hey, what about the batter?

418
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,950
- It's all done, it's all done.
- If it's done, put it in.

419
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,950
- Even if you don't tell me, I'm going to put it in.
- One by one.

420
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,310
I told you to put it in one by one.

421
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,390
What the heck?

422
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,310
Everyone, be careful!

423
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,060
♫ Follow me, look at me ♫

424
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:14,410
♫ What are you doing?
Now I control you.  ♫

425
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:18,300
♫ Finally everyone on the hot stage crazy.♫

426
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,400
♬  Let's intentionally play out of our minds.♬

427
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,660
♫ I'm different, different (hey)! I'm different, different (hey)  ♫

428
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,160
♫ I don't know either, I don't know ♫

429
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,340
♫ I will show you. I'm fast, fast. I'm fast, fast. ♫

430
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:36,100
♫ Feel it as it is,
ah ah ah ah ah I'm the king ♫

431
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,720
Are you okay?

432
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,550
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

433
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,490
Won't you let go? Do what on purpose?

434
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:02,820
You put ice inside on purpose to make me look like a fool!

435
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,480
Would I kill myself too just to screw with you?

436
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,380
Stop!

437
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,540
They don't have basics, no basics!

438
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,870
They dare to grab collars in front of their professor?

439
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:28,020
One kid is accepted because of contributions and the other kid...

440
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,670
Why do we have an idol in Moorim School?

441
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,410
Send him out before he creates more accidents.

442
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,300
I think it's too early to decide on anything.

443
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,290
Let's wait and see a bit more.

444
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,960
As expected, Professor Daniel has a different way of thinking than the ill-tempered Professor Kim.

445
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,400
Yes. Let's just watch a bit more.

446
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,730
Who said they would leave in one day?

447
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,580
I said they would leave, not that we would chase them out.

448
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:02,330
Does the rule that you get expelled if you fight only apply to students?

449
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,010
Dad, so you have to fix it.

450
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,030
No, just tell him to dig his ear like this.

451
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,990
No, it's not because of that.

452
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,230
Then tell him to go to a ear, nose, and throat doctor.

453
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,460
Dad!

454
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,260
I'm still wondering if I should let you go of your unexcused absence to

455
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:29,340
see a concert and babbling about Moorim School to a complete stranger. Now, what?

456
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,760
You want me to fix his ear too?

457
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,940
Please! Save my Si Woo Oppa.

458
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,030
- Hwang Seon Ah.
- My Si Woo Oppa is different from other people.

459
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,440
He's kind of... extraordinary, something like that?

460
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,050
He even made the stage lights that were dropping to the stage freeze.

461
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,520
Really! I saw it.

462
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:18,800
Ariel, there are more classrooms here than I thought, I was looking for a long time.

463
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,680
Shh! This is meditation time.

464
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,680
- Control your heart.
- Mm.

465
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:40,480
What? Is he following me?

466
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,710
When class is over, come see me

467
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:54,280
where we met yesterday.

468
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,030
What are you?

469
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,010
Thanks for earlier.

470
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,560
Yeah, well...

471
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,380
Why does that bastard want to see you?

472
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,900
I don't know.

473
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:37,040
No matter how much I think about it, this doesn't seem like you.

474
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,250
About accepting Yoon Si Woo and Wang Chi Ang to Moorim School.

475
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:43,930
Perhaps,

476
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,990
Is it because of the barrier?

477
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,210
If it wasn't you who opened the barrier in advance.

478
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:55,970
If one of them or the both of them together removed the barrier then...

479
00:45:55,970 --> 00:46:00,900
As you said, this might be a decision that's unlike me.

480
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,200
I only hope that my

481
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,660
guilty conscience and my trust

482
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,000
won't be wrong.

483
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,700
The basic purpose of meditation is

484
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,980
to take a look at your inner self.

485
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:24,500
Take it as opening the acupuncture point.

486
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,930
Think of yourselves receiving energy from the heavens,

487
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,680
and feel the energy in your surroundings.

488
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,560
Awaken your entire body. Breathe in,

489
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,210
and breathe out. This is how

490
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:43,000
you get ready to receive life energy.

491
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,680
I'm not telling you to sleep!

492
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,730
Now. With your own body,

493
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,530
go into your heart.

494
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:07,640
Do you see what you want to overcome?

495
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,160
Shannon, do you see something?

496
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:16,610
I see... chicken.

497
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,210
Hwang Seon Ah.

498
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,330
Some

499
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,680
fire.

500
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,040
I can feel the heat.

501
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:13,710
Yoon Si Woo.

502
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:16,200
What do you see?

503
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,100
Nothing.

504
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,950
I see nothing.

505
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,530
You need to know yourself—

506
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,580
I see, Professor!

507
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:43,630
What do you see?

508
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,870
I see gangsters.

509
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:51,850
I would run away and leave the girl behind, if I were there.

510
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,930
These gangsters are very frightening.

511
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,110
What is he saying?

512
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,920
Professor, I'm really scared of those gangsters.

513
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,310
Hey, don't laugh!

514
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,270
Why would you come all the way to such a shabby place?

515
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:06,540
Our Soon Deok escorted your son well last night.

516
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,130
She said not to worry.

517
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:11,060
Thank you so much.

518
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,310
I don't know how to thank you.

519
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:16,310
No. You don't need to thank us.

520
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:21,560
What are you talking about? Your daughter saved my son's life.

521
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,540
We didn't do it expecting anything.

522
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,440
Even though I can't see,

523
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,910
I can feel everything with my heart.

524
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:30,290
Our daughter will be like that too.

525
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:36,650
This is a small token of my gratitude. Please accept it and don't reject it.

526
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,040
Don't worry about your son.

527
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,430
If he occasionally comes over to our house,

528
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:48,410
I will make sure to cook something delicious for him.

529
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,150
Please take it back.

530
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:01,730
Rejecting so much isn't polite either.

531
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:06,160
That's right. Please accept it.

532
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,690
Nothing in life is free.

533
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:13,070
This is what I've learned.

534
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,260
I won't say this twice. Please take it back.

535
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,350
Ah, excuse me.

536
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,430
Ah.

537
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:22,940
You know,

538
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:27,210
you could give it to me discreetly.

539
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,650
Pardon?

540
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:32,370
No. It's fine. Just go.

541
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,630
Yes, then.

542
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:35,890
Excuse me. But,

543
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:39,050
haven't we met somewhere before?

544
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:40,170
Pardon?

545
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:43,190
Where is your hometown?

546
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,030
Why suddenly my hometown?

547
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,330
Isn't it Masan?

548
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:49,490
Foxy girl from Changdong?

549
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,870
Right?

550
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:54,150
I'm the double eyelids girl from Oryungdo!

551
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,390
Don't you remember me?

552
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:57,820
What are you talking about?

553
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,550
Then, please take good care of our Chi Ang.

554
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:05,190
I'm sorry. Please go.

555
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:09,610
She's not?

556
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:19,250
Anyway, I will make my Soon Deok marry that rich boy.

557
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:24,530
I wonder if Soon Deok is seducing Young Master Wang Chi Ang well?

558
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:41,790
Aside from my leg falling asleep,

559
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:43,610
meditation class is nice.

560
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:47,250
I can just sit next to you in class.

561
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:50,670
You know how to say things that hurt people's feeling.

562
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,390
You thought that the class was okay?

563
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:54,770
You're getting angry again.

564
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:58,490
Are you doing it on purpose because I said you look pretty when you get angry?

565
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:00,630
Wang Chi Ang.

566
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,310
I didn't come here to play, like you,

567
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,610
so please don't bother me.

568
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:09,850
Ariel!

569
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,270
What?

570
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:14,190
You...

571
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,970
If you mess around our Oppa Si Woo again,

572
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:19,230
I won't stay still.

573
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,910
Our Si Woo?

574
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:24,740
Are you Yoon Si Woo's follower?

575
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,520
This is a warning.

576
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,230
I'm not scared at all.

577
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:36,110
Ariel! Let's go together!

578
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:58,110
Just because you're here, doesn't mean you'll get better.

579
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,600
As time passes and you train, it could get better.

580
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,200
Everything depends on you.

581
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,990
♬ Here comes the fire ♬

582
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:17,450
♬ Here comes the fire ♬

583
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:18,990
Cool Ariel.

584
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,550
♬ Whatever anyone says ♬

585
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,330
♬ I don't care. Set it On Fire. ♬

586
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:24,940
♬ Just walk away. Go! ♬

587
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,630
♬ Don’t try to Push Me In Your Way ♬

588
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,480
He's still here?

589
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:32,300
He still hasn't left yet?
♬ Sky yay yay yay I can't forget .  ♬

590
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:35,120
♬ Here comes the fire. ♬

591
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:39,930
♬ Here comes the fire. ♬

592
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,490
♬ Here come the fire. ♬

593
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:46,000
♬ I wanna live my life  ♬

594
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,730
Now it finally seems more like Moorim School now.

595
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:58,550
Our Ariel, how much more are you going to surprise me for you to be satisfied?

596
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:02,270
This class isn't at a level where beginners like you should be.

597
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:06,350
Same for that useless idol.

598
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:12,230
- What?
- Stop disturbing us and go to the beginners' class.

599
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:15,090
Do you think we're all the same students just because we're at the same school?

600
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:17,330
Why are telling me to get out?

601
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,050
You're only studying here thanks to my father's money.

602
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,970
Wang Chi Ang. Your words are harsh.

603
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,090
Sorry, Ariel.

604
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:26,610
It just seems like these things are thinking I'm a doormat if I stay still.

605
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:29,930
If you wanna show off your money, find somewhere else.

606
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:34,110
This is not a place for people like you to show off your money or kill time.

607
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:37,530
Being on this strange mountain,

608
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:39,630
learning some martial arts,

609
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:41,410
I'm not here because I like it.

610
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,050
It's because it can't be helped.

611
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,970
Then shut your mouth and get lost.

612
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,710
Yeop Jeong.

613
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:52,850
This village school might seem pathetic to you

614
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:56,530
but we're all here because we have a reason,

615
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:59,440
We're here together because of our dream.

616
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,310
Although the way he said it was wrong, Yeop Jeong's words are right.

617
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:07,530
Neither of you are trained enough to be in this class.

618
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,130
Go take a different class.

619
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:13,130
Yeah, just leave this strange school to us

620
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:15,510
and please just get lost.

621
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,650
You guys are so weird.

622
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:19,850
What's the big deal with this mere class?

623
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:22,970
Mere class?

624
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:24,810
So...

625
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:31,010
Are you saying that if I attain the level to take this class, then can I stay?

626
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:33,750
You could get injured if you haven't mastered the basics.

627
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,910
That's why we're like that. It's not to make you an outcast or something like that.

628
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:38,890
Basics?

629
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,190
What?

630
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:44,510
Or ...

631
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:53,010
Something like this?

632
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,890
Swinging this a few times in your music video,

633
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,650
and you think you're a master in it?

634
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:01,810
Sorry, but

635
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:05,090
I grew up going through numerous ordeals

636
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:09,950
so I know how to do Judo, Hapkido and Taekwondo.

637
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:11,170
Really?

638
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:16,090
Then should we see the skills of the newbie?

639
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:18,450
You two go against each other properly.

640
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,530
How is it?

641
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:25,210
Let's use this opportunity to check their skills properly.

642
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:28,990
Let's see if they're qualified enough to enter our school or not.

643
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:33,520
Don't do that, Yeop Jeong. You know that you'll get expelled if you fight.

644
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,340
Moorim School's rule, fighting is prohibited outside of sparring.

645
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:41,900
which means that sparring is possible any time

646
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,450
because sparring isn't considered a fight.

647
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:52,750
Will they have the qualifications to go to our school?

648
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:56,510
Is our school where just anyone can come in?

649
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:59,100
Don't you think it's unfair?

650
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,010
Yeop Jeong, stop this.

651
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:07,020
Yeah, both of you could be expelled if something goes wrong.

652
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:11,970
We always see the two of them going at each other.

653
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:13,310
Why don't we end the battle here?

654
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:16,510
The winner stays, and the loser leaves.

655
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:18,350
Is it like that?

656
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:23,890
Why are you speaking in such a complicated way? Wang Chi Ang remains here

657
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:26,190
Yoon Si Woo is leaving.

658
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:29,030
Aren't you saying that?

659
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:32,030
Great.

660
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:34,510
I'll be happy if the two of you leave.

661
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:39,090
But today, I'm satisfied enough if one of you leaves.

662
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:43,530
Stop.

663
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:45,570
He's taunting you.

664
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:58,250
Why? Don't you have any confidence?

665
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:00,670
You don't get scared and run away.

666
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,470
- Runaway-dol.
- Wang Chi Ang!

667
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:07,690
Sorry, Ariel. This time I can't listen to you.

668
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:18,570
Ah, I'm going crazy.

669
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:19,490
We have to stop them.

670
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,690
I think it's too late to stop them.

671
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:24,150
This isn't a battle between Yoon Si Woo and Wang Chi Ang.

672
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:27,010
It's a battle between the pride of men.

673
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,610
♫Yeah I am alive. ♫

674
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:40,990
♫Look straight at me ♫

675
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:44,060
♫I am going to get up once again dozens of times ♫

676
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,050
♫Yeah I am alive. ♫

677
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,570
♫ Watch me. ♫

678
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:50,990
♫ Open your eyes now and feel me ♫

679
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:54,230
Oh, awesome.
♫ In the deep pitch-black darkness♫

680
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:58,390
♫  Like a child who lost its way  ♫

681
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:03,890
♫  Even if I scream, no one will hear  ♫

682
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:07,710
♫Buried deep in my heart ♫

683
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:10,970
♫ In the memory of a cry directed at me♫

684
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:14,620
♫Faint consciousness ♫

685
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:17,120
♫is barely holding onto me ♫

686
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,250
♫Your voice lingering in my ears ♫

687
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,100
♫ Has become the only light shining on me under cover.♫
