1
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,790
It doesn't look like you're delivering food.

2
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,910
Yoon Si Woo!

3
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,730
People would think you saw a ghost or something.

4
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,650
You... didn't go to Seoul?

5
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,810
If I leave, there are more than one or two people that would cry.

6
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,290
So, you're going to stay here?

7
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,870
Well, yeah.

8
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,170
That's right! You thought well!

9
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,910
What you need right now is not fame, it's rest.

10
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,890
If you're on your way to the school, let's go together.

11
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,150
Okay.

12
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,430
Didn't you do anything for the injury you sustained at Moorim Peak?

13
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,250
Get on.

14
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,870
I'll do it.

15
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,090
You worked all day without rest.

16
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,110
You can sleep on the way as well.

17
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,010
You might fall if you're asleep, so hold on tightly.

18
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,990
♫Why am I like this? I can only think of you.♫

19
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,750
♫I keep smiling, even during the hard times♫

20
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:52,150
♫What exactly did you do to me?♫

21
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,450
♫Everyone, strangely, keeps staring at me♫

22
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,270
♫Even if I try to hide it, I can't help it.♫

23
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,990
♫Even if I try to stop it, I can't do it♫

24
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:11,350
♫I can only think of you all day.♫

25
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,530
♫I can't stop it, my girl♫

26
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,570
♫ Wherever I go, whatever I do ♫

27
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,330
♫I can only think of you♫

28
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,130
♫ Wherever you go, whatever you do ♫

29
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,430
♬  being with you would be so great  ♬

30
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:42,250
♫ Even if I was offered the world, I wouldn't trade you.♫

31
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,550
♫I will be okay even if I lose everything♫

32
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:54,210
♫  What to do now? I fell for you hard.  ♫

33
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,400
Wang Chi Ang. What are you doing here by yourself?

34
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,280
I just can't sleep. Why are you here?

35
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,870
Me too. Just... I came to get some fresh air.

36
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,170
By chance, have you seen Yoon Si Woo?

37
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,190
If I ask you something, you should reply.

38
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,750
He left.

39
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,460
- What ?
- He left the school.

40
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,570
I was unsure, but I was right.

41
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,160
If he was going to leave after clearing his name, why did he even try to go up to Moorim Peak?

42
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,750
There was no need for all that hard work.

43
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,700
That kind of fame; what's so precious about fans who easily turn their backs on people?

44
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,280
If you don't know anything, don't talk like that.

45
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,240
If he made the decision to leave, there's a reason behind that so don't talk carelessly.

46
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:20,460
By chance... Isn't this a dream?

47
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,820
Try pinching me.

48
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,310
What are you two doing?

49
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,380
Were you possibly waiting for me?

50
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:46,300
Wait? Why would I wait for you? I was waiting for my Ariel.

51
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,770
- Ariel!
- Ah, really. Go!

52
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,630
Don't laugh.

53
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,360
Why?

54
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,420
Because I'll start to grow fond of you.

55
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,830
Moorim School
- Episode 5 -

56
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,410
Oh! Oh! Oh! I thought you left, so I tried lying here.

57
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,560
It was just so-so. I don't think I'll even be able to sleep properly because of the sunlight streaming in in the morning.

58
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,580
You use it.

59
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,970
No need. I'll sleep on this one.

60
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,460
Really?

61
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,880
Yeah.

62
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,770
Really? You can't change what you said.

63
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:58,600
However, this will be the first and the last time I'll ever yield to you.

64
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,890
Can't you stop acting all cool?

65
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,700
Yoon Si Woo, Wang Chi Ang, you are invited tonight to the entrance ceremony at the bell tower of the armory.

66
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,660
Bell tower? Armory?

67
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:29,220
What is this? Is this something like an extension of Moorim Peak?

68
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,030
You're really not going? You can't not be there!

69
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,720
I already told you that I don't care whether those people remain here or leave.

70
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,850
Got it.

71
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,920
No problem here.

72
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,210
Okay, let's go.

73
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,990
The bell tower armory is where weapons used to be stored a long ago.

74
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,810
It's prohibited to go there now.

75
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,470
Why?

76
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:59,070
From a long ago, students weren't allowed to enter because of a secret room.

77
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,160
A secret room?

78
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,480
People like you, who were so curious, went and created trouble—

79
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,460
Only up to there.

80
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,990
So, what's the whole point of seeing us there.

81
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,580
What do you think the reason is?

82
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,320
It means that they still don't acknowledge us and are still trying to kick us out.

83
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,160
If you are scared, you don't need to go.

84
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,500
Scared? Are you?

85
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,980
It wasn't easy to make the decision to stay here.

86
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,260
Of course, who are we? We went all the way up to Moorim Peak. Do you think that we will be scared of some armory bell tower?

87
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,950
Let's go.

88
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,390
Let's go.

89
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,110
- If I suddenly go, they will be surprised, right?
- Just act like you know nothing.

90
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,220
This is our Moorim School's tradition.

91
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,820
When did this tradition start?

92
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,040
Ah, our teacher Daniel is not from Moorim School, so he wouldn't know.

93
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,330
We made this tradition.

94
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,980
So it was similar even back then?

95
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,540
The present is nothing compared to the past. Is it?

96
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,500
Anyway, I said I want to do the demonstration.

97
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,170
Don't even mention it. Back then, I was the best among the guys...

98
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,870
And I was the best among the girls.

99
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,200
It was so nice back then.

100
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,160
I know, right?

101
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,520
What's this? Whenever you two get lost in memories, something always happens.

102
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,520
It's been a while. Should we warm up?

103
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,210
History of Moorim

104
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,330
Do you really need to do this?

105
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,950
You know that this is a Moorim School tradition.

106
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,430
You've got to be kidding me.

107
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,550
How dare you little pricks act all high and mighty?

108
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,550
If you're scared, you can just go now.

109
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,690
Ariel!

110
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,610
I'll fix all your bad habits today,

111
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,660
so prepare yourselves.

112
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,430
So should we get the Moorim initiation ceremony started?

113
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,060
Welcome to Moorim!

114
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,620
♬  Follow me, look at me, what are you doing now?  ♬

115
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,900
♬  Now I am in control ♬

116
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,190
Woohoo!

117
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,400
Woohoo!

118
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,540
♬  I'm different, different, yeah I'm different, different  ♬

119
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,900
♬  Even I don't know, I will show you  ♬

120
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,570
♬  I'm so fast, yeah I'm so fast  ♬

121
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:06,760
♬  Feel it now, I'm the king  ♬
- Let's party!

122
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,060
Cheers!

123
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,160
Those kids must be drinking right now.

124
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,580
They won't be throwing up all over the school tomorrow, right?

125
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,700
Those kids are so weak. Back in our day, we drank for four days and three nights.

126
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,010
Ok, that must be an exaggeration.

127
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,890
Exaggeration, you say?

128
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:26,850
Is it?

129
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,650
Hmm, maybe a bit. It was three days and two nights, not four days and three nights.

130
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,350
But it was really something else.

131
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,870
There was a time when I drank for a week straight, back in the Serengeti!

132
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,710
Sam, aren't you a poor drinker?

133
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,930
Why do you think that is?

134
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,270
I don't want my face to get all red, so I don't drink.

135
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,400
Are you red now?

136
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,640
Am I already?

137
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,790
Oh, um, Germany is famous for beer, isn't it?

138
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,420
I don't think of beer as alcohol.

139
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,810
We drink beer instead of water if we're thirsty.

140
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,150
It's the same here!

141
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,330
When I was little, I put a bit of sugar in makgeolli and I drank it like yoghurt.

142
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,630
In Ghana, there are tribes where even three-year-olds drink.

143
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,790
If only I didn't go red in the face, you'd all be under the table before I felt anything.

144
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,500
Hey, I wouldn't believe that.

145
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,280
I'm also someone who can really hold his alcohol too.

146
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:30,560
Look here. When I was in the hospital, the doctors wanted to see my liver,

147
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,530
because they had no idea how it was possible to have such a good alcohol resistance.

148
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,430
They were curious to see if it wasn't made of steel or something.

149
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,050
What kind of nonsense is that?

150
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,210
If you don't believe me, then should we have a go?

151
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:47,180
The first one today to get drunkest, pays the bill, okay?

152
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,300
Deal.

153
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,430
It's about time I find myself drinking while watching the sunrise again.

154
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,360
Sir, bring us some more drinks!

155
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,890
Oh, man... And I was planning to have a quiet life here in Korea.

156
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,490
Ms. Yoo Di, will you be the judge?

157
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,010
What are you doing right now?

158
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,830
Why aren't you including me? Let's all compete.

159
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,850
I thought you left without even saying goodbye.

160
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,570
Why didn't you leave?

161
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,880
Because of you.

162
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,600
What?

163
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,570
You're going to babble off to everyone

164
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,550
saying I ran away because I didn't want to clean the bathrooms.

165
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,100
I really couldn't leave thinking of that.

166
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,600
That's right.

167
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,400
If you're a man, you should take responsibility for what you've said and done.

168
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,970
But you're still no match for me.

169
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,440
Look who's talking.

170
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,520
I was behind the incident in the cooking class.

171
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,780
What?

172
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,820
I didn't want to acknowledge you as students of this school.

173
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,490
Do you know how shocked we were back then?

174
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,640
I was hoping you'd be shocked enough to give up.

175
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,060
You must've taken us lightly, but we're not to be messed with.

176
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:46,560
Anyway, since you apologized like a man, we'll accept your apology.

177
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,600
Let's get along from now on!

178
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,520
Admitting what I did doesn't mean I acknowledge you both.

179
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,380
I still don't like the both of you.

180
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,150
Hey, Go Yeop Jeong!

181
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:08,800
You did come! Want a drink?

182
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,090
Don't you know how bad alcohol is for the muscles?

183
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:17,310
I don't have the time to fool around like you guys seem to do.

184
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,310
Look at how that bastard talks.

185
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,370
Yes?

186
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,700
This is Hwang Moo Song.

187
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,070
What?

188
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,730
What did you just say?

189
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,300
So, the total is $207.50

190
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,090
but I'll only ask for $200.

191
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,470
- What?
- Two hundred, please.

192
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,370
They were all bragging about their drinking prowess,

193
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,030
so how could they all pass out after only drinking this much?

194
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,640
I thought it would total about $500. Oh my.

195
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,700
Was the meat delicious?

196
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,630
Yes, it was really good.

197
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:30,810
Is the sun rising from the west tomorrow? How come I get to eat meat you bought?

198
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,340
I got a new job, you see.

199
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,040
Let's see... Soon Deok's coming home tomorrow, isn't it?

200
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,120
Yes, why? Want to buy her some meat too?

201
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,800
What? Oh, she doesn't need that, she's eating alright at her school anyway .

202
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,300
What school? You said she's attending a preparatory classes for the government official exam!

203
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,990
Oh, what am I saying?

204
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,910
She's eating all fine at her institute, so don't worry.

205
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:01,560
Oh, I'm so glad we're out after such a long time!

206
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,400
- What's with that ridiculous nasal voice?
- What's ridiculous about it?

207
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,840
Let's go!

208
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:21,030
Dear, you can't see so you don't know, but we're a couple both of us wearing orange. It's a couple look!

209
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,010
Couple, ridiculous...

210
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,550
Walk straight, will you?

211
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,280
Oh my! Hello!

212
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,150
Looks like they've had a few.

213
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:43,670
Oh yes, hello... Oh my, careful, careful!

214
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,030
Who were those?

215
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:53,730
Oh, you know, there's this school called Moorim School on top of the mountain. He's the headmaster of that school.

216
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,550
The Headmaster of Moorim School?

217
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,170
Yeah. You know, the school Wang Chi Ang or whatever his name was is attending.

218
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,970
No, Soon Deok... Tell her to not even get close to that place!

219
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:10,210
I know, I know. They even wanted to give her a scholarship but you kept her from going there.

220
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,310
She can't go there! Why would a girl want to learn martial arts?

221
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,590
Please make sure, check once, twice, ten times that she doesn't even get close to there. Am I clear?

222
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,070
Okay, I got it. Don't worry.

223
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,590
But why do you get so worked up whenever you hear about Moorim School?

224
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,970
Let's go there.

225
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,770
- The house isn't in that direction. Why are you dragging me?
- I said let's go this way!

226
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,570
- I'm telling you it's this way—
- Come this way right now!

227
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:38,670
I even gave this man beef. Why is he getting so mad at me? This wasn't the plan...

228
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,830
It's this way, I'm telling you!

229
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:45,050
♬  I need to stick around the way you chase round south ♬

230
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:49,070
♬  That type of red hot love that got me freezin' cause ♬

231
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,770
♬  Say you can go all night the way you lay that track♬

232
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,300
♬  But if you wanna hear me sing you better play that sax. ♬

233
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,990
♬  Give it to me. ♬

234
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,390
♬  You better play that sax, uh ♬

235
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,490
Wang Chi Ang sure is excited!

236
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,750
He can dance, though. He could be an idol.

237
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,500
You're right. I second that.

238
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,400
♬  Yeah he be lovin' himself more than Kim and Ye ♬

239
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,440
♬  I'm like boy stop, run that back ♬

240
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,170
♬  God damn you fine but can you play that sax?♬

241
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,150
♬ Met a smart ass dude, mister know it all ♬

242
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,290
It's been a while since I ate delicious food. Man, I feel so good.

243
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,010
This is all thanks to our Nadet.

244
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,490
Thanks for always being our eyes and ears!

245
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,390
Didn't I already tell you?

246
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:45,390
It's not polite to pat someone's head in Thailand.

247
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,630
That's right, that's right. Sorry!

248
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,300
♬  I need to stick around the way you chase round south ♬

249
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,080
♬ The type of red hot love that got me freezin’ cause ♬

250
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:58,810
Hello? It's a bit loud, I can't hear you. Just a second!

251
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:02,460
♬But if you wanna hear me sing you better play that sax! ♬

252
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,670
♬ Give it to me! ♬

253
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:08,030
Was that thing about the secret chamber also a lie?

254
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:08,890
Secret chamber?

255
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,730
About a treasure being hidden in the school.

256
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:18,070
That's real. The treasure that has been carried down from generation to generation. Was it called Cheon Ui Joo?

257
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:23,210
Anyway, the person who gets Cheon Ui Joo will gain great power.

258
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:29,990
But if the Cheon Ui Joo gets in the hands of someone who can't handle it, it will cause harm.

259
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,990
There's even a student who died when she sneaked into the secret room because she wanted that Cheon Ui Joo.

260
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,030
That's nonsense.

261
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:41,710
Why is it nonsense? Several people heard the cries of a girl on rainy nights. Didn't you too?

262
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,270
Yeah!

263
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,280
What?

264
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,640
Ajumma, what are you ...

265
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,360
♬  ... and rock me all night ♬

266
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
♬ Hold tight, lean back ♬

267
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,380
♬ Play one on one with that sax. ♬

268
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,060
♬  Get loose, get right
Get a grip and rock me all night ♬

269
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,350
♬ Hold tight, lean back ♬

270
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,700
♬ Play one on one with that sax. ♬

271
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,990
You called me this late at night because something doesn't add up?

272
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:15,410
It's not a dime or two, but $50. That's weird, don't you think?

273
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,210
Are you suspecting me right now?

274
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:22,870
Well, the fact that today of all days you didn't feel well and suddenly left early is suspicious,

275
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:28,370
and since it wasn't me, it must be the doing of you, greedy girl.

276
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,430
Lady!

277
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,150
Give the money you stole back to me right now!

278
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:18,230
Hey, Shim Soon Deok? Where were you all this time?

279
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,970
I had something to do. Only you guys are left?

280
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,530
Party's over. We're going to our rooms soon too.

281
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,330
Let's go.

282
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,470
Just leave it like this. I'll wake up early tomorrow and clean it up.

283
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:42,030
I'll sweep left and right. I can clean everything up in ten minutes, don't worry.

284
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,490
Vicious girl, look at how you're talking.

285
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,330
See? There's nothing? Should I take off my underwear and show it to you too?

286
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:41,170
Show me then. We're both girls, so there's no reason I can't see.

287
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,090
Mom!

288
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,250
You should have gone home after your tutoring. Why did you come here?

289
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,590
I wanted to go with you.

290
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,930
Then wait outside just a bit, ok?

291
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:04,830
Got it. Ah, you weren't here earlier but I took $50 out.

292
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,190
What?

293
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,370
Take care of the rest.

294
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,510
I won't.

295
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,590
Hey.

296
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:24,010
I fry chicken in the kitchen and I even do deliveries.

297
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,550
You didn't even pay me properly,

298
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,750
but I told myself I'd stick with it because I grew fond of this place after all that time.

299
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,130
Well, not anymore.

300
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:42,110
It's not about money. I don't want to work somewhere where I'm not trusted.

301
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,630
Come on, down you go.

302
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:25,550
If a person who does wrong gets their hands on Cheon Ui Joo, there will be chaos in this world.

303
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,350
Dear, if anything happens to me—

304
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:34,400
Don't say anything more. You said you had to leave. Are you going to keep scaring me?

305
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,030
It's so hot...

306
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,910
So hot...

307
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:22,010
I feel like my throat is burning.

308
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:27,150
Please... Get me some water.

309
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,030
Was that talk earlier about the secret chamber also a lie?

310
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,330
Where a treasure is hidden inside this school.

311
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:56,610
That's real, real. There's a treasure handed down for generations in our school. Was it called Cheon Ui Joo?

312
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:02,190
Anyway, the person who has it in their possession will obtain great power.

313
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:09,470
But if someone who can't handle the Cheon Ui Joo's power obtains it, they'll suffer great harm.

314
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:50,570
I asked him to get me some water. Did he go to dig a well or something?

315
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,770
He's useless, just useless.

316
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,010
People will think you're a ghost.

317
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:36,290
I thought you were that ghost from the secret chamber. I heard a girl's cries out of the blue.

318
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,070
Who said I was crying?

319
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:53,430
As people live, they can cry.

320
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:55,970
♬  When I look back, I was so young  ♬

321
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,230
♬  In the last diary, just a child filled with worries  ♬

322
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:10,870
♬  I'm leaving everything here from the past which was difficult. ♬

323
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,870
♬  Without even anyone I can go to ♬

324
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,750
♬  I will run far away. ♬

325
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,350
♬  I’m running to you, just for you. ♬

326
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:29,430
♬  I will be right there, believe in me. ♬

327
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:36,690
♬  I gotta run, run, run, I gotta run, run, run  ♬

328
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:44,500
♬  I must see you smiling widely when the day I dreamed of comes.  ♬

329
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:52,130
♬  Even if it's for a few years, I'll run.  ♬

330
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,350
♬  If I truly want it,  ♬

331
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,830
♬ I won't be afraid and will run  ♬

332
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:03,310
♬ I can overcome with my own strength.  ♬

333
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:11,390
♬  I'm running just for you.  ♬

334
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:17,470
♬  I will be right there, believe in me . ♬

335
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:22,990
♬  I gotta run, run, I've got to run ♬

336
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:38,630
I don't really cry in front of people. I was busted by you today.

337
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:44,590
Just pretend you didn't see that, okay?

338
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,490
No one will give you a prize for not crying.

339
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:59,530
No one will praise you or reward you for bottling it all up.

340
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:04,650
So just cry when you feel like it.

341
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,000
Emotions are like that.

342
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,220
If you hide them, you're the only one who suffers, and no one will commend you for it.

343
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:24,100
Did you have fun at the welcoming party?

344
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,610
No, it was just so-so.

345
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,470
I was really glad when you said you weren't going to Seoul.

346
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:39,500
But why did you decide to remain here?

347
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:51,610
As I was preparing to become an idol, I never properly attended school.

348
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,870
Of course, I never went to college either.

349
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,790
Of course, school wasn't that fun before,

350
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:04,120
but I think it will be different here.

351
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,950
That's right. The more you study here, the more you come to like it.

352
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,690
That's why even though I'm working, I devote my energy to attending school.

353
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,770
Go inside.

354
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:41,930
Okay. Get some rest, too.

355
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,310
You must receive treatment tomorrow.

356
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,870
Alright.

357
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,450
Good morning? That's disgusting.

358
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:19,130
When you drink, you also need to eat well.

359
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,360
You ate everything!

360
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,260
I think I only ate two chickens.

361
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:34,110
Hey, I give up on morning training. Please help me to my room.

362
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:37,380
Goodness, that's why a guy your age shouldn't be running like that.

363
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,620
Your next drink will only be after you graduate, got it?

364
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,820
Hey, Nadet!

365
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,530
Let's go.

366
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:51,070
I'll go inside after I practice some kendo.

367
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,900
Eat a lot! Eat well!

368
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,590
Please enjoy your meal!

369
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,700
Shim Soon Deok, why curry for breakfast?

370
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:35,660
This isn't okay, Soon Deok. Curry for breakfast? This isn't right.

371
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,280
Well, you see...

372
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,620
I suggested we eat this.

373
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,160
The curry looks delicious.

374
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,000
Don't you agree, Professor?

375
00:41:51,000 --> 00:42:01,380
We should be role models for the students, so eat up and leave your plates clean.

376
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,660
Curry for breakfast is such a delight!

377
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,700
I agree, Professor.

378
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,400
You had quite a lot to drink last night. Are you feeling alright?

379
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,280
Why are you looking at me like that?

380
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:33,340
Someone who cares about how I feel shouldn't have done something like that.

381
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,830
What?

382
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,190
Where are you going?

383
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,740
My fresh morning needs to start with my Ariel's face.

384
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,200
So we're having Ariel's curry this morning!

385
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,340
Good morning!

386
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,060
Hey, did you sleep well?

387
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,930
What are you doing? Should I help you with something?

388
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,440
I'm good. If you butt in, you'll only be in my way.

389
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,080
♬  Hey girl, you're dazzling  ♬

390
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,180
What's with you?

391
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:41,430
Whenever something makes you tear up again, come to me. This is the real healing center.

392
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:49,250
Got it? This is the place you should come for hugs. Don't go anywhere else.

393
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,070
I guess you aren't sober yet. Go.

394
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:01,270
♬  Should I say something? (right, right now)  ♬

395
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:07,190
♬  To the girl who waited for me, girl  ♬

396
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:13,340
♬  Girl, show me your heart, show me what you've got  ♬

397
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,280
♫Show me what you've got, girl.♫

398
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,770
It's 1:1, a tie.

399
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,620
♫Show me what you've got♫

400
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,140
♫ Show me what you got girl.♫

401
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,950
Let's go get some curry.

402
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:30,290
Wowee, this place is just like a department store.

403
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:34,580
This looks so expensive! Oh my, I'm envious.

404
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:40,040
Oh my, oh my, look at these clothes! I'm so jealous.

405
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:50,630
No matter how I look at it, she has to be the Fox of Changdong.

406
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,260
Over here!

407
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,100
Yes!

408
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:59,310
- Please have a seat.
- Ah, yes.

409
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,850
I'll teach you how to brew tea.

410
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:06,240
From now on, please use this whenever the chairman's friends visit.

411
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,220
Yes.

412
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,400
What is it?

413
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:18,260
Oh, it's just that I seemed to have forgotten my manners last time,

414
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,320
so I wanted to apologize.

415
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,400
- What do you...
- When I first met you,

416
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,200
I called you the Fox of Changdong.

417
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:35,380
When I was in Masan, there was this really pretty girl.

418
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,480
Seems like she was quite a beauty.

419
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,120
I know, I know, she was something else.

420
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,460
Are you really not her?

421
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,450
I am not.

422
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:57,530
For this tea, the temperature and ratio of the water as well as the infusion time are very important.

423
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:03,620
Since you said it's not you, I can talk comfortably now.

424
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:08,510
That girl's face was so pretty, but her personality, her personality...

425
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:13,400
Well, it wasn't only that personality of hers. She also got into fights with other girls from neighboring schools.

426
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,870
She begged me, crying, to help her with those girls' hospital bills.

427
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:22,980
And I gave her the money, but when I think of how she ran away and hasn't paid me to this day—

428
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,020
What do you mean run away?

429
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:29,830
She must've moved, or had her reasons.

430
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:35,640
This fragile tea leaf is perfectly capable of giving its taste at 60 degrees Celsius,

431
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:42,440
especially because the tea leaves in our house are all precious and delivered from China.

432
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:50,520
In the past I used to drink so much coffee at that cafe with the Fox of Changdong.

433
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,400
- I wonder if it still exists...
- That cafe does—

434
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,320
I mean, it should be still there. Why not?

435
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:07,400
So let's forget about the past now and focus on the present here.

436
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,830
Oh yes, we should.

437
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,520
Do it right!
 Midterm evaluation notice

438
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,320
Man, midterms already?

439
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,540
Are you still afraid of tests?

440
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,850
This can't be...

441
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,040
Oh my god...

442
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:33,260
I need carbs now. I need carbs to get it straight. Let's go eat, Jenny.

443
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,770
Wait for me.

444
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,310
You should be nervous too.

445
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,390
Hey, let's go together!

446
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,290
Your skills will finally be revealed this time.

447
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:48,500
Let's grab a bite.

448
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:54,910
Is there anything to show? We haven't even learned anything, right?

449
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,850
Yeah, that's what I mean.

450
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:00,010
Do you actually think we'll just leave you alone?

451
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,800
Don't worry, we have something in store for you.

452
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,170
What is it?

453
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,700
Helping each other.

454
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,940
Mentor-mentee system?

455
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:18,140
Don't you think you should help the newbies adjust to this place?

456
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,130
Oh, yes.

457
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:22,640
Teach them well. It will surely be rewarding.

458
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,020
And aren't they entertaining too? Like me.

459
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,330
Here you go.

460
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:37,150
I got treatment today.

461
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:42,690
You did well. It seems like the midterms are really hard. Everyone seemed so nervous.

462
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:47,520
Well, I guess it's because the evaluation method here is different from other schools.

463
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,080
The pressure is high, especially in the mixed examination at the end.

464
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,300
The mixed exam?

465
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,440
As it says on the tin, it evaluates a mix of abilities,

466
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:02,300
and it's totally at the headmaster's whim. No one has any idea when, where, or what kind of test it'll be.

467
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,220
I don't think the other professors know the content either.

468
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,770
Really?

469
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:14,200
♬  Here comes the fire, here comes the fire  ♬

470
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,240
♬  I don't know why, my eyes  ♬

471
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,920
Oh, bravo!

472
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,040
Yoon Si Woo should've have done better and stacked up his luck like I did.

473
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,380
That's why I get such an amazing mentor.

474
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,590
I think I'm going to be the only one to advance to the elite class.

475
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:35,050
Si Woo must've been matched with another mentor.

476
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:35,820
Who?

477
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,700
Probably... Soon Deok?

478
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:43,160
What? Ariel? Damn...

479
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,500
Hey, Wang Chi Ang!

480
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,660
Let's start with the basic position. First...

481
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:58,270
Before you do any martial movement, you need to harness the force.

482
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:05,340
Think that you're harnessing the force of nature and awaken the force within yourself.

483
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:13,150
Concentrate and think that you're gradually bringing all of the force inside yourself to your stomach area.

484
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:20,850
What do you think? Can you do it?

485
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,420
Yeah.

486
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:28,190
♬  Everything's getting complicated, I don't know why  ♬

487
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:37,410
Rotate, harness the energy of nature. Think, think!

488
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:41,350
Like that. Turn...

489
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,700
Gather?

490
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,370
Slowly gather it down there.

491
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:51,960
♬  I must go on my way  ♬

492
00:50:53,710 --> 00:51:02,630
♬  Here comes the fire, here comes the fire
I wanna live my life  ♬

493
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:10,360
I need to find a new part-time job quickly.

494
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,910
This one's too far from school.

495
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:17,800
This one pays so little!

496
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:20,860
Oh!

497
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,930
Convenience Store...

498
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:26,690
It's an early shift at the convenience store.

499
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:30,160
It overlaps with class too much.

500
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:35,370
The time at the chicken place was perfect.

501
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,580
Forget it!

502
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,430
Would there not be a single place for me to work?

503
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,500
I just need to find it.

504
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,140
Ah, I can't find any.

505
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:55,370
I can just look for more.

506
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,000
Are you doing some night meditation?

507
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,690
Do you like learning from my Ariel?

508
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:41,030
- What now?
- I asked you if you enjoy learning from my Ariel.

509
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,760
What would I like and what would I not like?

510
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,310
I'm telling you this out of loyalty,

511
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:52,970
I'm going to beat you at the upcoming midterms.

512
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,530
I don't really like losing either.

513
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,110
Brace yourself, Yoon Si Woo.

514
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:04,040
I already told you that that bed was going to be the first and last thing I was going to yield to you.

515
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,840
Don't come crying later.

516
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,230
I don't think that's going to be the case.

517
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,770
♬  Yeah I am alive ♬

518
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:29,460
♬  Look at me, I'll get up again dozens of times ♬

519
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:35,040
- That's it! So you aren't completely un-athletic after all.
♬  Yeah I am alive, look at me, now close my eyes and feel me ♬

520
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,070
You should be on your toes too.

521
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:39,350
If I say I'm going to do it, I'm quite scary.

522
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:42,690
I've never seen someone actually scary after saying that.

523
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:47,300
♬  Even if I scream, no one will hear ♬

524
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:52,460
♬  Yeah, buried deep in my heart ♬

525
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:58,970
♬  In the memory of a shout directed at me, faint consciousness ♬

526
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:01,470
♬  Barely holds onto me ♬

527
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:04,540
♬  Your voice lingers in my ears♬

528
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:07,620
♬  It's become the only light which shines under cover on me♬

529
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:13,630
♬  Surviving again (My spark)♬

530
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,920
♬  Yeah I am alive, ♬

531
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,450
♬  Look straight at me, ♬

532
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:20,200
♬  I will get up again dozens of times ♬

533
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,260
♬  Yeah I am alive,

534
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,210
♬  watch me, ♬

535
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:27,380
♬  Now close your eyes and feel me.♬

536
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:30,710
♬  Eh, eh, in front of everyone ♬

537
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:34,570
♬  I'm living, breathing, I'm newly born ♬

538
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:36,160
Let's call it a day here.

539
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,980
You go first. I'm going to practice a bit more before I leave.

540
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:44,440
♬  Like a child who has lost his way ♬

541
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:49,790
♬  Even if there is a tortured scream, there's no one who will hear ♬

542
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,680
♬  Buried deep in my heart♬

543
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,090
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- You're working really hard. It's unlike you.

544
00:54:55,090 --> 00:55:00,060
I will definitely advance to the elite class and be Ariel's classmate.

545
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,890
I can just do this.

546
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:06,550
No, don't bend your elbows.

547
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,760
Ah, like this?

548
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,270
Yeah, like that.

549
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:15,600
♬  Surviving again (My spark)♬

550
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,040
What are you looking at?

551
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,750
Wang Chi Ang, you're better than I thought.

552
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,740
I admit, you surprised me.

553
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,790
I'm cool, aren't I?

554
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:28,830
♬  I'm living, breathing♬

555
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:32,950
♬  I'm newly born♬

556
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,790
Let's go practice after this class.

557
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,600
- Okay.
- Remember what I taught you.

558
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,810
I think this is the place.

559
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:55,700
Yeah, Wang Chi Ang. I'm busy now so I'll call you la—

560
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,320
Ariel, big trouble!

561
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,570
What? What is it?

562
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:04,940
I saw you leave and followed you. But anyway, just come here quickly.

563
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,840
- What?
- I'm at...

564
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:12,290
Yeah. O-Okay.

565
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:18,750
Ah, Wang Chi Ang. What trouble did he create this time?

566
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,230
Ariel!

567
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:35,570
First, have a seat.

568
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,900
What's all this?

569
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,700
What could it be? It's food.

570
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:53,660
I saw you leaving earlier. You left without even having lunch.

571
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:59,770
I missed my job interview because of you. This was the big trouble?

572
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:05,350
Of course it's big trouble! Everyone's doing what they can to make a living. You can just slowly find a part-time job.

573
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:06,760
Let's eat first.

574
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,260
I rented the whole place to eat comfortably with you.

575
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,430
The whole place?

576
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:20,170
Wang Chi Ang,

577
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:24,540
do you know that this costs way more than my monthly salary?

578
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:28,170
Don't be too moved.

579
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:34,980
It must be nice to have a rich father.

580
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:43,030
Having a rich father enables you to

581
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:45,550
do this kind of stuff as a joke

582
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:51,130
and to always smile brightly and freely.

583
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:57,400
But I'm different from you.

584
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:04,080
- I—
- Hey, I just wanted us to have lunch. No need to get so serious.

585
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,640
Let's eat first. The food's getting cold.

586
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,670
Ariel.

587
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:16,980
Yeah, my interview is out of the picture anyway. Eat up!

588
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,150
There's a saying that even ghosts like people who eat well.

589
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:26,630
You mean, people that eat well live well even as a ghost.

590
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:29,180
Right, right. Ariel, your words are always right.

591
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,590
I still wish you ate your meals properly.

592
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:39,130
Okay, let's eat quickly or we're going to be late for class.

593
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,380
This meat is cooked perfectly.

594
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:56,280
I'm feeling some kind of heat.

595
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,630
There's also an exam for the meditation class?

596
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,170
That's a class too, so we have an exam in that as well.

597
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:15,080
I find that exam the hardest.

598
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,510
How should you know all about your trauma?

599
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:20,790
No matter how much I think, I don't have any trauma.

600
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,830
Don't do this! (In Chinese)

601
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:56,600
What are you going to do if someone sees?

602
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,470
Who said someone will see?

603
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:10,370
They say he's been in that condition for years now.

604
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:12,480
He's the same as dead, don't worry.

605
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,510
What is the exact thing

606
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:23,350
Chairman Wang Hao is searching for?

607
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:28,700
I don't know precisely. Only that it has something to do with Cheon Ui Joo.

608
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,020
Cheon Ui Joo?

609
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:35,100
If Chae Yoon, in the hospital, wakes up, everything will start.

610
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:39,280
Then we will know for sure

611
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,070
what Chairman Wang Hao is searching for.

612
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:44,370
I understand.

613
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:47,440
The madam and Young Master Chi Ang know nothing about this.

614
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,670
Cheon Ui Joo, Moorim School, and

615
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,680
about you.

616
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,350
Watch your mouth.

617
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:58,570
Yes.

618
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:12,380
Yoon Si Woo? What do you see?

619
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:22,350
Nothing. I see nothing.

620
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:01,940
Are you ready?

621
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:08,880
You're still keeping your trauma locked inside you.

622
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,700
This is why both class and exams are impossible.

623
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:34,410
Are you ready?

624
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:39,900
If you are, let's get started.

625
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,750
I see a child.

626
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,500
A child who was crying

627
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:59,470
in the middle of a fire.

628
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:09,480
Someone was definitely there.
