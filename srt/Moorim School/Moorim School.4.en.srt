1
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,290
Wait, that... What is that?

2
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,050
What is that? There was something like that in the forest?

3
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,630
Yoon Si Woo!

4
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,100
They'll be okay, right?

5
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,560
I have to go.

6
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,980
Where are you going? What about class?

7
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,320
Is class the problem right now? Those who want to go with me, come.

8
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,630
Bring it on!

9
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,220
Why are you just standing there?

10
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,320
Wang Chi Ang, come quickly!

11
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,960
Grab my hand.

12
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,470
Moorim School
Episode 4

13
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,150
Are there any kids wanting to come along?

14
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,120
What about you?

15
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,230
Let's go.

16
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,660
As expected, you're Sim Soon Deok. But, what is that?

17
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,580
Wang Chi Ang's sneaker. He went barefoot.

18
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:44,750
Seon Ah, just a minute. I have something to do before we leave.

19
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,250
I think it left.

20
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,610
Thanks.

21
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,320
Since I was also thankful, we're even now.

22
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,140
You saved me from the cliff and I saved

23
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,800
you from that wolf, or whatever that was, so we're even.

24
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,190
I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it, but I guess you can't get over it.

25
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,490
Hey, are you laughing? You were someone who knew how to laugh?

26
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:40,150
Hey, we should leave now. We need to run far away before the wolf decides to return.

27
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,840
An idol is even drinking creek water.

28
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,250
Did a rich corporate company's son not drink this water before?

29
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,630
- You said I was an illegitimate child.
- Shut up.

30
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,790
-This thing—
- Hey!

31
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,920
- Are you saying you want to have a go at it?
- Try and have a go at it.

32
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,470
Hey, hey. Let's fight, let's fight.

33
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,650
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

34
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,410
Hey, it's cold! Hey!

35
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,560
- Hey, Wang Chi Ang!
- What?

36
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,510
- Hey.
- Shh.

37
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:38,400
I want...to continue to hear these sounds.

38
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,230
Will we be able to reach Moorim Peak?

39
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,900
It'll be a relief if we don't die before we make it there.

40
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:55,860
Hey, you should feel blessed that you have me as your partner because I was a boy scout.

41
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,270
Get up. Let's go quickly before the sun sets.

42
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,410
What type of leather is like this?

43
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,050
Where are Seon Ah and Soon Deok?

44
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,920
They followed Yoon Si Woo and Wang Chi Ang...

45
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,450
to Moorim Peak.

46
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,050
Let's start class.

47
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,840
Are you sure it's this way?

48
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,840
The clear indirect path to Moorim Peak is that way but those kids probably just went straight ahead looking only at Moorim Peak.

49
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,340
They took a very dangerous path.

50
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,460
I don't think anything bad will happen since Seon Ah and Soon Deok went.

51
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,690
What are the other kids doing?

52
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,420
Do you think the rest of the kids feel at ease?

53
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,010
They haven't been able to concentrate all day.

54
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,600
- What? Hapkido this late at night?
- Oh, Yoo Di.

55
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,760
Let's go for one more round. What's wrong with my condition today?!

56
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,160
Professor, your speciality isn't Hapkido. It's a given that you're not good at this.

57
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,300
What are you talking about? I'm Kim Dae Ho. I won't tolerate defeat.

58
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,310
Let's do one more round.

59
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,890
Stop it now. Ah, I'm so tired.

60
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,510
- I'm going to go in and rest.
- You should.

61
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,590
But why isn't there anyone out exercising today? Everyone's lost their focus.

62
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,470
Shouldn't they be interested in Moorim Peak tonight?

63
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,640
They're interested in Yoon Si Woo and Wang Chi Ang who left for Moorim Peak.

64
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,040
This will be better than a flashlight to chase off wild beasts.

65
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,540
I hope they escaped that wolf-like dog earlier.

66
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,010
They would have returned if something had happened.

67
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,250
You never know if they're injured to the point they can't retur—

68
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,270
Hey! Don't say such unlucky things.

69
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,670
And my Oppa Si Woo isn't someone who would get attacked so easily.

70
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,910
Yeah, you're right. That's right, your Oppa Si Woo ...

71
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,820
When did you learn fencing?

72
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,070
Since a very young age, this body has been kidnapped a lot.

73
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,750
So, I've learned most self-defense martial arts.

74
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,360
Kidnapped?

75
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,120
I'm here also because my dad kidnapped me.

76
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,910
But because of that, I was able to meet my Ariel.

77
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,950
Here.

78
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,300
What is this?

79
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:42,210
I dug through my pockets earlier and found this coincidentally. I was lucky.

80
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:49,710
I thought about eating it alone but I'm really loyal. You're thankful, aren't you?

81
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,420
Yeah, thanks.

82
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,820
Give me some too.

83
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,740
But... I just don't understand.

84
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,580
My father sent me here by force.

85
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,810
My father is a bit like that.

86
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,410
Well anyway, although I can't do anything else, I'm trying to stay.

87
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,470
Why are you remaining at this school, even cooking and cleaning?

88
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,490
By any chance, is it because of your ear?

89
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,080
Can you not hear well?

90
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,870
Is that why the concert accident happened?

91
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,050
You were the only one standing while everyone else moved aside.

92
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,430
Yeah, that's why I came.

93
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,610
The hospital doesn't know the cause of why I'm like this and they don't know how to cure it,

94
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:10,740
but I think the headmaster might be able to cure it for me.

95
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:21,460
I don't have anyone, not even a family.

96
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,180
I just have music.

97
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,430
But if I lose my hearing and can't do music—

98
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:38,750
Don't worry. You'll make an awesome comeback.

99
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,380
There's no way my Ariel would just leave you like this.

100
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,320
- There's still no news from the kids who went to Moorim Peak, right?
- Yeah.

101
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,360
Ah, we should have stopped them when that fight happened.

102
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,390
Huh? What is this?

103
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,780
- Yoon Si Woo, return?
- Huh? Yoon Si Woo?

104
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,100
Sim Soon Deok clarification video?

105
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,270
Sim Son Deok from our school?

106
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,510
Sim Soon Deok isn't a common name in the 21st century.

107
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,900
Take a look.

108
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:29,250
I'm Sim Soon Deok who

109
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,940
was at the site where Yoon Si Woo and Jung Da Rim were being bothered by gangsters.

110
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:39,920
Truthfully, the rumors about Yoon Si Woo aren't the truth.

111
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,050
He didn't run away.

112
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:48,730
He chased the reporters to protect Jung Da Rim from the paparazzi.

113
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,640
That was it?

114
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,950
When did she post this?

115
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,240
Then why didn't Yoon Si Woo say anything?

116
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,060
If he did, would you have believed him?

117
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,040
He must have been so embarrassed and ashamed.

118
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,440
Shall we just click the "like"?

119
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,800
1524 likes

120
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,000
This won't do, come out.

121
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,970
As a close friend of Ms. Shim Soon Deok, I can

122
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,370
100% testify to her integrity.

123
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,450
Comment posted.

124
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:25,320
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you. Sorry for not being able to keep you safe.

125
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,950
Return quickly, Yoon Si Woo.

126
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,560
Cheer up, superpower.

127
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,850
I'm sorry for misunderstanding you.

128
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,950
Yoon Si Woo, fighting!

129
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,950
- How is it?
- Wow, our senses are... Wow.

130
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,190
Get back to the total beginners' class!

131
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,900
Hey, Wang Chi Ang. Get up.

132
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,290
We should eat this and get on our way.

133
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,250
What's wrong? Are you hurt anywhere?

134
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,840
I've been raised like a prince. It's not the wound in itself, but the fact I'm not used to this kind of stuff.

135
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,650
Wow, this breakfast is organic!

147
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,590
What?

148
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:45,750
The headmaster said that only one of us will get to remain.

149
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,730
Say something that makes sense.

150
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,210
♬ I Gotta Run Run. I Will Run. I Will Run. ♬

151
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,200
You should go ahead.

152
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,540
Shut up.

153
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,970
I knew you would say that.

154
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,070
Then why be like this?

155
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,680
I'm being sincere. You should go ahead.

156
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,690
What are you saying?

157
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:10,430
Go by yourself before I have a change of heart. I can't go anymore.

158
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,880
♬  With a totally lost past  ♬

159
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,250
♬  With everyone having left here  ♬

160
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,570
♬  Without even any one I could go to  ♬

161
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:25,630
♬  I will run far away  ♬

162
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,070
♬ I'm running to you. Just for you. ♬

163
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,950
I'm tired too. Why?

164
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,660
This bastard, acting as if he's all that.

165
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:41,050
Don't regret this later. When I become fine, I'm going to fly around.

166
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:50,200
I scaled Daesan and even the face of Janggak Falls.

167
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,350
You only know how to talk.

168
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,490
First place on real-time search! Ninety-five per cent of social media (SNS)

169
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,950
is talking about Yoon Si Woo.

170
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,320
Discussions have been going on all nigh. It's even on the front page.

171
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,010
Looks like the video was useful.

172
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,760
My comments too.

173
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,730
Fans are going crazy wanting their Oppa Si Woo to return,

174
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,730
but we don't even know if he'll be able to return from Moorim Peak.

175
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,260
That's what I mean. I just wish they would return safely.

176
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,000
Stay here. I'll go out and search for something to eat.

177
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,920
That bastard... I told him to go by himself.

178
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,770
Hey, Wang Chi Ang. I don't think we can stay here, get up quickly.

179
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,450
Is it the wolf from yesterday?

180
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,810
One is no problem, we beat it yesterday too.

181
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,720
But I think the entire pack is here.

182
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,780
Wang Chi Ang! Hey!

183
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,420
Are you okay?

184
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,270
Wang Chi Ang, be careful!

185
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,980
Wang Chi Ang!

186
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:10,110
Now, I stopped the bleeding and did first aid so you'll be fine.

187
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:19,040
Here, put this on. It's strange because you're quiet. You should say something.

188
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,900
Why are you looking at me like that?

189
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,700
You were like a female warrior when we fought with the wolf-dog but you're like a nightingale now.

190
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,180
I guess you're not in too much pain since you're joking around.

191
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,500
I cancel what I said earlier. Sh! Be quiet.

192
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,980
Let me see.

193
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,240
I'm fine.

194
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,820
If you get a scar on your face, the hearts of your fans will tear into pieces.

195
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,760
I don't know if I still have fans whose hearts break over me.

196
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,500
Don't worry. Everything will return to its original place.

197
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,940
What?

198
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,540
You're hurt too.

199
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,780
Ah, this? This is nothing, I'll take care of this.

200
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,130
Drink.

201
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,610
There she comes, your fan.

202
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,740
You're thirsty, right? Drink.

203
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,460
Thanks. I keep on being indebted to you.

204
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,180
Ah, what debt?

205
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,350
Isn't there anything with more elegance?

206
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,570
This is quite "elegance" in the countryside.

207
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,640
Yes, just give it to me.

208
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,780
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my!

209
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,750
Who is this? What brings you here?

210
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,340
Ah...this.

211
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,650
I was planning to give you a call anyway. Are the kids doing well?

212
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:52,550
Aigoo, I told you not worry since our Soon Deok is there.

213
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,810
I've been having these weird dreams lately. Chi Ang is not answering the phone either.

214
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,220
I even broke a vase today.

215
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,220
Since I'm so upset, please stay with me for a while.

216
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,880
Sure!

217
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,020
Since you were the wife of the Shanghai Group's president,

218
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:13,070
I thought you lived in Shanghai or Seoul but you live here?

219
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:18,070
Ah, you must stay here because of your son.

220
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,740
Yes, yes, of course!

221
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,710
I'll go get some refreshments. Just a moment... Ah !

222
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,320
Oh my, oh my! Are you alright?

223
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,170
Ahjumma! Ahjumma! Where did this ahjumma go to again?

224
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:36,490
Goodness, why is someone who is supposed to be working doing such a sloppy job?

225
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,890
You have to clean up things like this neatly.

226
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,450
Aigoo, are you okay?

227
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,040
That's what I mean. I just don't like her, ugh!

228
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:54,590
- By any chance, do you not want to hire someone else?
- Pardon?

229
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,540
If I work here, I can deliver news about your son every day,

230
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:03,300
work, and talk to you. I can do three things for you!

231
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,570
I don't know...

232
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,240
I'm really strong too.

233
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,130
If we hurry, we'll be able to reach Moorim Peak by tonight and arrive back at school.

234
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,680
Let's go.

235
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,000
- Are you okay?
- Do you think you can walk?

236
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,720
Of course. My vitamin, Ariel, is right next to me so of course I'm fine.

237
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,650
Now, let's start.

238
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,010
Hold my hand.

239
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,080
Now, slowly...

240
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:46,810
I think I'm going to call you a carp for all this.

241
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,320
Let's just rest a bit.

242
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,900
Wang Chi Ang.

243
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm fine. I just need to rest for a bit.

244
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,680
This won't do. Going to Moorim Peak in this condition is too much.

245
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,050
Let's return.

246
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:39,680
What are you saying? Do you know how hard it was for me to come this far?

247
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,160
I can go.

248
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,370
No, you can't go.

249
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,850
Both of you can go. I'll go down the mountain with him.

250
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:50,090
Moorim Peak is right around the corner so how can I give up here? I can go.

251
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,230
Right ahead there's nothing but a steep cliff. You can't go.

252
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,570
Ariel!

253
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,390
Why are you looking for Ariel on a mountain without any oceans?!

254
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,390
I can't save you there.

255
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,570
Then, only Yoon Si Woo who went to the Moorim Peak will remain at school.

256
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,290
I'm going to attend school with you.

257
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,390
I have to remain at Moorim School. That way, my mom—

258
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,360
I can go.

259
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,340
I said you can't. Stop being so stubborn.

260
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,200
Um...

261
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,680
what about starting again after resting for an hour?

262
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,730
Let's do that. If we rest for just one hour, I can go again.

263
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,730
And after an hour, you're going to go die?

264
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,650
If I were you, I wouldn't even have been able to come all the way here with my body like that.

265
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:52,870
You're not giving up because it's difficult, you're returning because you have no other choice.

266
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,580
You can't go on anymore.

267
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:00,280
I'll take him and go down. You should go to Moorim Peak with Yoon Si Woo.

268
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,960
Why would you take care of me?

269
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,290
If I have to go down, I'm going to go down with Ariel.

270
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:18,150
I'm taking you down because I'm stronger than Soon Deok. Do you think I don't want to go up with my Oppa Si Woo?

271
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,130
Let's go.

272
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:30,030
Um... Then, can't you support

273
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,790
me and go to Moorim Peak?

274
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:38,330
If you keep acting like this, I'm going make you faint by smacking you and piggy-back you down.

275
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,230
Yoon Si Woo.

276
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,260
Go.

277
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:01,560
It's better for at least one person to succeed than for both of us to fail.

278
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,610
Hey, Wang Chi Ang.

279
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,140
What are you doing? You said you were going to support me.

280
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:23,160
Don't worry about me. If I get expelled, I can always live at Ariel's house.

281
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,740
- Hey!
- Is this what they call turning a misfortune into a blessing?

282
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,830
Let's go.

283
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,720
You had to give up without a choice because you were injured,

284
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,680
so it's possible that the headmaster might accept you if you explain it well.

285
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,300
I'll also help you.

286
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,460
Do you think words will get through to that damned person?

287
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,500
Just look at his face. You can tell he's awful just by looking at him.

288
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:19,430
He's a headmaster? I'm going to tell my dad to fire him.

289
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,850
Is that something to say to the headmaster?

290
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,220
Expelled? Tell him to expel me.

291
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,780
Or tell him to come at me.

292
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:37,380
I... I don't even need my right arm. With only my left arm, I'll jab-jab.

293
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,130
If we rush a bit, we'll be able to reach Moorim Peak within 30 minutes.

294
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,780
Where is it? Seriously...

295
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,330
Why? Is it hard? Do you want to rest a bit?

296
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,800
Yeah, let's take a rest before we go. Where should we rest?

297
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:14,870
I... don't want to end up like the Mobius kids.

298
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:24,350
I don't want to do things so I can survive by myself. I don't like it.

299
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:31,470
See if I leave the headmaster, that damned old man, alone.

300
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:35,740
After I'll have my lawyer drag him through dirt,

301
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,880
ugh...

302
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,170
Then he'll probably beg, "Master Wang Chi Ang, please save me. Master Wang Chi Ang, please save me."

303
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:46,460
Do you think I'll let you off the hook just because you do that, you strange old man?

304
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:53,760
Shut that mouth before I throw you somewhere.

305
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,450
Did I say anything wrong?

306
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,700
The headmaster that you call strange old man is my dad!

307
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,730
Do you understand?

308
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,520
You don't resemble him at all, sorry.

309
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,300
Did he do something wrong again?

310
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:21,460
You startled me. Did you come back already?

311
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,410
Where's the symbol?

312
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,360
He said he'll give up.

313
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,730
What?!

314
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,860
- Let's go.
- Give up? You were so close, give up what?

315
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,690
Just in case I meet any more wolf-dogs.

316
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:41,560
- What?
- I'm scared to go with her without you.

317
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,150
Are you pitying me right now?

318
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:59,520
I thought about it...and I don't think you would have gone by yourself.

319
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,890
What? "Going with her"? Ah, seriously.

320
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,840
Let's go, I feel upset.

321
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:39,700
- Oh!
- Oh, they're here!

322
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,880
-They really returned.
- Oh, unbelievable.

323
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,380
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

324
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,880
Who brought back the symbol?

325
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:01,470
Is the symbol important right now? I almost died.

326
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,950
A place like that—

327
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,380
We couldn't make it all the way there.

328
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,430
He could have but he couldn't because of me,

329
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,440
so please just acknowledge that Yoon Si Woo was the one who succeeded.

330
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,290
I'm not lying, he really could have reached the peak if he continued going up for 30 more minutes.

331
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:21,410
To tell you truthfully, I could make it up to there because of Wang Chi Ang.

332
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,330
I was afraid of going by myself so I gave up.

333
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,390
I see.

334
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,160
Why were you alone? My Ariel followed you.

335
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,810
He's lying to seem cool.

336
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,720
He basically reached the peak and came back.

337
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,500
It's not true.

338
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,440
Be quiet, shut up.

339
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:47,680
You said you would let one of us remain

340
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,350
so do that.

341
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:55,010
What did you tell us? You told us that Moorim School is a school that teaches about life.

342
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:00,250
Isn't life like that? You make mistakes and you gain things out of those mistakes.

343
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,620
You just smiled right now, didn't you? Right?

344
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,470
Go get treatment where you're injured

345
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,380
and start formally entering classes tomorrow.

346
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,230
We couldn't reach Moorim Peak.

347
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:29,590
If you succeeded on your first try, you'd be monsters.

348
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:32,510
Leave quickly before I change my mind.

349
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:35,780
Get out quickly! You all smell!

350
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,770
You guys came back from the creek. Did you not wash at all? Get out.

351
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,830
Get out quickly! Ah, the smell.

352
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,620
Hey, hey!

353
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,520
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

354
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,470
Yoon Si Woo and Wang Chi Ang have both guaranteed their spots in Moorim School.

355
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,240
R-Really?

356
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,140
Wow, really?

357
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,170
How come you're eating so much again?

358
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,940
It's because I'm happy, because I'm happy.

359
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,190
My appetite changes according to my mood.

360
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:17,420
Well, my heart felt torn when they came in. I felt all the emotions rushing in.

361
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,660
It was pretty amazing.

362
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,880
I acknowledge it too.

363
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,930
Yoon Si Woo and Wang Chi Ang returned.

364
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:37,670
Even though they couldn't get the Moorim symbol, I still acknowledge them.

365
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,400
I can't acknowledge those bastards.

366
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,410
You even dissed the people who thought of you as their friend.

367
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,440
Friends?

368
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,310
I never thought of them as friends.

369
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:56,190
I thought that those rascals would return without even being able to endure a night in the forest.

370
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,780
They're quite admirable, aren't they?

371
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,680
It was worth giving them a chance.

372
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,110
That's what I mean.

373
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:06,150
If we had kicked them out like Professor Kim Dae Ho said to do, what would we have done?

374
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,070
If someone sees, they'll think that those kids actually succeeded on the mission.

375
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,640
What are you so happy about kids who failed that you're making such a fuss?

376
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,840
Truthfully, you're happy to see the kids too. Aren't you?

377
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,900
I'm not.

378
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,370
Yes, you are.

379
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:31,020
- You're tired, aren't you?
- Yes.

380
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,540
Even if this room is smaller than my bathroom, I still like it.

381
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,780
I think I can finally live now.

382
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:45,840
Hey, don't you think the other kids also look at us differently now?

383
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,320
I'll clean the bathrooms until your arm heals.

384
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,110
I guess you're really touched that I saved you from the wolf-dog.

385
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,200
Do you just want to do it?

386
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,120
What's the real reason?

387
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,650
What's the real reason that the headmaster accepted us?

388
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,210
Is the person I'm seeing right now

389
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,560
Moorim School's indifferent student, Hwang Seon Ah?

390
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,150
It's a waste to see by myself. The other kids need to see you like this.

391
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:41,880
- Do you think he saw your interview?
- I'm sure he saw it.

392
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,410
That child didn't run away,

393
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:51,930
and he chased the reporters to protect Jung Da Rim from the paparazzi.

394
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:56,870
Don't worry. Everything will return to its original place.

395
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,720
What is that?

396
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,970
All this, because of reporters and myself,

397
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:15,650
Oh. My Ariel looks good on camera.

398
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:20,580
Yes, here are Mobius fans supporting Yoon Si Woo's comeback.

399
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:24,640
Wow, what amazing people.

400
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,400
They were calling you the Runaway Idol and a loser, but now they say they believe in you.

401
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:35,580
Come back, Yoon Shi Woo

402
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:39,160
Isn't it funny? Since when were they on your side?

403
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,430
Hey, I'm always the scapegoat.

404
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:55,860
I saw the public reaction and I just went with it. Should've said something sooner.

405
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:02,260
- Rest up.
- Hey, where are you going?

406
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:09,140
It seems those children found a reason to remain here.

407
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:13,400
Not succeeding by yourself, but failing together.

408
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,400
As you live life, don't you learn more about failure than you do about success?

409
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,960
They're kids who fit perfectly with Moorim School.

410
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:28,700
Well... I don't know about Wang Chi Ang,

411
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:34,110
but I don't think that Yoon Si Woo will return.

412
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,480
He's not conscious, but he's perfectly stable?

413
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,630
Good. I'll tell Chairman Wang Hao that he shouldn't wait too long.

414
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,170
Yes.

415
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,190
♬  Yeah I am alive. ♬

416
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,910
♬ Look straight at me.♬

417
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:54,540
♬ I will get up once again for dozens of times♬

418
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,680
♬  Yeah I am alive. ♬

419
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,290
♬  Yeah I am alive. Watch me. Now close both eyes and feel me. ♬

420
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:02,530
♬  Now close both eyes and feel me. ♬

421
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:05,860
♬  In the deep pitch-black darkness♬

422
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,900
♬  Like a child who has lost his way♬

423
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:14,490
♬  Even if I scream, no one will hear ♬

424
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:18,740
♬  Buried deep in my heart♬

425
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,550
♬  In the memory of a shout directed at me♬

426
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,260
♬  Faint consciousness♬

427
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,820
♬  Barely holds onto me♬
-Oppa, I love you!
-You're Si Woo oppa, right?

428
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,200
♬  Even if the dark shadows pierce me♬

429
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,680
♬  While you shine on me everything disappears♬

430
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,950
♬  Again surviving (My spark)♬

431
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,940
♬  Yeah I am alive. ♬

432
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,160
♬  Look straight at me.♬

433
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,350
♬  I will get up once again for dozens of times ♬

434
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,460
♬  Yeah I am alive. ♬
Are you finished?

435
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,630
♬  Watch over me ♬

436
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:54,210
♬  Now close both eyes and feel me♬
-It's all done.
-One more spicy fried chicken.
-Yes.

437
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:58,810
♬  In front of everyone♬

438
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:01,590
♬  I'll show more of myself♬

439
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,330
♬  I'm living, breathing♬

440
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:07,040
♬  I'm newly born♬

441
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:39,410
You've seen me a few times on a broadcast, haven't you?

442
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:41,030
Yes.

443
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:46,570
It seems you just came back from a long trip, so I won't waste your time and will get to the point.

444
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,300
Sign a contract with my company.

445
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:53,300
Since your name has been cleared, you need to have an extravagant comeback.

446
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,150
You'll come back as a solo singer, not as a team.

447
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,980
President Choi is quite well known in this industry

448
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,370
as someone who only knows and cares about money.

449
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,760
Trust me this time.

450
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:17,720
If you need it, I'll help you let go of Mobius and do the music you like.

451
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,130
Actually ...

452
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,670
I have a problem.

453
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:37,780
With the ears? I know, President Choi made sure to let rumors out.

454
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:44,920
While resting in America, you can write songs and receive treatment for about a year.

455
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,080
If you want to rest longer, you can do that.

456
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,820
Are you being sincere? This is...

457
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:55,200
There's a possibility I will never hear again.

458
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,290
Which proves the extent we are willing to help you.

459
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,450
Until now, have you lived being lied to?

460
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,630
Just accept some things as they are.

461
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,120
Did you live your entire life being fooled?

462
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:16,480
Since we're talking about this, let's leave for Seoul immediately.

463
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,580
Today?

464
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:23,710
What are you talking about, Dad? Oppa Si Woo might not return?

465
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:30,060
- Hey, do you know how many times I told you clean up properly?
- Ah,

466
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:38,100
No! Even if he leaves when he has to, tell him to leave after fixing his ear. You can cure his ear.

467
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,860
He really can't just leave like this.

468
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,480
Where have you been residing? Do you have any family here?

469
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,390
No, I...

470
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,640
don't have any family.

471
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:16,460
It's either one of the two, I'm either wrong about you

472
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,940
or President Choi spread negative rumors about you.

473
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:24,310
- What kind of rumors?
- You're too closed.

474
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:30,820
He said that you won't tell anyone about your true feelings or the situation you're in.

475
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,420
Yes, did he?

476
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:50,170
Wang Chi Ang

477
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:58,200
Wang Chi Ang

478
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,630
Are you really leaving?

479
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,950
Don't leave.

480
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,900
You're popular wherever you go.

481
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:18,300
Wang Chi Ang

482
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:40,080
Get in. Let's start anew.

483
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,880
Yoon Shi Woo!

484
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:57,010
Are you going somewhere?

485
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:04,260
You're the woman who uploaded the video on the Internet, right?

486
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,610
You have done a great deed.

487
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:10,580
Excuse me. Please give me some time.

488
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,360
Alright.

489
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,870
Reporter Park, why did you suddenly call me?

490
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:21,670
Anyway, the press should know too.

491
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:25,900
Yoon Si Woo is an important figure after all.

492
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:31,650
I think my thanks are kind of late,

493
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:36,230
but thanks.

494
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:39,270
- For what?
- For the clarification video you uploaded on the Internet.

495
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:44,180
Oh, I just resolved a misunderstanding.

496
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,010
But,

497
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:50,190
did he come to meet with you?

498
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:55,050
Yes. Because of you,

499
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,740
I can work again.

500
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:05,890
That's great! Later, you need to treat me to a really big meal next time!

501
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:10,180
The reporters are already making a fuss. If you're done talking, we should leave.

502
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,370
Are you, by any chance, leaving right now?

503
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,820
Already?

504
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:33,020
As soon as I meet you, we're saying good-bye.

505
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:37,620
I'm a little sad, but you're leaving with the misunderstanding solved.

506
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,420
Congratulations!

507
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,000
Stay healthy and

508
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,010
when you want to rest after you have a tight schedule, come see us anytime.

509
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:55,010
We won't go anywhere and stay right here, so you're welcome any time.

510
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:57,000
Thanks.

511
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:03,780
I have to make a delivery, so I'll leave now.

512
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,760
Be safe, Yoon Shi Woo!

513
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:11,740
Go!

514
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:30,800
♬  When I look back, I was so young ♬

515
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,510
♬  All that happened  ♬

516
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:36,880
You grew a lot, Yoon Shi Woo.

517
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,880
You dare to ignore Wang Chi Ang's calls?

518
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,900
Don't schedule anything for Si Woo yet.

519
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:52,320
There's this lawyer, Kim. I should call him.

520
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,210
Where are you? Call me as soon as you see this message!

521
00:52:56,210 --> 00:53:00,160
Are you running away because you don't want to clean the bathrooms?

522
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:07,820
Fine! Let's split the bathroom chores! So just hurry up and come.

523
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:11,600
♬  Run, run, run  ♬

524
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,230
♬ When the day I dreamed of comes I must see you smiling widely  ♬

525
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:18,340
Yoon Shi Woo, this jerk. He did run away because he didn't want to clean the bathrooms.

526
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:24,750
♬ Facing an unknown future ♬

527
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:30,180
These people. What do they see me as?
♬ Totally worn out I Am Gonna Run To You ♬

528
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,540
Yoon Shi Woo, this jerk.

529
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:36,480
Of course. He's a runaway idol, he ran away again.
♬ With everyone having left here. ♬

530
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,080
Even if you left, you should have said bye.
♬  Without even anyone I can go to. ♬

531
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,730
I'm the stupid one for caring about him.
♬  I want to run far away. ♬

532
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:48,830
Well, it's for the better.
♬  I am running to you.  ♬

533
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:51,870
Having this room to myself would be pretty cool.
♬ Just for you. ♬

534
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:56,180
♬  I will be there. Believe in me ♬

535
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,210
From now on, I guess this bed is mine!

536
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,210
From the beginning they should have given me a room to myself.

537
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:06,990
Does it even make sense for me to share a room with someone else?

538
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:11,540
This place is nice! It's so comfortable!

539
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:15,670
♬  Run, run, run  ♬

540
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:18,890
♬  I gotta run, run, run  ♬

541
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:22,360
♬  I gotta run, run, run  ♬

542
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,390
♬  I gotta run, run, run  ♬

543
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:28,440
♬  I have got to run  ♬

544
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,200
I want to leave the campus for a bit.

545
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,500
Are you going to come back?

546
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:44,850
Like the rest of you, there was a time

547
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:47,840
when I was a tight bundle of stubbornness and persistence.

548
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:52,170
If it wasn't for that friend,

549
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,350
I wouldn't be here.

550
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:59,120
Friend?

551
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:08,090
We should rest for now since we also have to see President Choi's situation.

552
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:11,980
Are you listening to me?

553
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:18,880
Don't worry about your ear. We'll see a doctor as soon as we get there.

554
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,530
That's right.

555
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,210
First of all, my ears should get healed.

556
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:40,300
You really haven't become a human being yet.

557
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,390
If you want to ask for a favor, do it properly.

558
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:45,410
It's proper order to thank me for helping you out that day first,

559
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:48,700
and asking me to go to Seoul to help clear your name comes after that.

560
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:52,500
Honestly, the way it turned out for Oppa Shi Woo, even if it wasn't your intention,

561
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,450
isn't it still your responsibility?

562
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:56,350
- Are you okay?
- What is?

563
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:59,760
Not being able to do music, or

564
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,220
being placed in the total beginners' class?

565
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:05,990
If you get a scar on your face, the hearts of your fans will tear apart.

566
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:09,390
I don't even know if I still have fans whose hearts would break over me.

567
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:12,430
I think my greetings are a bit late

568
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:13,880
but, thanks.

569
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,970
Thanks to you,

570
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:20,030
I'm able to start working again.

571
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:34,590
You're so close so why would you give up?

572
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,810
I thought about it

573
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:40,550
and I don't think you would have left by yourself.

574
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,580
Don't play around just because we don't have any orders, and slice up some radish. We're almost out of radish for the chicken.

575
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:02,730
Ahjumma, could I get off work early today?

576
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:05,100
I'm not feeling well...

577
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:09,370
You are? Is there a time when you don't feel well?

578
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,140
I'm sorry.

579
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:18,920
I'm really not feeling well.

580
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:31,660
I don't think it's a delivery.

581
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,500
Yoon Si Woo!

582
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,450
Hey, someone would think you saw a ghost or something.

583
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:43,750
D-Didn't you go to Seoul?

584
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:48,730
Even though I'm popular and everyone knows me,

585
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,590
my popularity doesn't look like it's going to die down.

586
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:55,420
If I do it, some will be really disappointed.

587
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,940
Then did you decide to remain here?

588
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:03,020
Well, yeah.

589
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,200
Yeah, you decided well!

590
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:10,200
What you need now isn't popularity, but some rest.

591
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,090
I don't know.

592
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:16,030
I don't know how much I could rest in that place.

593
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:20,080
If you're on your way to school, let's go together.

594
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,300
Okay.

595
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,030
Just a minute.

596
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:30,200
Did you leave it like that ever since Moorim Peak?

597
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,640
Ah, it's nothing.

598
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,150
What's nothing? What are you going to do if you get a scar?

599
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,970
Stay still.

600
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:00,040
- Get on.
- Ah, I'll do it.

601
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,460
Get some rest.

602
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,660
You couldn't even rest and you've been working all day long.

603
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:11,640
You should get some sleep on the way or something.

604
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:29,350
If you fall asleep you could fall off,

605
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:31,370
so hold on tightly.

606
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:47,530
♬  Oh, girl, oh, yeah  ♬

607
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:54,040
♬  Why do I keep being reminded of you?  ♬

608
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,660
♬I keep smiling, even during the hard times♬

609
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:02,730
♬  What did you do to me? ♬

610
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:08,170
♬  Everything seems so weird now  ♬

611
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:13,250
♬Even if I try to hide it, I can't help it.♬

612
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:16,880
Even if I try to stop it, I can't do it♬

613
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,940
♬I can only think of you all day.♬

614
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:24,460
♬I can only think of you all day.♬

615
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:30,720
♬  I just can't stop, my girl  ♬

616
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,480
♬  'Cause you are my girl  ♬

617
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:40,250
♬  Wherever I go, whatever I do  ♬

618
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:45,060
♫ I only think of you ♫

619
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:49,920
♬  Wherever you go, whatever you do  ♬

620
