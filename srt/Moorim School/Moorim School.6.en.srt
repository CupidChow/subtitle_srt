1
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,980
Are you ready?

2
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,550
If you are, let's start.

3
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,500
I see a child.

4
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,610
A child crying in the middle of a fire.

5
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,970
Someone was definitely there.

6
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,950
Hey!

7
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,840
Who is it?

8
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,180
Who is that child?

9
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,060
I don't know who that child is and I don't know who that person is either.

10
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,220
The more I think about, the more I remember...

11
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,380
I feel something pressing down on my chest.

12
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,570
For now, you accomplished a great thing by looking at what's inside you

13
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,100
and releasing what's inside.

14
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,210
We'll think about how you can overcome that.

15
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,770
Moorim School
- Episode 6 -

16
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,730
It's the first time we are seeing a patient who was in a semi-coma for 18 years wake up.
(Chinese)

17
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,870
We're keeping an eye on his condition.

18
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,370
His brain scan came out normal, and his recognition ability is normal as well.

19
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,350
I understand.

20
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,900
He woke up? Alright.

21
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,370
Chae Yoon woke up.

22
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,640
Things will unravel faster than I thought.

23
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,500
Dad.

24
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,890
What brings you here at this hour? You're not studying for the exams?

25
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,310
If you fan-girl too much, can you develop a trauma for it?

26
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,710
What are you saying?

27
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,820
Ever since I was a kid, I was scared of fire. My Oppa Si Woo is the same.

28
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,930
Hey, can't you get rid of "my Oppa Si Woo"?

29
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:32,800
Look, huh? My Oppa Si Woo -- even your dad is starting to say this because of you.

30
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,230
Yoon Si Woo is one year younger than you.

31
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,660
How can he have the same trauma as I?

32
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,690
By chance, is this... fate?

33
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,850
It can be fate...

34
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:52,020
But where can you find someone who hasn't played with fire at least once in their childhood? I'm busy, so leave.

35
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,230
You take other students' concerns seriously, but why are you only so cruel to me?

36
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,110
Are you really my dad? Did you pick me up from under a bridge or something?

37
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,590
They say, you can figure out someone's personality by the way they clean a restroom.

38
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,590
This guy... You should have cleaned it better.

39
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,390
Are you okay?

40
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,700
About?

41
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,260
Nothing. Just clean up.

42
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:16,770
Oh my god! Ariel, please use another bathroom. I don't want to break my fantasy about you.

43
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,160
I came to wash my hands.

44
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:29,220
But Ariel, I'm working really hard. Isn't there anything like a prize?

45
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,280
- Are you doing this for me?
- Of course.

46
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,310
No need.

47
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:48,070
Don't be like this. If I win against Yoon Si Woo in the upcoming exams, grant me one wish.

48
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,050
How childish.

49
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,780
There's no way we're going to lose.

50
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,750
Don't show off, Sim Soon Deok.

51
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,830
"We"? You and that person are "we"?

52
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,410
Well... It just means we're on the same team.

53
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,200
Mentor-mentee.

54
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,930
Is it not because you're not confident?

55
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,540
Who is not confident?

56
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,600
Fine. Then you'll grant me a wish.

57
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,250
What on earth is your wish?

58
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,560
A date.

59
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,160
- What?
- Let's go on a date.

60
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,090
You promised. If I win, we'll go on a date.

61
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,710
His jokes are too much, seriously.

62
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,030
Hey, I almost got hurt.

63
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,770
Sorry.

64
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,830
I'm always thankful.

65
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,130
As expected, Teacher Kim Dae Ho's tea is the best.

66
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,920
I wish it was midterm all year long.

67
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,760
Why?

68
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,910
How nice is it when the kids aren't creating trouble?

69
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,420
Also, has there ever been another time when they were that focused in class?

70
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,280
They are focused every day in my class.

71
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,310
That's due to the excitement difference kids have between cooking and physical education.

72
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,170
It looks like it's the difference of the teacher.

73
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,860
Let's fight.

74
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,030
Anyway, Seon Ah will place first again, right?

75
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,070
In terms of martial skill, Yeop Jeong isn't bad either.

76
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,750
If we judge simply based on martial arts skill,

77
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,660
then won't we become like someone who has absolutely no consideration for his opponent?

78
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,330
The Moorim School doesn't launch students like that so...

79
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,380
Become like who?

80
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,800
Wasn't Professor Kim Dae Ho a full scholarship student?

81
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,810
He was. However, you cannot think that the full scholarship student from back then is Professor Kim Dae Ho now.

82
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,450
He was different than he is now.

83
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,340
Really?

84
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,270
During that time, he was controlled by an abnormal hormone.

85
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,240
Abnormal hormone?

86
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,330
You know, Dopamine, phenylethylamine, oxytocin, endorphins.

87
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,100
Those things that make people feel like they are floating on a cloud.

88
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,250
Aren't those all the hormones that are released when people fall in love?

89
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:43,390
Oh my... What... Man... Saying unnecessary things.

90
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,110
After saying it himself, now he says that it's unnecessary?

91
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,050
Is the only way to change a person through love?  (in German)

92
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,680
I don't know about anything else, but we must win this.

93
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,840
Losing means death.

94
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,810
Rock for men. You know that, right?

95
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,850
- I know.
- Hey, don't plan it out!

96
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,430
If you don't play, you lose. Rock, paper, scissor, shoo!

97
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,230
- Yes!
- Wow, wow, wow!

98
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,710
I have a conscience, I'll wash these myself.

99
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,530
You know that you have to wash our athletic suits with your hands, right?

100
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,830
Split the colors and the whites.

101
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,380
Make the white clothes even whiter!

102
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,950
Make the colors look like signature colors.

103
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,910
Let's go practice!

104
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:50,520
Aish, we're already short on time to practice.

105
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,630
Should I help you out?

106
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,870
- Good luck!
- Ariel, I'm sorry!

107
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,320
-Aish, it's fine.
-Sim Soon Deok...

108
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,300
Here, this is yours. You can do it!

109
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,270
Let's go. Hey Yoon Si Woo, snap out of it!

110
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,050
Snap out of it! Get up, we have to do the laundry.

111
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,570
We have to practice...

112
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,240
Let's just think of this as basic practice and do it.

113
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,620
But...

114
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,840
The kid in the fire.

115
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,120
Was it, by chance, you when you were younger?

116
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,290
It could be. It might not be.

117
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,300
I heard I was abandoned somewhere in the mountains when I was young.

118
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,610
In the mountains?

119
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,870
According to the news, they said that your parents were living in the States...

120
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,890
Do you even search articles about me?

121
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,190
No, well...

122
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:04,490
That's a past that was made up by my entertainment agency. Truthfully,

123
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,150
I'm just an orphan.

124
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,050
Sorry.

125
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,510
It's not as if you were the one who abandoned me so what are you sorry for?

126
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:23,330
But... It's possible that they didn't abandon you.

127
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:31,250
They could have lost you or they could have had a situation where they had no choice.

128
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,660
If that were the case, then they would have came back for me.

129
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,850
If you can use the lance, then you can do it now in reality.

130
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,410
But what is this pouch for? So that it won't hurt if you get hit?

131
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,550
No. I put flour at the end of the lance.

132
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,910
If you succeed in your attacks, flour will stain your opponent's body.

133
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,370
When we finish, you'll be able

134
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,840
to see how many of your attacks landed, in one glance.

135
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,280
You used your head on this one.

136
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,120
If you even get an ounce of flour on my body, I'll just consider that your won.

137
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,720
You think that I won't be able to get any flour on you? I'm telling you this again.

138
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,280
A man like me, who has done Taekwondo, Hapkido, Judo—

139
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,700
Are you going to spar with your mouth?

140
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,720
Start.

141
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,550
I won't go easy on you.

142
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,750
Hey, we're supposed to hand wash all of these.

143
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,610
We'll never be able to hand wash all of these. The sparring test is in two days.

144
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,070
Hey! Move aside, move.

145
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,650
Oh, Yoon Si Woo. You're using your brain.

146
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:02,030
- So you're going to work on your balance and wrist strength at the same time, huh?
- That's right.

147
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,670
Hey, start quickly!

148
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,230
Fine. #2 laundry to #1.

149
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,000
#3 laundry to #1. #4 to #1!

150
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,380
Hey! Hey! What is that? You're like an amateur. Move faster so your hands become invisible.

151
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,340
#1 to #3!

152
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,730
Catch!

153
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,330
Oh, your reflexes are becoming faster!

154
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,250
♫ Here comes the fire ♫

155
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,670
♬ I don't know why my two eyes ♬

156
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,040
♬ seem like they're going blind ♬

157
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,250
♬ I don't know why like my whole body knew ♬

158
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,450
♬  I saw you. I saw you. ♬

159
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,200
♬ No matter how hard I try ♬

160
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,800
Aish, hey!
♬ There are some things I can't throw away. ♬

161
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,870
♬ Just leave me alone for awhile ♬

162
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:59,000
♬ I must do in my own way ♬

163
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,100
♬ Here comes the fire,
I can't hold back ♬

164
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,740
♬ Just back off and
Go away I will burn everything. ♬

165
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,150
♬ I don't know why as though my heart will explode ♬

166
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,430
♬  things are getting complicated  ♬

167
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:23,050
♬ I don't know why like my whole body is going to get lost in a fire ♬

168
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,920
♬  I mean Hot In Here. I’m Outta Here.  ♬

169
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,670
♬ No matter how hard I try ♬

170
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,250
♬ There are some things I can't throw away. ♬

171
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,310
♬ Just leave me alone for awhile ♬

172
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:44,450
♬ I must go on my way ♬

173
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,260
♬ Here comes the fire, I can't hold back ♬

174
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,640
♬ Just back off and go away.  ♬

175
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,150
♬ Here comes the fire. Here comes the fire ♬

176
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,350
♬ I wanna live my life ♬

177
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,340
Aish.

178
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,540
We'll finish up now.

179
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,200
I don't want to, let's do more.

180
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,030
I still haven't been able to get any flour on you.

181
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,090
Why? There's some right here.

182
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,790
That's stained because you hit yourself!

183
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,790
This pocket doesn't usually rip.

184
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,050
That's evidence that you practiced really hard.

185
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,830
We have a chance of succeeding in the tests.

186
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,050
Really?

187
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,430
Is that so? So you're saying we're going to win?

188
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,630
But... Why are you trying to win against Yoon Si Woo so much?

189
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,650
Well, it's a given that you want to win, but...

190
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,060
A wish coupon depends on that.

191
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,060
If I win in this test, my Ariel agreed to grant me one wish.

192
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,860
A wish? What's that?

193
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,520
It's a secret.

194
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,400
What the heck?

195
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,280
But what to do? You were always teaching me that you didn't even have time to practice.

196
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,480
Aren't you going up against Yeop Jeong?

197
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,130
Yeah.

198
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,170
Ah, that rude bastard.

199
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,830
You need to win too.

200
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,030
Mm... I also practiced.

201
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,610
I practiced really hardcore.

202
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,370
Really hardcore?

203
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,980
Where?

204
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,990
Oh, I feel like I can fly now.

205
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,030
Wow...

206
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,170
Is Wang Chi Ang's side doing well?

207
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:46,570
I'm sure they're doing well. Hwang Seon Ah is quite impressive.

208
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,610
You need to know the enemy and yourself to win.

209
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,340
I want to win too.

210
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,510
Yoon Si Woo! I'll see you later tonight.

211
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,830
Huh?

212
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,720
What? Steel wristlets?

213
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,470
That's what I said. How can that power come out of such a slender body?

214
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,270
I should have done that too.

215
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,990
So are you saying that you practiced every day with Seon Ah while she was wearing steel wristlets?

216
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,570
Of course. There's a wish coupon on the line with you.

217
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,890
Ah, that's right. I forgot that you're currently the enemy.

218
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,290
Forget what I just said.

219
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:43,000
It looks like you don't know this but, do you know what the most used battle tactic is?

220
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,740
What is it?

221
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,700
Temptation. You were just lured in by me. Ooh!

222
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,160
So pretty.

223
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,080
Hey, Yoon Si Woo!

224
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,960
You still need some more training.

225
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,600
Your reflexes only amount to that much?

226
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
What is it all of a sudden?

227
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,860
There's a change of plans for your test tomorrow.

228
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,300
A change of plans?

229
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,420
A change.

230
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:41,640
I see a child. It was a crying child in a fire.

231
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,220
There was definitely someone there.

232
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,640
I don't know who that child is and I don't know who that person is either.

233
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,960
By any chance, is he alive?

234
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,080
Are you conscious now?

235
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,800
I worried because I thought you would not be able to wake up again.

236
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,400
Who are you?

237
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,760
I am the sponsor for the International Martial Arts Society, Wang Hao of the Shanghai Group.

238
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:06,500
Because you were in a coma for 18 years, your muscles have atrophied a lot.

239
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,140
It's still too soon for you to move around.

240
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,720
Yes. Where are the children?

241
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,800
That... Recovering your body is our first priority.

242
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,460
I'll tell you about the specific details after that.

243
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,600
I heard that you haven't completely regained your old memories.

244
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,860
At last, tomorrow's the sparring examination.

245
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,580
I'm curious. Will their skills have improved greatly?

246
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,940
It feels worthwhile to see the students' process of growth.

247
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,440
My body feels fidgety for no reason.

248
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,700
Since we're already here, should we lightly warm up?

249
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,900
Seriously!

250
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,580
That's good.

251
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,560
What's wrong with you?

252
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,460
No. No.

253
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,860
Aigoo. I'm tired. I should sleep quickly.

254
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,900
Yeah, yes, yes. Rest quickly, rest deeply.

255
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,860
What is it?

256
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,180
I'll go take a shower.

257
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,740
What is it really?

258
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,400
You're sleeping already?

259
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,040
Yeah.

260
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,560
Okay, one-on-one sparring sessions are ten minutes each.

261
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,820
As determined, the lowest class each other with lances

262
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,000
and the rest of the students' events will be decided by lottery.

263
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,700
Number 1 and number 2 come forward.

264
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,800
The lower ranked person will come to pick the event.

265
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,040
Hwang Seon Ah and Yeop Jeong's event is

266
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,420
- hand-to-hand combat.
- To your positions.

267
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,320
If it's hand-to-hand combat, Yeop Jeong is at advantage.

268
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,420
Are the first and second rank finally going to change?

269
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,620
It's been a while since I've smelled the scent of sweat at school. It's nice.

270
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,080
Should we see how much their skills have improved?

271
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,140
They're pretty much an even match, right?

272
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,880
What? What happens?

273
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,280
Seon Ah and Yeop Jeong, it's a tie.

274
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,100
Tie?

275
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:28,220
The results are a tie but we have to take it that Seon Ah won. She blocked all of Yeop Jeong's attacks.

276
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:36,680
- Next.
- To change the atmosphere, should we see how the lowest students spar?

277
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,260
Us?

278
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,740
It hasn't even been a month since they entered. Will they have improved?

279
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,970
Yoon Si Woo has started to see inside himself,

280
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,220
so he will have become different.

281
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,820
Wang Chi Ang seems serious this time.

282
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,800
Here, start now.

283
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,180
China Boy is quite good.

284
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,560
The idol isn't half-bad either.

285
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,220
♬  Yeah I am alive. Look straight at me. ♬

286
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,000
♬  For dozens of times, I will get up once again. ♬

287
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,840
♬  Yeah I am alive. Watch me. ♬

288
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,920
♬  Now close both eyes and feel me. ♬

289
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,640
♬  In the deep pitch-black darkness♬

290
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,400
Chi Ang is better in strength.
♬  Like a child who has lost his way♬

291
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,500
♬  Even if I scream♬

292
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,420
Yoon Si Woo seems to be losing to Wang Chi Ang.
♬  No one will hear♬

293
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,640
Does it seem like that?
♬  Buried deep in my heart♬

294
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,260
If he gets pushed out, he's eliminated.

295
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,720
As expected, he's really different since Moorim School's #1 was his mentor.

296
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,020
Looks like Wang Chi Ang will win.

297
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:12,160
♬  It's become the only light which shines under cover on me♬

298
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,180
Hey, Sim Soon Deok. What have you been doing?

299
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:19,580
Why is Yoon Si Woo only getting attacked?
♬  Yeah I am alive. Look straight at me. For dozens of times, I will get up once again. ♬

300
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,680
This isn't it.

301
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,020
♬  Yeah I am alive. Watch me. Now close both eyes and feel me. ♬

302
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,300
You're asking me to do what? "Four ounces moves a thousand pounds?"

303
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,920
It's a battle tactic used by the defense. We're going to have to use that.

304
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,160
What is that?

305
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,520
It means that with the strength of four ounces, you deflect a thousand pounds.

306
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,000
Then are you saying that I'm four ounces and Wang Chi Ang is a thousand pounds?

307
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
That's not important. You know Spanish bullfighting, right?

308
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,580
I know it.

309
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,920
If the matador grabbed the bull by the horns, and started to push against each other, what do you think would happen?

310
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,310
It's obvious that the matador would end up losing.

311
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,460
Chi Ang and Seon Ah are both attackers.

312
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,840
Therefore, he will of course be attacking ferociously from the beginning.

313
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,490
Think well. A person who fishes for the first time will only try to reel in the fishing line,

314
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:17,270
but an expert leaves the fish alone to become exhausted.

315
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,730
Okay. You're telling me when I think the fish is tired,

316
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,890
reel him in.

317
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,980
You're laughing?

318
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:38,520
Yoon Si Woo is feeling his opponent

319
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,520
and waiting for his chance to attack.

320
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,040
Ah, it's "four ounces moves a thousand pounds".

321
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,610
Wow!

322
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,030
Who won?

323
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:17,450
Yoon Si Woo did land a large blow at the end but we have to take it that Wang Chi Ang won.

324
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,930
None of his attacks landed.

325
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,790
Yoon Si Woo's last attack was the only one that went in properly.

326
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,570
One vote for Yoon Si Woo for me.

327
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,190
How can you do that? We are all for Wang Chi Ang.

328
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,490
So you went for "four ounces moves a thousand pounds".

329
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,610
Sim Soon Deok. You used your head.

330
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,780
I said it as trivially as barley cake,

331
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,540
but it was Yoon Si Woo who did it well, like a rice cake.

332
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,090
This match is also a tie.

333
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,800
Excuse me? That doesn't make sense.

334
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,400
He just kept avoiding.

335
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,280
Wang Chi Ang showed us many amazing skills in a short period of time.

336
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,850
However, my main assessment is that you used too much force.

337
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,150
Yoon Si Woo showed that even avoiding is a skill.

338
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:08,740
I gave you points in the aspect that you attempted to win over the opponent's skills, but your attack was too slow.

339
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,620
If it wasn't a ten minute battle but a real one,

340
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,020
Yoon Shi Woo would have won.

341
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,020
I can't acknowledge this.

342
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,950
Then let's do more

343
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,070
until one of us gives up.

344
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:26,650
Stop it, Wang Chi Ang. You also need to know how to accept the results.

345
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,670
I lost, Sim Soon Deok.

346
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,690
Why did you lose? It's a tie.

347
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,570
The midterms?

348
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,250
How long has it been since he's entered that he's already taking a test?

349
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,700
Don't worry.

350
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,090
I heard from Soon Deok and I hear he's doing very well.

351
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,920
My Chi Ang gets goosebumps all over his body whenever he even hears the "te" of test.

352
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,840
It would be nice if I could be next to him at a time like this to take care of him.

353
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,250
Through Soon Deok, can we give Chi Ang

354
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,300
something like food?

355
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,540
This hot pink color suits me very well,

356
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,190
even the size looks like it'll fit me well. Look.

357
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:26,050
It kept bothering me that I couldn't even properly make him some food before I sent him away.

358
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,760
Yes. Yes, you can do that.

359
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,340
Our Soon Deok is good at making deliveries.

360
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,040
Really? That's good.

361
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,140
Then it's not time to be like this. I'll have to go grocery shopping first.

362
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:46,020
I wonder where I can get fresh seafood.

363
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:51,100
But how come there are only your clothes in your closet?

364
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,150
Why isn't there any of the Chairman's clothing?

365
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:59,410
Ah, are there separate closets for you and for the Chairman?

366
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:04,390
Ah, that's...because I'm the only one temporarily down here.

367
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,790
My husband does his business in China.

368
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:12,390
I will go to China soon as well.

369
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:16,480
He's someone who really hates being separated from me.

370
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,140
Then, goodbye.

371
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:27,200
Even so, they are a married couple. How could there not be even one pair of his underclothes here?

372
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,810
Anyhow, she's going to have to make plenty of food if I'm to get some of the excess.

373
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,900
Excuse, excuse me, Madam~

374
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,750
What on earth is the comprehensive exam? Why won't he tell us about it?

375
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,510
I have to know in advance so I can prepare.

376
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:52,990
Hey, are you stupid? They're preventing us from preparing, they want us to do as we normally do.

377
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,530
Did you just call me stupid?

378
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,430
Just eat your food.

379
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:03,570
I'm going to have to ask Hwang Seon Ah what "four ounces moves a thousand pounds" means after I eat dinner.

380
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:06,090
At the next examination, you won't even stand a chance.

381
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:09,470
For tomorrow's comprehensive exam, isn't there a way we can gain a hint?

382
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,600
Should we trap Sam and pressure him?

383
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,430
You know that this isn't something where he would give in.

384
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:18,950
Just wait. I sent a spy so an answer should come soon.

385
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,810
Don't act as a spy and leave.

386
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:27,310
Nothing will change whether you reveal it tomorrow morning or now.

387
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,250
Dad?

388
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,710
Don't you understand that the only thing I want is for you all to relax?

389
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,220
We're all sitting on needles, how can we rest properly?

390
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,210
If you've been doing well everyday, then there's nothing to worry about. Just enjoy the comprehensive exam.

391
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,910
If you keep acting like this, I'm...

392
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,350
Dream... Dream.

393
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,920
I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream about ghosts.

394
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,200
Did you dream about Seon Ah? Did dream about me, dad?

395
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,880
I'm busy so get out.

396
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,330
I dreamed...

397
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,950
Get out.

398
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,460
I didn't realize that he wouldn't reveal the comprehensive exam to even us.

399
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,750
The comprehensive exam has always been up to the discretion of the headmaster.

400
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:17,690
They will have to show all the skills they've learned. It's a real-life test.

401
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,250
Back when we were attending this school, during our comprehensive exam of climbing Moorim Peak,

402
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:24,650
all the endurance and perseverance, stamina and skill that I had accumulated—

403
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:29,470
Ah, until when are you going to use the talk about Moorim Peak?

404
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,400
In any case, since he's already done Moorim Peak,

405
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,150
I can't tell what he's thinking.

406
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,580
Last year, out of nowhere, it was a choral competition, right?

407
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:44,800
What do you mean out of nowhere? Do you know how much doing a chorale helps group training?

408
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,300
Vocalizing helps with lower abdominal breathing,

409
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:52,350
and making choral group with good harmony trains them in working cooperatively.

410
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:56,130
It also help train your patience, for when your teammate makes a mistake.

411
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:00,410
It helps you respond faster when the song suddenly goes out of tune.

412
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,950
There's nothing that's as good as that.

413
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:07,450
At times like this, there is no other couple that has such great chemistry as you guys.

414
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,090
Oh my, what chemistry?

415
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,960
Anyway, Yoon Si Woo and Wang Chi Ang have seemed to improved a lot.

416
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,460
The mentoring system has seemed to help a lot.

417
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:22,290
Earlier, it seemed like it was a fight between Seon Ah and Soon Deuk.

418
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,780
Seon Ah's precise and concentrated attacks,

419
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,720
and Soon Deok's clever play to survey the situation and look for a chance.

420
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,600
Since the sparring examination was a tie,

421
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:38,420
Let's look forward to how the comprehensive exam will change up the students' results.

422
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,910
I'm really going to beat you tomorrow.

423
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,740
Yeah, do that.

424
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:54,060
Aish, so embarrassing. A tie?

425
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,540
Don't take your eyes off him for even a moment and watch him.

426
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,480
He's an important key to this business.

427
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,120
Yes.

428
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,630
Ah, it's starting again!

429
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,810
He just goes to sleep as soon as his head hits the pillow.

430
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,530
There's probably no one as dull as him in this world.

431
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,750
I'm going to say something to the person who's playing that lullaby.

432
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,570
It was you?

433
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,970
Oh, sorry.

434
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:33,560
Was it noisy? I just couldn't sleep.

435
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:39,000
You walk around wearing steel wristlets yet you can't sleep at night. Exactly what type of stamina do you have?

436
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,380
I know right. I have a severe case of insomnia.

437
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:49,060
But strangely, my heart becomes at ease whenever I hear this song.

438
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:53,380
That's a lullaby. Is it a song your mom sang for you when you were young?

439
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,630
Was that the case?

440
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:03,290
I don't really have any memories of my mom. I don't really know.

441
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,840
Could you not sleep because of the sound of the piano?

442
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,660
I guess I'll have to stop playing starting from tomorrow.

443
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,720
It's fine.

444
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,430
I think Yoon Si Woo is sleeping well because of this.

445
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,800
Oppa Si Woo?

446
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,320
I see.

447
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,700
But why do you call Si Woo "Oppa" and call me just by my name?

448
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,190
Yoon Si Woo is one year younger than me.

449
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:34,380
Really? Then we are the same age.

450
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,090
Sleep well, Wang Chi Ang.

451
00:41:50,850 --> 00:42:00,460
♫ Sleep well, my baby. My cute baby. ♫

452
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:10,690
♫ Make beautiful dreams where flowers bloom. ♫

453
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:57,850
If you fan-girl too much, can you develop a trauma for it?

454
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,810
Ever since I was a kid, I was scared of fire.

455
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,350
My Oppa Si Woo is the same.

456
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,620
Comprehensive Examination Notice

457
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,960
Your mouth looks like it's going to rip apart.

458
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:44,310
Didn't you sleep last night?

459
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:47,490
No, I'm fine.

460
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,900
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

461
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,370
Comprehensive Examination Notice

462
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:09,060
The exam is a potluck party?

463
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,950
Potluck? What's that?

464
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:17,980
Hah, you ignorant children. Of course, you guys who live in the middle of a forest wouldn't know.

465
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:22,910
To explain it simply, it's one of the casual parties enjoyed in foreign countries.

466
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:27,550
The main point of this party is that the people invited each bring one dish they made.

467
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:30,760
They freely eat and have fun.

468
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,430
A party makes me excited, but there will be various dishes?

469
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:37,250
Yeah!

470
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:41,260
But... Exactly how is this a test?

471
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,660
How could a party be a test?

472
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,190
A potluck party?

473
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:50,830
The Headmaster has given a very interesting comprehensive exam this time.

474
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:52,970
It's a perfect test.

475
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:56,270
Well, there hasn't been enough tests given on my cooking class.

476
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:58,710
This is a test on your class, Professor Kim Dae Ho?

477
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:02,080
Each of them must cook one dish, of course this is my test.

478
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,270
There's a saying that cooking is the oldest diplomatic step.

479
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,580
Of course!

480
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,750
By sharing foods, they naturally learn about their teammate's tastes

481
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,900
with consideration of the other cultures.

482
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,660
They also get to taste new food from other cultures that their friends bring.

483
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:21,080
Right. It's beneficial for both sides. It helps you respect different countries

484
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,760
and helps you understand different cultures.

485
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,140
They get to express their sincerity in order to win someone's heart.

486
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:31,260
The concept is good and the idea is good.

487
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,220
I don't think it's only cooking.

488
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,540
Since it's a party and I'm the one in charge of teaching manners, I should definitely

489
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,050
be checking their table manners and outfits, right?

490
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,380
Oh, killing two birds with one stone?

491
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:46,280
In Ghana, a party isn't really a party unless you catch a moose.

492
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,060
I can't wait to see what the kids prepare.

493
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,070
You never forget to tell a story about a moose, don't you?

494
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:59,210
It just reminded me of this humongous moose I caught when I was a kid.

495
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,640
Anyway, I'll leave first to prepare the party.

496
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:10,190
Professor Kim Dae Ho gives points for cooking and Professor Daniel gives points for manners.

497
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:15,790
Then, I'll...go to pick out my dress.

498
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:17,970
How short is it going to be—

499
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,330
Professor Yoo Di?

500
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,760
Hey, Yoo Di. Hey!

501
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,110
P-Professor!

502
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:27,380
I'm still eating...

503
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:33,310
Ah, seriously. Is giving points for manners only exclusive to students?

504
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:40,720
It's already noisy with the talk of the party.

505
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:48,220
By the way, won't their be a test on my class this time?

506
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,280
Ah, how could that be?

507
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,320
That's the most important hidden card.

508
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,570
Is it even a secret from me?

509
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:11,710
I'm confident in a party because that's my specialty.

510
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,850
Exactly why is he telling us to make food?

511
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:18,450
I'm confident in both.

512
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,790
That's mine.

513
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,700
China Boy, don't be petty.

514
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,000
What are you going to make?

515
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,370
Something tasty.

516
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,650
Is there a Chinese restaurant that delivers all the way out here?

517
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:50,090
Our Chi Ang is really picky.

518
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:52,930
I don't know if he will like it.

519
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,300
I'm really weak in things like parties.

520
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,640
- Same, I agree.
- What should I wear?

521
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,450
Same, I agree.

522
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:12,890
Exactly where do we have party clothes that he could give out a test like that?

523
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,670
Should we rip up some bags and make a skirt?

524
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:17,210
What is this...

525
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:21,440
Hey, hey, hey! The dressing room for the Manners class is open today.

526
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,670
Really?

527
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:27,250
I guess it's the Headmaster's intention for us to really have fun. Yes!

528
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,910
My dad did tell me that all I had to do at this comprehensive exam was have fun.

529
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,130
Could it have been real?

530
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:37,190
Then, we should go quickly and choose.

531
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,570
- Yes!
- Yes!

532
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,200
Yes, Ahjumma.

533
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,100
What is all of this?

534
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:55,350
Wang Chi Ang's Madam never even washed the dishes once,

535
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:59,740
but she personally made all of this to feed her son.

536
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,400
You should take it to him.

537
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,680
All of this?

538
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:10,050
Right? It's going to be really hard to move all of these, right?

539
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,480
So, we'll eat—

540
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:21,190
Ah, seriously! How is that one boy going to eat all of this?!

541
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:24,690
You're worrying about all sorts of things. I'm sure he'll share with the other students,

542
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:29,020
and she stayed up all night to feed the kids who are having a difficult time because of their studies. Why would you and I eat this?

543
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:33,370
Seriously, you have a talent in making people look petty.

544
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:37,490
Fine, give all of this to him!

545
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:41,070
Just deliver the food and come straight out and you, tell the Madam that

546
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:42,800
this is the last time you're going to do a favor like this.

547
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,350
Why do you keep making the child go into that Moorim School or whatever?

548
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,730
Soon Deok, you! Don't even go anywhere near Moorim School!

549
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,360
Yes!

550
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,510
I'll just deliver this and go to my academy.

551
00:49:55,510 --> 00:50:01,320
♫ I can't sleep, oh oh. ♫

552
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,200
♫ Why do I feel so uneasy ♫

553
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,390
There's a place like this in a school?

554
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:10,770
This school is so peculiar.

555
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:15,250
Still, this is really lacking compared to my dressing room.

556
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:19,690
True masters never blame their weapons.

557
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,950
We'll see who's the real master.

558
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:28,680
♫ Even if I close my eyes I can see you clearly.
What's going on? ♫

559
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,040
♫ Everything is foolish ♫

560
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,260
Where's the dress I marked as mine?

561
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,780
Oh, it's here!

562
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:40,080
I'm going to look like Tinkerbell.

563
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,140
No, no, no. Put that down at once!

564
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,770
Why?

565
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,540
Is it weird?

566
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:52,150
- Is it weird?
-It's really weird. It's literally flowing with cheapness.

567
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,230
Really?

568
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:57,560
Since I received your help with the exam, just leave this to me.

569
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:03,730
My fashion sense is amazing. I'll pick out your outfit.

570
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:04,610
Okay.

571
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:06,620
Let's see...

572
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:12,930
What fits you?

573
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:21,180
♬ Why are you always caught in my heart? ♬ I can't leave♬

574
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,770
♬ I want to remember everything.♬

575
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:31,500
♬ Unlike myself ♬ I'm always drawn to you♬

576
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,770
♬ I don't even know if this is love
♬ Because I tremble if I see only you♬

577
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:39,790
To Soon Deok

578
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:45,720
♬ Telling you telling you 
♬ Because you know this is how I feel ♬

579
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:51,000
After that fire happened, the corpses of the children were not discovered.

580
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:56,920
The corpse was your wife. It was a Korean person.

581
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:06,310
If your life energy wasn't that high, you wouldn't have survived all this time.

582
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:14,360
I have to find the children.

583
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:27,580
We are currently searching for your children, so recovering your health is a priority.

584
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:53,790
Joon, Yeong.

585
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:57,030
Where on earth are you?

586
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:13,940
Decorating it like this makes it feel like an actual party.

587
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,530
I know right. This feels like an European school dance party.

588
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:20,740
I think everything is set now. Shall we open the doors?

589
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,650
I understand.

590
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:30,970
♬ Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Vixxx world. ♬

00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,180

Dressed up that way, they look like different people.
♬  Here in crazy Neverland I'm Peter Pan. ♬

596
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:47,920

Not everyone can look good in that outfit. It suits you because you're you, Hwang Seon Ah.

Don't say anything today. I'm already embarrassed to death right now.

626
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:26,960
How did you pick such a pretty dress?

627
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,880
Wow, my Ariel... I didn't know you had this side to you.

628
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:36,550
Weren't you the one who put the dress in my room?

Shannon, you just fried a chicken whole. Won't it be difficult to share?

641
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:22,820
I don't share my whole chicken with anybody else.

642
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:34,640
Wang Chi Ang, you're saying that you made this?

643
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,000
Yep.

644
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,770
It's not easy to make this kind of taste. How'd you do it?

645
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:46,480
Excuse me? Ah, I don't know.

646
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:51,600
MSG... is not it.

647
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,230
Sugar... is not it either.

648
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,680
You can just say it's my secret recipe.

649
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,920
You didn't make this personally.

650
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,490
Of course.

651
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:10,210
Anyway, Madam Kang's skills are a problem. What is she telling me to do if she makes it obvious it's homemade?

652
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:13,440
Sim Soon Deok, mugwort rice cakes are quite unexpected at a party.

653
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,030
These mugwort rice cakes are perfect to recharge life energy.

654
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:21,800
I didn't think that there was a food as great as this for the Moorim School students.

655
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,060
I even personally dug up the mugwort

656
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:29,140
and I even made the sweet rice myself. It's 100% handmade.

657
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:33,580
I heard it was good for the hearing...

658
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:42,930
Really? I didn't know.

659
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:48,440
A food like this gives off the best taste when you make it thinking of someone.

660
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:53,200
If you wish for the person to be healthy when eating this,

661
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,300
that sincerity releases good energy in the food.

662
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:02,420
I know right. I think that this one is the tastiest.

663
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,280
Thank you!

664
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:10,130
For a party, aren't you guys standing too stiffly, as if you're being punished?

665
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:13,320
Professor Kim Dae Ho, please finish up here.

666
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:17,100
Yes. The cooking taste-testing is over.

667
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:32,580
You guys are all champions!

668
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,370
Should I test my skills?

669
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:35,310
Sounds good.

670
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,730
Woo!

671
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:53,140
How am I supposed to grade them?

672
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:01,470
Did you make that rice cake because of me?

673
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:05,680
No! Mugwort is good for various parts of the body!

674
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,290
So tacky, what's with mugwort rice cake?

675
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,690
Ah, go, go.

676
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,590
Are all of the scores totaled up?

677
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:42,350
Expect for Go Sang Man's white socks, there's nothing to complain about in points in manners.

678
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:47,810
For now, the students' scores have been set but it's a problem because there are so many ties.

679
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:55,180
Yes, Seon Ah and Yeop Jeong tied during the sparring but Soon Deok received many points in the cooking. The 3 of them are tied.

680
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:59,720
Si Woo, Chi Ang and Choi Ho also have the same score.

681
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,000
Why did Choi Ho's score fall so low?

682
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,260
Choi Ho didn't do badly, it's just that Yoon Shi Woo and Wang Chi Ang did that well.

683
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,810
Now, what are you planning to do?

684
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:15,250
In your class, there were two students who shared the same trauma.

685
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,970
The same trauma?

686
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:25,350
This champagne is a special present for just this table.

687
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:28,290
The exams are over so I'm so happy!

688
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:30,680
You're only giving this to our table?

689
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,130
Probably because you two got the highest score.

690
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,720
Then, cheers!

691
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,490
Cheers!

692
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:52,630
You're doing that as your last test?

693
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:56,840
Is it okay to change it so suddenly?

694
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:01,740
It'll still be too much of a stretch for Yoon Si Woo and Wang Chi Ang.

695
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:07,510
They have mentors. Let's watch over them.

696
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:14,090
Alright, let's leave.

697
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:19,530
Why is it already a finished party? I'm just starting though.

698
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:24,530
If your stamina is this weak, do you think you can handle me, Choi Ho?

699
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:28,470
I know right, everyone's leaving.

700
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:34,910
But... What kind of alcohol is this that I'm getting completely drunk?

701
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:37,440
Oh my, oh my, oh my.

702
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:45,060
What's in there? This is a plant root.

703
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,940
A plant root?

704
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:53,060
Yeah, this is something like that bloodwort Xin Shi Wang used to brew and drink

705
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:58,700
and it's the best for...insomnia.

706
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,540
Hey, Sim Soon Deok.

707
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:09,690
You really fall asleep easily anywhere...

708
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,300
What is this?

709
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:43,500
What happened?

710
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:50,300
Hey, Sim Soon Deok, are you okay? Hey, Wang Chi Ang!

711
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:54,990
What is this? Did I fall asleep?!

712
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,890
Why am I here?

713
01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:03,840
Omo! It must have been that drink! But, why would the teacher give us something like that?

714
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,830
Something feels strange.

715
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:12,890
It's locked.

716
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:16,910
What is this? Why did they put us here?

717
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:19,310
The test isn't over!

718
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:29,940
What is this!
