1
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,360
This punk.

2
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,150
Just a little more...

3
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,660
Wang Chi Ang... Wang Chi Ang!

4
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,940
Soon Deok!

5
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,610
Sim Soon Deok.

6
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,510
♫ Yeah I'm alive,♫

7
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,130
Are you okay? Are you hurt?
♬  Look straight at me.
For dozens of times I will get up once again. ♬

8
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:29,440
♬  Yeah I am alive.Watch me.
Now close both eyes and feel me ♬

9
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,880
That's a relief.

10
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,540
It's truly lucky.

11
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,010
♫ Yeah I'm alive. ♫

12
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,900
Wang Chi Ang!

13
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,980
It seems like Soon Deok changed clothes with Seon ah. Soon Deok is fine, but

14
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,600
Chi Ang is having surgery.

15
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,050
Hwang Seon Ah!

16
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,110
You're okay, right?

17
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,970
Yeah. What about Chi Ang?

18
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,890
What happened?

19
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,650
He lost a lot of blood...

20
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,040
He's having surgery right now.

21
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,440
Moorim School
- Episode 9 -

22
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,390
How can you do work like this? Just hide until everything calms down.

23
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,070
Perhaps it's good that it happened.

24
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,380
Definitely. Because Chi Ang was hurt,

25
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,910
they probably won't think it was we who did it.

26
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,860
There was a lot of blood loss, but due to a friend's quick help (who stopped the blood), we passed the critical stage.

27
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,560
For now, it's great for him to just rest.

28
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,500
Thank you.

29
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,890
What kind of person would do this?

30
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,790
Let's all think it's a relief that everyone is fine.

31
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:03,870
These people definitely knew about Seon Ah.

32
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,020
By chance, do you have any suspicions?

33
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:17,620
But, there was a reason why my dad didn't allow me to leave the hotel.

34
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,660
Anyway, all the other children should go back to the school. This is the headmaster's order.

35
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,400
Teacher Yoo Di, you'll stay with Chi Ang.

36
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,330
No, I'll stay with him. I am ashamed to see the Headmaster.

37
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,740
I'll stay here as well.

38
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,500
Because of me, Chi Ang got hurt. I'll take care of him.

39
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:48,340
It's not your fault. They thought you were me, so it's my fault.

40
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,210
So I'll take care of him.

41
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,800
If it was like that, it's even less okay for you to stay here.

42
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,620
Alright. First, Sam and Soon Deok will stay here.

43
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,510
- Okay.
- Yes.

44
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,830
Let's not make rash decisions.

45
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:12,380
To be honest, while I was being held hostage, I heard something strange.

46
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,710
What about the kid? Should I take her to that person?

47
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,980
"That person"?

48
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,310
"Person"?

49
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,340
They definitely said "that person."

50
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,090
Do you have any suspicions?

51
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,830
No... None at all.

52
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,040
About this issue, I think the headmaster is suspicious.

53
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,770
What?

54
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,910
Just like the exams, the field trip was a mission. Chi Ang was injured.

55
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,810
And who is Chi Ang? He's the son of the school's sponsor.

56
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,470
So because the problem might get bigger, they are trying to blame someone else?

57
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,860
There you go!

58
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,440
If the sponsorship is gone, there is no more Moorim,

59
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,040
so they are trying their best to cover this problem—

60
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,180
Hey!

61
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,520
Yeah, the headmaster is not such a coward?

62
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,170
Yes. Why does that make no sense? Yeop Jeong, what do you think?

63
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,700
Stop making assumptions. Why don't you use this time to practice instead?

64
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,480
Have you already forgotten what happened to you?

65
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,190
The school is in chaos! Can I even practice?

66
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,380
You have been in Moorim Institute for three years and you can't even handle those jerks.

67
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,850
He's starting again.

68
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,780
Didn't you enter Moorim because you didn't want to be bullied anymore?

69
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,370
But then, what changed between then and now?

70
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,130
Back then I... didn't want any trouble...

71
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm sure you are embarrassed.

72
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,450
While letting them see how you have not changed being weak and useless and then letting us find out about your past.

73
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,850
Me too, I would be embarrassed.

74
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,280
Hey! Yeop Jeong!

75
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,540
Anyway, amateurs like you won't even think about such things.

76
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,510
Ahoo, this jerk.

77
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,790
Yeob Jeong was dissing you, but I sure am upset.

78
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,750
What are those? Aren't those Seon Ah's?

79
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:43,230
Seon Ah received the order from the headmaster not to leave, so I'm pretending to be Seon Ah.

80
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,790
Do you know who it could be?

81
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,540
They definitely talked about "that person".

82
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:02,040
Moorim is facing a serious situation.

83
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,150
A board meeting will surely start soon.

84
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,630
Prof. Beop Gong, the only people who knew that the kids left school,

85
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,280
are me, the teachers, the students,

86
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:22,220
and Chairman Wang Hao who was sponsoring us.

87
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:29,080
The culprit has to be one of these people.

88
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,540
But rather than asking who did this,

89
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,010
I'd rather first ask myself why.

90
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,090
If, perhaps, you share my perspective,

91
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,810
don't you think we'll find the culprit who caused this faster?

92
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,020
I do not want to suspect anyone from Moorim.

93
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,220
Sometimes an enemy

94
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,600
can hide in a very close place.

95
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,010
Just like how eighteen years ago,

96
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,730
when Chae Yoon's family was attacked,

97
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,570
some people suspected you were part of the destructive force.

98
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,510
But I believed you until this day, and here we are.

99
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,220
That has not changed.

100
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,860
However,

101
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,330
I do have some unresolved suspicions

102
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,340
regarding Seon Ah.

103
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,950
- About that...
- You said you would tell me when the time was right.

104
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:50,100
Has that time not come yet?

105
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,620
As you have said,

106
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,960
the enemy might be in the closest spot.

107
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,910
Please find out more details about Chairman Wang Hao.

108
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,890
Yes.

109
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,490
Oh, are you up?

110
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,480
She stayed up all night nursing you.

111
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,630
How is it? Pretty right?

112
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,440
She is pretty.

113
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,360
Si Woo just called. He asked if you were okay.

114
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,860
I'm fine.

115
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,940
I find you quite burdensome.

116
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,420
Receiving this kind of help from you

117
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,610
I hope this is the last time.

118
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,870
I'm sorry.

119
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,880
Have I done something burdensome again?

120
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,350
Wang Chi Ang!

121
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,020
- Are you up?
- Can you walk alright?

122
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,760
Doesn't your head hurt?

123
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,950
Don't worry, I won't die.

124
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,470
Why are you looking at me like that?

125
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,760
I'm Wang Chi Ang! Of course, I'm okay.

126
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,390
Hey, Sim Soon Deok.

127
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,910
Stupid.

128
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,150
You couldn't avoid that

129
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,090
even now that you're in Moorim's advanced class?

130
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,310
Well, why couldn't you just avoid

131
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,030
getting kidnapped by those guys?

132
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,790
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

133
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,690
Can't you stop apologizing already?

134
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,430
I really am sorry.

135
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,190
As long as you are safe, I'm good.

136
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,490
That is enough for me.

137
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,320
They say Chi Ang can be transferred to a hospital closer to us in about a week.

138
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,260
Did the police call?

139
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,390
They don't know where to start.

140
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,890
Since the hotel supervisors were persuaded too,

141
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,400
it looks like it will be hard to find them.

142
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,960
Will the headmaster just keep silent?

143
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:23,000
- Maybe if he could explain to us...
- There must be

144
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,350
some kind of meaning to this.

145
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,010
Let's learn the art of hapkido self-defense.

146
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:37,360
How should we defend ourselves when suddenly attacked?

147
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,200
Let us demonstrate.

148
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,660
The situation must be serious.

149
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,000
I know right. All of the professors are taking part.

150
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Don't tremble. To use this technique in real-life situations,

151
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,440
the body must respond first.

152
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,950
- Are you alright?
- Yes, it's fine.

153
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,060
Professor.

154
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,540
What should I do to advance to the higher class before finals?

155
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,910
I don't think there is a way to do it before the finals.

156
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,620
Seeing your speed of development,

157
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,120
I think even advancing after the finals would be a stretch.

158
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,480
Please get a grip.

159
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,730
- How's Chi Ang?
- He's good now.

160
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,100
He's eating well

161
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,750
and just acting like the normal Wang Chi Ang.

162
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,990
- When are you coming?
- Tomorrow.

163
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,840
He'll be alright after he rests at his mother's house and takes some medicine.

164
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,430
- My son! Chi Ang! Chi Ang!

165
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,050
- I'm hanging up. Hello, Madam.

166
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,880
Student Soon Deok? How's my Chi Ang?

167
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,960
Are you really alright?

168
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,930
I perfectly protected my handsome face. I'm doing great.

169
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,910
What kind of school only contacts me now after my son's wound up like this?

170
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,150
I told them not to call you.

171
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,950
Look at yourself. You're overreacting like this again.

172
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,700
But what happened?

173
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,590
Your professors said you were trying to save a friend.

174
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,370
I am so sorry to interrupt,

175
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,440
but since it's a slight injury, you shouldn't worry.

176
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,570
Who are you?

177
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,470
I am the security guard responsible for the safety of Moorim students.

178
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,470
As the school's representative, I would like to extend our profound and sincere apologies.

179
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,530
Well,

180
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:55,140
what kind of a school has its headmaster hide away and sends the security guard?

181
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,340
- Mom...
- I should've looked better into this weird school your father wanted to send you to.

182
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,860
You are quitting this school and coming home right now!

183
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,220
Mom, stop it. You're embarrassing me.

184
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,630
But, Student Soon Deok, have you been here all this time?

185
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,100
Bang Deok called.

186
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,820
- What?
- Your dad caused a ruckus on the cruise. He wanted to turn the ship back.

187
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,230
What?

188
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:28,820
How can someone stop in the middle of a cruise because their daughter hasn't called?

189
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,500
I even had bad dreams. I worried so much, so how could I endure that?

190
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:38,560
But how could it be so bad for you to yell at them to turn the boat around in the middle of the Pacific?

191
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,600
Do you think it was some kind of bus?

192
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,620
Stop being so loud and call Soon Deok again.

193
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,200
What is the use in calling again and again?

194
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,720
Huh? This damn girl...

195
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,600
- Hey? Why won't you just answer your phone?
- Give me that...

196
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,570
Hello? Oh, oh...

197
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,350
I lost my phone, but now I found it. Sorry.

198
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,390
Are you alright?

199
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,580
Dad, what are you talking about?

200
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,620
I'm having so much fun right now.

201
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,160
Really? That's a relief.

202
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,620
What? Pfft, relief...

203
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,850
Nothing's wrong, so don't worry and have fun sightseeing.

204
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,910
Okay, okay. I'll have lots of fun too,

205
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,260
so you be careful too.

206
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,800
Having fun, my foot.

207
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,970
Where are you going now?

208
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,770
I want to feel the sea breeze some more.

209
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,560
I'm going to borrow that boat from Mr. Kim.

210
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,550
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

211
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,840
Wait... How annoying.

212
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,440
The sun will set soon!

213
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,120
Well, what would we do in the middle of the sea?

214
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,420
How romantic!

215
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,860
You won't even tell me?

216
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,380
Why so formal? It doesn't suit you.

217
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,560
Wasn't the restriction order on going out because of this?

218
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,250
You knew in advance

219
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:40,620
there was a possibility that something bad could happen to me.

220
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,460
You've always had a lot of secrets.

221
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,140
Things about Mom... and the reason why I'm afraid of fire.

222
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,300
You were always worried that something would happen if I ever went out of the school.

223
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:03,320
Tell me. Who in the world wanted to kidnap me?

224
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:20,830
Everyone has a burden they have to carry.

225
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,960
To someone that could be responsibility.

226
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,820
To another, it could be a past that can't be turned back.

227
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,540
To another, it could be a relationship between people.

228
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,890
Like the amount I can't take on , are you saying that your secret is heavy?

229
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,010
No,

230
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,670
You'll be able to endure it

231
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,290
because you're my brave daughter.

232
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:13,390
But, what I carry, I do not want you to take on that baggage.

233
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,410
What you have as a secret, which one of them is it?

234
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:24,610
Responsibility, the past... or

235
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,230
Is it about the relationship between us?

236
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,170
If you can't bear this by yourself anymore, tell me.

237
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,990
I'll be able to do as much as you can. Just like you said, I'm your daughter.

238
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:08,140
Looks like this powerful energy you're unable to control is inside your body.

239
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,900
If you can't overcome this energy by yourself

240
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,980
the pain might never go away.

241
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,220
I heard that 18 years ago, there was a destructive force member in the Moorim Association.

242
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,930
What do you mean? A lone martial artist?

243
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,940
Yes.

244
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,540
Someone saw a man leaving with a young child.

245
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,220
What did the person look like?

246
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:49,920
No, which child did he hold? Boy or girl?

247
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,600
I have not found out to that extent.

248
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,680
Do you know if this witness maybe

249
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,960
saw Hwang Moo Song?

250
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:40,740
Let's go! Let's go!

251
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,210
As expected, it was you.

252
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,730
Oh?

253
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,010
You're here to play the lullaby?

254
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,610
Yeah.

255
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,420
You knew that I was the one playing the piano?

256
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,640
Why weren't you playing?

257
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,400
Just because... I didn't have the energy to do it.

258
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,250
Why aren't you sleeping?

259
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,490
Maybe it's because I haven't heard the piano playing,

260
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,230
or because I have no one who is constantly chattering away,

261
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,600
I can't sleep.

262
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,100
Was it Brahms?

263
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:54,420
Yeah. It's a lullaby my mother sang to me often when I was little.

264
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,750
Although I haven't told my father that I remember it,

265
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,270
I recall it sometimes.

266
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,700
To be honest, this is the only thing I know how to play on the piano.

267
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,640
What's wrong?

268
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,960
Me, too...

269
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,580
You too what?

270
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:32,810
I probably would have liked having such childhood memory.

271
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,240
Oh! Hey, where are you going?

272
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,430
I feel confined. I can walk by myself.

273
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,450
Hold my arm. You can still be dizzy.

274
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,460
When I'm dizzy, I'm going to fall into your arms. Is that okay?

275
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,560
Yeah, it's better than your head falling onto the floor.

276
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:22,440
Are you feeling sad for me now? You pity me? Are you showing compassion?

277
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,160
"You got hurt because of me, I'll take it all." Is that it?

278
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,720
I'll let you help me when I'm in physical pain, but what are you going to do about my emotional pain?

279
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,600
This wound is much deeper.

280
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,630
Hey, this...

281
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,200
I can take a walk alone.

282
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,800
Is it going well? Hurry up and come back to your bed.

283
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,660
♬ The countless tears which flowed past me ♬

284
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:11,550
♬ were like the end of unknown darkness ♬

285
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,400
♬ Both when I take another step ♬

286
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,450
♫ and let out a long sigh

287
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,010
For the first time in my life, I thought I had a friend.

288
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,990
♫ where does that road end? ♫

289
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,750
This is what I thought.

290
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,160
Sorry.

291
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,600
I don't want to hear this.
♬  Goodbye, goodbye this word. To me ♬

292
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,770
♬  Goodbye, please don't say goodbye. ♬

293
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,810
Are you okay?

294
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:44,440
You say you woke up. Let's see each other soon.
♬  Baby, it looks like I was young then.  ♬

295
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,960
♬  Baby, it looks like I was a coward then,  ♬

296
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,600
♬ I knew just a connection was there ♬

297
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,310
♬ I thought I could just reach out to you ♬

298
00:28:55,310 --> 00:29:01,140
♬  Goodbye, please don't say goodbye. ♬

299
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,430
That's believing a delusion.

300
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,310
Get your head straight, Hwang Seon Ah!

301
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,630
I'm coming back home today! Expect a lot!

302
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:28,250
Yoon Si Woo! Soon Deok and Chi Wang are coming back today.

303
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,660
- Really?
- Yeah.

304
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,570
Hey...

305
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,560
Slowly, careful, careful!

306
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,590
Omona, omona. You're here?

307
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,520
I told you I was okay. I'll go back to school.

308
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,660
You want to see me die?

309
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,580
Yeah, even for a few days, just stay here. I'll visit often.

310
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:55,300
Omona, your face got so much smaller!

311
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,620
I'll make a very special dish for you!

312
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,210
Let's have lunch.

313
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,340
Careful, careful...

314
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,650
Are you waiting for your friends?

315
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:46,760
I feel safe in this school, weirdly enough.

316
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:56,340
I feel like the barrier isn't restraining me, but protecting me.

317
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:02,340
I wish they would just come back faster.

318
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,560
I was hesitating in saying this,

319
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,930
but when Soon Deok was kidnapped, I met a man.

320
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:24,980
My head and ears hurt like they haven't in a long while, but that man just showed up and healed me.

321
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,010
With the method like yours.

322
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:32,970
I asked him if he was from the Moorim Association, but even before hearing the answer,

323
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,160
he disappeared.

324
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,630
Could he have a part this incident?

325
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:45,550
Can you describe what he looked like?

326
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,920
What is wrong?

327
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,880
I went to find the Moorim School, but I couldn't even locate the barrier.

328
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,210
Where are you?

329
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,440
Are you the one who was looking for me?

330
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,920
I'll get back to you.

331
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:38,150
Eighteen years ago... Ah, when the Moorim successor died.

332
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:42,150
I heard that, back then, Geo Ji was involved in this.

333
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:47,510
That is true. But those involved in the affair were obliterated by the destructive force.

334
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,810
The five other members left, fearing for their lives.

335
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:57,280
You know them and how they love to talk.

336
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:04,530
Does anyone from those who are now scattered know more about the incident in detail?

337
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:08,570
Now that I think of it, there is this man.

338
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:15,330
I don't know much about him, but there is someone who was watching everything from a distance.

339
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,720
Soon Deok's mother...

340
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,950
How can you leave your kid with someone else?

341
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,570
What will you solve by drinking all day?

342
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,710
Just give me more drinks!

343
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,490
It's been ten days since your wife died.

344
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:46,320
You should think of Soon Deok and get back on your feet.

345
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,580
Here come these guys again. What do you want?

346
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,840
We'll just have the usual.

347
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,730
By the way, why is the destructive force gathering its people?

348
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:06,400
So what, huh? We'll just go with the flow and make money.

349
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,400
If it goes well, they'll be giving so much money.

350
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,850
What do you mean, go well?

351
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:17,220
I hear they want to steal the key to Cheon Ui Joo.

352
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,190
Cheon Ui Joo? What's that?

353
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,240
If you have that, you gain all the strength in the world.

354
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,700
What kind of nonsense is that?

355
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,900
It's true!

356
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,200
There have always been earthquakes, plagues, flooding, and

357
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,200
a lot of people suffered a painful death.

358
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,500
It's all because of the owner of Cheon Ui Joo.

359
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,660
After getting it, I've heard people

360
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,120
can become invincible or even immortal.

361
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,700
Should we just sneak and take it?

362
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,660
Hey, do you think they're so easy?

363
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:53,650
But the one from Moorim who has it shouldn't be easy either...

364
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,840
Cheon Ui Joo?

365
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,660
What's that?

366
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,060
What are they doing?

367
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:24,380
What do they want to do with the Cheon Ui Joo? I should just go home...

368
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,210
No.

369
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:37,450
If only I can get it, my Soon Deok will never have to suffer.

370
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,380
Who are you?

371
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,790
Where's the Cheon Ui Joo?

372
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,190
Look around.

373
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,780
Go find it!

374
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:27,400
I have found the key to the Cheon Ui Joo. But it's only a part.

375
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:34,000
If you're hiding it, I will kill you.

376
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,190
I swear it's only this one part.

377
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:44,650
No one leaves until we find the entire thing. Find it!

378
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,240
Hey!

379
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,300
Mommy, Mommy!

380
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,420
Come on, kid.

381
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,410
What is this?

382
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,730
Mommy!

383
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:54,750
Oh my... stop crying, stop crying!

384
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,810
It's all in the past, all in the past...

385
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,180
You startled me.

386
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:27,830
Sim Soon Deok! You returned from Seoul a while ago but you're only coming now?

387
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:31,910
I had to stop by my place and had to work too.

388
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,670
Were you waiting for me?

389
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,410
"Were you waiting for me?"

390
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,130
You weren't? Haha...

391
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,310
Yes, yes I was.

392
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,390
Have you eaten anything?

393
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,220
♬  Today  ♬

394
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:14,830
I knew it. I told you not to skip meals.

395
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,040
I haven't.

396
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,680
I'm just hungry again.

397
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:28,630
Wow.

398
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,820
It's good!

399
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,800
Don't forget the rice! And the vegetables are tasty too.

400
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,630

00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,190
I already ate.

404
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:50,450
Two bowls.

407
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,290
Drink some water while you eat.

00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:04,710
Eat a lot.

♬  You are my love  ♬

415
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,330
I got scared.

00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:41,490
♬  You don't have to say it, you can just embrace me  ♬

417

I was scared I might not see you again

418
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,590
Yoon Si Woo.

419
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,400
Don't disappear from now on.

420
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,850
Don't

♬  My days pass so easily  ♬

422

♬  The love I've learned  ♬

424
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,240
Why are you looking at me like you would a stranger?

425
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,490
How long have you been standing there?

426
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:52,990
What are you thinking about so deeply that you don't even notice when people sit in front of you?

427
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,950
Isn't it obvious?

428
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,750
Thinking of me?

429
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:00,170
That's crazy talk.

430
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:03,650
So it's not that.

431
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,580
I was thinking of a really interesting story.

432
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,420
Want to hear?

433
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:15,860
Your sense of humor is very different from mine.

434
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,340
I'll listen for now.

435
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,620
Once upon a time,

436
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:24,580
like, in the eighteenth century,

437
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,420
there was this German guy called Schumann.

438
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:30,720
- What kind of a story is this?
- Will you listen or not?

439
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,500
That guy got a story book from his dad when he was little.

440
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,500
A story about a golden treasure which burned in a fire.

441
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,980
The kid actually thought the treasure was real

442
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:47,540
and promised himself he'd find it one day.

443
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,450
It was only a short while, but

444
00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:01,510
That man's eyes looked very sad.

445
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,300
Have you looked into it?

446
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:14,780
Yes. There's nothing in the records of our owning ONP Holdings.

447
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,570
That can't be. I clearly remember it.

448
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,750
You must have been mistaken.

449
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,650
But why are you asking?

450
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,280
It's nothing. I must have really been mistaken.

451
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,840
Thank you, Secretary Jang.

452
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,740
When he grew up, he became a very rich businessman

453
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:49,320
He wanted to see the world that he imagined in that story

454
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,920
and decided to go find the treasure.

455
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,000
He held on to that even as an adult? Jesus.

456
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,840
They all said he was crazy.

457
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,860
That it was just an absurd, fictional story.

458
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,940
But then? Did he really find it?

459
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,060
What do you think?

460
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,980
There really was a golden treasure?

461
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,940
No one had seen it in real life.

462
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:15,800
They all thought it was just a legend, but he found it.

463
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,850
A golden crown, golden chalices, et cetera et cetera.

464
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,850
All the things you'd like too, in abundance.

465
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,140
That doesn't make sense.

466
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,620
What doesn't make sense?

467
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:29,310
The thing Schumann found, and now the whole world knows,

468
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,290
are the Trojan artifacts.

469
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:37,730
Wait a minute. Wasn't that so-called Schumann Schliemann? Heinrich Schliemann?

470
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,040
That's why this...

471
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:47,380
Look at this. If ask you to look at the moon the only thing you'll look at will be the dirt under my nails.

472
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,360
I am talking about the Cheon Ui Joo now. The Cheon Ui Joo.

473
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,980
Oh, the Cheon Ui Joo that lets you rule the world?

474
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,660
Even when you were in school you always said you'd find it and went to Moorim Peak and stuff.

475
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,830
Have you still not given up?

476
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:16,130
ONP Holdings.

477
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,850
How will I remember all of this?

478
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:27,710
Even if you don't join management right now, you should at least remember our affiliates, right?

479
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:29,990
ONP Holdings?

480
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,780
Why do they suddenly want a deal with us?

481
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,440
You don't have to be concerned with that.

482
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,100
It's a paper company.

483
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:45,260
What is the CEO thinking about that he sent up a ghost company.

484
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,790
So annoying.

485
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,250
It certainly was there.

486
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:57,260
Certainly. They're hiding something from me.

487
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,720
Could my father have something to do with Soon Deok's kidnapping?

488
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:11,970
Son, it's time to take your medicine.

489
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:23,800
Mom. When my dad told you to send me to Moorim School, didn't he mention anything else?

490
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,920
Something else? What?

491
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,780
Nothing. My dad visited recently, didn't he?

492
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:37,200
I thought he'd be staying for a while, but he left because something came up at the head office.

493
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,590
I heard things aren't good at the company. The rumors must be true.

494
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:46,510
But, why are you asking?

495
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,370
No, it's nothing.

496
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,090
Here.

497
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,720
It's a child called Hwang Seon Ah.

498
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:05,810
If it's certain that she is Chae Yoon's daughter, Chae Yeong...

499
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:09,250
Chae Yoon's lost key

500
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:14,470
is very likely to be with her.

501
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:24,060
I heard you have one of the pieces to the key.

502
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:31,520
I do have some suspicions regarding Seon Ah.

503
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:37,100
- About that...
- Is it still not time?

504
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:43,660
As you said, the enemy can hide in the closest places.

505
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,360
How long were you guys here?

506
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,140
Since a little while ago.

507
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,220
What brings you here at this hour?

508
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,040
Haven't you seen anyone suspicious around here?

509
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,000
A suspicious person?

510
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,920
Is something wrong?

511
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,180
Oh, Professor.

512
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,360
What's going on?

513
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,120
Nothing bad happened to you two, right?

514
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:02,080
No, nothing really happened.

515
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:05,870
Is it morning?

516
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:07,930
Nothing happened, right?

517
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,720
We're only bothered you came at this hour.

518
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,920
Hello.

519
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,920
I thought I'd sleep in my room, but I came here to borrow something,

520
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,250
and I just fell asleep.

521
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,560
What the heck?

522
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:36,210
Professor.

523
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,210
I got it. Go back to sleep.

524
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,990
All right, go on to sleep.

525
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,130
What's going on?

526
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:51,630
What is all this?

527
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:16,870
What's going on?

528
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:19,370
Who did this to the Headmaster's office?

529
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:33,190
Has the barrier been broken?

530
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:40,090
As if kidnapping a student wasn't enough, now someone wants to harm the headmaster?

531
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:43,210
This is not an ordinary situation.

532
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:53,390
Even as this continues, are you going to keep your mouth shut about the key, Headmaster Hwang Moo Song?

533
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:06,170
The key! The key to Cheon Ui Joo!

534
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:39,740
So to sum it up, the rumors about Cheon Ui Joo are actually true?

535
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:45,470
Not only that. If we're to believe Prof. Beop Gong, the headmaster has the key to it.

536
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,710
Oh my God.

537
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:52,200
It was unusual that he cared for the school this much. Now the answer is coming out.

538
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,200
Hwang Seon Ah, don't you know anything?

539
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:05,000
Hwang Seon Ah, wouldn't you telling us about it correctly be faster?

540
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:07,910
I'm hearing it for the first time.

541
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:10,930
Does it make sense that the headmaster's daughter doesn't know about it?

542
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:14,990
All this time weren't you working how to take over the chairman's (headmaster's) place?

543
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:17,610
That's right. Weren't you going to become the successor?

544
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:20,960
It's not that. I just...

545
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,230
You're really pathetic.

546
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:28,830
What about you? Have you known all about the Cheon Ui Joo?

547
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:38,230
Listen up carefully. This is the difference between me and you guys.

548
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:42,590
Yeop Jeong, if there's anything you know, say it. Don't beat around the bush.

549
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:53,150
That was not something to be brought up in front of the children.

550
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:58,870
It was going to be known by everybody someday.

551
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:05,530
The barrier has certainly not been broken. It isn't an outside force.

552
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:10,350
Then that means it was an inside job.

553
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,280
Isn't that worse?

554
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:19,800
As expected... to find the Cheon Ui Joo...

555
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:26,530
Professor Beop Gong. We cannot know if the Cheon Ui Joo was their goal.

556
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:28,830
Do not make reckless assumptions.

557
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:37,400
The voice of doubt, claiming that eighteen years ago

558
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,610
you were the one who stole the key from Chae Yoon, is ever stronger.

559
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:46,730
Of course, you wouldn't have...

560
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:48,780
Please stop!

561
00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:04,470
Professor Beop Gong, weren't you one who wasn't swayed by unfounded rumors?

562
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:13,250
I am only saying that if you have one part of the key to the Cheon Ui Joo,

563
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:19,370
I would like to help you find the others as well.

564
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,990
Do you really not have it?

565
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:44,560
So the Cheon Ui Joo that gives you all the power in the world really existed.

566
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,730
To think that the key was with the Headmaster.

567
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:51,530
It isn't guaranteed that the headmaster has the key.

568
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:57,020
What is with that key? Why is it so important that the headmaster's office was ransacked?

569
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:04,320
Eighteen years ago, the Moorim Association was assaulted by the destructive force.

570
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,770
Assault?

571
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:12,310
The victims were the Moorim representative guarding the key and his family.

572
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:19,250
But something happened that night, and the key just disappeared.

573
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,970
So then, the destructive force took it?

574
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:25,030
What's the destructive force?

575
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:29,310
It's an organization within Moorim.

576
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:33,410
Instead of protecting the Cheon Ui Joo, they intended to use it for selfish purposes.

577
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:38,090
It seems like their true identity has yet to be revealed.

578
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:43,210
Then, if the missing key is with the headmaster,

579
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:46,960
the headmaster is...

580
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:57,910
The man who died then was the headmaster's best friend.

581
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,890
Within the family there were young children too.

582
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:05,130
There's no way... The headmaster isn't someone who would do that.

583
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:09,210
That's how the rumors go.

584
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:13,270
But if the key to the Cheon Ui Joo is in this school...

585
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:19,270
The rumor would then be true.

586
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:36,050
If the destructive force wants to terrorize us,

587
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:39,890
shouldn't we do something about it?

588
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:43,570
This isn't something we can just cover up, Headmaster!

589
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:49,690
The students should be informed and well prepared.

590
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:54,530
I have an idea.

591
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,520
Are you sleeping?

592
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,840
No.

593
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:21,030
The thing is...

594
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,970
Let's sleep.

595
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:28,450
Okay. Sleep tight.

596
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:49,010
Headmaster.

597
00:59:54,090 --> 01:00:00,620
Everyone is very confused. Of course, I am too.

598
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:09,330
I was about your age when I heard about the Cheon Ui Joo.

599
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:16,210
Do you really have it?

600
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,090
Better than saying that I have it,

601
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:29,050
this school having it would be right.

602
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:35,470
Because the reason I wanted to establish Moorim School was because of that friend.

603
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:38,090
The one you've told me about last time?

604
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:48,490
Yes. Actually I am only a substitute for that friend.

605
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:54,570
Also, I continue to search for the student who has the ability to safeguard the key

606
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:57,050
in order to become the master of Moorim School.

607
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:03,450
Wait.

608
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:17,910
It seems like we are not the only ones awake.

609
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:34,790
Are you feeling better now?

610
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:39,050
I am all good, thanks to your help.

611
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:47,400
Could the ONP Holdings you mentioned last time have any relationship to the incident?

612
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:54,010
That's what I want to ask. I know the company has many buildings and partners in Seoul, but...

613
01:01:54,990 --> 01:02:00,030
It's strange that this happened exactly there.

614
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:07,490
Soon Deok was kidnapped and I was hurt there, of all places.

615
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:12,670
That company was already taken care of a long time ago.

616
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:17,370
Does my father know about this as well?

617
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:22,570
- I haven't told him.
- Why?

618
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:27,830
I did not want him to be disappointed in you again.

619
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:34,510
The Chairman has been making great efforts to push you forward as the official successor.

620
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,470
What?

621
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:42,450
But the lack of a sound justification was always the problem.

622
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,850
A justification?

623
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:50,110
The perfect reason for him to confidently name you his heir.

624
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:02,670
Are you going to keep silent about the key, Headmaster?

625
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:06,470
The key to Cheon Ui Joo!

626
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:14,350
If someone finds Cheon Ui Joo but isn't worthy, the world will be in an uproar.

627
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:16,950
Should anything happen to me...

628
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:38,450
Become a strong son to the Chairman. A man qualified to take the greatest position, who always wins over his enemies,

629
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:44,110
a powerful man who can lead such a great group.

630
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:48,790
Moorim isn't an ordinary school.

631
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:53,630
This is why the Chairman sent you there.

632
01:03:54,650 --> 01:04:01,450
First, become acknowledged at Moorim. The Chairman wants a strong heir.

633
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:09,730
Actually, I am only a substitute for that friend.

634
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:16,330
Also, I continue to search for the student who has the ability to safeguard the key
