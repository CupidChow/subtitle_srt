1
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,050
Dad, are you alright?

2
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,030
My father is blind.

3
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,170
Oh, it seems that I should have let you know of my visit sooner.

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,210
Everybody, get out!

5
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,550
Alright.

6
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,750
My apologies.

7
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,930
I have thought of meeting you earlier than this, but never did it.

8
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,350
You have wasted your time.

9
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,370
Soon Deok will no longer be attending your school.

10
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,110
Sir.

11
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,230
That immature girl must have thought that was a normal school and gone there.

12
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,090
Thank you for looking after her for all this time.

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,120
Everything is alright now.

14
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,610
How come you came along with the headmaster?

15
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,870
I came to get a con artist.

16
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,070
A con artist?

17
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,020
How can you just disappear after saying you're afraid of being apart from me?

18
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,870
Oh. You must've been worried.

19
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,340
Since the headmaster himself came, it will all work out for the best.

20
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,600
Don't worry.

21
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,080
It should be like that, yes...

22
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,310
Do you know what Soon Deok's dream is?

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,000
I first met her two years ago.

24
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,660
I just... It felt cramped in here, so I went out for a bit.

25
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,240
Hello.

26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,700
This girl got lost in the woods too, just like me.

27
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,760
I was not aware of such a school on this mountain.

28
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,460
Why would you want to escape such a...

29
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,230
I heard from Seon Ah on the way here.

30
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,890
I will do my very best.

31
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,090
Please accept me.

32
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,850
She was too smart and confident for me to turn her down.

33
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:51,330
The Soon Deok I have observed up until now is very diligent and focused on her future.

34
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,610
She never wanders off-course and always does her best.

35
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,390
I know what you are worried about.

36
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:07,960
I understand your view, as a fellow father.

37
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,940
What kind of parent in this world would like their daughter to go to such a dangerous, violence-teaching place?

38
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,740
My Soon Deok is just an ordinary girl.

39
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,260
She isn't someone who should get caught up with stupid stuff like the Cheon Ui Joo or whatever.

40
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,160
How does he know about the Cheon Ui Joo?

41
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,480
Please, just... just g-go.

42
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,460
Soon there'll be the Moorim Tournament.

43
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,200
Moorim Tournament?

44
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,600
I think they're trying to select the successor to inherit Moorim School.

45
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,640
But when I looked at the list of participants, it included alumni and Moorim Association members.

46
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,600
They're opening the school to outsiders?

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,760
It does seem out of the ordinary, right?

48
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,120
Moorim Tournament?

49
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,340
It must mean he's looking for a student capable of protecting the key.

50
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,420
This will only bring fear.

51
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,670
It is certain that the warnings have troubled him.

52
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,000
It will be great news for the chairman.

53
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,300
Do you have any plans regarding the third piece of the key?

54
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,360
It seems that things are going faster than expected.

55
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,280
Have you found the lost child?

56
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,920
We located the man who saved him,

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,280
so good news should be coming our way soon.

58
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,300
Slowly, it'll move the Moorim Association.

59
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,390
I am sorry.

60
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,030
You came all the way here...

61
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,350
Can I ask you when your father went blind?

62
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:16,010
It happened in an accident, not long after I was born.

63
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,880
Have you ever told your father about the Cheon Ui Joo?

64
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,080
No, never.

65
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,860
He didn't even know I was attending Moorim.

66
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,040
Why are you asking?

67
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,980
It's nothing. Get inside.

68
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,120
Yes. Have a safe trip back. You too.

69
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,970
So the girl we thought was Hwang Moo Song's daughter, and kidnapped, was actually Shim Bong Seon's daughter?

70
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,490
Don't be rash and observe them more.

71
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,330
Hwang Moo Song went to his house?

72
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:23,090
The chairman stated the lost child was definitely a son...

73
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,080
Are you Choi Ho?

74
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,710
Who are you?

75
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,060
Yeong... Joon.

76
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,100
Moorim School
Episode 11

77
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,420
Why are you back?

78
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,300
I couldn't go back by myself.

79
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,880
Who is this?

80
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,620
I am Soon Deok's friend, Yoon Si Woo.

81
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,850
He sure studies martial arts. His energy is something else...

82
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,320
Are you saying that you felt some kind of energy from me?

83
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,650
It's nothing. Please leave.

84
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,660
I will not go back until you let Soon Deok go to school again, Father.

85
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,720
How am I your father?

86
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,110
Don't get on my nerves and leave. Get out!

87
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,850
From what I've heard, you acted in a rush.

88
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,390
That's my level.

89
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,520
Thank you for wanting to support me, but...

90
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,530
The goal of this competition isn't for you to win matches.

91
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,150
- Then?
- The Tournament...

92
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,460
And it's about destroying the school that drove you away.

93
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:10,240
Please show me that the school doesn't empathize with anyone's excuses or poor abilities, and that it doesn't follow Moorim's principles,

94
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,120
so that no one can make any excuses for the school.

95
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,960
By doing that, you will be the true winner.

96
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,530
How much longer are you going to stay here?

97
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,490
I will not leave until you give her permission, Father.

98
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,570
You crazy bastard!

99
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,240
It's not even like you asked for her hand in marriage or something...

100
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,470
Go back before it starts raining even harder.

101
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,430
Yoon Si Woo!

102
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,330
You, too... How can you tell him to leave on such a stormy night?

103
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,270
It doesn't look like it's going to stop any time soon, either.

104
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:07,190
So you said your name is Yoon Si Woo?

105
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,090
You are very handsome.

106
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,250
What do your parents do?

107
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,450
Ahjumma!

108
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:19,350
Well, since he came all the way here just because you didn't show up at school,

109
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,450
it seems like you aren't just friends.

110
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,960
So your parents. What do they do?

111
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,910
I don't have any parents.

112
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,890
They passed away when I was young so I don't even remember what they look like.

113
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,220
Both of them?

114
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,820
Yes.

115
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Aigoo, what happened?

116
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,980
They died in a blaze.

117
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,710
A blaze? Are you saying in a fire?

118
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,150
Even though I was young and I don't remember it that well, this is what happened.

119
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:07,750
After that, I was sent to an orphanage.

120
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,110
Back then, Chae Yoon's son disappeared.

121
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,790
It couldn't be him, could it?

122
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,720
Mom! Mom!

123
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,550
Oh! Let's go, let's go!

124
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,960
Who's this?

125
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:16,220
Don't cry, don't cry.

126
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,310
They left.

127
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,400
I didn't see anything. I don't know anything about it.

128
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,090
He was there from the beginning.

129
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:44,170
It's just a coincidence. The child definitely died.

130
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,310
Could it be?

131
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,220
If your dad is against it until the end, what will you do?

132
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,760
I don't know.

133
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,180
To be honest, I never thought he'd oppose it that much.

134
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,090
If he went to the school at least once, he'd change his mind.

135
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,970
In order to make me quit school, it looks like my father

136
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,010
is prepared to move far away.

137
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,470
What?

138
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:33,050
I don't know why he hates Moorim School that much.

139
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,670
♬ Both when I take another step ♬

140
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,390
♬ and let out a long sigh ♬

141
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,630
♬ Where does the road end? ♬

142
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,820
I'll come back.

143
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,780
Whatever it takes.
♫ Goodbye goodbye, this word. To me. ♫

144
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,560
♫ Goodbye. ♫

145
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,340
Thank you for coming, Yoon Si Woo.
♫ Please don't say goodbye. ♫

146
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,630
♬ Baby it looks like I was young then ♬

147
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,350
♬ Baby it looks like I was a coward then ♬

148
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,910
♬ I knew just a connection was there ♬

149
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,630
♬ I thought I could just reach out to you ♬

150
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,210
♬ Baby I will take care of you ♬

151
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,830
♬ Baby I'm not afraid of anything ♬

152
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,470
♬ Will you stay with me? ♬

153
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,090
♬ Will you hold me tight? ♬

154
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:42,350
♬ Goodbye, you please don't say goodbye. Goodbye. ♬

155
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,990
♬ Goodbye, you please don't say goodbye.  ♬

156
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,920
♬ There is something I want to tell you ♬

157
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,840
♬ but will you listen to my story? ♬

158
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,740
♬ I don't want to hide any more. ♬

159
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,260
You're leaving?

160
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,750
If I saw your face in the morning,

161
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,980
I thought I might feel like dragging you along with me.
♬ Here’s One Thing I Can Say To You ♬

162
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,120
How about you?

163
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,740
Me?
♬ I really need you. ♬

164
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,960
The thought of you leaving alone made me feel uneasy.
♬ I will be the light for you ♬

165
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,600
What?
♬ If you also think the same way I do ♬

166
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,760
Let's go before my dad comes.
♬ If you also think the same way I do ♬

167
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,280
♬ Will you stay with me? ♬

168
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,940
♬ Will you hug me close to you? ♬

169
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:43,970
♬ Goodbye. You please don't say goodbye. Goodbye. ♬

170
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:50,600
♬ Goodbye. You please don't say goodbye.  ♬

171
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,250
You startled me. Why are you in this room?

172
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,100
Oh! What about Soon Deok?

173
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,420
She left.

174
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,630
She left?

175
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,490
Aigoo, she is not someone who would do this.

176
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,770
Why doesn't she listen to her father when it comes to that school?

177
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:25,560
Soon Deok is acting like this because of that young man.

178
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,300
Are you still half-asleep or are you just acting strangely from the shock?

179
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,320
The rest is up to me.

180
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,370
Up to me.

181
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,530
Are you waiting for Si Woo? Or Soon Deok?

182
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,200
Both of them.

183
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,210
Headmaster!

184
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,890
I'm back.

185
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,790
You came.

186
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,700
Safe!

187
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,420
I almost didn't make it in.

188
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,160
- Sunbae!
- Sunbae!

189
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh, hey. You've been well, right?

190
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,640
Wow, you've both become ladies.

191
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,030
Oh, Sunbae, us ladies?

192
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,340
If I saw you walking on the street, I wouldn't have recognized you.

193
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,410
It seems like just yesterday when Soon Deok was crying about wanting to marry me.

194
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,090
Marriage?

195
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,590
Sunbae you're too much!,

196
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,620
What the...

197
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,080
It's unreal.

198
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,330
But Sunbae Tae Ho, what brings you here?

199
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,850
By chance, did you come back to take part in the Moorim Tournament?

200
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,900
We can talk about all of this over time, but first let's go inside.

201
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,500
Yoon Si Woo and Soon Deok came back together.

202
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,000
Who's that guy?

203
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,850
Wow! This is so pleasing.

204
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,750
It's Sunbae Kang Tae Ho!

205
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,600
Kang Tae Ho?

206
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,160
Who's that?

207
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,950
If I were trying to describe Sunbae Kang Tae Ho—

208
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,790
During his time at Moorim School he got a perfect score in every subject.

209
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,070
Perfect score?

210
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,930
He was in the most advanced class all four years.

211
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,220
The most advanced class?

212
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,860
Moreover, he was the best at the Moorim Martial Arts Tournament.

213
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,060
He also won the Moorim Tournament!

214
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:43,860
Back then, Sunbae Tae Ho was so cool!

215
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,040
He is that great of a person.

216
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,050
Where did he appear from?

217
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:58,280
Back then, he almost became the successor of Moorim.

218
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,230
The successor?

219
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,430
But why did he refuse?

220
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:07,000
We don't know the reason, but two years ago, he ran away after the Moorim Tournament.

221
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,930
What? He was also a runaway-idol?

222
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:16,050
- Hey!
- Our Sunbae Tae Ho is not a runaway.

223
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,790
Our Sunbae Tae Ho?

224
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,060
Everything is exactly the same here.

225
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,640
But, you seem to have aged a bit, Headmaster.

226
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,270
You played a big part in it, you know.

227
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,230
I heard the successor spot is vacant.

228
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,700
Have you not told Seon Ah the truth yet?

229
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:46,210
Please tell her. Seon Ah is not a child anymore.

230
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,550
That's right, she did grow up a lot.

231
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,150
So much that I cannot hide the truth any longer.

232
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,830
- Headmaster.
- I intend to tell her everything

233
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,060
after the tournament is over.

234
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,140
Then, what can I do to help?

235
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,770
So you dragged her back here in the end? How unnecessary.

236
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,580
Aren't you glad Soon Deok is back?

237
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,170
I don't want to let her see

238
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,440
my current state yet.

239
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,420
If you understood, you wouldn't want to see me, either.

240
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,030
You guys seems to be full of energy.

241
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:01,900
If you have any questions while practicing your specialty, do not hesitate to ask.

242
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,580
- What do you think? They aren't bad, right?
- Yeah.

243
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,290
If you only practice Wing Chun, you'll neglect your leg strength.(Wing Chun: using striking and grappling )

244
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,140
Nadet, no matter how fast you are, one hard punch and it's over.

245
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,740
You know it. Same goes for you, too.

246
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,370
Ow.

247
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:45,320
If your thoughts are crooked, your movements will only be crooked as well.

248
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:50,040
Shannon, concentration, Jenny, determination, Seon Ah, flexibility, Wang Chi Ang...

249
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,490
You have to work on adjusting your strength.

250
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:58,450
Soon Deok, your timing is perfect.

251
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,200
Maybe your reliance on timing could be a weak spot?

252
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,350
♬  Please, my friend  ♬

253
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,670
And you, Si Woo,

254
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,510
♬  The world is so crazy  ♬

255
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,380
What's your deal?

256
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,730
♬  An unknown game  ♬

257
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,750
♬  Don't be afraid, I wanna make you crazy  ♬

258
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:22,030
I'll be straightforward. You guys are a total mess and you are doing only half the work.

259
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,530
So what should we do in order to overcome our weaknesses?

260
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,080
Aren't you here to tell us that?

261
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,110
You seem to be mistaken.

262
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,370
I actually didn't come here to make you win.

263
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,670
Then?

264
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:40,070
Who knows what is most important at the Moorim tournament?

265
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,730
- Of course it's about winning.
- Wrong!

266
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,140
This will be your homework, finding the most important thing about the tournament.

267
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,840
If you can't solve this, I plan to show up at this competition,

268
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,580
since I cannot let the successor of Moorim School be someone who can't answer such a basic question.

269
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,030
Whoever figures out the answer, come find me.

270
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,430
Whenever you like.

271
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,560
Who doesn't know their Achilles heel?

272
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,030
What if it doesn't work, even with practice?

273
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,280
He doesn't even know his own weakness.

274
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,700
How am I crooked?

275
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,640
What better form and attack could there...

276
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,910
It looks like I'm not perfect.

277
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,280
He was right. He was totally right.

278
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,760
What on earth could be the more important than winning at the tournament?

279
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,950
Aren't competitions meant to be won?

280
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:52,020
I might not know the answer, but this is so Sunbae Tae Ho-like.

281
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,810
Couldn't he mean,  Don't try too hard to win anyway?

282
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:02,180
This is it. The process is most important. Should I go tell him now?

283
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,820
Hey, don't.

284
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,420
We haven't had such a feast for the eyes in so long. How can you make him leave already?

285
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,310
The process is important?

286
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:15,570
I don't think that's it. It's too easy.

287
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:23,230
By the way, he told each person his weakness, but why didn't he say anything to Si Woo?

288
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,760
- My weakness?
- Is his weakness not having any?

289
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,210
It couldn't be that.

290
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,700
As Professor Beop Gong suggested last time,

291
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,020
I have decided to let students' parents and relatives watch the competition.

292
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,930
However, if there are too many people, we won't be able to monitor everything.

293
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:48,750
- If any incident should arise...
- I know what you are worried about.

294
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:54,270
But since the school has been so reclusive throughout the years,

295
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,190
outsiders, and especially parents, are prone to misunderstandings.

296
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,260
You must be talking about Sim Soon Deok's case.

297
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,050
This time, if we introduce Moorim School

298
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,230
to the parents and the Moorim Association through this tournament,

299
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,700
I think it would benefit the students.

300
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:15,980
You have reached a wise decision. Isn't everything we do for the students?

301
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,790
I have a special favor I would like to request from you, Professor Beop Gong.

302
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,230
Please tell me.

303
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:27,840
Please make sure those who may be associated with the destructive force are prevented from entering as contestants.

304
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:35,010
And I would like you to see whether there are any schemes or plots on their part.

305
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,770
Sure. I understand.

306
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,540
Are you okay?

307
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:06,750
You've changed so much since I left. You're a lot stronger.

308
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,710
Really? I didn't use that much force.

309
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:14,840
What? You're saying that you went easy on me? Aish!

310
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,660
This is annoying.

311
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,680
Come at me again.

312
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,050
- Let's stop for today.
- Let's go at it already!

313
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,020
Never mind.

314
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,930
- Hey, Shim Soon Deok!
- Come on.

315
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:39,560
One more time. Come on.

316
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,220
Not even two months have passed since Yoon Si Woo came,

317
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,290
but he is a very fast learner, both physically and mentally.

318
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:55,060
How did he end up coming here?

319
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:02,050
He had to face an unavoidable force one day or another.

320
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:09,960
Something like an amazing destiny.

321
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,300
Are you saying that his arrival was the result of fate?

322
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,470
Sunbae!

323
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:34,440
Sorry, sorry. I haven't used this in a while so I keep slipping up.

324
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:41,260
Wang Chi Ang. Have I told you your strength control is your weakness, or haven't I?

325
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:46,920
Wang Chi Ang is the son of Chairman Wang Hao, a great sponsor of the school.

326
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:52,020
I have yet to figure out

327
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,340
whether he is a friend or foe.

328
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:01,330
This place has gotten a lot better. Is it because of the sponsors?

329
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,120
Seon Ah, it's obvious that you're going easy on him.

330
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,280
I am not!

331
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,820
Then is it something else?

332
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,770
What? Her?

333
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,980
No, that's nonsense.

334
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:26,330
I am talking about being self-preoccupied and the sort, kids.

335
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,610
Keep practicing.

336
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:37,040
A lot of the students are too ill-tempered.

337
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,140
It's good that he has a goal,

338
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,750
but I'm afraid he will get hurt pursuing it.

339
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,540
Don't worry.

340
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:51,610
I will help them all so that nobody gets hurt.

341
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,020
So you're saying,

342
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,620
in tournaments, an indirect approach is better than straightforward techniques?

343
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,020
Like Hapkido and Taekwondo?

344
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,940
Yeah. With straightforward styles there are various fancy techniques,

345
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,590
but they're predictable.

346
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,750
They also drain a lot of your strength.

347
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:23,590
But indirect styles are like mind games.

348
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:30,000
If you can read the movements, you will win without losing stamina.

349
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:38,910
To be honest... I've also learned that from Sunbae Tae Ho.

350
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,670
What was his main style?

351
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,080
He might be good at Taekwondo.

352
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,460
He is good at everything. He's a genius.

353
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:02,150
There's no way you like that sunbae?

354
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,240
What?

355
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:09,760
No well, when he was a student here, there was no one who didn't like him...

356
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,960
No, I mean...

357
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:21,470
Judging by your stuttering, I must be right.

358
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,970
But still, now it's you that...

359
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,350
Hm?

360
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:30,660
But now you what? I'm what?

361
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,030
I have to hurry and go wash up.

362
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,760
Goodnight!

363
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,050
Goodnight, Sim Soon Deok!

364
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:55,060
In the end, what I have to work on is controlling my force but why do I keep overdoing it?

365
00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:01,220
Still, at this level you're great and you keep improving every day at an impressive pace.

366
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,550
I want to stop using so much force.

367
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:09,930
I want to be able to move more freely, more lightly.

368
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,420
I can't do that very well.

369
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,260
It might not be your body that's heavy but rather your heart.

370
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:22,400
Such a thought occurred to me, that's all. Anyway, Wang Chi Ang,

371
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,830
you're doing well. Fighting!

372
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,330
Let's go.

373
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:43,910
You left it as is. I'm going to go crazy. Are you planning on starving yourself to death?

374
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,930
What can you do about it now that she's already gone?

375
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:50,020
It's not like you can grab her by her hair and drag her back. She's all grown up now.

376
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,520
Soon Deok is a daughter who cares so much for her father.

377
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,960
If she went this far, she must be serious about this.

378
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,530
Understand her a little bit, huh?

379
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,960
I know. I have to understand her.

380
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,410
If you know than why— Ah this distresses me so much.

381
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,750
Please wait. I'll make a new meal again.

382
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,330
I'm so upset.

383
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,950
Your dad didn't contact you?

384
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:33,620
No. He must be so disappointed with me.

385
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,650
Our fathers really don't know how hard we're working, do they?

386
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,940
He'll know it one day.

387
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,760
Right?

388
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:50,290
Stay strong. No, no. Let's be strong!

389
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,090
Yoon Si Woo!

390
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:13,210
Wow... You're practicing in secret?

391
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,470
I just couldn't sleep.

392
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,390
- I heard you've only been here two months.
- Yes.

393
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,570
Is it that your senses are innate?

394
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,720
What?

395
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:33,070
No, well... It's just amazing to see a singer attend Moorim School.

396
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:37,150
I heard that you never even properly learned martial arts before.

397
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,430
What are you trying to say?

398
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:44,490
During the lessons, I didn't tell you what your weakness was, right?

399
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,920
I'm not curious about it.

400
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,330
You already know the answer.

401
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,240
Are you talking about the question, "What is most important about the Moorim Tournament?"

402
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,950
I really don't think I know the answer.

403
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:07,730
No, you know the answer. That's why your attack is estranged and detached.

404
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,430
Knowing the answer is your weakness.

405
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:20,870
Think well about what you're hesitating about.

406
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:59,000
Indeed, nothing is better than a blade.

407
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,330
If you want to win, take it.

408
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:15,120
Looking at the competitor registration list, I can see why

409
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:20,030
the headmaster opened registration for the tournament to outsiders.

410
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:24,500
I want to weed out the people who are coming into Moorim School with an ulterior motive.

411
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:30,650
I've taken notice of the people who might be from the destructive force.

412
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:36,220
However, even if we weed out the people who might be from the destructive force,

413
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:42,000
we won't be able to stop those people from participating in this tournament.

414
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,550
What are you trying to say?

415
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,130
There's an unwritten law

416
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:50,970
that states that the strongest will get the key to the Cheon Ui Joo.

417
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,260
So you're saying that

418
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:59,270
no matter what, our students will win.

419
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:04,240
I did not want to ban anyone, even if they're part of the destructive force.

420
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,960
Are you confident?

421
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,910
Don't you trust our students, Professor Beop Gong?

422
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:19,000
I just want to see

423
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,620
our hard work pay off, that's all.

424
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:29,820
I wanted to come back to Moorim School for the food.

425
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,710
Shall I see if our Soon Deok's cooking skills have improved?

426
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:38,880
Sunbae, I heard that you won the last Moorim Tournament. What is your secret?

427
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,950
My secret. It's top secret but

428
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:48,660
70% of my winning was thanks to luck.

429
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,540
Eh? Just luck?

430
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:56,110
I was lucky. Two of my opponents couldn't take part. One had a stomach ache, one had a bad allergic reaction.

431
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,340
Thus I succeeded with no trouble in the finals.

432
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,280
What the heck?

433
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:05,940
Regardless, the fact that you won is because of your skill. Isn't there something else you can tell us?

434
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,050
Right. Like something that would give us an advantage.

435
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,770
Let's not talk about the Moorim competition while we're eating. We'll get indigestion.

436
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:17,050
If 70% was luck, what about the remaining 30%?

437
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:22,410
Graceful reckoning. Do you know that saying?

438
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,320
Earlier I told you guys each other's weakness. You guys can use that in your attacks.

439
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,200
My Soon Deok, eat up.

440
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,030
Yes.

441
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,260
♬  Here comes the fire,  ♬

442

♫ Here comes the fire ♫

454
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,530
Instead of asking if I'm okay,

455
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,770
you should attack at that moment.

456
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:31,340
Okay. Next time, at the tournament, I'll do it that way.
♬ Go Away I want to burn everything♬

461
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,810
Yoon Si Woo. Are you holding back?
♫ Sky. I can't forget it ♫

462
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,740
How long are you going to just avoid it?
♫ Sky. I can't forget it ♫

463
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,690
I'm not avoiding.

464
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,330
Let's rest a bit before continuing.

465
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,730
♫ Here comes the fire ♫

467
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,410
What are you doing here?

468
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,210
What about you?

469
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,290
Weapon refill.

470
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,800
Why doesn't the headmaster use these weapons?

471
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,560
Because someone would get hurt, obviously.

472
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:43,300
If this was a real situation, could we block something like this?

473
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,000
Why are you thinking about this?

474
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:54,280
Hwang Seon Ah. If I really did stop that lighting unit in mid-air,

475
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,520
why on earth would I have that kind of power?

476
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,320
No, that's not that important now.

477
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,380
What  is  this strength, really?

478
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:15,470
It might be hard to put into words, but you can say it is an effect of your energy?

479
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,950
- An effect of my energy?
- Yes.

480
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:25,030
It's winning over your opponent without regard to physical limitations.

481
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:29,920
It demands great inner strength.

482
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:38,820
If I really can do that,

483
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:42,810
If I really did it without being aware,

484
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,250
isn't there a way

485
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,170
I could do it again?

486
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,150
- Are you going to practice?
- Yes.

487
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:36,450
I received a message that Chairman Wang Hao will be attending the competition too.

488
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,730
My father?

489
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:41,410
He must have some expectations for you.

490
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:45,030
This tournament is an important opportunity,

491
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:48,650
not only for you but also for the chairman.

492
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,050
Opportunities like this don't come all too often.

493
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:00,890
And even if they do, it might not be easy to take advantage of them.

494
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,680
I know.

495
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,740
This time around, be sure to receive

496
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:12,980
the chairman's, no, your father's acknowledgement.

497
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,650
Yes.

498
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,350
You know the answer. This is why your attacks are so tentative.

499
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,650
Your weakness is knowing the right answer.

500
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:44,830
If I had that kind of strength, my father wouldn't have to worry.

501
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:49,350
If you get in my way, I'll destroy you. Even if you're a friend.

502
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:00,490
How much longer are you going to keep this up?

503
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:03,310
Are you ill or something?

504
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:07,690
You're saving yourself for the real thing, aren't you?

505
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,390
- It's not like that.
- Then what?

506
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,590
For a while, all I've wanted

507
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,970
is to not hurt anyone, including you.

508
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:22,360
You don't want to hurt me?

509
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,910
That's actually insulting, do you know that?

510
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:30,810
Are you going easy on me? Who are you to do that?

511
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:33,370
You'll say you won without effort, isn't it?

512
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,430
I'm just trying to find a way.

513
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:42,600
A way to win without anyone getting hurt.

514
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:46,760
Stop acting all high and mighty and do it right.

515
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,500
Who in here doesn't want to win?

516
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:55,560
But whoever it is, what's the use in hurting others just to be first?

517
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,800
It's all a selfish fight in the end anyway!

518
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,050
For you and for me!

519
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:06,190
So if you, who said you'd destroy me, win, what do you really win?

520
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:09,810
Let's say I come in first.

521
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:14,770
If I get the key to Cheon Ui Joo, will I not lose you?

522
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,780
What's the use in that?

523
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:26,030
You can say that because you've already got it.

524
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:33,400
I... even if I lose you,

525
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,230
even if I hurt you, I won't care.

526
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:55,490
I don't know about you, but I care.

527
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:00,070
I don't want to hurt you again.

528
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,980
Yoon Si Woo. I'm different than you.

529
00:46:54,820 --> 00:47:01,640
You do your thing. I'm gathering all my strength now.

530
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:10,190
I will become strong so that I can protect the ones I love.

531
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,310
Shim Soon Deok?

532
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:50,550
How did you know it was me?

533
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:55,730
Your breath, your footsteps, your scent...

534
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,770
And...

535
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:07,000
The warm feeling you give me.
♬ Today again I see! I see that look!♬

536
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:13,350
Did something happen?
♬ You, whom I will only love,♬

537
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:21,200
♬ the person who is waiting for me far away,♬

538
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:27,580
Don't eat all the dishes another guy gives you.
♬ You are my love♬

539
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,900
Especially that guy.
♬ I am laughing over and over again♬

540
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,120
- What?

541
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,850
Are you acting like this just because of that?
♬ just to be only walking ♬

542
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,750
Yeah.
♬  together with you.♬

543
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:46,840
I got it. I won't eat it.
♬ When I see you, when I take your hand♬

544
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,640
Should I not look at Sunbae Tae Ho either?

545
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,630
You wanted to?
♬ My day will fly by too quickly♬

546
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:03,940
Go inside and sleep. It's cold.
♬ That love is happiness rather than pain♬

547
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:11,160
Don't get hurt, Shim Soon Deok.
♬  is the love which I have learned.♬

548
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:20,960
Okay.
♬  That's the love which I have learned.♬

549
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:40,510
I think he's really going to show us something this time.

550
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,410
I know, right?

551
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:44,350
Whoever thinks they can beat me, step forward..

552
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:56,340
Three vs. one isn't right. Who was first in your midterms?

553
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,900
Twenty minutes have already passed.

554
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:51,370
It looks like he's trying to show us today, Sunbae Tae Ho.

555
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:54,590
Show him who's the best, Hwang Seon Ah.

556
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:08,930
Is this all Moorim School's number one student can do?

557
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,770
Give me a chance, please.

558
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:13,390
I'm not done yet!

559
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:18,280
Hwang Seon Ah, come out. I'll do it.

560
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,140
If you want to challenge me, you should do it after you've at least beaten Hwang Seon Ah.

561
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,330
Wouldn't that be most fair?

562
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:27,650
Now, who's going to go after Seon Ah?

563
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:28,960
I will do it.

564
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:34,420
You said that you would break me. I'm telling you to beat Hwang Seon Ah first.

565
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:39,590
Isn't Hwang Seon Ah too tired right now? That would be too cowardly.

566
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:42,160
That's cowardly?

567
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:48,850
You said you wanted to be first at the Moorim Tournament. Winning is your goal, isn't it?

568
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:50,680
- But—
- Out of everyone else,

569
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:56,120
even if you can't defeat me, if you can defeat Hwang Seon Ah in this tired state you can be number one at Moorim School.

570
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:01,390
When are you going to get another chance like this? You might as well just knock Seon Ah down now

571
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:04,510
and make it so that she can't even come out and compete.

572
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:10,380
Why are you being like this? It's unlike you, Sunbae Tae Ho.

573
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,810
A week ago I gave all of you a homework assignment but none of you have given me the correct answer.

574
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:17,010
- That was—
- If the Cheon Ui Joo key

575
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:20,040
and the position of successor to Moorim school is that important to you,

576
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,350
where will you get a good opportunity like this? Agreed?

577
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:24,930
Sunbae.

578
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,160
Please stop all of this.

579
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,960
When you said that you wanted to come out on top at the competition,

580
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:38,720
you said that you don't care if all your friends get hurt.

581
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,980
I know the correct answer.

582
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:59,800
The most important thing at the competition is us, people,

583
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,390
since strength is something that you cultivate in order to protect someone else.

584
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,430
- However—
- However,

585
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:10,340
you know the correct answer but you cannot follow it. Is that what you mean to say?

586
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:14,650
Yes, I understand the situation the school is in currently,

587
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:17,560
and I understand my friends' situations,

588
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,760
but I don't have the luxury of considering that.

589
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,310
You don't have the luxury.

590
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:29,230
I have to be recognized in this tournament

591
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:33,960
in order to protect something important.

592
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,920
You're saying that you're gong to protect something far away when you can't even protect what's closest to you?

593
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,110
Wang Chi Ang, you can't protect anything when you think like that.

594
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:47,020
In the end, you're going to lose your own self too.

595
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:58,710
Everyone remember this. You may all know the path, but in actuality almost no one walks that path.

596
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:02,360
Therefore, the person who follows that path is the genuine article.

597
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:06,030
He is the person who will be left shining in the end.

598
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:15,400
I want to protect us.

599
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,280
The method in which no one gets hurt

600
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:23,550
and through which we can all win, please teach that to me.

601
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:28,740
That's not something I can teach you. You have to find that out for yourself.

602
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,540
I heard that there's such a thing as Gi Chae Sul. ( Returning to yourself your own energy/spirit )

603
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,400
Gi Chae Sul?

604
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,850
If, by chance, my strength is not a coincidence,

605
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:43,960
I was hoping that maybe that strength was meant to protect something important.

606
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:50,580
You're working using Gi Chae Sul?

607
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,540
If I have a strength that others don't have,

608
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:57,970
it must be because I am supposed to protect something important with that strength.

609
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:06,740
I'm going to show that I can subdue my opponent without drawing blood.

610
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,510
Headmaster.

611
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,180
Oh, sure.

612
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,990
I see.

613
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:28,480
It never occurred to me that your strength might be Gi Chae Sul.

614
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:35,430
However, in actuality it's not working for me.

615
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:38,100
I also wish I could teach it to you,

616
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:45,350
Gi Chae Sul is not an easy thing to do.

617
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:53,230
I've only ever seen one person who has successfully practiced it.

618
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:55,340
Only one person?

619
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,200
Who is that person?

620
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,640
He was the last successor to Moorim.

621
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:13,040
But, that person...died.

622
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,120
Dead?

623
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,610
Sunbae.

624
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:48,070
Yeah.

625
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,570
Was I too much?

626
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:59,210
I wanted it to sound cooler than that.

627
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:01,560
You did sound cool.

628
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,930
You were telling us to work hard together, right?

629
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:08,040
The Moorim Tournament is not going to be easy this time.

630
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,910
And even if you overcome that, you'll have harder obstacles in the future.

631
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:15,000
It's not something you can face alone.

632
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,910
We have more skilled students here together at one time than ever before.

633
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,990
That's why I was envious.

634
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:28,220
The reason I didn't become the successor for Moorim is probably because I didn't have friends like that.

635
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:31,100
At that time we were very young.

636
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:35,770
Now you'll be able to overcome it all very well.

637
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:40,700
Therefore, Seon Ah, no matter what, you need to believe in yourself.

638
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,520
And, Soon Deok, hang in there.

639
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,510
Yes, Sunbae.

640
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:12,220
The kid in the flames could be me.

641
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:16,360
Soon Deok's dad, you've received an invitation from Moorim School.

642
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,800
It looks like they are inviting us to an upcoming Moorim tournament.

643
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,860
Moorim tournament?

644
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:25,060
Yeah. Wait. I'll read it for you.

645
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,270
Forget it!

646
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:30,120
They've also included an invitation in braille.

647
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,780
- What?
- Look here. This is braille.

648
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:39,920
They must have made this up specially for you.

649
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,470
Did you receive the invitation?

650
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:46,850
Yeah, I received the invitation. I'll make sure to show up dressed nicely.

651
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:50,040
You would look beautiful if you showed up in just anything.

652
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,890
I heard that Father is coming too.

653
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:54,970
He says that he's making the time even though he's very busy.

654
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:56,010
Yeah.

655
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:59,400
Even so, don't overdo it. Don't get hurt, my son.

656
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,810
Don't worry, Mom.

657
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,020
Surprised?

658
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:33,190
What are you doing?

659
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,720
I heard you're working on Gi Chae Sul?

660
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,690
I know it's not going to be easy.

661
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:43,470
Even though I haven't tried it myself, I'm pretty sure it won't be easy with this sandbag.

662
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:44,890
What?

663
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:51,020
The one that you genuinely want to protect.

664
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:56,750
If you do it with a heart to protect that person, I think it might add to your strength.

665
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:05,790
Sim Soon Deok.

666
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,350
Hm?

667
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:12,780
Try hitting me.

668
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:13,980
What?

669
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,100
Yoon Si Woo, what's with you?

670
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:20,570
I'll defend myself, so hit me as hard as you can without worrying.

671
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:32,890
What the?

672
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,520
I'm really hitting you.

673
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,040
What are you doing? You said you'd block it.

674
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:57,500
One more time.

675
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,810
One more time!

676
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,230
I'm going to use my strength. I'm really going to do it.

677
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:43,010
Are you okay? I thought you said you'd block it!

678
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,550
Are you okay?

679
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:48,630
It's strange. I definitely felt the same feeling.

680
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,680
What are you trying to do?

681
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:58,060
I wanted to try Gi Chae Sul, but it's not going well.

682
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:59,580
Gi Chae Sul?

683
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:04,600
You mean that you tried to stop Soon Deok's fist with just your energy?

684
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,390
You were shocked, right? I'm sorry. Let's stop.

685
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:17,730
Stop? Stop what?

686
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:23,760
Don't do that.

687
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:34,550
You.This time really block it properly.
