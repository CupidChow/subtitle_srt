1
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,410
We're almost there.

2
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,770
Moorim School-Episode 1

3
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,030
18 years later

4
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,430
K-Pop Music Festival

5
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,330
Si Woo Mobius

6
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,510
If you're going to give an excuse, make it a good one!

7
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,830
Why is Yoon Si Woo always making up excuses?!

8
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,410
Is everything fine just because he's a top star? Bring him here immediately!

9
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,010
Manager Kim

10
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,710
Yes, Manager Kim?

11
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,070
Si Woo, why are you just now picking up the phone?

12
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,390
I had my phone set on vibrate.

13
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,670
I repeatedly told you that you can't skip this concert's rehearsal.

14
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,270
Producer Jeong's temper is no joke.

15
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,050
You didn't even go to the hotel I booked for you. Where the heck are you right now?

16
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:35,250
You're noisy. I'm in a suite room at the Inter Hotel so just come here.

17
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,530
It's starting again. How annoying.

18
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,050
What is that guy? Is he the model for Shanghai Group?

19
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,930
Yes.

20
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,950
When was the last time I told you to change it to White?

21
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,290
The president ordered for it to be left as it is.

22
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,630
- My father did?
- Yes.

23
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,870
I told you to leave it alone? Looking at it again, it looks fine.

24
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,310
Go back (to China). I don't need your protection.

25
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,130
Young Master, this is the president's special order.

26
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,210
You leave too! You too!

27
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,970
Hey, you guys. Did you think I wouldn't know that all of you are my father's spies? Aren't you going to leave?!

28
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,670
Then, our concert security team will take care of your security.

29
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,930
Whatever.

30
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,290
Maybe it's because your mother is Korean, but you speak Korean very well.

31
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,610
You investigated quite a bit on me.

32
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,950
I-I'm sorry.

33
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,510
Um, the concert is scheduled to start around 5 PM, so it will be good to look around downtown first.

34
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,810
Wang Chi Ang, what type of food do you like?

35
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,850
Well, see you later.

36
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:34,270
Wang Chi Ang, we've prepared a car to take you to the hotel.

37
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,790
It's been a while, shall we race?

38
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:42,110
Um, just a moment. This is your VIP ID card that you'll use for the time you're here.

39
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,930
Please take care of this for the duration of the event—

40
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,060
Then, I'll see you later!

41
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:17,550
I heard you sent all of the security guards back. You're sure you're not just causing accidents going around by yourself, right?

42
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,410
What accident? Who am I? I'm your son.

43
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:27,830
I'll definitely get points this time and come to China to pick you up.

44
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,510
I can't believe the president. It's not the main house building or even a secondary part of the house...

45
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,830
Chi Ang...

46
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:38,690
The fact that a beauty like you should be exiled in a place like that doesn't make sense.

47
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,930
Pack up your bags and wait. I'll come to pick you up in the morning.

48
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,450
- Wang Chi Ang!
- Hm?

49
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,770
I moved!

50
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,810
To where?

51
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:54,330
I'll text you the address later. Come find me at that place tomorrow morning, okay?

52
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,970
I love you (in Korean), Lady (as in high authority) Kang (Mom). I love you (in English). I love you (in Chinese).

53
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,430
Honey, do you really need to do this?

54
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,970
Moorim School? Why would you send him to such a strange school?

55
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:18,070
I've thought of everything so you just have to do what I tell you.

56
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:53,010
Warm. Ah, my eyes sting. Shall we see if you're all cooked?

57
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,450
In this cold winter, you have to eat things like this potato rice cake.

58
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:06,230
You're all cooked, you're all cooked, you're all cooked! You're tasty, potato rice cake.

59
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:13,590
That rascal won't just go with you easily. Be warned.

60
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,850
I understand.

61
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:22,010
If I send him there, maybe he'll be of some use.

62
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,810
It's still not cleaned up.

63
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,690
This was why they didn't hand the key over right away.

64
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:21,210
I'm requesting that you clean up this room quickly.

65
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,970
What are you?

66
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,810
Who are you?

67
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,050
They're doing all sorts of things, now even a man?

68
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,880
You're a stalker fan, aren't you?

69
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,540
What are you doing in someone else's room?

70
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,310
- Soon Deok, you're here.
- Yes.

71
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,250
Oh... I need to make a profit on a day like this.

72
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,660
Aigoo, business is slow today. Those Seoul people won't even have a taste.

73
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,260
- Really?
- Really!

74
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,160
I'm just going to borrow this.

75
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,550
Mobius.

76
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,560
Ahjumma! Do you have any potato rice cakes?

77
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,630
Potato rice cakes are what Mobius's Si Woo Oppa likes the most!

78
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,430
He doesn't eat other carbohydrates, but I heard he eats these!

79
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:07,720
- Line up quickly, quickly, quickly!
- Is that true?

80
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,860
Si Woo Oppa loves these potato rice cakes!

81
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,760
Our Si Woo Oppa! Potato rice cake! Students, buy some potato rice cakes!

82
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,750
You will lose weight like this!

83
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,350
I'm sorry. The employee was a first-time intern, so he must have made a mistake.

84
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,080
I got it.

85
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,210
So everyone, leave.

86
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,840
Who's telling whom to leave?

87
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,210
Manager Kim.

88
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,270
As you know, our Si Woo is a star whose face is well known.

89
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,930
Who is?

90
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,300
He is?

91
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,370
You don't know Yoon Si Woo?

92
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,280
He's the leader of Mobius, an idol group that's the most popular in South Korea.

93
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,550
I don't know him. Do I have to?

94
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:59,950
Shouldn't you at least know about the festival sponsorship? The finale is me, our Mobius.

95
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,340
Then, take them out.

96
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,240
Drop out of this concert.

97
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,010
Like you said, our Shanghai Group is the sponsor of the festival.

98
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:15,690
There's really no need to sponsor someone I don't like. Drop them.

99
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,270
Manager Kim. You heard that, right? I think I'll be able to rest today.

100
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,500
Si Woo, why are you acting like this?

101
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,270
Seventy percent of the people who came to the concert today are fans of Mobius.

102
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,300
Among them, more than half are fans of Yoon Si Woo.

103
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,200
If Yoon Si Woo doesn't appear, we'll have to refund every one of them.

104
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,600
Do you think I won't have the money? Reimburse them.

105
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,140
President Wang Hao is specially taking care of this concert.

106
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,670
I received a call saying that there can't be any mistakes. Please bear with it.

107
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,890
The chairman?

108
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,520
What was his name again?

109
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,910
Yoon Si Woo.

110
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,360
Do your best so I won't think I wasted my money.

111
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,180
I'll watch how well you do, Yoon Si Woo.

112
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,850
Let's go.

113
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,030
Si Woo was marked by the concert's sponsor? By the chairman of Shanghai Group?

114
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,490
Not the chairman, but his son.

115
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:33,950
Even if he takes off all his clothes and dances, I will have to think about forgiving him. He thinks he's the top of the world.

116
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,330
He usually does whatever he wants to do but he's gotten even worse these days.

117
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:41,070
He doesn't even want to talk to his members and he can't even be contacted whenever something happens.

118
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,490
Did you check the rumor about Si Woo getting a contract with DSL company?

119
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,890
Ay. No way, you know that if Si Woo leaves the company, we'll all go to waste.

120
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,420
Who are you calling a waste?

121
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,430
♬  While it's not anything serious ♬

122
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,410
♬ if you have something to tell me, walk with me this way. ♬

123
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:04,200
Aigoo. Soon Deok, you'll even be able to sell sand in the desert.

124
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,720
1,000 won.

125
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,000
Young man!
♬ A to Z  ♬

126
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,110
♬ I want to know you from head to toe♬

127
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,810
♬ Baby you baby only you ♬

128
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,660
Isn't that Hwang Seon Ah?

129
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,220
Hwang Seon Ah!

130
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,380
Wasn't that her?

131
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,580
Well, there's no way Seon Ah would come to a place like this.

132
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,600
Just a moment.

133
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,210
The entrance for regular fans is that way.

134
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,530
I am a VVVVIP.

135
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,940
I'm sorry but could I please check your ID card?

136
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,340
Where did it go?

137
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,560
What is this?

138
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,090
Yoon Si Woo?

139
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,470
What is this?

140
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,550
The next stage is White's

141
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,850
"Only you know".

142
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,550
You should have contacted them about the VIP list beforehand.

143
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,580
White's stage already started.

144
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,980
I'm sorry. That's why I told you to always take your ID card around with you...

145
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,490
Please sit.

146
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,920
♫ My heart flutters again at your dazzling appearance ♫

147
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,650
♫  Should I say I like you? ♫

148
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,140
♫  Should I make it so that ♫

149
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,130
Leave.
♫  you can't ignore me anymore? ♫

150
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,610
♫Oh, boy~♫

151
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,840
♫  Please just wait for me a bit more ♫

152
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,020
- Now, on to Mobius's stage.
- Now, Jenny. What stage is next?

153
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,330
Yes, the next stage is the climax all of you have been waiting for and anticipating.

154
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,050
South Korea's best group and the center of the Hallyu Wave,

155
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,690
Mobius!

156
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,190
Oppa Si Woo!

157
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,770
♫ You're a player, a player.
Your life is a trouble ♫

158
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,590
♫ I need to withstand this moment
I need to sew it up ♫

159
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,950
Ah... Jerk.

160
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:42,350
♫ Amen
I became a top star, Amen ♫

161
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:50,800
♫ This moment feels like a champagne ♫

162
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:57,620
♫ Tonight, again ♫

163
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,360
♫ I feel so good, let's dance! ♫

164
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,960
Please follow Yoon Si Woo, only Yoon Si Woo.

165
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,510
♫ You, this dance is part of you ♫

166
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,460
♫ Ah, what should I do! ♫

167
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,380
Oh my god!!! Oh my god!!

168
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,270
♫ I'm the best ♫

169
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,750
♫ But, I'm the best ♫

170
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,730
Yoon Si Woo! Yoon Si Woo! Yoon Si Woo oppa!

171
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,030
♫ Uh, uh ♫

172
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,750
♫ Other people— ♫

173
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:51,350
♫ We will never die
Mobius will never die. ♫

174
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:59,000
♫ Let's party right
We will never die. Mobius will never die ♫

175
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,290
♫ Feel so good ♫

176
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:09,030
♫ Feel so good! Let's dance, rock again! ♫

177
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:13,440
♫ I'm the best ♫

178
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,880
♫ But, I'm the best ♫

179
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,270
The lights! Move, move away!

180
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,730
What are you doing, Yoon Si Woo?! Move aside, get out of the way!

181
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,050
It stopped...

182
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,230
Are you okay?

183
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,910
Can you not hear? Does it hurt?

184
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,550
Come to Moorim School. The Headmaster will be able to cure you.

185
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,110
Are you okay?

186
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,090
Remember! Moorim School!

187
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,670
- Move aside, move aside!
- Get out of the way, get out of the way!

188
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,810
Security, come here quickly!

189
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,030
Si Woo!

190
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,890
Why did you stay still when they told you to move multiple times?

191
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,930
I was concentrating on my singing so I didn't hear.

192
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,730
Are you sure you'll be fine without having to go to the hospital?

193
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,290
I want to rest.

194
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,230
Yeah, you guys should leave.

195
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:01,050
You were really surprised, weren't you? My heart lurched thinking that something would happen to you.

196
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,890
We can go to Seoul tomorrow so sleep comfortably.

197
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,370
President...

198
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,930
Yeah?

199
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,530
I think I need to rest.

200
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,710
Yeah, yeah. You should rest tomorrow, rest comfortably.

201
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,770
That's not what I mean.

202
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,370
Please give me a vacation, just for one year.

203
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,290
Hey! That's—

204
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,890
Fine. We'll talk about that again when we arrive in Seoul, okay?

205
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:47,770
- So are you saying that I might never be able to hear again?
- That could be the case.

206
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:51,270
As of now, all I can tell you is that there seems to be a psychological reason.

207
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:55,210
Even painkillers have a limit so you should rest for now.

208
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,310
What is all of this?

209
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,630
What? He can't hear?

210
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:17,250
After looking into it, I found out that the person Si Woo met outside wasn't the president of DS Entertainment, it was a doctor.

211
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:22,610
The problem isn't that he can't hear, the problem is that the cause is unknown.

212
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,170
President, it's the end for our company if Yoon Si Woo develops a problem with his ears.

213
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:38,550
Si Woo is the one doing all of our producing and composing. How can you laugh?

214
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:42,990
The heavens have helped, the heavens have helped!

215
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,030
Pardon?

216
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:49,430
I couldn't sleep well these days because I was worried about how much I need to pay him so that he'll sign the contract with our company again.

217
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,450
You're planning to renew his contract for a cheaper price with that excuse?

218
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,750
No.

219
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,210
Take Yoon Si Woo out.

220
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,850
How would I use a singer who can't hear?

221
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,410
It's possible that he could get better immediately-

222
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:14,230
He might not be able to hear ever again. It's hard to control too.

223
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,890
We already used him up as much as we could. Remove him.

224
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,290
We will have to do a proceeds settlement.

225
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:24,330
The rest of the kids... Will we be able to work with just them?

226
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:29,050
We have to think of a way to save this company and Mobius

227
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:34,190
while taking Yoon Si Woo out.

228
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:40,870
You know that girl who's all over the flyers, the girl group member who was dumped by Si Woo and threatened to hang herself. Who is she?

229
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,790
Why would you suddenly

230
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,810
mention Da Rim?

231
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:59,190
I don't think he's in his room right now.

232
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:08,010
Yoon Si Woo, seriously. Ah, I really have to find my phone.

233
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:18,070
Yoon Si Woo! Hey! Give me my phone!

234
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,550
Did he go out somewhere?

235
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,850
Am I hearing things now?

236
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:21,650
I'll watch you to see how well you do, Yoon Si Woo.

237
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,710
Ah, that bastard...

238
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,790
Mom

239
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,650
Mom?

240
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:00,950
He'll arrive there by tomorrow morning.

241
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,850
The Cheon Hee Joo...

242
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,910
Don't rush. Everything has a time.

243
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:20,710
Even if you forcefully send Young Master Chi Ang to Moorim School, won't he just quit that school in a short time as he did with the others?

244
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,870
There's a way to prevent that.

245
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,270
Pardon?

246
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,910
He's a child who cares deeply for his mother.

247
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,690
Customer, I've arrived at the hotel.

248
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:03,670
Bringing in outside food is banned here so I think you'll have to come outside secretly and take it—

249
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:12,510
No, what am I supposed to do if you say you don't want to eat it now?

250
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,410
Customer? Customer?

251
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:19,510
Ah, they hung up.

252
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,290
Excuse me!

253
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:30,570
Did you know that the hotel's room service chicken is the size of a booger, but they charge you $80?

254
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:37,870
But, this is only $15! Chicken and beer! How about it?

255
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,890
Are you crazy?

256
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,610
Yes, I'm crazy worrying about you!

257
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,390
How is your body? Are you hurt anywhere?

258
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:06,070
My body is fine and I'm not hurt anymore so get out right now.

259
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,790
Oppa!

260
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,890
Hey! Hey, are you really crazy?!

261
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:17,910
Why do I have to do something like that to Si Woo Oppa?

262
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:24,410
For a rookie like you to rise to the top of this industry, there are exactly two ways.

263
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:30,870
Get involved with someone at the top or drag down someone at the top.

264
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:38,890
He's a cold person who didn't even look at you when you wanted to die. Do you still have lingering feelings for him?

265
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,790
Nothing good will come to you just because you do this. Get out right now!

266
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,050
Let go!

267
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,860
Get out right now.

268
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,060
This is your last chance. If you reject me right now,

269
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,060
- I can't save you anymore either!
- Save me?

270
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,190
You're going to save me?

271
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,350
Please don't act without thinking and get out, Da Rim!

272
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,830
Get out, quickly.

273
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,500
Oh, oh, oh, who is this?

274
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,380
I guess you don't have a choice anymore either.

275
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,230
Let us take some pictures with a Hallyu star too.

276
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,470
Ah, you can't since you're on a date with a pretty lady?

277
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,250
This won't do. I'll take you back, get in.

278
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,980
Let go of me!

279
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,670
Your girlfriend says she doesn't like it. Leave her behind and just go.

280
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,890
Let's not get involved, let's not get involved.

281
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,380
My father, Shim Bong San's life motto,

282
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,190
"Don't get involved in other people's business."

283
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:54,120
- Off I go.
- You should stop.

284
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,550
- If you continue to do this—
- If I continue to do this,

285
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,500
if I continue to do this, what are you going to do? Huh?

286
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,460
What are you going to do if I continue to do this?

287
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,120
I feel like I've also seen you somewhere before.

288
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,620
I guess she's a celebrity too.

289
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,700
You shouldn't mess with the woman.

290
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,210
Then, it's okay for us to mess with you?

291
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,700
- Let's go, quickly—
-Aish, go? Where do you keep on wanting to go?!

292
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:30,280
Ahjussi, you guys shouldn't be like this. I reported this to the police.

293
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,360
It would be nice for you to run away quickly. Go!

294
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,830
Return before the police come. I'll take care of that.

295
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,770
Oppa!

296
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,600
What are you doing? Follow him!

297
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,370
President, the situation has started.

298
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,280
Another is gone like this.

299
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,860
Oh, are you injured anywhere?

300
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,230
Are you also one of President Choi's people?

301
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,240
- Huh?
- Excuse me!

302
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,100
Da Rim, what happened?

303
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,330
It's true that you were with Yoon Si Woo, right?

304
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,350
D-Da Rim, a-are you okay?

305
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,750
What happened? It's true that you were with them from the beginning, right?

306
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,620
- M-Me?
- Did you witness everything?

307
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,380
What happened?

308
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,830
Then Mobius's leader, Yoon Si Woo

309
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,970
returned with an assault case that's

310
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,460
driving a nail into the hearts of young female fans.

311
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,910
- Yes, it's really unfortunate news.
- Yes, it is.

312
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,450
Our Entertainment Love Room has done a close up interview.

313
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,220
Let's meet them now.

314
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,480
White/Da Rim (18 years old): I was on a date with Oppa Si Woo.

315
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,280
As soon as some hooligans appeared,

316
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,630
he abandoned me and ran away.

317
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:59,020
The person who saved Da Rim wasn't Yoon Si Woo,

318
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,200
it was a small and frail female student.

319
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,420
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

320
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,080
- Hello.
- Shim Soon Duk (Student/20): Yes, hello.

321
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,100
- You can speak now.
- Yes.

322
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,200
I was delivering chicken and a few people were bothering someone

323
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,190
- so I just helped.
- When you were fighting with those large men,

324
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,790
- what did Yoon Si Woo do?
- He suddenly went inside his car and drove that way.

325
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,220
Is it true that he ran away by himself?

326
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,050
Well, is that it?

327
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:29,090
Viewers, did you just hear that? Mobius's Leader, Yoon Si Woo, abandoned Da Rim

328
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:33,240
on his date and ran away by himself!

329
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,380
How many times do I have to tell you that I didn't run away, I went to catch the paparazzi?

330
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,480
Those bastards weren't after Da Rim from the beginning, they were after me.

331
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,640
The truth isn't important!

332
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,080
What's important is that the reporters are pushing to make it seem like that!

333
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:52,330
Manager Kim, find that chicken-head girl.

334
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:55,540
If we both do some sort of open interview with reporters, then

335
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,900
- won't this be resolved quickly?
- Si Woo.

336
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,720
President, this seems like a trap made by Da Rim.

337
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,970
It doesn't make sense that so many reporters were gathered near there, out of all places, and—

338
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:10,620
What doesn't make sense? It's a given that reporters were gathered because of the concert yesterday,

339
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,870
and have you ever done an interview with the reporters with a smiling face?

340
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,140
That's why there's no chance they'll put out a good article!

341
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:21,410
All this time, I told you so many times to greet the reporters but you never listened.

342
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:25,260
Look at how Reporter Kim, who started the scandal, wasn't even ordered to, but he went there anyway.

343
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,350
Ordered?

344
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,440
Ordered what?

345
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,030
Yoon Si Woo!

346
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,410
You became even more famous overnight.

347
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:51,290
You should give me my jacket before you run away.

348
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,410
How annoying is it that we had the same jacket?

349
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:59,810
What are you doing? Give me back my clothes and my phone.

350
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,500
Lady Kang must be waiting for me.

351
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,090
- Don't mess with me unless you want to die.
- What?

352
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,020
Hey! Give me back my jacket, you unlucky bastard!

353
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:23,420
Yeah, what would I expect from someone who ran away after leaving a woman behind?

354
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,040
I'm going to let you go this time—

355
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:39,810
By any chance, did you plan this? Why?

356
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:43,090
Is it because I asked you for a vacation?

357
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,950
Don't think of any strange misunderstandings and

358
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,240
you should rest until your ears heal completely.

359
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,270
I'll contact you then.

360
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,030
What in the world? How can a woman have no fear? You have no fear.

361
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,800
It wasn't enough that you attacked a group of gangsters so you plainly showed your face on television.

362
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,300
What are you going to do if those gangsters come to find you and retaliate, huh?

363
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,820
She's over here. Over here.

364
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,130
Is the direction really that important right now?!

365
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:23,870
- Oh, you scared me. Aish, with hot-tempered head...
- Aish? Aish?

366
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:28,740
Exactly who do you take after that you have absolutely no fear? What did I tell you?

367
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,640
I told you to pretend you don't see anything if you see something unfair happening, like I do!

368
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,510
- You naturally can't see—
- What good did you do that you're talking back?!

369
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:40,410
You're teaching her so well! A father should be telling his children to stand up if they see something unfair happening.

370
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,250
That's!

371
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,640
Because you haven't given birth to a child. Stop anyone in the world and ask them.

372
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,250
Ask them if anyone would want their daughter to stand up to a group of gangsters.

373
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:52,750
She can protect herself very well so don't worry.

374
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:56,210
She doesn't go to any other school, she goes to Moor—

375
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,700
What?

376
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,070
Oh, yeah. I have the sorghum and azuki bean rice cake and white kimchi here.

377
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,280
Eat them when you're craving something.

378
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,620
Where are you trying to go?

379
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:09,350
I'll catch the fish that you like and make you some sushi mixed rice.

380
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:12,960
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!
- Soon Deok, Soon Deok!

381
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,870
Hey, you guys messed with the wrong person. Let go of me!

382
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,210
Do you know who I am? Let go of me, aish!

383
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,920
Hey, you guys. Do you think I've been kidnapped like this only once or twice?

384
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,050
- Aren't you going to let go of me?!
- Anyway, I think it's going to be impossible to escort him quietly.

385
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,600
- Put in the call.
- Yes.

386
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,860
- Mom!
-Son.

387
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,200
Aish, I've been kidnapped again.

388
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,020
Just give them some money and get them off of me so I can go to you quickly.

389
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,220
Truthfully, your father is the one

390
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,500
who ordered your kidnapping this time.

391
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,350
- Why?
- To send you to Moorim School.

392
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,550
Moorim School?

393
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:57,860
So that's why you should have just quietly gone over there when I sent you the text.

394
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,890
He sponsored the K-pop concert to send you there.

395
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,050
What exactly is Moorim School?

396
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,630
- Why are you sending me there?
- You were cut from TV-ing weren't you?

397
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,580
and you were also cut from Luxembourg.

398
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:16,370
Now, there are no colleges in the world that will accept you.

399
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,280
Do I really have to graduate from a college?

400
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,470
I'm the heir of Shanghai Group so who's going to say anything just because I don't graduate from college?

401
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,980
- Chairman...
- According to whom are you the heir?

402
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:35,690
Stop nagging and just go. Go there and study to death for a year.

403
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,660
I won't say this twice.

404
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,710
C-Chairman! Father!

405
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,080
Do you really have to go this far?

406
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,550
He needs to reset his thinking.

407
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:53,660
He has to become a human being first. He's been expelled 20 times from middle school to now. Does that even make sense?

408
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:59,010
For a child who was forcefully taken away from his mother, isn't it just a relief that he grew up brightly like that?

409
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,960
Why are you only so cruel towards Chi Ang?

410
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,020
If he graduates properly this time,

411
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,790
come to China together.

412
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,870
Really?

413
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:15,890
You're not planning something, right?

414
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:21,130
No... Something like, it's really hard to graduate from there or...

415
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,090
I'm fine

416
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:27,010
so can't you just take our Chi Ang with you to China?

417
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,320
China has a Shaolin temple.

418
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,220
Why do you have to send him to Moorim School?

419
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:43,040
This is all for you so please don't be upset, Young Master.

420
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:50,580
It's not that but I'm...urgent.

421
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,490
Pardon?

422
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,430
I said it's urgent! I have to use the bathroom.

423
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,110
Call the Chairman.

424
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,010
I said it's coming out! Aren't you going to stop the car?

425
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,850
Stop the car!

426
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,320
I understand that you want to watch me poop but leave while I'm being nice.

427
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,550
Ah, still—

428
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,700
Leave. Aren't you going to leave?

429
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,650
Turn around.

430
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,230
- Aish, what's Moorim School?
- Catch him!

431
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:39,400
Do you think I'll go to that type of school? I'm not going! I won't ever go!

432
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,410
You should just give up now and come with us.

433
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:55,610
Don't come! If you take one more step from there, I'll jump.

434
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,610
Do you think I won't be able to do it?

435
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,290
I can't swim, the only sport I can't do is swimming.

436
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:06,710
If I fall from here, this happens.

437
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:11,420
Even if I'm an illegitimate child, my parents won't let you guys be if I die here.

438
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:14,520
- Please calm down and talk with me—
- Don't come!

439
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,800
I'll really fall. I'll really die.

440
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,820
Young Master!

441
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,440
- Aish!
- Aish, seriously!

442
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,120
Mom, I guess I'm really going to die.

I'm going crazy.

Aigoo!

455
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,420
You're so heavy!

456
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,670
Hey!

457
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,930
Look here, look here, look here, pull yourself together.

458
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,430
Ah, seriously!

459
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,020
Ah, seriously!

460
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:32,200
I wasn't planning to do something like this.

461
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,260
Ah, seriously...

462
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:58,100
Mermaid...princess?

463
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,180
- Kick out the Yoon Si Woo who ran away! Kick him out!
- Kick him out!

464
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,330
- Kick him out!
- Oh?

465
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:23,510
It's Yoon Si Woo's car, it's Yoon Si Woo's car! His car!

466
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,310
You can't hear? Does it hurt?

467
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:57,590
Come to Moorim School. The Headmaster will be able to cure it for you.

468
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:10,790
Moorim School

469
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,340
What are you thinking about, Yoon Si Woo?

470
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,430
Call me when you arrive at Moorim School

471
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:40,290
Son, have you still not arrived at Moorim School?

472
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,160
Moorim School?

473
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,440
It seems you're awake now.

474
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:16,570
Go away! Go away!

475
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,310
Have you woken up now, young man?

476
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:35,570
Oh my, your body is quite nice.

477
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,970
Oh? Young man? Young man?

478
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,090
I ate well.

479
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,670
It wasn't anything much. Why would a young man be so surprised over something like that?

480
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:11,910
I opened my eyes and a strange old man was caressing my body.

481
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:15,220
- If you were me, wouldn't you be surprised?
- Well,

482
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,650
your body should be refreshed thanks to me.

483
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:20,570
There are people who come to find me all the way from Seoul to receive my massages.

484
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,770
Ah, but why exactly did you fall into the ocean?

485
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:26,910
Where do you live and what do your parents do?

486
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:30,330
You're asking him all sorts of questions. It'll be bothersome for him.

487
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:34,460
We even saved his life so why can't I ask him questions like these?

488
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:39,580
My name is Wang Chi Ang.

489
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:45,980
My father, Wang Hao, is the CEO of Shanghai Group, the best company in China.

490
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,880
Since you saved the heir of the Shanghai Group, you will be compensated generously.

491
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:55,800
Oh... Should I completely demolish this house and build you a new one?

492
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,360
He's completely lost it, he's lost it.

493
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,670
I think I should also say hello to the mermaid who saved me.

494
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:04,850
Where is she?

495
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:08,510
Oh, she's outside so you can go outside. Go outside quickly.

496
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,280
Really?

497
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,490
I called the police but seeing that there's still been no call yet,

498
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,620
didn't someone throw him away or something?

499
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,880
If something goes wrong

500
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,220
we might have to keep on feeding him, even though we don't have enough for ourselves.

501
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,980
♫  Hey girl, you're my sunshine ♫

502
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,200
♫  Hey girl, from the moment I first met you (love, love, love) ♫

503
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:03,140
♫ I've been feeling shaky whoa-oh-oh ♫

504
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:06,160

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,360
♬ Everywhere Always there ♬

506
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:15,660
♫ I wait for you ♫

507
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,440
Oh? You're awake.

508
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:24,820
Yeah, he woke. But he's so weird.

509
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,460
He says he's the son of a Chinese chaebol.

510
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,380
Since you saved me, tell me what you want.

511
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:36,060
I'll grant you anything you wish.

512
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,600
I'm fine. If you're awake now, go back to your house. I have to go to school.

513
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,100
You're a student?

514
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:46,500
It's not rude to ask someone's age in Korea, right? How old are you?

515
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,540
Hey, don't be nosy and get beat up.

516
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:56,340
Move aside. Our Soon Deok is a student of Moorim School.

517
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:59,430
Moorim School? You attend that school?

518
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,790
Quiet! I'll die if my dad finds out.

519
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:04,000
Son!

520
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,450
Mom!

521
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,300
Are you okay? What in the world?

522
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,170
What's with how you look?

523
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:29,540
This won't do. Moorim School or whatever, take him to China right now!

524
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:38,600
Mom, I'll go. I'll attend Moorim School.

525
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,690
What's the reason you suddenly changed your mind?

526
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:00,330
I know that you don't trust me.

527
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:04,120
However, I'll really do it properly this time.

528
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,910
Please trust me.

529
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:09,520
In return, when it's time to return to China, I want to go with my mom.

530
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,560
If it's about your mom, we already agreed to do that.

531
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,200
Please allow me to take my mom and one more person.

532
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:25,290
♬ Now open the ears which were plugged♬

533
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:33,700
♫ Shout with a voice about to explode. Say, oh. Oh. Oh, Oh. Go crazy today ♬

536
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,700
♬ Let's party seriously out of our minds.♬

537
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,950
♫ I'm the best, best. I'm different, different. ♫

538
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:53,200
♫
I don't know either, don't know. I'll show you♫

539
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,660
♫ I'm fast, fast. Feel this. ♫

540
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:01,380
I'm in the middle of a mountain...

541
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:22,390
Are we still far?

542
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:25,450
We're almost there. We just have to go a bit more.

543
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,700
That's your twentieth time saying those words.

544
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,990
It's hard for me, Mermaid Princess.

545
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:32,030
Stop looking for a mermaid.

546
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,790
You can't even pronounce it right.

547
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:36,810
If you keep being like that, I'm not going to take you.

548
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,750
I got it.

549
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:43,340
But is the path to Moorim School usually this complicated?

550
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:46,660
This place, by nature, isn't a place just anybody can find.

551
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:52,430
Don't say you don't know anything about our school.

552
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Huh? It's tiger grass. Wait a minute.

553
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,200
This is the best for healing wounds. Wait a minute.

554
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:13,610
It's a tiger swallowtail butterfly.

555
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:16,870
No, not a tiger swallowtail butterfly! Tiger grass!

556
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:19,780
Oh, it's really a butterfly.

557
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:24,630
There is a saying in China that good things will happen if you see a tiger swallowtail butterfly.

558
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,750
There's a saying like that in Korea too.

559
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,170
Really? Then should I catch it for you?

560
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,830
Forget about the tiger swallowtail butterfly.

561
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:34,450
Just gather some tiger grass, please.

562
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:43,850
But then ... Wang Chi Ang!

563
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:07,350
Why did he go off to catch a butterfly?

564
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:09,810
Wang Chi Ang!

565
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:17,200
What? Could he have run away? He couldn't have.

566
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,930
Wang Chi Ang!

567
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,070
Yoon Si Woo?

568
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,770
What did Yoon Si Woo do?

569
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:59,450
He suddenly went inside his car and drove off that way.

570
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,180
What brings you here?

571
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,230
Did you stalk me?

572
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:08,490
I did think that it was a trap.

573
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,570
What? What are you talking about?

574
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:15,350
It was weird that a group of hooligans suddenly appeared,

575
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:18,640
and it was strange that you were waiting right there as if to interfere.

576
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,840
Who ordered you?

577
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:23,120
How much did you get paid to turn me into trash?!

578
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,800
President Choi ordered you to do it, didn't he?

579
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,100
I helped you since you were afraid of the hooligans but what? I received money?

580
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,000
Then why did you suddenly interfere in someone else's business?

581
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,080
I already told you that I wanted to help you.

582
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,830
You wanted to help me for no reason at all?

583
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:48,060
Seeing your thought level, it would serve you right to call you a loser.

584
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,840
Tell me properly! Who ordered you?!

585
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,960
Let go of that hand!

586
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:04,450
Omo, omo.

587
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,580
Professor Kim.

588
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:52,000
By any chance, is this...?

589
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,200
The barrier has been removed.
