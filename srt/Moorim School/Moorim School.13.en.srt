1
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,490
You wanted to meet Seon Ah?

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,420
I don't understand. If there was anything you wanted to tell Seon Ah,

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,380
there could have been a more peaceful method than kidnapping.

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,200
Wouldn't coming to the school do?

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,790
Do you think the barrier built by Headmaster Hwang Moo Song

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,660
is simply to protect you guys?

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,320
Don't you think that, with the pretext of protecting his students,

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,090
he is actually hiding something terrible that he did?

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,500
Oh my, oh my!

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,660
Yeop Jeong!

11
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,810
The family protecting the Cheon Ui Joo were assassinated.

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,480
The one who set up the attack at that time,

13
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,150
in order to steal the key to the Cheon Ui Joo,

14
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,300
burned the house down

15
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:17,590
and kidnapped the four-year-old girl holding a part of the key.

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,090
Stop it!

17
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,790
Stop!

18
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,680
We need to stop the fight! If he continues ...

19
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,370
The culprit had no place to hide,

20
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:45,450
so he entered deep into the woods of Moorim Mountain, established a barrier,

21
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,410
and hid along with that child.

22
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,420
- Are you now saying...
- That man

23
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,600
is your headmaster, Hwang Moo Song.

24
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,760
Is what I said wrong, Headmaster?

25
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,950
Moorim School
- Episode 13 -

26
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,150
What is he saying? Are you...

27
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,750
I mean, is Seon Ah not your daughter?

28
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,200
This can't be.

29
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,240
What on earth are you talking about, Father?

30
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,870
I did not really intend to talk with you in such a place,

31
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,800
but it seems that my son and your students have some misunderstandings about me.

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,200
In front of your students, please explain personally, Headmaster Hwang.

33
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,630
It looks like the truth is not what you are looking for.

34
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,060
Your ambition blinded you and made you kill your friend and his family.

35
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,860
You even kidnapped a child to get the key to Cheon Ui Joo.

36
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:30,140
So aren't you, Hwang Moo Song, the destructive force?

37
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,280
If Hwang Seon Ah, who everyone considers your daughter,

38
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,050
is actually Chae Yoon's daughter, Chae Yeong...

39
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,770
Headmaster!

40
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,180
That is correct.

41
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,640
Just as you said, Seon Ah is Chae Yoon's daughter, Yeong.

42
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,730
Did you really, because of that key... Your friend...

43
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,000
That's right. I killed him.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,090
That warped emotion, envy, led me to kill Yoon.

45
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,940
Maybe the destructive force ... really was inside me all along.

46
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,170
Where is the key that you stole along with Chae Yoon's daughter?

47
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:57,020
Chairman Wang. If your goal is the key to Cheon Ui Joo,

48
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,610
I have to tell you that I don't have it.

49
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,030
So you want to hide until the end.

50
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,260
Then, should I ask the girl who thinks of you as her father

51
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,950
if she has ever seen the key?

52
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,750
What...

53
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,900
What is going on in here?

54
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,230
God, I'm so uneasy!

55
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,290
Please just wait a minute!

56
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,410
We would like to apologize to the spectators.

57
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,130
All matches and the entirety of today's Tournament schedule

58
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,760
have been cancelled due to sudden circumstances.

59
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,160
- But this...
- Really?

60
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,420
This... Damn it!

61
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,150
The parents are reacting very strongly.

62
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,610
You did well. Great work.

63
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,180
What have I even done, really?

64
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:15,220
Weren't the outsiders, Choi Ho, Yeop Jeong, Yeop Poong, even Chi Ang

65
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:21,760
carrying out your directive, as was your plan after all?

66
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,410
They were all bombs ready to explode.

67
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,400
I did nothing but ignite the end of the fuse.

68
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,580
I am very curious as to how Headmaster Hwang will react to this situation.

69
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,690
If it stays like this, the departure of students is a matter of time.

70
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,190
And what would be the purpose of a school without students?

71
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,960
Come quickly!

72
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,670
Chi Ang, Chi Ang!

73
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,950
Where on earth is Chi Ang? Chi Ang!

74
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,700
Soon Deok, please!

75
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,560
She must have left already knowing how you would feel.

76
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,530
She kept assuring me it was a trustworthy school, but what the hell is this? What in the world?

77
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,220
Soon Deok! Soon Deok!

78
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,490
How on earth are we supposed to understand all this?

79
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,010
The Headmaster told me something once.

80
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,590
The fact that my best friend was like an obstacle I could not defeat

81
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:40,950
was, to me, a burden too heavy to bear.

82
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:47,750
Sometimes, when I had a heavy heart, there were times I wished he would just disappear forever.

83
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:55,860
His envy caused the death of his precious friend. If this means murder...

84
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,010
This can't be!

85
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,480
He lived while blaming himself.

86
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:05,680
He must have thought that not being able to protect his friend is no different than killing him.

87
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,390
The headmaster I know and trust could never do such a thing.

88
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,240
That's right. I, too,

89
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,590
hope it was just a misunderstanding on my father's part.

90
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,680
Even if this aspect isn't true, what about Seon Ah?

91
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,550
He admitted that.

92
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,730
She thought he was her dad all her life and she loves him so much.

93
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,850
What will happen to her if she finds out, after all these years, that he isn't her actual dad?

94
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,680
What do you mean?

95
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,790
What are you guys talking about?

96
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,250
- Hwang Seon Ah...
- I'm asking what kind of nonsense you're spouting right now!

97
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,320
How could such a shameful incident take place

98
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,640
when the trusted Moorim sponsor, Chairman Wang, was present?

99
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,080
Hiding and pretending to teach students for 18 years...

100
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,900
Please say something already!

101
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,590
Will you just keep silent?!

102
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,320
During these 18 years, many such tournaments have taken place.

103
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,830
They helped push forward many valuable people,

104
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:49,290
and the fact that the alumni are now working hard in various sections of the association is undeniable.

105
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,160
What are you talking about now?

106
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,400
I would like to explain how the annual tournament, which has occurred uneventfully each year,

107
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:03,280
was the source of such unfortunate events this time.

108
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,860
The reason why I agreed to open the tournament to outside participants this year,

109
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,830
and invite non-students is because, during our field trip,

110
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,400
one of our students was unfortunately kidnapped.

111
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:23,460
I understand that a rumor got out that the key to Cheon Ui Joo is hidden in this school.

112
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,760
Is it really just a rumor?

113
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,840
The seeds of doubt give birth to mistrust,

114
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,400
and getting rid of the hostility that bloomed from a mistrust so strong

115
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,460
isn't as simple as pulling out a weed.

116
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,520
Just like how, for years on end, I was suspected of being the destructive force.

117
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,580
I made this competition an open one today

118
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,380
specifically in order to find the real destructive force.

119
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,700
Someone who thinks the Cheon Ui Joo key is hidden here in this school

120
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,240
couldn't have resisted the temptation

121
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,240
to come here when the barrier has been lifted for the first time in 18 years.

122
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,800
Son, get ready, quick.

123
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,420
I am never sending you to such a sloppy school again! Hurry up!

124
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,100
I found out clearly through this incident.

125
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,530
The people who came with the sole innocent purpose of seeing their children

126
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:41,170
are rushing to flee this place in order to protect their loved ones.

127
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:46,140
However, the people whose goal was the key to Cheon Ui Joo,

128
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,540
must plan on remaining here

129
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,130
and forcing me out of this place, by whatever means.

130
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,120
Instead on reflecting upon your mistakes,

131
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,450
are you accusing us of being the destructive force? What kind of nonsense is that?

132
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,390
If your assumption holds water, I must be the top candidate for the destructive force.

133
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:18,470
The incident during the field trip was purely to verify

134
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:25,050
whether your so-called daughter, Seon Ah, is actually Chae Yoon's lost daughter.

135
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,930
That wasn't because I doubted you,

136
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,910
but because I wanted to trust you.

137
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,890
However, haven't you said it yourself?

138
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,770
That Seon Ah is Chae Yoon's daughter.

139
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,230
What could be better proof

140
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,590
of you being the destructive force?

141
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:55,350
All I did was face the true destructive force and save Seon Ah— No, save Yeong.

142
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,640
Let's say that is true.

143
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:08,890
Then you must have learned something from the child you protected for so long , haven't you?

144
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:16,390
As I expected, the reason he sponsored us was his desire to obtain the Cheon Ui Joo.

145
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,580
Please stop.

146
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:28,230
This isn't the place to debate an incident from 18 years ago.

147
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:36,450
Headmaster Hwang, the Moorim Association

148
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,930
has lost much of its old power after the disappearance of the key to Cheon Ui Joo.

149
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:47,390
This is why I had very high expectations of this school.

150
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,130
These expectations are far from being met so the disappointment is just as high.

151
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,270
I couldn't change the students' attitudes even a little bit.

152
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,430
I caused this big incident.

153
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:08,790
But I have faith in the students. They will not disappoint again.

154
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,210
All the students must have fled by now.

155
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,550
What is the reason for having faith in a school without students?

156
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,330
The students will definitely return.

157
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,510
There is no need for that.

158
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,120
As of today, this school is closed.

159
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,350
Chairman...

160
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,400
A man almost died!

161
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,720
In a martial arts match, there were dirty tricks and blood!

162
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,260
I felt murderous violence in that assault.

163
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,940
Today's incident is nothing but the destructive force's scheme.

164
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,100
I cannot accept this decision.

165
00:14:52,100 --> 00:15:00,040
Whether you or someone else is the destructive force,

166
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:06,460
I cannot believe what anyone says about that issue.
I will not repeat it.

167
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,530
I will step down.

168
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:25,850
Please at least protect the school and the students.

169
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:39,440
My dad... My dad kidnapped me because of the Cheon Ui Joo?

170
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,490
His friend...

171
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:50,660
I mean, he killed my entire family?

172
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,730
It obviously has to be a misunderstanding. We should find out the details from the headmaster himself.

173
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,060
My name is Yeong?

174
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,090
I'm not my dad's daughter?

175
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,210
What the hell are you saying...

176
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,790
I seriously can't understand.

177
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,430
Yeop Poong was moved to a city hospital.

178
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,490
The injuries are fortunately not that serious.

179
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,490
How did things escalate into this?
And why is the school so quiet?

180
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,830
What do you think? Things are getting worse.

181
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,190
The students have all returned to their homes.

182
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,050
Or rather, 'were dragged out' would be a more appropriate way to put it.

183
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,330
Don't worry about that. I will persuade the parents.

184
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:02,270
It isn't just today's incident. The parents must have heard some weird rumors,

185
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,270
and I even heard someone say the headmaster killed somebody.

186
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,770
Where is the headmaster?

187
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,950
He is still in a meeting with the Moorim representatives.

188
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:27,240
The headmaster set fire to that house because of the Cheon Ui Joo.

189
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,370
Your actual name is Yeong.

190
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,160
You're the daughter of the headmaster's dead friend.

191
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,600
I think leaving her alone would be best now.

192
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,640
Don't you have to go to your father? He must be so worried.

193
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,470
They must have caused a ruckus already.

194
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,630
Go to your dad. You can't keep avoiding it.

195
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,330
He was so against this school anyway...

196
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:36,390
He'll probably drag me home just like it happened to the others.

197
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:43,750
But I can't leave Seon Ah like that.

198
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:53,640
I'll stay with Seon Ah. Calming your father down should be your priority now.

199
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:03,560
This isn't what I wanted to show them when I ran away.

200
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,040
It's okay.

201
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:22,540
If I go now, I might never return.

202
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:29,760
Don't worry, you will. I will make it so that you can.

203
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,810
Don't be hurt.

204
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,160
Okay.

205
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,510
Don't be like this and let's just go back today.

206
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,550
Soon Deok must be hiding somewhere.

207
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:51,780
I will blackmail her and tell her that you're very sick and even drag her out to bring her to you.

208
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,360
Let go of me.

209
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,570
There's no need for that.

210
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,590
Soon Deok!

211
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,310
For now, let's go.

212
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:35,620
This is the worst. I hoped so much that it wouldn't end up like this.

213
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:51,430
I must tell the association to find the one responsible immediately.

214
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:57,410
Until then, Professor Beop Gong should act as

215
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:01,010
interim headmaster in Hwang Moo Song's place.

216
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,460
Yes. I understand.

217
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,720
Make sure that

218
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,500
Hwang Moo Song leaves this school. Do not ever take your eyes off of him.

219
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,370
Yes.

220
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,770
How is Chae Yoon doing?

221
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,530
He still doesn't know anything.

222
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,590
He is resting to recover his body.

223
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,900
He will soon be able to function. Prepare yourselves.

224
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,010
Headmaster! What's going on?

225
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:42,910
What do they mean Professor Beop Gong will replace you?

226
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,010
That's how things went.

227
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,020
What?

228
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,110
It seems I will have to leave this school for a while.

229
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:57,630
What do you mean leave Chi Ang here?

230
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:02,720
I am absolutely not leaving him here behind. Absolutely not! You go first!

231
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,930
Do you want to see me die?
Should I die right here, in front of you?

232
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,610
Where is my father?

233
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,140
Chairman!

234
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,140
What happened?

235
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,600
You did something great. Something amazing!

236
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,780
It's the first time I hear you complimenting me.

237
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,960
Are you sad that your father complimented you?

238
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,640
Your child got beaten up and the school you're sponsoring is a mess.

239
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,440
But you seem strangely happy.

240
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:05,150
I will persuade your mom. You stay at this school.

241
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,300
You have many things to do from now on.

242
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:14,310
What on earth are you scheming? What do you want from me?

243
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:29,280
To look straight ahead

244
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,810
and live the right way, with a cool head!

245
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:51,580
Don't you ever forget that I want you to take over the Shanghai Group.

246
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,500
All of this is for you.

247
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,190
He's saying it's all for my sake.

248
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,540
No, it's not. It's not, Father.

249
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,570
Any father in the world

250
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:39,770
would always be there for their child and care for them.

251
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,290
Always worrying for their safety

252
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:50,500
and doing whatever they could to protect them.

253
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:01,360
But you haven't even asked me,

254
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,580
all the way to the end, whether I'm alright or I'm hurt.

255
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,240
Seon Ah.

256
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,130
Can we have a talk?

257
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,770
I am so tired right now. Let's talk tomorrow, yeah, tomorrow.

258
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,300
Are you hurt anywhere?

259
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,880
I told you I wanted to talk tomorrow.

260
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,180
Or let's just not talk at all.

261
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,140
I'm so scared. So can you please don't say anything

262
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,330
and say that it's all a lie, okay?

263
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,360
- Seon Ah...
- You told me this, Dad.

264
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,860
You told me I was born and raised here.

265
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:26,740
You and this school were my entire life.

266
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,890
So how do you expect me to believe this is all a lie?

267
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:45,200
Since you never mentioned my mom, I just assumed

268
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,370
something really bad must have happened.
I only remember her lullaby,

269
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:58,460
but I never even mentioned that
because I thought it would hurt you.

270
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,650
I am sorry.

271
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:13,050
Is what the others said true?

272
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:19,320
Did you kill my real father?

273
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,640
I am sorry.

274
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,740
This can't be true.

275
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:20,080
♬  Yeah I'm alive, ♬

276
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,320
♬  Look straight at me.♬

277
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,480
♬  For dozens of times I will get up once again♬

278
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,570
♬  Yeah I am alive ♬

279
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,720
♬  Watch me. ♬

280
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,630
♬  Now close both eyes and feel me ♬

281
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,700
♬  In the deep pitch-black darkness♬

282
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,000
♬  Like a child who has lost his way♬

283
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,300
♬  Even if I scream♬

284
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,560
♬  No one will hear♬

285
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:50,000
♬  Buried deep in my heart (my spark) ♬

286
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,850
♬  Yeah I'm alive, ♬

287
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,240
♬  Look straight at me. ♬

288
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,640
♬  For dozens of times I will get up once again♬

289
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,320
♬  Yeah I am alive
 Watch me
 Now close both eyes and feel me ♬

290
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,640
♬  Watch me. ♬

291
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,790
♬  Now close both eyes and feel me ♬

292
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:07,150
♬  Hey, hey, in front of everyone, ♬

293
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:10,270
♬  Hey, hey, I'll show you what I've got ♬

294
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,700
♬  Hey, hey, alive and breathing, ♬

295
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,470
♬  I will be born again.♬

296
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,580
I have heard the news.

297
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,710
You cannot leave. What will this school amount to if you leave?

298
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,300
Professor Kim.

299
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,240
At today's Moorim Tournament, and during the field trip as well,

300
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,220
I felt that the incidents were strange.

301
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,820
The sole reason I agreed to the opening of the barrier, in spite of all my doubts

302
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,930
was the fact that I thought you had a plan.

303
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:02,360
Professor Kim, thank you for believing in me for so long.

304
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,660
Are you really going to leave like this?

305
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,610
There are things that slipped my mind

306
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,740
while I was busy running the school.

307
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,170
Is any of that more important than the school, the students who trusted you,

308
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:22,990
and protecting the key to the Cheon Ui Joo?

309
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:27,320
Do not worry about the key to the Cheon Ui Joo.

310
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,670
They will not find the one who has it.

311
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,770
Are you really planning to let him leave like this?

312
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,900
I understand you, but the headmaster right now...

313
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,500
Seon Ah.

314
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:28,460
I remember when you first came here, eighteen years ago.

315
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,330
Yes.

316
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,480
There were many in the association who doubted you.

317
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,280
It was truly hard to find professors.

318
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,480
Back then, you told me this.

319
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,390
"Good will always prevail.

320
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:52,180
"The evil will never be as strong as the good,

321
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,800
"and the latter will always emerge victorious in the end."

322
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,500
Do not forget those words.

323
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,950
As one lives,

324
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,360
one might wonder

325
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,300
what evil and good exactly are.

326
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,810
Would justice

327
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,060
always be the answer?

328
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,120
Are you just going to leave like this?

329
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,420
Have you really killed my father and deceived me for all these years?

330
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,880
Seon Ah...

331
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,070
I never want to see you, a person like that.

332
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,540
Don't ...

333
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,350
ever come back.

334
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,570
I cannot accept this decision.

335
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:34,970
Whether the destructive force is you

336
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,080
or someone else,

337
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,430
I cannot believe what anyone says about the matter.

338
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:46,370
There are things that slipped my mind while running this school.

339
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:52,100
Is there anything more important than protecting the Cheon Ui Joo?

340
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,150
Headmaster!

341
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,570
You can't leave right now.

342
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,710
You can't leave Seon Ah like that.

343
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,220
Will you do this one thing for me?

344
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:20,260
There is a picture in my desk drawer.

345
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,750
Give that picture to Seon Ah.

346
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,220
This man...

347
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,180
Are you from the Moorim Association?

348
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,020
How do you know about the Moorim Association?

349
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,390
He isn't dead.

350
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,940
He's definitely alive.

351
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,350
It's said that that night

352
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,990
the man who took your child went blind.

353
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,790
Hwang Moo Song asked me about him too.

354
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,450
It's not Hwang Moo Song?

355
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,310
It's Sim Bong San.

356
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:16,460
If you find him, you'll find the child.

357
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,250
No...

358
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,570
No, no...

359
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,020
No, please no...

360
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,150
Oh no, oh...

361
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:43,130
I heard someone found me among fallen leaves when hiking.

362
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,230
No, don't...

363
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,940
Dad, I'm here.

364
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,890
It's alright.

365
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,530
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

366
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:11,250
Oh, I'm so sorry...

367
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:15,090
I didn't mean to...

368
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,840
I didn't know... I didn't know.

369
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,890
No, no...

370
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,210
I didn't do that.

371
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,360
The headmaster told me to give you this.

372
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,380
It's a picture of your parent.

373
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,800
Seon Ah.

374
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,670
Believe in the headmaster.

375
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:20,630
When I arrived that day, eighteen years ago,

376
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,400
the house was already on fire.

377
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,900
Se Ryeong...

378
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,290
Yoon's wife was already dead

379
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:36,230
and Yoon and his son, Joon, were nowhere to be found.

380
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,010
I had no choice but to dodge the remaining destructive forces and run away with Yeong.

381
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,340
Why haven't you told Seon Ah?

382
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,600
If it were known that she is Chae Yoon's daughter,

383
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,120
Seon Ah's life would have been in danger.

384
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,990
Is it because of the key to the Cheon Ui Joo?

385
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:59,920
That's all the more reason for you to stay by her side!

386
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,670
You have to protect Seon Ah!

387
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:06,410
Seon Ah knows nothing about the key.

388
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,150
She's never seen it

389
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,360
so she will be alright.

390
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:17,270
They will most likely come after me.

391
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,550
Are you leaving in order to protect her?

392
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:27,440
Seon Ah and all of you.

393
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,260
Headmaster...

394
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:36,050
Believe in me and hang on for a while.

395
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,880
No matter what,

396
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,540
I will return to the school.

397
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,210
Maybe he told me all he wanted to tell you.

398
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,640
I want to hear none of that.

399
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,850
The headmaster keeps blaming himself for not protecting his friend.

400
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,860
He thinks not protecting him is the same as killing him,

401
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,660
and he locked himself away from the world for eighteen years.

402
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,380
Can't you understand?

403
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,740
Please just stop!

404
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:13,660
Do me a favor. Please leave.

405
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,740
The man in that photo,

406
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,520
the guy who is supposedly your father... I saw him.

407
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:50,380
Your real dad is definitely not dead.

408
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:30,800
Although I told Seon Ah like that, I know that understanding

409
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:37,430
and knowing, as well as accepting are different.

410
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,800
That's why no one can be comforted or forgiven right now.

411
00:41:51,860 --> 00:42:01,360
The barrier has opened for the first time in 18 years, but now, all the doors are closed.

412
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,060
I thought it would be okay if I just pulled myself up,

413
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:31,660
but everyone's left, even the headmaster...

414
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:37,390
What will happen

415
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,130
to the school now?

416
00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:01,380
After I left the school, someone came looking for me.

417
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:06,430
Those people were interested in the tournament.

418
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:09,200
They must have planned this from the beginning.

419
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,000
I think not only I, but also Yeop Jeong, was played by them.

420
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,660
Were they from the Shanghai Group?

421
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,450
Yeah. They might have gotten Wang Chi Ang too.

422
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:20,560
Chi Ang isn't at fault.

423
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:27,650
Chi Ang knew nothing.

424
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:34,490
I'm sorry. The headmaster, Professor Kim and all of you guys trusted me.

425
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:38,960
I messed it all up. Because of me, everything became a mess.

426
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,230
I understand how you must have felt, taking out that knife.

427
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:48,910
But you didn't go all the way. Isn't that the important thing?

428
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:56,560
When you raised that knife, you didn't think of Chi Ang as your opponent, but as your friend.

429
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:03,880
You know... Although I've continuously been in the lower rank up to now,

430
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,050
I learned a lot there.

431
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:14,750
Will the headmaster be okay?

432
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,990
He will return.

433
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:22,540
It will all be okay if we protect this place as if the headmaster is here.

434
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:28,990
Right now, there's nothing else we can do.

435
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,330
The chairman has gone back to Shanghai.

436
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:41,200
You must know what's going on in his head, Secretary Jang.

437
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,760
He must have had something in mind by sending Chi Ang there. Am I wrong?

438
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,960
Everything is for the sake of the company.

439
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,470
What is good for the company is for Young Master Chi Ang.

440
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:54,470
Please make sure to tell the chairman this.

441
00:44:54,470 --> 00:45:00,080
If my Chi Ang gets hurt, I will not just stand by and watch any more.

442
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:13,010
You did something great. Something amazing!

443
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:18,170
I will persuade your mom, so you stay here at the school.

444
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:20,300
What on earth are you scheming?

445
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,420
What exactly do you want from me?

446
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:26,370
Don't you ever forget that you will be

447
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,940
the successor of Shanghai Group.

448
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,050
All this is for your sake.

449
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,990
Where is the key you stole along with Chae Yoon's daughter?

450
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:45,390
Should I ask the one who thought of you as her father?

451
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:49,870
Whether she's seen the key?

452
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:55,160
The reason he sent me here...

453
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:00,460
Could it all have been because of the key?

454
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,640
Get up quickly, Dad.

455
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,160
- Soon Deok.
- Yes?

456
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:30,840
If you don't want to see me die, don't you dare ever go back there, understand?

457
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,990
Soon Deok.

458
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:53,230
What your dad said... No, forget it.

459
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,680
Whatever it is, say it.

460
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,090
It's not that.

461
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:03,890
He always gets so defensive hearing about that school... Maybe his blindness

462
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:08,100
is connected to your school.

463
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,700
What?

464
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:13,130
What are you talking about?

465
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,610
When I asked him about it, he yelled

466
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:20,680
and told me never to mention this idea in front of you.

467
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:53,150
♬ The countless tears which flowed past me ♬

468
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:57,620
What now, Wang Chi Ang?
♬ were like the end of unknown darkness ♬

469
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:02,100
♬Both when I take another step ♬

470
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,880
♬ and let out a long sigh ♬

471
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:11,410
♬ Where does the road end? ♬

472
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:16,370
♬ Good Bye Good Bye the words to me ♬

473
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:20,360
♬ Good Bye You Please  ♬

474
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:25,460
♬ Don't Say Good Bye ♬

475
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,950
♬ Baby, it looks like I was young then ♬

476
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,850
That can't be.
♬ Baby, it looks like I was a coward then ♬

477
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:36,380
♬ I knew just a connection was there ♬

478
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,130
♬ I thought I could just reach out to you ♬

479
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,630
♬ Baby, I will take care of you ♬

480
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,170
♬ Baby, I'm not afraid of anything ♬

481
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,920
♬ Will you stay with me? ♬

482
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,170
♬ Will you hold me tight? ♬

483
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,670
♬ I also worried a lot ♬

484
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:02,030
♬ I was afraid perhaps you would be far away ♬

485
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:03,920
♬ Without Your Smile  ♬

486
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,820
♬ Without Your Love My Life~ ♬

487
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,800
♬ I'm not afraid of anything ♬

488
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,360
♬ Now I will take care of you ♬

489
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,990
♬ Will you stay here as you are? ♬

490
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,630
♬ Will you just take my hand? ♬

491
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:27,110
♬ I will be the light for you ♬

492
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:30,810
♬ If you also think the same way I do ♬

493
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:34,540
♬ Will you stay with me? ♬

494
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:38,220
♬ Will you hug me close to you? ♬

495
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:41,240
♬ GOODBYE You Please  ♬

496
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,540
♬ Don’t SAY GOODBYE  ♬

497
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:53,430
You must be very confused regarding

498
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:58,420
Headmaster Hwang's sudden departure.

499
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:03,000
However, given the circumstances,

500
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,340
you should understand that this was probably the only sensible choice.

501
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,500
I cannot understand at all.

502
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,360
This is a school founded and grown under Headmaster Hwang's care.

503
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,370
There is no corner of this place he hasn't taken care of.

504
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:21,900
So how can be kicked out in the blink of an eye?

505
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,230
This is unacceptable.

506
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:27,850
Please thoroughly persuade the association to reinstate him.

507
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:30,650
As Professor Yoo Di says,

508
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:39,240
there is no part of this school that Headmaster Hwang Moo Song hasn't touched.

509
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:46,060
Given that, there will be many changes to the school now.

510
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:54,780
If you aren't able to accept this upheaval,

511
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,480
Like the students,

512
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,980
are you saying that we should leave as well?

513
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:05,230
Please don't misunderstand me.

514
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:10,930
That possibility is just there for you to choose.

515
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:18,530
Change to a different school? How on earth are we suppose to do that?

516
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,960
How could he be turning things upside down as though he were waiting for the chance?

517
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,320
It is as expected.

518
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,600
What?

519
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:29,990
Then, are you going to accept the headmaster leaving this way?

520
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:34,030
For now, our first priority is having the students come back to school.

521
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,330
I'll try to persuade their parents.

522
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:40,990
You two continue the curriculum with the remaining students.

523
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,660
Are there classes?

524
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,180
Is this the time to conduct classes?

525
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,980
- Professor Kim ...
- Yoo Di.

526
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,480
For now, I think he is right.

527
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,910
This is when we have to stick to basics.

528
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:58,400
Let's go.

529
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:11,330
You haven't eaten since yesterday.

530
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,790
Aren't you hungry?

531
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,850
Aren't you cold?

532
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,450
If you give this doll a name,

533
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:08,920
it will take away all your sadness and worries.

534
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,050
So, Yeong,

535
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,900
let's

536
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:22,670
give this doll your name, Yeong, okay?

537
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:27,790
Then, tomorrow's nightmares

538
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:32,850
and the bad memories that make you sad will all disappear.

539
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:41,060
Let's put our bad memories into this doll,

540
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:44,840
and hide them away so no one can find them.

541
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,040
Yeong

542
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,040
She is Yeong and he is Joon.

543
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,820
She is Yeong. He is Joon.

544
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:03,520
You gave them the names Yeong and Joon, right?

545
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,860
Dad.

546
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,710
Yoon!

547
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,210
Choi Yoon!

548
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:40,270
At the time, if I had gotten there a little sooner,

549
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:43,050
many things would have been different.

550
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,940
I am positive that he did not leave it in the headmaster's office.

551
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:58,600
I understand.

552
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:04,980
Yes. All right.

553
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:07,950
Yes.

554
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:13,130
I will contact you again later.

555
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,810
Yes.

556
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,010
That's right.

557
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,280
What's the rush?

558
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:46,910
In any case, it'll be difficult for the headmaster to come back.

559
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:54,030
And this school is all mine.

560
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,500
Headmaster Beop Gong

561
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,060
I've heard the news about Moorim School.

562
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:37,770
What are you planning to do?

563
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,930
And the thing I requested?

564
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:44,350
How am I supposed to find a kid that couldn't be found 18 years ago?

565
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:51,270
If that child is still alive, the child will be 21 years old.

566
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:55,430
By any chance, is there someone you suspect?

567
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,140
I have to find that child.

568
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:04,800
That is how I can atone to Yoon, and

569
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:08,930
that is the only way everything can be finished.

570
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:12,670
As you well know, Moorim's movements are out of the ordinary.

571
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:16,990
There are rumors floating around that say that Yoon is still alive.

572
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:52,380
That day, the person who knifed me was my father.

573
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,480
Don't tell me that you don't know anything about Seon Deok's kidnapping.

574
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,960
He's not letting anyone find out the truth.

575
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,420
I had no option but to go find her myself.

576
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:07,560
Why did you send me to this school.

577
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,640
In order to get the key to the Cheon Ui Joo, he set fire to the house and

578
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:28,600
even kidnapped the four-year-old child of the family guarding the key to the Cheon Ui Joo.

579
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,220
So aren't you, Hwang Moo Song, the destructive force?

580
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:37,920
When I arrived that day, the house was already on fire.

581
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:45,140
I had no choice but to avoid the destructive force
and run away with Yeong.

582
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:49,840
Actually, I'm only acting in his place.

583
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:59,740
If I put all the pieces of the puzzle together, the hidden truth will be revealed.

584
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:03,840
Even if it is something horrifying and to be feared,

585
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,200
I get the feeling now that it's something I can no longer avoid.

586
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:12,700
I am now ready.

587
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:22,990
The recent incident involving violence,

588
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:26,430
honestly, what wrong did Headmaster Hwang do?

589
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:29,890
He tried to protect the student and

590
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:35,250
he took responsibility for everything and left.

591
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:42,750
However, truth knows everything.

592
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:47,450
But the real person who has to leave, is in fact you.

593
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,250
But

594
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:53,370
I can expel you.

595
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:59,920
However, I've decided not to.

596
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,220
If you're kicked out of school without earning anything,

597
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:07,040
since you're not in a good standing at home,

598
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,380
it will be the end of everything.

599
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,140
What do you really want to say to me?

600
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:15,940
From now on, I plan

601
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:19,300
to, according to my principles,

602
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,360
transform you into a new person.

603
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:27,490
Yeop Jeong, for all the time you've been here,

604
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:33,110
I know you have been very dissatisfied with this school.

605
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:37,650
Am I wrong?

606
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:42,650
What do you want from me?

607
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:01,580
Wang Chi Ang, let me ask you one thing.

608
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:07,200
From Soon Deok getting kidnapped to the violent events at the tournament,

609
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,580
and the fact that Seon Ah isn't really the headmaster's daughter,

610
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:17,180
what on earth is your father intending?

611
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:22,630
Your ambition blinded you and made you kill your friend and his family.

612
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:24,200
So,

613
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,040
aren't you, Hwang Moo Song, the very destructive force?

614
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:34,270
If the fact that the headmaster had to leave school,

615
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:39,870
if everything was all planned by your father,

616
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:44,250
If that is the fact, if everything

617
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:50,140
was indeed planned by my father, what are you going to do?

618
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:56,310
I've had a weird feeling ever since he sent me to this random school in the countryside.

619
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,210
From the time he promised

620
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,910
to take my mother to the main house,

621
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,000
I should have known.

622
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Never...

623
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,680
He isn't ever the type of person to make those kinds of promises.

624
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,470
Could it be ...

625
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,380
that your father wants the Cheon Ui Joo?

626
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:32,160
Live the right way, with a cool head!

627
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:39,300
Don't you ever forget that I want you
to take over the Shanghai Group.

628
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:50,690
Cheon Ui Joo...

629
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:55,710
It could be what he wants.

630
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:06,070
My father is a terrifying person.

631
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:10,880
If there's something he wants, he will do
whatever he wants to get it.

632
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:13,910
In order to get what he wants,

633
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:16,890
he will stop at nothing.

634
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:21,030
My father is that kind of person.

635
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,860
That's all I know.

636
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:37,170
Watch out.
