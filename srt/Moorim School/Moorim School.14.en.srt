1
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,270
How are you going to find a kid that you couldn't even find 18 years ago?

2
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,050
If that kid was still alive, he would be 21 years old, right?

3
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,030
Is there someone you suspect?

4
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,960
I see a child.

5
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,870
A crying child in the middle of the fire.

6
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,610
I've been scared of fire since I was young. Oppa Si Woo is the same.

7
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,970
Yoon Si Woo is a year younger than you!

8
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,220
There was definitely someone.

9
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,480
I don't know who this person is or this child.

10
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,040
There's also a rumor going around that Yoon is alive.

11
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,650
It had been a while since I was in such pain but this man appeared and alleviated it

12
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,390
with the same method as you, Headmaster.

13
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,970
What did you just say?

14
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,810
I need to meet Hwang Moo Song.

15
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:59,010
If Moo Song was there on that day, 18 years ago, he will know the truth.

16
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,680
I understand.

17
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,510
Also, please find Sim Bong San.

18
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,020
You have to find him.

19
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,250
Moorim School.
- Episode 14 -

20
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,440
I talked with Sang Man hyung and he told me that, like you, everyone is trying to persuade their parents, so not to worry.

21
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,120
They will be back soon. He's surprisingly dependable.

22
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,540
It looks like Professor Kim Dae Ho is trying very hard. So don't worry too much.

23
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,010
Are you listening?

24
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,830
Yeah. You told me five times not to worry.

25
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,660
Did I?

26
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,880
How is Seon Ah ?

27
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,980
She is resilient so she'll be fine soon. How about you?

28
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,100
Sim Soon Deok, are you listening?

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,070
Yeah. I'm okay.

30
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,400
How great would it be if we could all go back to the school soon?

31
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,330
It's not like I'm in a position to say such things.

32
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't say this; explain it well to your father.

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,490
Then you'll be able to go back to school. That's all that matters.

34
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,980
He loses it when we talk about Moorim School.

35
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,440
Maybe the reason why he can' t see

36
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,140
is connected to your school.

37
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,920
Nothing happened, right?

38
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,430
No. Nothing is going on, really.

39
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,990
Okay, I'll call you later.

40
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,860
Okay.

41
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,550
That man and woman were the people
who kidnapped me during the field trip.

42
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,840
- Aren't you mistaken as to what you saw?
- I said I am certain!

43
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,450
Aren't they working for your father's company?

44
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,150
Answer directly!

45
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,130
Mom.

46
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,850
Chi Ang? Is your body okay?

47
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,760
Yes, Mom.

48
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,250
Are you really okay?

49
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,800
I am.

50
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,770
Mom... do you believe in Father?

51
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,460
Chi Ang...

52
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,330
I know this kind of question is weird.

53
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,400
- Even still—
- He's still your father.

54
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,530
He can be selfish and cold, right? He doesn't know how to say nice things.

55
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,160
But still, the fact that he's your father hasn't changed.

56
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,820
You might not know it, but your father,

57
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:20,350
in his own way, sent you there because he loves you. I believe that.

58
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,480
You're the successor of the Shanghai Group.

59
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,070
Don't ever forget it.

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,390
Chi Ang, I'm...

61
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,160
Don't worry about me, Mom.

62
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,650
I wish you were happy.

63
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,710
Your happiness is all I wish for.

64
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,810
Are you really going to be okay?

65
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,800
Of course. I'm okay.

66
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,390
Yoon Si Woo! Yoon Si Woo!

67
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,380
Yoon Si Woo! Woo!

68
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,960
Woah.

69
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,550
You were surprised, weren't you?

70
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,540
I thought you'd cry. Did you wait long?

71
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,070
Do you finally understand the worry we felt when you went up to Moorim Peak?

72
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,160
When I got all the texts from everyone telling me to come back, my heart went pitter patter.

73
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,540
What do you mean pitter patter? Stop sending so many text messages. Because of you—bing! Bing!

74
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,960
I'm about to go crazy.

75
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,980
Did you settle everything with your parents?

76
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,380
Of course. At this age am I one to give up just because my parents dragged me away?

77
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,750
Teacher Kim kept on begging my parents to let him take me with him.

78
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,930
Thank you all so much for coming back.

79
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,300
We're the ones that came back, so why are you thanking us?

80
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,440
Also, in this school there are a lot more people who have more at stake than you.

81
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,040
This punk...

82
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,030
Let's go in.

83
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,400
So you're telling me you ran away from you family?

84
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,640
I didn't realize I could run so fast. No matter what anyone says, I guess I really am a Moorim student.

85
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,950
I'm in Paris right now.

86
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,110
My father thinks that I am doing language study abroad.

87
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,650
Enough of this, just bring out some food. After being on a hunger strike for two days,

88
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,030
I'm starving.

89
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,300
Ta-dah! Eat this.

90
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,560
Woah!

91
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,310
Why is it so noisy? Aigoo.

92
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,980
Teacher!

93
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,950
- Teacher!
- I missed you!

94
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,900
You don't see me? I worried so much.

95
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,750
Aigoo.

96
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,680
Now that I'm back, it's like I'm meeting my uncle. I'm so moved.

97
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,330
You suffered a lot.

98
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,680
Thanks for coming back.

99
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,390
The students came back?

100
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,020
Yes.

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,630
It seems that Professor Kim Dae Ho did something unnecessary.

102
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,450
Alright. You can leave.

103
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,620
Now, shall I start moving things along?

104
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,980
I told you that I don't want to eat. Please just leave me alone!

105
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,710
Leave. Please.

106
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,600
When I think of it, in this school now,

107
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,040
the person whose having a more hellish time than me is you.

108
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:16,380
Truthfully, I find all of this confusing, infuriating, and sad.

109
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:26,750
More than the fact that my father lied to me, for the fact that he left me here,

110
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,760
I can't seem to forgive him.

111
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,360
But still, I have no choice but to believe in him,

112
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,000
because no matter what others say, he's my father.

113
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,150
Today, I'll just open the curtains and leave.

114
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:56,580
Let's proceed one step at a time. Slowly. One by one.

115
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:05,590
If you think about it again and again, an answer will come out, right?

116
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,280
I'm so sorry towards you.

117
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:15,130
Instead of my dad, I'll be the one apologizing.

118
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,200
Immediately, all students and professors

119
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,060
are to meet in the assembly hall.

120
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,110
Up until now, Moorim School

121
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,330
has been without discipline and validation.

122
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,240
You had way too much freedom.

123
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,900
Who is it?

124
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,000
- I wonder.
- During this past Moorim Tournament,

125
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,760
even if there were some rough times,

126
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,500
we won't be shaken by them.

127
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,330
This school no longer belongs to Headmaster Hwang Moo Song.

128
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:08,390
Beginning now, this school will undergo great changes.

129
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:14,580
With the start of the change, we'll introduce new teachers.

130
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,840
These are your new professors as of today.

131
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,540
If all our professors are staying,

132
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,200
why would new teachers come?

133
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:34,230
From now on, I will be in charge of your martial arts education,

134
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,190
I'm Kim Sook.

135
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:41,590
Moorim School will no longer be your refuge or your playground.

136
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,770
During this Moorim Tournament, no one won and everyone had to give up.

137
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,130
It was because of the teaching method.

138
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:53,070
For all this time, Headmaster Hwang was teaching you like this.

139
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,420
Therefore, he is no longer at Moorim School.

140
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:03,170
There is no meaning if you can't defend yourself independently,

141
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:09,410
in a way befitting the name of Moorim School and as a student of Moorim School.

142
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,470
You all have to become stronger.

143
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,060
From now on, during the classes

144
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:22,340
the fittest will be able to survive. And since you are Moorim School's students,

145
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,360
I believe you'll follow me well.

146
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,940
Professor Kim Dae Ho and Professor Yoo Di,

147
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:48,820
just like before, you can be in charge of cooking and sports dance classes.

148
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,920
What do you mean, just like before? I have half as many classes now.

149
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,420
Also, Professor Daniel, you be in charge of basic martial arts training.

150
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,840
Basic martial arts?

151
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,160
If you look at the class schedule you'll see that,

152
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,420
in order to raise the students' levels, we've increased the amount of martial arts training.

153
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,840
Besides that, there's barely any change.

154
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,720
Nothing has changed?

155
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:19,200
So, what does the provision "Only assigned teachers are allowed to enter" mean?

156
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,880
The new teacher is in charge of all the Moorim martial arts classes,

157
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,580
and then are we not allowed to observe the students?

158
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,020
All the teachers had their own roles in martial art classes.

159
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:35,100
If only one teacher is in charge of the students, it can be dangerous and...

160
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,560
The new teachers know nothing about the students.

161
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,060
How can we not be involved in this?

162
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:48,400
I cannot comply with a unilateral termination like this.

163
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,920
Just like I told you last time

164
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:57,130
if you can't comply with the changes, you can still make a decision.

165
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,510
Pardon?

166
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,690
The headmaster has changed now.

167
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,990
A bunch of people want to come here as well.

168
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,400
Teacher Beop Gong!

169
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,560
I'm not a teacher, but the headmaster!

170
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,330
I might have been a teacher in the past,

171
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,300
but now I'm the headmaster of this school. The headmaster!

172
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,120
He can't meet Hwang Moo Song.

173
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,280
Find a way to buy some time.

174
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,370
Yes.

175
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:39,000
Also, it looks like Chae Yoon knows about Sim Bong San. What do we do?

176
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,640
From what we've observed Sim Bong San hasn't seen the child in 18 years.

177
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,240
We'll let them meet. Nothing will happen anyway.

178
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:01,650
I know that the child was abandoned in a forest.

179
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,530
Does Hwang Moo Song also know about this?

180
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,850
There's no way he would.

181
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,240
But... is it true that Chae Yoon is still alive?

182
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,870
You're trying to know too much.

183
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,010
I've searched in the weapons storage, and in the whole school

184
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,760
I couldn't find the key.

185
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,520
It's not in his office nor in the school...

186
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,660
Could it be in the dorms?

187
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,320
How is Hwang Seon Ah doing?

188
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,810
She's not coming out of her room.

189
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,970
Should I search in this room?

190
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:58,690
Hwang Moo Song wouldn't put his daughter in such danger.

191
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:07,850
Hwang Moo Song... What are you planning?

192
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,500
The new classes are starting tomorrow.

193
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,900
It's pretty certain the new teachers are going to be tougher about the grading system.

194
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,090
If you miss more classes, it'll be difficult for you.

195
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:34,790
Soon Deok is not at school right now and I don't know what's crossing Chi Ang's mind.

196
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,930
At least you should

197
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,650
get up soon.

198
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,180
It's enough. I ate enough.

199
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,880
Dad.

200
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,840
Is it this hard for you if I go back to Moorim?

201
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,060
Perhaps...

202
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,980
The reason why your dad can't see

203
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,520
might be connected to your school.

204
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,570
I don't know what happened but,

205
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,440
don't hold it in. Talk to me, please.

206
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:43,830
If I can't understand my Father, who in this world will understand him?

207
00:17:52,560 --> 00:18:00,020
♬ The countless tears which flowed past me ♬

208
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,320
♬ were like the end of unknown darkness ♬

209
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,380
A person's heart is the same as a butterfly.

210
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,740
If you try to catch it, it will fly away.

211
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,440
I'll show you what kind of person I am. I'm not just an "okay" guy.

212
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,410
I'm going to do my best to be a very great man.

213
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,730
I'll give you the necklace again then.

214
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,490
♬ You Please Don't say goodbye  ♬

215
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,740
♬ Baby, it looks like I was young then ♬

216
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,360
♬ Baby, it looks like I was a coward then ♬

217
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,940
♬ I thought you would always be there ♬

218
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,740
♬ I thought I could just reach out to you ♬

219
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,380
♬ Baby, I will take care of you ♬

220
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,860
♬ Baby, I'm not afraid of anything ♬

221
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,600
♬ Will you stay with me? ♬

222
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,700
I don't know what's inside of you.
♬ Will you hold me tight? ♬

223
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,400
Yoon Si Woo you... are just Yoon Si Woo.
♬ I also worried a lot ♬

224
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,370
Don't worry.
♬ I was afraid perhaps you would be far away ♬

225
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,070
Whatever it is...

226
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:16,620
Will you stay with me?
♬ Without your smile, without your love my life  ♬

227
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,450
Yes, I'll stay with you.
♬ I'm not afraid of anything ♬

228
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,120
Whatever it takes,
♬ Now I will take care of you ♬

229
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,700
I'll come back.
♬ Will you stay here as you are? ♬

230
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,930
♬ Will you just take my hand? ♬

231
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,370
Thank you for coming,

232
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,000
Yoon Si Woo.
♬ I will be the light for you ♬

233
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,620
♬ If you also think the same way I do ♬

234
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,280
♬ Will you stay with me? ♬

235
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,720
♬ Will you hug me close to you? ♬

236
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,680
♬ Goodbye, you please  ♬

237
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,140
♬ don't say goodbye. Goodbye.  ♬

238
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,930
♬  Goodbye, you please  ♬

239
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,390
♬ don't say goodbye.  ♬

240
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,500
Yoon Si Woo.

241
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,650
Are you going somewhere?

242
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,390
You ...

243
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,840
Let me ask you one thing.

244
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,550
Do you have a plan for Soon Deok?

245
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,560
I was going to do everything for her.

246
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:45,270
A warm, and comfortable life. A lifestyle that has nothing lacking nor any concerns.

247
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,520
I wanted to give a life like that to Soon Deok.

248
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:56,020
Do you have anything else to show her aside from yourself?

249
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,020
From the time I first came here until now,

250
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:06,870
everything here seemed like a dream,

251
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,380
both meeting you

252
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,660
and liking Soon Deok.

253
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:24,600
If I just give up on everything here and return,

254
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,650
it'll all become a dream.

255
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,440
What do you want to say?

256
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:42,200
Aren't you returning to your world eventually as well?

257
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,730
Can Soon Deok be in that world?

258
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,060
Can she live there?

259
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,500
Do you really believe

260
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,160
you can make her happy?

261
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,150
Did you come back from somewhere?

262
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:22,890
No, I wanted for your father to regain his energy. I bought some abalone.

263
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,100
It's not directly from the sea of course.

264
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,500
Thank you, Ahjumma.

265
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,860
There's no need to thank me, but don't say you are going to return to school. Are you?

266
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,180
We ran out of rice.

267
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:42,210
You suffered a lot because I ran away to school, and it didn't work, right?

268
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:48,540
What was difficult? Are we living thanks to the rice or something?

269
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:55,560
I am starting my part-time job again. I will be back!

270
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,210
What, work right now? Soon Deok!

271
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,740
She's trying to be strong...

272
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,610
Chicken Maru

273
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,240
Come look, Ahjumma.

274
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,980
Doing it like this makes it crispier and more savory.

275
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,660
How about doing a new menu?

276
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,960
Taste it.

277
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,320
It tastes good.

278
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,140
Right? It's totally delicious, right!

279
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,800
In order to make up for all those days you missed, you sure are doing everything!

280
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,500
I don't know. She went to her part-time job.

281
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,670
Part-time job?

282
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,820
Yes. We ran out of rice so she went to her part-time job.

283
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,790
It's just...

284
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,270
Yes, welcome.

285
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,550
You look very familiar.

286
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,750
Did Sim Soon Deok not come here?

287
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,410
-She just went out for a delivery.
- Where did she go?

288
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,100
I'm back!

289
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,170
What about your friend, did you meet him?

290
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,200
My friend?

291
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,320
He was really handsome like a celebrity, but he resembled someone.

292
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:42,520
This might be like a dream there, not for me.

293
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:57,570
It has never been this real. I never wanted someone that much.

294
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,040
I was passing by this stationery store and when I entered,

295
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,490
you know how they sell all those notebooks, right?

296
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,950
After such a long time, it was so fascinating,

297
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,380
and because I haven't seen this kind of notebook in a long time,

298
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,320
That's why I... I really just...

299
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,740
Assorted notebooks

300
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,520
Yoon Si Woo!

301
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,590
Hey, we're on the street.

302
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,950
What if someone recognizes you?

303
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:08,420
Because that child has already become my world.

304
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,350
This seems like a quiet place.

305
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:24,640
Aren't you dragging me into a dark alley?

306
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,930
No, that's not it.

307
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,490
Give them to me, your hands are cold.

308
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,260
I forgot to give you the necklace back.

309
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,420
Forget it, keep it.

310
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,480
During those times, you said it protected you.

311
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:11,220
What protects me now isn't that necklace.

312
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:21,890
♬ Today again I see! I see that look! ♬

313
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,990
♬ You, whom I will only love. ♬

314
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,860
That's better.

315
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:36,510
I missed you.
♬ The person who is waiting for me far away, ♬

316
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:41,580
Me too.
♬ You are my love ♬

317
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:50,460
♬ I am laughing over and over again like a half grown child ♬

318
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:56,710
♬ just to be only walking together with you. ♬

319
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,290
♬ When I see you ♬

320
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:03,770
- I longed for you.
- Me too.
♬ If I take your hand ♬

321
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:10,920
Like a madman.
♬ My day will fly by too quickly♬

322
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:18,790
♬ That love is happiness rather than pain ♬

323
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:25,260
♬  is the love which I have learned. ♬

324
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,960
I heard that Director Wang Hao

325
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,460
went back to Shanghai.

326
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:39,770
You might have had to stop at the semi-finals but you did very well at the Moorim Tournament.

327
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,790
You were very outstanding.

328
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:47,150
Your father must also be proud.

329
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:51,030
If you have any difficulty, you can tell me at any time,

330
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:58,230
because Wang Chi Ang is a student of mine I especially care for.

331
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:10,530
That time, at this place, didn't you talk about the key that can obtain Cheon Ui Joo?

332
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,390
Why, yes I did.

333
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:17,810
Just what is the Cheon Ui Joo?

334
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:26,690
Cheon Ui Joo is something that can gather all the powers of this world.

335
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:31,320
A strong person, a natural force for the person

336
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,030
who deserved to have this power.

337
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:42,320
Your father is a strong man.

338
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:48,580
Working hard to get something you wish for isn't a bad thing.

339
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:53,430
The bad thing is when you don't make any effort.

340
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,300
How is it? I made a new menu item.

341
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:17,160
Because of this, the owner called me to tell me there was a line for it.

342
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,630
This is really good.

343
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,890
I bought those.

344
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,440
At a time like this, you need to eat a lot and get strong.

345
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,910
It's good.

346
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:47,210
It's worse than I thought. After Professor Beop Gong became headmaster,

347
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,200
he summoned new instructors as though he had been waiting.

348
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,300
As to the significance for the school, it's the same as if Shanghai Group had taken over.

349
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,990
How is Chi Ang doing?

350
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:05,280
I don't really know what he's thinking.

351
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,060
If even Chi Ang is affected, that's a big problem.

352
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,590
- Why?
- Are you really okay?

353
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:26,780
When I called you earlier, your voice didn't sound good. Are you sure there's nothing going on?

354
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:32,330
Nothing! There's nothing going on.

355
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:39,580
I guess a good thing did come out of the barrier being broken. We can have dates outside.

356
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,860
Date? How is this a date?

357
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,480
Even if we couldn't go to an amusement park or a movie theater,

358
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,230
we should have at least eaten ddeokbokki at an outdoor food stand for this to be considered a date.

359
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,470
This isn't like some kind of rendezvous between spies.

360
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,520
Okay, I get it.

361
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:06,180
Going to the amusement park, the movie theater, and the outdoor food stand.

362
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:11,800
We must do all of that in the future.

363
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,600
Okay, for sure.

364
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,270
If even the fact that the headmaster had to leave school,

365
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,000
if everything was planned by your father...

366
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,130
If that is a fact, if everything

367
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,780
was indeed planned by my father, what are you going to do?

368
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,440
Could it be that your father wants the Cheon Ui Joo?

369
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,530
It could be what he wants.

370
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,550
Seon Deok is doing well, right?

371
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,160
Wang Chi Ang, what are you planning to do from here on?

372
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,520
I don't know.

373
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:22,770
Your father caused the headmaster to leave, but you don't know?

374
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:26,190
That's right, I don't know.

375
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:29,780
I came to this school because of Soon Deok and my mom.

376
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,780
But Soon Deok is only looking at you,

377
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,410
and at this rate, even my mom...

378
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
The things that I want,

379
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,930
how could I not get even one of those things?

380
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,530
- Or...
- Or?

381
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,700
If I just have the Cheon Ui Joo,

382
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,250
I can get everything I want.

383
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:14,240
The thing that can give you everything in this world.

384
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,830
That's what the Cheon Ui Joo is.

385
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,970
What are you thinking about right now?

386
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:25,660
I don't know either. So you tell me.

387
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,620
How do I handle the situation?

388
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,110
Even though I am confused now,

389
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:42,680
I'm certain about one thing. My father who will do anything

390
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,490
to get what he wants, I resemble him the most.

391
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,780
Because, without any choice, I am my father's son.

392
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,270
No.

393
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,610
You are different.

394
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,620
You, the Wang Chi Ang I have come to know over several months,

395
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,500
are different from your father who, because of his purposes, uses illegal means.

396
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,180
You treasure the people who are by your side.

397
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:07,440
I said it before. We want strong humans.

398
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,760
Moreover, the way the classes were taught will change.

399
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:19,500
We will make you stronger, so you never give up.

400
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:25,070
You'll fight again and again against foes until only a survivor is left.

401
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:29,390
You will become tough.

402
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:45,090
Thus, I will teach you just like the Spartans were taught.

403
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:49,650
Spartan? Is she saying we will be sparring with real, not blunted, swords?

404
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:01,120
A fight is the essence of fear.

405
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:06,870
Are you going to make your opponent drop to their knees from fear,

406
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:23,500
or are you going to be filled with terror and you yourself go on your knees?

407
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:45,220
Up until now you were trained with bare hands and wooden swords.

408
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,450
You do not know the true meaning of terror or dread.

409
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:55,300
From now on, you are really going to fight for your life

410
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:01,750
so that you know the true meaning of victory.

411
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:07,880
Now, step forward take a sword.

412
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,220
Why are you in my room?

413
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:38,940
Because I heard you missed a week of studies, I was worried.

414
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,100
You're saying you came here yourself, for that reason?

415
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:47,930
Not because the key to Cheon Ui Joo might be with me?

416
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:56,240
Hwang Moo Song wouldn't leave the key with you.

417
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:03,720
Also, there's this saying, "The darkest spot is at the base of a lamp."

418
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,480
If you're so terribly curious why don't you look for it yourself?

419
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,570
Look... Look!

420
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,580
Just how important is this Cheon Ui Joo?

421
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,220
Is there even such a thing?

422
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:32,350
If it's not in the school, then that means Hwang Moo Song has it.

423
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:42,510
If you know something, it's best for you to tell me everything

424
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,300
before whatever that is happens...

425
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,570
Just now, is that a threat?

426
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:55,050
What the hell is the big deal about it? We were like family. How did you change that much?

427
00:39:55,050 --> 00:40:00,950
All humans change depending on the situation.

428
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,960
That is human nature.

429
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,490
Just as I expected, you Seon Ha, have changed.

430
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,090
What did you just say?

431
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:20,250
You think Hwang Moo Song, the man you believed to be your father,

432
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:24,630
is actually the enemy who killed your real parents.

433
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,820
Isn't that why you hate him so much?

434
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,150
No way! That can't be. Dad—

435
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,670
Then, why are you holed up in your room?

436
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:43,170
Isn't it because there is a part of you that can't believe what he has done?

437
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:57,360
However, that isn't your fault.

438
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,380
The situation just turned out that way.

439
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:18,980
If everything is returned to its proper place now, everything will be finished.

440
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,600
Don't make the situation dangerous or difficult.

441
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,190
As I expected, it shows that you are an elite. Good job.

442
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:11,970
What the heck is everyone doing?! Do you not want to learn?!

443
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,610
It's too early for these students to use real swords.

444
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:25,860
The students? Does that include yourself?

445
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:32,820
I heard that you showed exceptional skills at the Moorim Tournament.

446
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,590
Any of the students here will be able to impale someone with these.

447
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:44,040
But we will not hurt our friends with these.

448
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:50,500
Friends? I haven't heard such a sweet word in a while.

449
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,290
I don't think so.

450
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:01,160
This is the last time I'll say it. From now on, during the classes in this school, there won't be such harmless weapons.

451
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,970
Of course, there are no friends here either.

452
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,690
Have you managed to obtain the key to the Cheon Ui Joo?

453
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:23,240
The chairman wants a fast answer.

454
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:31,230
It is either within the school or Hwang Moo Song has it.

455
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,530
It is one of these two possibilities.

456
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:37,060
So, what are you saying? Which one is it?

457
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,130
Let's not be hasty.

458
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:43,120
The rats have already gone inside the trap,

459
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:49,740
and does it matter what color cat is able to catch those rats?

460
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:54,360
Is there even a way to catch those rats?

461
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:02,930
Chairman Wang Hao says Chae Yoon is the last card he will play.

462
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,830
Are you saying that we should use Chae Yoon?

463
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:10,910
Hwang Moo Song and Chae Yoon used to be best friends.

464
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:18,380
If we use Chae Yoon, we may be able to figure out what Moo Song knows.

465
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:23,140
For example, the location where the key to Cheon Ui Joo is hidden.

466
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:28,150
However, right now Chae Yoon is desperately focused on finding the other students.

467
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:30,270
If he comes here and bumps into the daughter—

468
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:34,780
We'll kill two birds with one stone then.

469
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,510
For all this time, Hwang Moo Song, with Chae Yoon' s

470
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:43,650
daughter, has been hiding in this school.

471
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,400
Isn't it a better card hand to make

472
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,980
Chae Yoon suspicious that Hwang Moo Song was a member of the destructive force?

473
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:04,880
Then, please relay my thoughts to the chairman.

474
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,370
Why is the room in this state?

475
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,950
Did something happen? By chance—

476
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:56,910
I did it.

477
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,440
You?

478
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,330
What the heck is this Cheon Ui Joo that it's got everyone riled up?

479
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,130
Seon Ah...

480
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,610
I don't know what kind of incredible thing it is, but

481
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:09,730
it's just a terrible hardship and inconvenience to me.

482
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:14,440
Even more so, at times like this, you have to remain calm and strong.

483
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:24,590
Honestly, I want to just disappear, but

484
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,990
I have nowhere to go.

485
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,400
Up until recently, it was like that for me too.

486
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,630
But when I had no where to go, no one to lean on,

487
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:55,460
you told me to come to the Moorim School.

488
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:58,800
Do you not remember?

489
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,920
That's why this time, I'll tell you.

490
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:08,740
Stay at Moorim School, Hwang Seon Ah.

491
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:15,440
Didn't Headmaster say that all problems are inside one's self?

492
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:22,440
Your solution is definitely inside you.

493
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:59,010
From Soon Deok's kidnapping to the school's violence,

494
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,180
what is your father's intention?

495
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,320
You've done a big thing, a big thing.

496
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,930
Just what do you want from me?

497
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,230
This is all for your sake.

498
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:31,680
You lost Hwang Moo Song?

499
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,680
Search thoroughly and then call me back.

500
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,360
Young Master.

501
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:49,300
Now you don't have any deals going on, so you came here?

502
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,690
I had some business to take care of.

503
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:58,160
Well, that's good, since I need to request something of you.

504
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,150
What?

505
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:03,750
I need to see my father. Where is he right now?

506
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:08,440
The president has gone to China to tend to the company's business.

507
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:13,490
As you know, Young Master, the president is usually a busy person.

508
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:18,230
Staying here at the school waiting for the president to call is a good idea.

509
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,600
Leaving the school right now—

510
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,900
Don't tell me what to do!

511
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,370
Why don't you just arrange the plane ticket?

512
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:34,460
We will have to punish the students who didn't come back after the tournament.

513
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,650
Punishment?

514
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:40,110
Are you saying we should expel the students?

515
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:45,280
We will expel the students who are unable to continue.

516
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,920
Isn't it a sure thing to give opportunities to the new students?

517
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,650
Expelling? What are you...

518
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:54,640
Wait, wait a little longer please.

519
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,630
I'm in the middle of convincing those students.

520
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:02,810
Also Sim Soon Deok asked me to give her more time.

521
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:09,380
In the instance of Sim Soon Deok, it is a waste of her skills, but we can't keep on waiting for her.

522
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,340
Handle it according to the rules please.

523
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:11,930
Okay.

524
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:14,290
It is not a matter of skills.

525
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:18,860
But if you are an educator, shouldn't you first think about the children's situations and dreams?

526
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,080
There's something I want to say about the new teaching method.

527
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,780
Is the safety of the kids not important?

528
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:29,240
For a school that was so concerned with the safety of its students,

529
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,010
even after witnessing that violence, how can you continue to say such a thing?

530
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,180
- That was—
- It's the only

531
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:39,150
way to speed up making this school normal.

532
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:46,110
Then, I hope you'll get my point and stand down.

533
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:54,930
Don't expel her. Give her a little more time. Soon Deok...

534
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,670
I will definitely convince her.

535
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:01,210
Right. Let's think of a method together.

536
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,530
Teacher!

537
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:15,050
To tell you the truth, the headmaster told me everything.

538
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:20,870
The key to Cheon UI Joo is not protected by the headmaster, but by the school.

539
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:25,290
Seon Ha's real father, after being declared the next person to take over this school,

540
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:32,510
had to protect the key. And the destructive force wanted to steal it so they burned down the house,

541
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:35,710
and the fact that he rescued Seon Ha then... I know everything.

542
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:42,050
Then you know that from then on he was suspected of being part of the destructive force.

543
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:47,730
Yes. But perhaps,

544
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:52,170
if that key falls into the hands of the enemy, what will happen then?

545
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:54,450
Don't worry about this.

546
00:51:54,450 --> 00:52:00,050
They can't do anything with just that one little piece.

547
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,490
One piece?

548
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:06,270
According to the rumors, that day at Chae Yoon's house,

549
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:12,070
the key to Cheon Ui Joo was split into three pieces, of which Seon Ah has one.

550
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:18,030
There is a big chance the son has the second piece.

551
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,490
Then what about the last one?

552
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,970
Up to now, its whereabouts—

553
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:24,190
Could it be with the destructive force?

554
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:33,510
They took over the school. Finding the key will just be a matter of time.

555
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:37,570
Without that remaining piece, it's all for nothing.

556
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:43,590
Because they know this, they are desperately searching for that missing son.

557
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:44,930
So the headmaster is also ...

558
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:48,870
Yes, I am thinking the headmaster is looking for that child right now.

559
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:53,290
The lost son of his friend.

560
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:11,090
After meeting with me, there were probably people who came to see you.

561
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:14,690
Those people. What did they ask you?

562
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,190
That is...

563
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:19,470
Did they ask about Chae Yoon's son?

564
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:27,870
It seemed that, like you, they were searching for Chae Yoon's son as well.

565
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:33,310
And when I asked them if it's true that Chae Yoon was alive, they wouldn't answer me.

566
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:37,290
I'm certain they know something about Yoon.

567
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:41,470
If Yoon is really alive...

568
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:46,470
If he's really alive, he is probably suspicious of you.

569
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,730
Are there any other ways to meet him?

570
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,890
I overheard a phone conversation, and

571
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:58,790
someone talked as if they had known Yoon 18 years ago.

572
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,630
Who is it?

573
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:08,530
We have no proof that Sim Bong San was with the boy 18 years ago.

574
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:13,530
Yes. Bong San. His name was Sim Bong San.

575
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:21,850
How can I meet Hwang Moo Song?

576
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:24,410
Tomorrow, I'll show you where the school is.

577
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:26,850
The school...

578
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:30,950
Don't worry about the barrier.

579
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:34,090
A lot of things happened at this school,

580
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:38,950
and it has been confirmed that your daughter Yeong is within the school.

581
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:41,410
Her name is Hwang Seon Ah.

582
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:43,930
What did you say?

583
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:46,590
This is clear proof that Hwang Moo Sung was implicated

584
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:50,130
as an accomplice in that incident 18 years ago.

585
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:54,610
This was revealed recently and Hwang Moo Song has gone into hiding.

586
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:59,150
He was also expelled from his position as headmaster of the school.

587
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:02,210
So that means that Hwang Moo Song... My Yeong... ?

588
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:06,770
Yes. For 18 years, Hwang Moo Song deceived her.

589
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,430
She believed he was her father.

590
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:12,450
Hwang Moo Song...

591
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:23,750
Wang Chi Ang.

592
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,340
♬  Yeah I am alive. Look straight at me.
For dozens of times I will get up once again♬

593
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,710
♬  Look straight at me.♬

♬  Watch me. ♬

00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:49,660
♬  Now close both eyes and feel me ♬

598
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,040
I won't avoid it.

599
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:59,070
Whoever my opponent is, I have to meet him directly and fight.

600
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:04,390
♬  Even if I scream, no one will hear♬

601
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:09,730
Yoon Si Woo, I'm like my father.

602
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,030
I'll get what I want.

603
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:14,110
Wang Chi Ang...
♬  Faint consciousness♬

604
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:17,130
♬  Barely holds onto me♬

605
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,390
♬  Your voice lingers in my ears♬

606
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:24,410
I'll get what I want. Whatever it takes.
♬  It's become the only light which shines under cover on me♬

607
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:29,230
♬  Surviving again (My spark)♬

608
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:30,920
♬  Yeah I am alive. ♬

609
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,170
♬  Look straight at me.♬

610
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:35,670
♬  For dozens of times I will get up once again♬

611
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:37,910
♬  Yeah I am alive. ♬

612
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,350
♬  Watch me. ♬

613
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:43,070
♬  Now close both eyes and feel me ♬

614
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:50,060
♬  In front of everyone. I'll show more of myself. ♬

615
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:57,170
♬  I'm living and breathing. I'm newly born♬

616
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,850
I will protect it.

617
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:25,230
I won't let it be stolen from me.

618
00:57:56,330 --> 00:58:01,810
I am going to find some answers about what I should do.

619
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:20,850
Please come back safely, Wang Chi Ang. You must.

620
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:35,170
Don't be like this.

621
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:41,710
Tell Seon Deok whatever the matter is and empty your burdens.

622
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:46,970
Dear, ever since you found out that she was attending Moorim School,

623
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:49,870
it seems like you've aged ten years.

624
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:52,390
What are you telling me to say?

625
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:57,710
Dear, your eyes.

626
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:02,890
I'm talking about how you lost your sight. If you can't tell me, tell Seon Deok at least.

627
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:05,950
You'll get sick because of this!

628
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:12,010
Soon Deok is a very thoughtful person.

629
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:17,410
Even if you committed murder, she is the type of child who will take your side.

630
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:21,750
She's lost so much weight lately.

631
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:27,470
She's pitiable. Let's not make her suffer any longer, huh?

632
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,870
Wang Chi Ang!

633
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,140
What brings you here?

634
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,830
Have you been well?

635
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:11,750
Yeah. I'm okay.

636
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:19,770
How about you?

637
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:23,570
Me? Hey, I'm Wang Chi Ang!

638
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:27,610
Of course I'm doing fine. I'm really fine.

639
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:34,110
That's right. That's how I like my friend Chi Ang the most.

640
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:39,870
But, why are you here?

641
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:46,190
Ah... I have to go somewhere for a little while.

642
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:53,930
You'll come back, right?

643
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:59,810
If I come back, it'll be hard for you.
♬ Today again I see! I see that look! ♬

644
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:04,910
For you and Si Woo, and even for Seon Ah.
♬ You, whom I will only love, ♬

645
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:10,610
I might possibly become your enemy.
♬ You, whom I will only love, ♬

646
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:13,790
♬ the person who is waiting for me far away, ♬

647
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:19,430
If you're possibly doing this because of me,
♬ the person who is waiting for me far away, ♬

648
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:22,610
if it's because of me...
♬ You are my love ♬

649
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:23,590
Don't do this.

650
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:26,690
Don't do this.
♫ Like a child who is half-grown ♫

651
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:31,690
From the beginning up to now, I've only made it difficult for you.
♬ I am laughing over and over again ♬

652
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:37,950
If you change...
♬ just to be only walking together with you. ♬

653
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:43,730
Perhaps, now...
♬ If I take your hand when I see you ♬

654
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:47,830
might be the last time I see you.
♬ My day will fly by too quickly ♬

655
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:52,210
Be well, Sim Soon Deok.
♫ I keep on smiling ♫

656
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:59,970
♬ That love is happiness rather than pain ♬

657
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:07,190
♬  This is the love I've learned  ♬

658
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:14,790
♬ Even in a small room, always smelling only your perfume ♬

659
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:20,470
Are you smiling?
Someone like Yoon Si Woo knows how to smile?
♬  When you the person I will love  ♬

660
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:27,200
♬ are sad and cry again, it is certain ♬

661
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,740
Even here, my father kidnapped me to this place. 
♬ you are my love ♬

662
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:35,050
Although, thanks to that I got to meet my Ariel.
♬ you are my love ♬

663
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:40,350
He could've left but he decided to stay with me. So let's acknowledge that he won. 
♬ I am laughing over and over again like a half grown child♬

664
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:45,310
- Perhaps, were you waiting for me?
- Why would I wait for you? I was waiting for my Ariel.

665
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:47,930
♫ Beneath any empty sky there's only you and I ♫

666
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:51,470
For all this time, with Soon Deok... You knew.

667
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:54,550
All this time I thought a jerk like you was my friend.

668
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:57,310
For the first time in my life,

669
01:02:57,310 --> 01:03:01,250
I thought I found a friend.
♬ My day will fly by too quickly ♬

670
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:03,710
That's what I thought.

671
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:08,640
♬ That love is happiness rather than pain ♬

672
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:13,340
- Are you going to participate in the Moorim Tournament?
- I have to be first. 
♬ That love is happiness rather than pain ♬

673
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:17,030
I'll destroy you, even if you're a friend.

674
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:24,500
If you were just an okay guy, it would have been quite difficult. 
♬ Let's not rush. Let's not even hesitate.

675
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:31,750
♬ I’m afraid because it might suddenly be unclear. ♬

676
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:38,630
♬ For the times full of happiness we will spend together ♬

677
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:45,610
♬  Thank you my love ♬

678
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:57,400
I'm... so cold.
♬ If I take your hand when I see you ♬

679
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:04,700
For a little bit, let's stay like this.
♬ My day will fly by too quickly ♬

680
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:12,550
♬ That love is happiness rather than pain ♬

681
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:19,930
♬  This is the love I've learned  ♬

682
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:22,950
♬  This is the love I've learned  ♬

683
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:25,250
I'm leaving.
♬  This is the love I've learned  ♬

684
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:29,030
Okay.
♬  This is the love I've learned  ♬

685
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:47,450
♬  Yeah I am alive. Look straight at me.♬
For dozens of times I will get up once again♬

686
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,960
♬  Look straight at me. ♬

687
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,050
♬ For dozens of times I will get up once again ♬

688
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,070
♬  Yeah I am alive. ♬

689
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:55,630
♬  Watch me. ♬

690
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,400
♬  Now close both eyes and feel me ♬
