1
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,770
Welcome.

2
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,410
I have heard many things about you.

3
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,010
I came to meet a child called Hwang Seon Ah.

4
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,600
Is it true that she is here?

5
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,110
Yes, she is.

6
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,650
How is she doing?

7
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,630
She has recently been very shocked to find out that former Headmaster Hwang Moo Song is not her real father.

8
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,790
However, isn't everything in the process of returning back to it's place?

9
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,710
Moorim Association is hoping you'll find your daughter,

10
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:45,670
as well as the key to Cheon Ui Joo that Hwang Moo Song hid within the school,

11
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:51,200
in order for everything to return to its original state.

12
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:59,340
Please let me meet Yeong.

13
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,010
Do you really think the barrier Hwang Moo Song erected

14
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,550
is there solely to protect you?

15
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,930
Everything leading to the headmaster's departure

16
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,110
was well planned by your father.

17
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,470
I won't avoid it.

18
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,910
In my own way, I'm going to fight, head on.

19
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,210
Moorim School
- Episode 15 -

20
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,440
What are you doing, Yoon Si Woo?

21
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,020
Do you remember me?

22
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,160
Oh, you at that time...

23
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,940
If you're going to go to Seon Ah, please give her more time.

24
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,380
She is very confused right now.

25
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:06,380
Even if you are her real dad, if you meet her before the headmaster commotion is dealt with,

26
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,000
you will only make things harder for her.

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,890
Yoon Si Woo! You are crossing the line.

28
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,220
What qualifies you to say such things?

29
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,370
I am speaking as her friend.

30
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,140
If you are her father, I believe that you will understand.

31
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,900
Alright.

32
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,160
I will do so.

33
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,840
What is it?

34
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't be shocked and listen.

35
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,730
Your real father came here to see you.

36
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,340
What?

37
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,410
If you're not ready, no one will force you to meet him immediately.

38
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,030
He also seems to understand that you need time.

39
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,820
If the man I thought was my father

40
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,660
and I lived with wasn't really my father,

41
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,810
but could everything he said to me during that time been true?

42
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,400
I really don't know what's true anymore.

43
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,370
You should know best.

44
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:43,700
The fact is that the headmaster's love and care for you all of this time wasn't a lie.

45
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,800
I'm sorry, but today will be difficult.

46
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,580
Alright.

47
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,960
I guess I only thought of myself too much.

48
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,920
When Yeong's feelings are ready, then I will return.

49
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,200
But can I ask you something?

50
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,540
How come you are here with people from the Shanghai Group?

51
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,040
What do you mean?

52
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,140
Not long ago, Chairman Wang orchestrated the kidnapping of a fellow student called Sim Soon Deok.

53
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,000
It was an incident stemming from mistaking her for Seon Ah.

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,360
Although he said it was to let Seon Ah know the truth,

55
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,040
there are many aspects that make it very doubtful.

56
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,410
Could you have known about that?

57
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,410
Right now,

58
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,560
I can't really understand what you're talking about.

59
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:16,200
Chairman Wang said that Headmaster Hwang set fire to the house and kidnapped Seon Ah that day.

60
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,470
However, I think differently.

61
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,470
Can I ask what your opinion is?

62
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,590
The headmaster said he went to save his friend

63
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,850
but he was too late.

64
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,030
I think what he said was true.

65
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,750
Yes.

66
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,580
It could be.

67
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,920
If it's too hard by yourself, tell me.

68
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,400
You can share everything with me. After all,

69
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,780
I'm your daughter.

70
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,560
I thought I could understand everything about my dad,

71
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,630
but I didn't even ask Dad directly,

72
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,640
while looking into his eyes, what the truth is.

73
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,500
Did you really kill my real father and make me live in a lie all this time?

74
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,800
- Seon Ah...
- I never want to see someone like you again.

75
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,920
Dad... Right now, I

76
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,340
really don't like this hateful image of myself

77
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:48,760
who is suspicious and resentful.

78
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,970
What did you discuss with that student?

79
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:06,330
I think Chairman Wang is the destructive force.

80
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,850
His goal is the Cheon Ui Joo.

81
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:15,290
He doesn't even hide his intentions and will do whatever it takes to get it.

82
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,370
Did you know all those things?

83
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,930
He was just being concerned, as a friend.

84
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,600
You arrived.

85
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,780
Did you know I was coming?

86
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,000
Please come inside.

87
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,220
You know what the Cheon Ui Joo key is, don't you?

88
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,550
Eighteen years ago, were you there?

89
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,630
I don't know who they were, but

90
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,990
I only know that those people were after the Cheon Ui Joo.

91
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,970
I did not come here to blame you or make you repent for anything.

92
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,550
Please tell me everything about that day.

93
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,050
I am sorry, but I cannot take you to Shanghai.

94
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,050
I told the Chairman you were planning to leave.

95
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,640
He wouldn't have welcomed that.

96
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,020
- No, so now it would—
- Do not

97
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,560
tell me to calm down.

98
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,680
If anything like Soon Deok's kidnapping happens,

99
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,820
I will not remain still.

100
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,900
Keep that in mind.

101
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:15,920
I will never be fooled like that again.

102
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,830
As I was leaving with the child, I was attacked by them.

103
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,870
and unfortunately lost the child in the process.

104
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,040
I kept thinking he would've died in the burning house anyway,

105
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,760
that it wasn't my fault

106
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,180
and I should just forget it. But then...

107
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,150
- But?
- He was found in the woods and saved.

108
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:47,100
That child is in that school with Soon Deok.

109
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,630
I guess this is a case of fate eventually returning like this.

110
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,280
What do you mean?

111
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,640
This child is in the school?

112
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,170
Didn't you come here being aware of everything?

113
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:12,160
Yoon Si Woo... Haven't you heard everything from him?

114
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,770
Is he really the child who you rescued from the fire?

115
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,550
Are you saying it is Yoon Si Woo?

116
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,610
The people who set the house on fire back then

117
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,780
are looking for that child and are watching you.

118
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,620
If you don't want to suffer any consequences from that event,

119
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,290
please don't tell this story to anyone.

120
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,630
I still don't understand everything about my dad.

121
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,970
Still, on the day that I see my dad again,

122
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:07,100
I think I shouldn't let him see me as weak.

123
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,050
I will ask my real dad

124
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,440
why is he with people from the Shanghai Group?

125
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,020
I want to see you, Dad.

126
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,810
Are you okay?

127
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,270
Are you okay?

128
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,320
Your skills are indeed quite underdeveloped.

129
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,840
Who's next? Go Sang Man.

130
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,600
- Go Sang Man?
- Y-Yes?

131
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,360
I'll do it.

132
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,150
♫ I don't know if you were ready ♫

133
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:40,380
Student Yoon Si Woo. You should use a weapon.

134
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,820
I'll do it with my bare hands.

135
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:49,350
You're going to fight a spear with your bare hands? Good.

136
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,040
You will soon realize how absurd your confidence is.

137

♫ Come to me, follow me, what are you doing now? I'm controlling you now ♫

142
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,090
You said because we've been fighting with our bare hands or with wooden swords,

143
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:23,780
no one would feel true panic or fear, right?

144
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,050
You were wrong.

145
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,870
What was I wrong about?

146
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:34,400
What we learned here wasn't terrorizing people with knives or weapons.

147
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,520
You can feel that once you take one step outside of the school anyway.

148
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,810
So what was the greatest fear

149
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:45,190
that you experienced in this school?

150
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,250
Overcoming people without having real skills, like you do.

151
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,720
Your never ending greed that has mercy for none...

152
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,450
That scares you?

153
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,440
Those rotten thoughts...

154
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,270
Right now, how I want to make you feel powerless exactly they way you do others.

155
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:17,570
Right now, I'm most scared of how I feel.

156
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,570
You could do something about it,

157
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,560
but you won't. Is that what you are saying?

158
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,040
Please don't hurt my friends anymore.

159
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,910
This is my last warning.

♫ I'm different, different. I'm different, different ♫

163
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,760
♫ I don't know either. I'll show you. ♫

164
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,300
♫ I'm fast, fast. I'm fast, fast. ♫

165
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,010
♫ Feel this, I'm a king. ♫

166
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,790
Shanghai, China

167
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,310
You'll be back, right?

168
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,890
If you're like this because of me... Don't be like this.

169
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:34,590
From the start up to now, I made things hard for you.

170
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,050
If you change...

171
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,170
Father. It's Chi Ang.

172
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,030
Please tell me everything.

173
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:08,450
I need to know all you know and are planning to do.

174
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,110
What did you just say?

175
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,500
I asked if Yoon is alive.

176
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,270
Right...

177
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,340
He's under Chairman Wang's protection now.

178
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,760
Could Yoon have joined forces with him?

179
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,100
If Yoon is on the same side as Chariman Wang,

180
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,620
and if they know that you know that Yoon is alive,

181
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,590
irreversible events will occur.

182
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,910
I need to meet Yoon and tell him everything myself.

183
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,310
I'm positive Wang Hao is scheming something.

184
00:17:55,310 --> 00:18:01,680
It's dangerous for you to meet him alone. I will gather some people for you.

185
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,700
That is one of the three missing parts of the key that were lost 18 years ago.

186
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,580
The one that Hwang Seon Ah had is probably with Hwang Moo Song,

187
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,130
and the other is probably with Chae Yoon's lost son.

188
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,320
Is this the real reason why you sent me to that school?

189
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,510
Yes.

190
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,570
Did you think I would help you?

191
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,900
I am a businessman.

192
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,640
I will not spend money, time or resources

193
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:48,290
on people I don't think will succeed. I believe in you.

194
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,740
You believe in me?

195
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,510
Don't look back if you're going after something you want.

196
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,890
Also, remember the promise I made.

197
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:07,300
If I receive something, I will give something at least as valuable in return.

198
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:13,550
I didn't come here for this give-and-take talk. I'm here for the truth.

199
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:19,040
Tell me something that could truly make me feel I need to help you.

200
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,720
Sincerity?

201
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,100
You still talk like a young child.

202
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,710
With such a desperate mind, I came here.

203
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,970
It means, that's how much you are wavering.

204
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:44,790
When I was little, you told me this.

205
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:50,520
Even if I fall, I should survive and thrive, like a lion cub.

206
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,910
You said that's how fathers should raise their children.

207
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,330
If this time, I don't do what you're asking me to do,

208
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,790
what will become of me?

209
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,900
And...

210
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,080
What about Mom?

211
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,980
What do you think?

212
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,250
This isn't just for my personal gain.

213
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,650
It's dangerous, but it absolutely has to be done.

214
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:34,600
More importantly, it's for the sake of you, your mom and our whole family!

215
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:42,690
If you don't believe me, I will bring your mother back to China right now. Like you said, that is

216
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,450
not a reward, but my true feelings.

217
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,110
I didn't cause the incident eighteen years ago.

218
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:57,330
I didn't know about the key to the Cheon Ui Joo back then.

219
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:03,700
I heard about it three years ago.

220
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,980
Is that true?

221
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,830
Yeah.

222
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,830
It's because of Soon Deok.

223
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,430
I love Soon Deok.

224
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,750
Love, you say?

225
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:32,380
Unlike you, I won't neglect someone I love.

226
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,750
I will definitely make that person happy.

227
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,820
Happiness, you say?

228
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,250
That's overrated.

229
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:50,180
Those who want happiness can't have power

230
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,800
because they get too entangled in emotions.

231
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,050
You.

232
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,460
Didn't you want to become powerful?

233
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,680
Do you really know nothing about Yoon's son?

234
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,130
If you know the whereabouts of the last part of the key,

235
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:18,300
it's an opportunity to erect the Moorim Association again.

236
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:23,010
If we join forces now, it's not too late to have a shot.

237
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,740
I don't want to have a shot at anything.

238
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:31,180
For this to end without anyone getting hurt is what I want.

239
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:38,720
Do you, by chance, know the whereabouts of Yoon's son?

240
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:50,850
Not that long ago, Yoon Si Woo entered the school.

241
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:56,250
It was a coincidence that the child was brought to the school by Seon Ah.

242
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,210
Yoon Si Woo?

243
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:05,660
The child who used energy control at the tournament?

244
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,540
I have to hurry and go back to the school.

245
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,730
To do that, I need to see Yoo Di.

246
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:17,370
First, we need to meet Chae Yoon without Chairman Wang knowing.

247
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:21,990
You need to be very careful. I will send some people.

248
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,370
You're here?

249
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:44,430
Dad, what is all this?

250
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,890
Sit over there.

251
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,150
I know you want to go back to school.

252
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:01,290
My answer is... this.

253
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:09,340
Dad, I can't just go like this.

254
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,220
Soon Deok.

255
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:15,340
Before I hear a complete explanation, I'm not going anywhere.

256
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,080
Why exactly are you going this far?

257
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:28,250
Is it really because of Moorim that you can't see?

258
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:35,510
Actually, it involves Yoon Si Woo.

259
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,690
Hwang Seon Ah.

260
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,330
I'm sorry.

261
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,370
And ...

262
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,790
Thanks.

263
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,290
The one who is thankful is me.

264
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,530
Thank you, Seon Ah, for coming out of that room.

265
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,980
You know you were the one who helped me do it.

266
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,380
I, too, wanted to get the key.

267
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,350
It's true.

268
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:44,770
But I saw what they did, got a grip and saved that kid from the fire.

269
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:49,100
I was told my life would be in danger if I stayed with that child, and

270
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,440
I thought he died.

271
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,210
No. I thought I killed him.

272
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:04,160
So that's why I had no choice but to leave that child alone in that bed of leaves and run away.

273
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,060
That's impossible.

274
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,390
Back then, my eyes were injured from their attacks,

275
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:18,780
and I thought that with that I had paid for my sins, but...

276
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,230
By any chance, that child...

277
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,370
Yes.

278
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,720
Yoon Si Woo is the very child.

279
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,970
This child survived and is going to the same school as you.

280
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:50,900
You're lying. Dad, Si Woo... Si Woo...

281
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:56,520
I know he is dear to your heart.

282
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,900
I know very well that you went back to school because of him.

283
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,690
Thus, I can't hide this from you anymore.

284
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:10,590
That cannot be. Do you know how Si Woo has lived up to now?

285
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,660
You should have looked for him! You should have gone to see if he was alive

286
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,220
or tried to find out why all that happened!

287
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:23,080
Even if it was later, you should have looked into it!

288
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:30,370
I was just so afraid that the ones after Cheon Ui Joo would be hunting me.

289
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:35,210
With my damaged eyes, I could only think about the need to get you and leave as soon as possible.

290
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,890
I needed to live somehow because of you.

291
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,770
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

292
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,270
In the end,

293
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,970
it was because of me.

294
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,130
The very reason that Si Woo was like that ...

295
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,280
was me.

296
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,800
Did you have a nightmare again?

297
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,850
The dream about the kid in the fire.

298
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,980
When did you come here?

299
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,960
You called me.

300
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,600
It's a dream, isn't it?
♬ The countless tears which flowed past me ♬

301
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:33,700
Even so, that I get to see you like this...
♬ were like the end of unknown darkness ♬

302
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,910
It's really nice.

303
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,750
♬ Both when I take another step ♬

304
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,670
♬ and let out a long sigh ♬

305
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:46,280
♬ Where does the road end? ♬

306
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:53,090
I hope there will be no more reason to have nightmares.
♬ Good Bye Good Bye  ♬

307
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,990
There won't be.
♬ the words to me Good Bye.  ♬

308
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:01,900
Si Woo.
♬  You please don't say goodbye ♬

309
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,650
I'm sorry.
♬ Baby, it looks like I was young then ♬

310
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,240
It's because of me.
♬ Baby, it looks like I was a coward then ♬

311
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,490
♬ I knew just a connection was there ♬

312
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:18,690
What are you saying? It's because of you?
♬ I thought I could just reach out to you ♬

313
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:23,610
I'm sorry.
♬ Baby, I'm not afraid of anything ♬

314
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,410
♬ Will you stay with me? ♬

315
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:30,200
♬ Will you hold me tight? ♬

316
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:36,440
♬ Good Bye Good Bye, you please don't say good bye ♬

317
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:44,220
♬ Good Bye Good Bye you, please don't say good bye ♬

318
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,990
Have you checked whether or not Chi Ang is back in Korea?

319
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,430
Yes.

320
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,230
From now on everything depends on him.

321
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:06,590
If we're not going to pull out the tree, then we'd better make sure the roots are firmly planted while it's swaying.

322
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,450
Will Young Master do well?

323
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,180
I've made sure he cannot be swayed,

324
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,090
so don't worry and go help him.

325
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,420
Yes.

326
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,220
Yes.

327
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,410
I understand.

328
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,390
Seems like I have to go to Korea.

329
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,780
You take it.

330
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,850
Father...

331
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,960
I believe in you,

332
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,750
because you are my son.

333
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,880
Seon Ah!

334
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,400
- Shannon!
- Are you better now?

335
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,700
It must have been so hard for you guys all this time.

336
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,130
It couldn't have been harder than what you went through.

337
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,080
I am so sorry about the headmaster. I was rash and stupid.

338
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,750
Since our school's ace, Hwang Seon Ah, is back too,

339
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,940
they should watch out. Let's go till the end together!

340
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,280
One, two, three, fighting!

341
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,580
Yoon Si Woo.

342
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,410
What is it? Did anything happen?

343
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:52,240
I think Soon Deok left this behind.

344
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,520
Soon Deok came here?

345
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,590
I seriously don't understand what she's trying to say.

346
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,420
I don't know how I should put this

347
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,330
or how should I start.

348
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:17,640
But I think there are words I need to say to you

349
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,340
so I am leaving this letter.

350
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,700
Seon Ah, you said, eighteen years ago, a great fire took over your house,

351
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,120
and that's how you lost your family, right?

352
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:37,300
My dad was there.

353
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:42,130
He took your brother out of that house, which was on fire,

354
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:48,250
but left him in the woods while trying to fight off the destructive force.

355
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,110
That child was actually Si Woo.

356
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:58,070
I know how Si Woo has lived until now,

357
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,240
how lonely he was,

358
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,410
and the fact that all of that was because of my father...

359
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:12,660
I know that I cannot apologize to you by any words.

360
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:19,640
Si Woo, Seon Ah, I am so sorry.

361
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,320
Si Woo, Seon Ah, I'm so sorry.

362
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:33,260
♬  Even in a small room, always smelling only your perfume  ♬

363
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:38,820
♬  When you're the person I will love ♬

364
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,380
Is this...
♬ are sad and cry again it is certain♬

365
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,690
What does this all mean?

366
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:54,380
♬ You are my love ♬

367
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:01,600
♬ It’s okay if it’s unsaid. It’s okay if it just must be hidden.♬

368
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:08,660
♬ There's only you and I beneath the empty sky ♬

369
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,170
Is this all really true?

370
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,680
You too can...

371
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,850
Yeah.

372
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:25,580
That's right. You also had a memory of a fire when you were young.

373
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,760
I just thought it was a coincidence, but...

374
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:37,200
Why didn't I pick that clue up sooner?

375
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,520
You and I survived that fire.

376
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,630
So the piano lullaby...

377
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,100
That's why...

378
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:03,040
I slept well for the first time in my life after hearing it.

379
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,890
Seems like you remembered it too. Mom's lullaby.

380
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:16,230
♬ If I take your hand when I see you♬

381
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,200
The first person to call me to this place...
♬ My day will fly by too quickly♬

382
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,820
was you...
♬ That love ♬

383
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,560
Yoon Si Woo...

384
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,720
I can't really figure things out right now.
♬  is happiness rather than pain♬

385
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:37,100
We should take it slow. Slowly.
♬  is the love which I have learned.♬

386
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:47,750
♬ That's the love which I have learned.♬

387
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,620
What am I suppose to do right now?

388
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:24,060
That day at Chae Yoon's house, the key to the Cheon Ui Joo were separated into three pieces.

389
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,310
Chances are one is with Seon Ah

390
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:31,470
and another is with the lost child.

391
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:40,240
It's a heirloom of mine. It protected me in a fire when I was little.

392
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,270
So, what your father wants is the key.

393
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,780
He's someone who will

394
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,370
do anything to achieve his goal.

395
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,860
Are you Headmaster Hwang Moo Song?

396
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,810
That's correct.

397
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,750
I am from the Moorim Association.

398
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:14,150
Meeting Chae Yoon can be dangerous, so we came to take you there.

399
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,980
Thank you.

400
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,020
Yes.

401
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,550
I'll be there in a moment.

402
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:46,820
It seems like you're busy. Go. I will go up and have some rest.

403
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,680
I think Chairman Wang is the destructive force.

404
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,190
His goal is the Cheon Ui Joo.

405
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:13,620
He doesn't hide or hold back from doing anything to get it.

406
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,380
Yes, sir.

407
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,060
Are you alone right now?

408
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,230
Yes.

409
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:28,560
That's good. I have something to tell you.

410
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:35,170
Can we meet now? But don't tell anybody.

411
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,620
Yes, I understand. Where should I go?

412
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,310
Chi Ang. Your father came.

413
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:55,020
He says I should move to China.

414
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:03,590
That's great! You should've gone sooner. What took so long?

415
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:08,110
Nothing bad is going on with you, right?

416
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:11,310
Here you go again. There's nothing wrong.

417
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,260
Are you really okay, Son?

418
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,130
Of course.

419
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,510
When are you leaving?

420
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,280
I will take you to the airport.

421
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,860
Don't worry, I can go by myself.

422
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,900
I will go with you.

423
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,600
Go first.

424
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:33,220
Start to think about what you want to do and to eat with me.

425
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,120
I'll soon be there too.

426
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,010
I will do that.

427
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:38,890
Mom.

428
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,360
Yeah?

429
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:46,660
If you go to China, you will be happy, right?

430
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,660
You always said you wanted to move there.

431
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:01,120
If you're also coming, there's nothing else I could hope for.

432
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:09,470
Then, it's fine. I'll see you at the airport, Mom.

433
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:26,600
♬ The countless tears which flowed past me ♬

434
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,810
♬ were like the end of unknown darkness ♬

435
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:37,300
Is it my turn to keep the promise to my father?
♬ Both when I take another step ♬

436
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,110
♬ and let out a long sigh ♬

437
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:47,810
♬ Where does the road end? ♬

438
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:55,390
♬ Good bye good bye the words to me, Good bye ♬

439
00:42:55,390 --> 00:43:00,650
♬ You please don't say good bye ♬

440
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,320
♬ Baby, it looks like I was young then ♬

441
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,820
♬ Baby, it looks like I was a coward then ♬

442
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:11,810
♬ I knew just a connection was there ♬

443
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:16,010
If... Really, if...
♬ I thought I could just reach out to you ♬

444
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,490
Even if you can't come back to school,

445
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,650
♬ Baby, I'm not afraid of anything ♬

446
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:25,290
we aren't breaking up.
♬ Will you stay with me? ♬

447
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,830
Yeah.

448
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:32,930
We'll never separate.
♬ Will you hold me tight? I also worried a lot ♬

449
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:37,440
♬ I was afraid perhaps you would be far away ♬

450
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,050
♬ Without your smile  ♬

451
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:44,130
Back then, the feeling of love I experienced for the first time...
♬ Without Your Love My Life~ ♬

452
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:47,980
Why did I take it for granted?
♬ I'm not afraid of anything ♬

453
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,090
♬ Now I will take care of you ♬

454
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:53,200
How did we
♬ Will you stay here as you are? ♬

455
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,810
think that we wouldn't break up too easily?
♬ Will you just take my hand? ♬

456
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:01,740
Why...♬ I will be the light for you ♬

457
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:06,010
Why couldn't I see your hesitation?
♬ If you also think the same way I do ♬

458
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,060
♬ Will you stay with me? ♬

459
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:13,370
How could I have known you'd leave me saying you love me?
♬ Will you hug me close to you? ♬

460
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,440
♬ Good bye ♬

461
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,860
I really didn't know then.

462
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:26,710
♬ Good bye good bye, You please don't say good bye ♬

463
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,750
He's coming.

464
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,640
Tell them to start.

465
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,580
Chae Yoon will soon arrive.

466
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:51,250
What should I do? Should I keep following that car?

467
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:56,770
I have something to tell you. Can we meet now?

468
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,570
If anything happens to me...

469
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:03,370
Will you keep scaring me like this before you leave?

470
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:08,580
Can we meet now? I have something to tell you.

471
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:11,020
Can you come to Moorim headquarters? It's urgent.

472
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,750
Don't tell anybody anything. No one must find out.

473
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,690
Yeong, Joon!

474
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,750
Yoon, please take care of the key.

475
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,680
You cannot leave like this. I will find the destructive force with you.

476
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,980
Your friend and partner, Hwang Moo Song...

477
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,680
What?

478
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,620
Don't trust him too much.

479
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,720
It's already started.

480
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:22,960
Didn't you start everything eighteen years ago?

481
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,740
Who are you?

482
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,880
I am the Chairman of Shanghai Group, Wang Hao.

483
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:40,920
I know very well that you are the destructive force.

484
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:46,580
I also know that now neither you nor the Moorim Association has any power.

485
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,560
So what?

486
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,160
I came here to negotiate.

487
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:02,150
You want to negotiate with someone who is on the verge of death?

488
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:06,260
Didn't you want to save your life through the Cheon Ui Joo?

489
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:11,230
I can help you with that.

490
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:19,510
Give the part of the Cheon Ui Joo that you stole that day to me.

491
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:29,390
Did you find the last part of the key?

492
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:31,360
How could someone so impatient

493
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:36,420
not have found the other part by now?

494
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:43,370
There should be no problem with Chae Yoon, right?

495
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:47,790
Since I called him, he should be in the headquarter's

496
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:51,140
meeting room waiting for me.

497
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,940
Hwang Moo Song is now done for.

498
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,420
Where is the third part?

499
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:23,360
Trust me and hang on for just a while.

500
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:14,230
Moo Song!

501
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,530
Get yourself together, Moo Song!

502
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,250
Here.

503
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,890
I'm sorry.

504
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:46,700
I really needed to say this.

505
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,110
I misunderstood you.

506
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,090
I should've trusted you and come to find you earlier.

507
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:56,110
Eighteen years ago...

508
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:01,030
I should have protected you like this.

509
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,500
It's not your fault.

510
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:16,720
Yeong, Yeong is alive.

511
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,310
I know.

512
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:20,210
Also...

513
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,000
That's enough. Right now.

514
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,740
Joon...

515
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:37,900
Joon is... alive.

516
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:48,650
Yoon Si Woo... There is a kid name Yoon Si Woo in our school.

517
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:54,950
He is... your son.

518
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:02,620
He resembles you quite a bit.

519
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,250
Yoon Si Woo?

520
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:13,990
I thought I could go back to see Seon Ah.

521
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,500
Let's go to Seon Ah.

522
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:22,580
Please don't lose consciousness, and let's go back to the kids.

523
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:35,930
Yoon, the key Yeong has...

524
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,250
is in the school.

525
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,860
The barrier...

526
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:58,750
The headmaster surely hid part of the key here, somewhere inside the school, and put up the barrier.

527
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,390
Let's find the Cheon Ui Joo.

528
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,110
Us?

529
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:08,240
We have to protect it in the headmaster's stead.

530
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,220
The school, the ones we love...

531
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:14,840
and

532
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,220
ourselves.

533
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:38,890
The barrier is precise. It's definite..

534
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:41,640
But, why now?

535
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:50,350
By chance... Nothing happened to Dad, right?

536
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:02,610
Hwang Moo Song disappeared.

537
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,950
- What?
- I'm sorry.

538
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:08,570
We're looking for him right now.

539
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,750
What did you just say?

540
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,510
Yoon Si Woo is Chae Yoon's son?!

541
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:29,830
What have you been doing in that school?

542
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:33,580
I... I will look into it.

543
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,250
If you leave Yoon Si Woo to me...

544
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,650
It's fine. I'll call you later.

545
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:41,240
Did you meet Chae Yoon yesterday?

546
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:46,150
No. But I'm still looking for him.

547
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:51,260
We've been fooled by Hwang Moo Song. I can't find Chae Yoon either.

548
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:09,430
My Son. Don't do this and go back with me, huh?

549
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:13,380
No. There's something I promised Dad.

550
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:18,400
If this promise is because of me...

551
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,930
Don't worry about me, Mom.

552
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,990
Chi Ang.

553
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,990
Mom, if you go to China,

554
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:44,320
and stay by Dad's side, you'll be happy, right?
♬  When I look back ♬

555
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,310
♬  I was so young  ♬

556
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:51,360
Chi Ang, all this time saying,
♬  In the last diary,  ♬

557
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,710
"Are you okay? Don't worry."
♬  Just a child filled with worries  ♬

558
00:56:54,710 --> 00:57:01,410
I'm very sorry for always making you say that.
♬  I'm leaving everything here from the past which
was difficult. ♬

559
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:04,530
Why are you sorry?
♬  Without even anyone I can go to ♬

560
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:10,150
Seeing you happy is enough for me, that's all.
♬  I will run far away. ♬

561
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:15,360
True happiness shouldn't be for anybody else but you.
♬  I’m running to you, just For You. ♬

562
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:20,280
If you aren't happy, no one around you will be either, eventually.
♬  I will be right there, believe in me.

563
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:27,330
So you have to be happy, okay?
♬  I gotta run, run, run,  ♬

564
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:29,280
♬  I must see you smiling widely  ♬

565
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,150
Okay. I'll do it.

566
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:40,550
♬ Facing an unknown future ♬

♬  Without even anyone I could go to  ♬

571
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:02,020
♬ I want to run very far away ♬

572
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:08,730
♬ I'm running to you, just to you ♬

573
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:14,870
♬  I will be right there, believe in me  ♬

574
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:18,040

575
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:24,000
♬  I gotta run, run, I've got to run.  ♬

576
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:38,920
Yes, Father?

577
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,330
I found the last part of the key.

578
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:44,610
Where is it?

579
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:48,600
With that kid you fought at the Moorim Tournament.

580
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,760
Yoon Si Woo?

581
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,790
Yoon Si Woo is Chae Yoon's son.

582
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:59,420
That kid has the last part of the key for certain.

583
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:18,110
If it's him, leave it to me.

584
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:23,540
I will for sure get that key.

585
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:38,550
Seon Ah come out, Professor Beop Gong is strange.

586
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,880
What are you doing here right now?

587
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:53,540
You knew it all along. Where is Yoon Si Woo!

588
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,150
Where are all the keys to the Cheon Ui Joo hidden?

589
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:58,990
Why are you looking in this room?

590
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:03,560
It's because Yoon Si Woo is your little brother!

591
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:08,050
Now not even the school is safe?

592
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:11,180
We've followed you since you were our professor,

593
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:16,940
but if you are going to abandon that, we will not hold back either.

594
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,870
What?

595
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:22,920
We won't watch you destroy this school anymore..

596
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:26,340
The headmaster is back!

597
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,640
The headmaster came back!

598
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,230
What?

599
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,930
Dad!

600
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:49,750
Chae Yoon. Why are you with Headmaster Hwang?

601
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,790
Dad.

602
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:41,490
If I wondered about what you said.

603
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:45,900
You wanted to know if I had space for Soon Deok in my world.

604
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,610
There is no such place

605
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:54,020
because she is my world.

606
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:58,590
You asked if I have the confidence to make Soon Deok happy.

607
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,900
I'm not really sure, but what I'm certain about is that

608
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:07,580
I'm happy in her world.

609
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:21,190
Wang Chi Ang.

610
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:24,610
Soon Deok... What about Soon Deok?

611
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,200
She left.

612
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,220
Where to?

613
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:36,150
I don't know yet.

614
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:45,840
The necklace that Soon Deok had, you gave it to her, right?

615
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:51,910
Is it really a part of the key?

616
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:53,820
Is it?

617
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:58,160
How do you know that? How much do you know?

618
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:03,740
Everything. Even the fact that you and Seon Ah are siblings. All of it!

619
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:05,070
So your Dad too...

620
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:07,990
Yeah. My Dad knows everything.

621
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:13,450
Because of you, Soon Deok is in danger. Because of the necklace you gave her!

622
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:15,520
Is this the result of what you've talked about?

623
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:21,190
You wanted to make Soon Deok happy by putting her in danger?

624
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:22,710
Why couldn't you see the truth?

625
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:28,450
Who is really putting Seon Deok in danger?
Do you have the right to say this?

626
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:30,170
Qualifications?

627
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:37,700
I was always standing behind you guys.

628
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,580
Soon Deok was always looking at only you.

629
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:46,920
But now... Soon Deok is gone.

630
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:51,760
What in the world did you do to Soon Deok?

631
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:57,430
If Soon Deok gets hurt or if something happens to Soon Deok...

632
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,760
I won't stay still,

633
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:07,000
