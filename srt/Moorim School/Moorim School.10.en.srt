1
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,520
If someone gets the Cheon Ui Joo, who is undeserving, the world will become chaotic ...

2
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,410
If something happens to me...

3
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,640
All this time,

4
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,830
The chairman has been making great efforts to push you forward as the official successor.

5
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,560
What?

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,060
But the lack of a sound justification was always the problem.

7
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,060
Justification?

8
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,700
The perfect reason for him to confidently name you his successor.

9
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm just a substitute for this friend.

10
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,010
And,

11
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:39,310
I continue to search for the student who has the ability to safeguard the key to become the headmaster.

12
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,580
Be a strong son.

13
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:54,120
A man qualified to take the greatest position, who always wins over his enemies.

14
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,670
A man who is strong.

15
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,470
You might already know that Moorim School is not your ordinary school.

16
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,530
Thus, the chairman sent you there.

17
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,590
First of all, be acknowledged by this school.

18
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,700
The chairman wants a strong successor.

19
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,660
After that, the chairman is going to do everything.

20
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,050
Moorim School
- Episode 10 -

21
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,280
Grade book.

22
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,960
The criminal did not come in with the mind for the key?

23
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,570
Yes.

24
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,060
Did you find out the who the criminal is?

25
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,080
Honestly, I'm waiting.

26
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,410
For what?

27
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,720
The criminal's confession.

28
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,690
Wait.

29
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,220
It seems like we're not the only ones who couldn't fall asleep.

30
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,480
Are you going to keep your mouth shut about the key, Headmaster Hwang Moo Song?

31
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,230
I'm talking about the key which opens the Cheon Ui Joo!

32
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,570
Who in the world is it?

33
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,340
What are you thinking about?

34
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,400
Oh...

35
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,630
It's pretty difficult, right?

36
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,790
Yeah.

37
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:17,170
And the Headmaster's office being burgled, what's this all about?

38
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:23,290
The Cheon Ui Joo that can rule the world, what's that all about?

39
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,730
Do you think Yeop Jeong knows about Cheon Ui Joo?

40
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:33,310
From the beginning, he's the guy who wanted to be the heir of Moorim.

41
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:39,670
He always tried to be the first. You also saw it.

42
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,470
Yeop Jeong is a graduate of the best martial arts school in Hong Kong.

43
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,310
He might know the most about Moorim.

44
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,880
You really don't know?

45
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,930
What?

46
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,820
About Cheon Ui Joo. Do you really not know anything about the Cheon Ui Joo?

47
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,030
I told you I don't know!

48
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,040
Yeop Jeong.

49
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,290
What do you know about the Cheon Ui Joo?

50
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,100
Why are you curious?

51
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:35,730
If you know about the key, then you could be the one who did this to the headmaster's office.

52
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,580
Stop the nonsense.

53
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,830
Even if my target was Cheon Ui Joo, do you think I would go inside the chairman's (headmaster's) room?

54
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:49,450
As long as I become the top in this school, I can get it. Why do I have to steal it for?

55
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,160
With that mindset, you think you can be the winner?

56
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,880
What's wrong with you today?

57
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,440
It's none of your business anyway. You're not related to this incident anyway.

58
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,000
How am I not related to it?

59
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,390
You're also a student in Moorim School, right?

60
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:12,250
Have fun, recover, and leave.

61
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,400
What did you say?

62
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:20,890
You've already done enough. Why don't you leave and go back to your place?

63
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:26,100
There is no reason for the great idol to be here anymore.

64
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,330
Hey, be careful!

65
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,600
I'm not being myself.

66
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Be careful with the knives. The cooking teacher always says that.

67
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,200
- Yoon Si Woo.
- What?

68
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:02,400
During the concert, the light which almost fell on you halted briefly.

69
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I saw it. It was very brief but I saw it.

70
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,300
How did you do it?

71
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,390
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

72
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,720
No, I clearly saw it. It was the same for the wolves.

73
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,070
The more I think about it you've always been different.

74
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:32,120
You were the first to enter the school by breaking the barrier.

75
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,590
Back then, it might not have been me. It could've been Wang Chi Ang.

76
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,320
No. It was you.

77
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,050
Even if I did, it might be a coincidence.

78
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,370
I'm envious even if it is a coincidence.

79
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:53,360
If I had powers like that, I could probably help my dad.

80
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,180
It would be better if you would just ask the headmaster to tell everything to relieve him.

81
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,560
If you can't bear it anymore, tell me.

82
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,240
I can definitely share the load. Just like you said, I'm your daughter.

83
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:16,700
I'm waiting for it. I can wait.

84
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,060
Goodbye.

85
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,660
Sim Soon Deok!

86
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,450
What are you doing here?

87
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,880
- To go to the school with you.
- Really?

88
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,810
I'm fine now.

89
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,030
Finally, Wang Chi Ang is coming back to Moorim School!

90
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,900
But before that, I need to finish all the homework I couldn't do.

91
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,850
Homework?

92
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,150
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

93
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,760
Are you going to keep your mouth shut?

94
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,580
What do you mean?

95
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,710
I know you were not in the room the night the professors came to check.

96
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,440
I saw you were wearing your shoes underneath the blanket.

97
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:23,650
Yeah, like you said, I'm pathetic. I just fell asleep with my shoes on.

98
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:28,190
Stop your nonsense. You came in a hurry to hide so you didn't have enough time to take off your shoes!

99
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,620
Don't accuse me on your own.

100
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,320
Stop all your nonsense and go confess to the chairman (headmaster). I'm saying this out of compassion.

101
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,970
Aren't you going to shut it? Stop your nonsense!

102
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:49,880
Are you going to say that I did it, and make people think that I'm trash?!

103
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,290
Yeah, I must look pathetic.

104
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,630
You, who see yourself as the successor for Hong Kong's best martial arts school,

105
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:04,450
and who loves to show off. Wow, how ridiculous this all must have been for you.

106
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:09,300
Do you want your family to be proud, so you're looking for the Cheon Ui Joo?

107
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,750
That's why you're here?

108
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,870
Shut your mouth!

109
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,200
Are you going to hit me again? You guys also looked down on me too.

110
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,670
What are you guys? What so good about you guys?

111
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,660
Stop it.

112
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:26,810
Don't butt it. For someone who does not know where he was born,

113
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,240
you're looking down at me.

114
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,350
Are you really the one who entered his office?

115
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,360
Grade book

116
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,450
Why?

117
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,500
Go tell the truth to the headmaster.

118
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,630
If you want to tell him, you can all go and tell him.

119
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,550
I don't have anything to say.

120
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,700
Choi Ho!

121
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,140
No need.

122
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,090
Why did you do it?

123
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:31,690
The you whom I know is not the kind of person who would do this.

124
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,970
You don't have anything to prove that I'm the culprit!

125
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,290
I just wanted to correct the error!

126
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,810
You did something very foolish.

127
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,970
Being in the beginners' class versus the advanced class does not mean that your skills are lacking.

128
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,930
It's supposed to give you time to reflect upon yourself.

129
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:59,710
So, is this why you told Yoon Si Woo about the Cheon Ui Joo?

130
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,840
I'm just a substitute for this friend.

131
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,740
Also, I continue to search for the student

132
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,790
who has the ability to safeguard the key to become the master of Moorim.

133
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,690
Are you thinking of Yoon Si Woo as the successor of Moorim School?

134
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,210
Why? Why in the world is it this jerk?

135
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,720
This jerk just—

136
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,050
Now I see that you don't even have a right to be in the beginners' class.

137
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,230
And even more than that, you have no right to be at Moorim School.

138
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,310
Go back home.

139
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,550
Is it just this, the place you wanted to go to?

140
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:54,210
Let's just have a cup of hot tea.

141
00:12:54,210 --> 00:13:00,600
Well, it's alright. The ambiance is nice, and I haven't had warm tea in a while.

142
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,190
You suffered a lot.

143
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,190
About?

144
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,730
Because you were nursing me you weren't able to go work at your part-time job or sleep very well.

145
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,850
I know that it's quite a thing for Sim Soon Deok to give up a part-time job.

146
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,700
Since you were hurt because of me, I have to do at least that much.

147
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,250
I'm still very sorry towards you.

148
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,550
Stop saying this.

149
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,090
Right? I don't need to be sorry anymore, right?

150
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,230
That's right.

151
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:36,550
So... I won't say I'm sorry anymore. You told me not to.

152
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:43,930
You already know what I want to hear from you.

153
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,000
I want you to stop losing your way.

154
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,620
What is this?

155
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,520
Open it.

156
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,610
Tiger swallowtail butterflies grant wishes.

157
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,140
So I caught one for you.

158
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,470
Sorry but...

159
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,280
I can't accept this, Wang Chi Ang.

160
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,960
I said I wouldn't say sorry...

161
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,260
Is it because... of Yoon Si Woo?

162
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,210
Huh?

163
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:01,230
You're sorry... Is it because of Yoon Si Woo?

164
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:08,930
You know it. You know how I feel about you.

165
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:16,990
My feelings are not fooling around. You know that too.

166
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:28,810
I know. I know that you're serious. Because of that I can't accept it.

167
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,090
I'm so sorry.

168
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,540
I can't give you up.

169
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,370
Wang Chi Ang...

170
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,460
Don't be burdened.

171
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:02,630
I think a person's heart is just like a butterfly.

172
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,720
If you try forcefully to hold onto it, it flies away.

173
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,120
I will no longer go chasing after you like a young kid would.

174
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:26,100
Instead, I'll show you what kind of person I am.

175
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,910
I'm going to show you that I'm not just an "okay" guy.

176
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,600
I'll try to show you my best side.

177
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,180
I'll give you the necklace then.

178
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,220
Chi Ang...

179
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,510
I feel like if I don't do this I won't be able to get over my feelings for you.

180
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:50,270
So... This is not because of you,

181
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:56,500
but it can be because of me.

182
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:03,310
So don't feel burdened by me. You already have so much on your shoulders.

183
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,910
I don't want to become baggage.

184
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,450
Let's go back to school now.

185
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:36,490
If someone gets the Cheon Ui Joo, who is undeserving, the world will become chaotic ...

186
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,310
If something happens to me...

187
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,840
Who is it?

188
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,500
Aigo, such a young person...it's a shame.

189
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,630
What in the world happened?

190
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,810
He was fine. How can someone die like this?

191
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:27,370
I went to go meet that person who knew about the occurrence from fifteen years ago.

192
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,150
That person died.

193
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,030
Can't it be just an accident?

194
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,330
Doubt it.

195
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,850
It was probably by the person who's scared of me meeting him.

196
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:46,470
The person who killed my wife and is covering up the truth.

197
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,670
The person who became silent after getting rid of the evidence.

198
00:19:53,890 --> 00:20:02,310
If the person you are referring to is Headmaster Hwang Moo Song, should I arrange for you to meet with him?

199
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:14,800
It's not the time yet, since it would be a fight without victory.

200
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,390
Eat up, Jenny!

201
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,000
Is it a special day?

202
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,780
Is it my birthday?

203
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,270
It has to be this much if you're going to congratulate me on my comeback.

204
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,000
- What the heck?
- Wang Chi Ang!

205
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,350
Wang Chi Ang!

206
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,820
Here.

207
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,000
Good job, Hwang Seon Ah.

208
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,370
Are you okay?

209
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,450
Of course.

210
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,870
Anyway, congrats on your comeback!

211
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,360
We are a little upset about a recent incident that happened.

212
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,950
It's not because we're not happy to see you.

213
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,890
I heard it all from Seon Ah.

214
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,950
Don't be upset. All we have to do is convince the headmaster, no?

215
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,870
He's also not that headstrong guy anyway.

216
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,960
Also, who am I? I'm the son of the school's sponsor.

217
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,100
Right. Stay strong and eat a lot!

218
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,710
In times like these, we have to keep our heads straight. You all know that, right?

219
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,550
Fighting. Fighting!

220
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,250
- Fighting!
- Fighting.

221
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,630
But isn't this a lot?

222
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,280
Eat.

223
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,760
We should eat a lot.

224
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,350
I'll have to clean the bathroom alone from now on.

225
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,500
Oh... I suddenly lost my appetite.

226
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,690
Sorry. I talked about the person whose name shall not be mentioned.

227
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,010
I can't understand why Choi Ho turned out to be like this.

228
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,460
- Me either.
- So did he steal the Cheon Ui Joo?

229
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,600
That means he has nothing to do with this!

230
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,600
He just did not want to go to the beginners class.

231
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,090
I'm going to see Choi Ho after I'm done eating.

232
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,850
This is the first thing to do on my comeback schedule.

233
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,120
You think you can leave like this?

234
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,980
Choi Ho.

235
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,860
Go to the headmaster and ask for forgiveness.

236
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,040
Leaving or being expelled, you can leave the school afterwards.

237
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,990
What do you know for you to say that?

238
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,530
You just arrived at the school. You think you can say this to me

239
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,810
just because you made it to the advanced class?

240
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,330
Do you think I chose to climb Moorim Peak instead of being expelled because I somehow liked this school?

241
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,510
Aren't you embarrassed? Leaving like this.

242
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,160
Don't you have any pride?

243
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,840
For three days you suffered, and you're just going to leave like this?

244
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,530
I saw it clearly.

245
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,260
I saw who is the one who is being acknowledged by this school?

246
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,420
What... are you saying?

247
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,080
It's Yoon Si Woo.

248
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:46,260
Last night I heard the headmaster telling him about Cheon Ui Joo.

249
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,390
Don't you know what that means?

250
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,920
A guy, out of nowhere, enters the school,

251
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,470
and he wants to make him his successor!

252
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,500
Don't expel him. Give him another chance, just as you did to for us, before.

253
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,780
He entered my office to fix up his grades.

254
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,080
He betrayed every single person in this school.

255
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,470
Didn't you say that a betrayer is also a comrade and a friend?

256
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,810
This betrayer is your comrade and also your friend.

257
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:26,490
You're all responsible for his betrayal. I hope you won't forget this.

258
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,040
If Choi Ho betrayed us, then it's everyone's fault.

259
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,820
Give him one last chance, please.

260
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,950
I second this.

261
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,110
Headmaster, think about it one more time.

262
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,400
Choi Ho is a hardworking student.

263
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,840
If you allow him to stay, I'll work twice as hard.

264
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,850
Wang Chi Ang, I'm...

265
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,370
I'll just do as I please.

266
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,690
You do as you are doing, and I'll do as I am doing.

267
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,960
You're the coolest guy I've met.

268
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,160
A friend like you,

269
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,050
I don't know if I'll ever meet one.

270
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,800
If you weren't an okay guy,

271
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,010
I would not be having a hard time.

272
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,470
Yeah. You go on your way,

273
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,770
and I'll also go on my way.

274
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,150
Thank you, for coming back.

275
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,250
What about Choi Ho?

276
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,040
He left.

277
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,720
What?

278
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,730
He left, this jerk.

279
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,770
I can in some way understand Choi Ho.

280
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,600
For a long time,

281
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,890
I also kept everything about my past to myself.

282
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,740
I'm dreaming a lot nowadays.

283
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,920
Are those dreams? Or are those memories?

284
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,990
Is it something that happened or just my imagination?

285
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,750
It's like...

286
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,770
my unknown past is waking up.

287
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,770
Wang Chi Ang.

288
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,220
What is the Cheon Ui Joo?

289
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,160
If you have all the power in the world,

290
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,810
would it be great?

291
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,420
Hello?

292
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:58,780
Why are you looking for my mom?

293
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,450
Who?

294
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,000
Mr Park's wife?

295
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,500
Who— Oh my!

296
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,380
Ji Soo-ssi! How have you been?

297
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,820
He died?

298
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,510
Who...

299
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,470
After the incident, there was one person from Moorim.

300
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:33,790
A Geo Ji person saw a man who came out, holding a child.

301
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:41,700
These memories of that day are still blurry. I still can't remember.

302
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,790
You found the girl?

303
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,520
If that person is with Chae Yoon's child,

304
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,800
we will find the other part of the key in no time.

305
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,770
Let's report it to the chairman.

306
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,490
One of your friends died.

307
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,330
Why are you looking for Soon Deok instead of going to his funeral?

308
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:27,150
Find her and tell her to come! Her school should be close.

309
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,810
That's why...

310
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,880
What are you saying, our Soon Deok is not attending this academy?

311
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,990
I tell you that we don't have a student named Sim Soon Deok.

312
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,010
No, what happened...

313
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,540
She's not attending this academy?

314
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,360
Did I make a mistake...?

315
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,780
You think I'm stupid just because I'm blind?

316
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,450
For all this time, have you been hiding something?

317
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,010
I really don't know!

318
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,040
If you're curious, go ask Soon Deok directly.

319
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,530
This...

320
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,170
Looks like you don't care one bit about my daughter.

321
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,860
What are you saying?

322
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,920
Then does it make sense that you don't know which academy she's attending?!

323
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,770
I don't know, I don't know!

324
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,080
The truth is...

325
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,680
she's attending a school.

326
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,480
A sch-sch-school?

327
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,940
This school in the mountain... Moorim School...

328
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,680
Omo! What's wrong?

329
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,490
This little... This little!

330
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,440
Ahjumma Bang Deok

331
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,510
Ahjumma Bang Deok

332
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,790
Missed calls.

333
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,780
Did something happened?

334
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,880
Where did Soon Deok go?

335
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,260
It's really strange here.

336
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,690
I really don't know where I'm going.

337
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,760
I'm not sure from where, but I keep on having this familiar feeling.

338
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,900
I was the same.

339
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,380
The day I got my college acceptance letter

340
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,440
We were so poor,

341
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,650
I went down after crying a lot in the forest,

342
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,560
I lost my way home.

343
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,360
Is that when you met the headmaster?

344
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,440
No.

345
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,740
I met Seon Ah.

346
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,620
Hwang Seon Ah?

347
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:48,700
Seon Ah had left the school without her dad knowing.

348
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:55,630
While I was lost with Seon Ha, I had the thought that going to school would let us live.

349
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:01,480
At that moment, the barrier opened.

350
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:09,830
On that day, I wanted it to be destiny.

351
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,430
Destiny?

352
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,870
Yeah, it must have been destiny.

353
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:27,680
Meeting you in the middle of the mountain as well.

354
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,040
But I'm often anxious.

355
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,300
It seems that I am going to be swept somewhere dark and cold.

356
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,880
The past that I can't remember,
♬ You, whom I will only love, ♬

357
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,750
is there something I can't handle?
♬ You, whom I will only love, ♬

358
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,370
Yoon Si Woo.
♬ the person who is waiting for me far away, ♬

359
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,700
Honestly, Cheon Ui Joo is not too unfamiliar either.
♬ the person who is waiting for me far away, ♬

360
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:04,130
But when I tell myself not to think about it,
♬ You are my love ♬

361
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,200
my head hurts terribly.
♬  Like a half grown child ♬

362
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,290
♬ I am laughing over and over again ♬

363
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,780
No matter what happened in your past,
♬ just to be ♬

364
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:19,260
Yoon Si Woo, you're just Yoon Si Woo.
♬  only walking together with you ♬

365
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,590
Don't worry.
♬ When I see you ♬

366
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,500
No matter what waits for us at the end,
♬ when I take your hand ♬

367
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,140
can you stay with me?
♬ My day will fly by too quickly ♬

368
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,330
Yes, I'll be together with you.

369
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:41,280
♬ That love is happiness rather than pain ♬

370
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:47,160
♬  is the love which I have learned  ♬

371
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:55,950
♬  Even in a small room, always smelling only your perfume  ♬

372
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:01,860
♬  When you the person I love  ♬

373
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,290
♬ are sad and cry again it is certain ♬

374
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:15,850
♬ you are my love ♬

375
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:20,870
Wang Chi Ang!
♬ It’s okay if it’s unsaid ♬

376
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,890
♬ It’s okay if it just must be hidden ♬

377
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:29,850
I didn't see anything.
♬ Beneath an empty sky there is only you and I ♬

378
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:37,760
♬  When I see you, when I take your hand ♬

379
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:44,990
♬  my time flies by too quickly ♬

380
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,310
Judge wisely whether he is your foe or on your side,
♬ That love is ♬

381
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,890
and don't get stabbed in the back later.
♬  happiness more than pain ♬

382
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:52,800
What?

383
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,890
The words you said back then... Don't they bother you?
♬  is the love which I have learned ♬

384
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,960
Last night this guy talked about
the Cheon Ui Joo with the headmaster.

385
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,060
Don't you know what this means?
♬ Let's not rush it ♬

386
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,770
♬ Let's not even hesitate ♬

387
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:12,370
I lost to that guy.
♬ I’m afraid because it might suddenly fade ♬

388
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,450
What could the Cheon Ui Joo be?
♬ For the time full of happiness ♬

389
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:20,000
Is having all power in the world really such a good thing?
♬  we will spend together ♬

390
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,750
♬ I’m thankful my love. ♬

391
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,950
Is it because of Yoon Si Woo?

392
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:36,620
I can't back down like this. No matter what.

393
00:34:52,430 --> 00:35:00,520
Say it with your own mouth. Is it true you're attending Moorim School? Is it true?!

394
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Dad.

395
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,240
Since this father of yours is blind, you should think about being his eyes, not be on the front lines fooling him.

396
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,440
How long did you think you could hide it?

397
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,290
Moorim School is not as strange as you think it is.

398
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:18,750
It's a martial art school on a mountain. How is that not strange?

399
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,060
Quit.

400
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,460
I know what you are worried about,

401
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,020
but can't you trust me just once?

402
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,830
It wasn't easy to work part-time in the evening while studying at school during the day.

403
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:35,130
But the reason I went so far is because this school is really good.

404
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,480
Who told you to do so?

405
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,990
Did I tell you to earn some money or go to college?

406
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:47,170
If you don't have anything, then you don't! Don't be greedy and just live!

407
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,820
It's not greed!

408
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,200
I am doing this because no matter what, I want to live with you.

409
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,580
For people like us who have nothing, is there another school in this world

410
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,390
where I can go to without having to worry about the school tuition?!

411
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,950
It's better for you to go to a school where we have to pay the school fees.

412
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,400
Even if I have to go into debt, I will send you there.

413
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,950
Does that even make sense to you?! With our situation now, do you think I can go to college?!

414
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:13,910
You, you dare to attend a strange school and now yell at your father?

415
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:22,370
Dad, please. Don't be like that.

416
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:27,550
Go to your room now. Don't even think about going near that school again.

417
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,060
You're really too much.

418
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,850
Too much? How am I too much?

419
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:38,340
I was really good at studying while going to school, but you didn't know.

420
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,290
Because I knew you would worry about college tuition fees,

421
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:45,190
I threw away my acceptance letter and you didn't even know about it then.

422
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:51,190
Like back then, just pretend you don't know!

423
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:55,540
It's fine if you just pretend you don't know, like you always did!

424
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,190
Soon Deok, you...

425
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:02,120
Do you know how I lived just to appease you?

426
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:07,130
Even though my own two eyes are perfectly fine, every day I've lived in darkness.

427
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:11,610
Living each and every day was hard, and I was suffocating.

428
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:17,590
But because I was able to attend this school, I was able to breathe again.

429
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:23,000
Even though it's hard, I am using every ounce of my energy to keep going.

430
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,970
So please, please just once...

431
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:34,750
Never. No matter what I cannot let you go to that school.

432
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,550
What exactly is your reason for going this far?

433
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:41,290
I can't understand why you hate that school so much.

434
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:44,580
So I can clearly understand, tell me the reason why.

435
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,170
Quit your part time job immediately,

436
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:57,560
stay in the house and don't move a muscle until I find a new place for us to live.

437
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,210
Dad!

438
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,310
What did you say right now?

439
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:33,090
In a month, there'll be a Moorim Tournament.

440
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,980
Wasn't this tournament the finals every year?

441
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:41,450
It was like that in the past, but I'm thinking of doing it differently this time around.

442
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,910
Differently?

443
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:50,520
It will not only be our students. I'll let in people who have already graduated from this school.

444
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,660
Pardon?

445
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:57,850
You will lift the barrier to let people from the outside in? No. This is way too risky.

446
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:02,420
As you see, the kids at Moorim are now different from before.

447
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,660
We need skilled people right now.

448
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:12,850
As you said, Moorim is different now, but because it is different, we must not open the barrier.

449
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,960
What if the destructive force enters the school?

450
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,920
Professor Kim, what is the main goal of this school in teaching martial arts?

451
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,870
What?

452
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:25,990
With martial arts, they can stop fights.

453
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:33,000
One who is truly strong will be able to stop a fight.

454
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,020
The destructive force acts unexpectedly. Is this why you want us to protect ourselves?

455
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,780
I agree with you.

456
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:50,700
Moorim Tournament...the school and the fate of Moorim is on the line for.

457
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,970
It'll be a very important contest.

458
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,800
Moorim championships public announcement
Date: 2016.02.22
Moorim Championship?

459
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:05,200
Wasn't this tournament supposed to be our finals?
Participants: Current students and outside Applicants

460
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,420
Why is this on already?

461
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,440
They're letting strangers in?

462
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,160
Yes!

463
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:17,140
The person you are trying to reach is unavailable...

464
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,760
Soon Deok isn't answering, right?

465
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,060
She'll come eventually. Where else could she possibly go?

466
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,860
Did you see the announcement?

467
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,610
The Moorim championships?

468
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:34,860
They're letting in people from the outside. They must really want to find the number one.

469
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,520
What are you worried about? Just do it the usual way.

470
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,620
You worked hard.

471
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:54,440
Professor Kim Dae Ho, I want to create a special class to debut at the tournament

472
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,140
I was actually thinking of making the class tougher.

473
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:02,860
Therefore I'd like to bring on another professor.

474
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,970
Do you have someone in mind?

475
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,120
Moorim Tournament? Finally, there's something that Go Sang Man can do for this school.

476
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,910
Being at the bottom of the bunch at the tournament?

477
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:25,920
My mom dreamed of a dragon gracefully flying in the sky with a pearl when she conceived me.

478
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,970
When I think about it, it was the Cheon Ui Joo, not a pearl!

479
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,350
The way he's interpreting it is awesome.

480
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:36,660
Stop the nonsense and practice if you don't wanna lose face in the competition.

481
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,900
Don't disgrace our school with your horrible skills.

482
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,700
Looks like he's getting private lessons.

483
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,210
What is he eating that he talks to us so distastefully every time he eats it?

484
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:49,730
Leave him alone. Since they are letting in outsiders this time, he must be getting nervous too.

485
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,790
In any case, this time a proper result will come out.

486
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:56,190
Indeed, who will be the best in Moorim?

487
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,790
Since, for the midterm exams we had them pick their events by chance,

488
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:19,130
this time we've decided to let everyone compete in their own specialty.

489
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,900
Yong Chun Quan versus Taekwondo, Kung Fu versus Hapkido. Something like that?

490
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:29,470
It's fun.They'll choose what they prefer to do while displaying their skills.

491
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,910
Still, I'm not sure about unlocking the barrier.

492
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,820
What is the headmaster thinking?

493
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,880
I'll be leaving first.

494
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,200
Where are you going?

495
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,680
I need to prepare a special class for the Moorim Tournament.

496
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,430
Are you really going to move?

497
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:56,010
You don't understand my words? We will move as far away as possible.

498
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,570
You might not know it but

499
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,340
the son of CEO Wang is attending this school.

500
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,530
It seems like it's not some ordinary school.

501
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,100
Don't do that. Just...

502
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,110
They all go here because they're planning on doing something dirty.

503
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,350
Something dirty? What is it?

504
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:15,000
There is something like that. You don't need to know.

505
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,540
By any chance...

506
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,120
Stop talking.

507
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:27,250
No, but... I was just wondering if it was related to your blindness...

508
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:32,110
What is it then? Why are you so against it?

509
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,010
Are you okay?

510
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,880
If you ever say this in front of Soon Deok,

511
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,010
I won't see you ever again.

512
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,850
Y-Yes.

513
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,050
♬  Yeah I am alive ♬

514
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,130
♬  Look straight at me ♬

515
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:13,600
♬  For dozens of times I will get up once again ♬

516
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,530
♬  Yeah I am alive ♬

517
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,630
♬  Watch me ♬

518
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:21,300
♬  Now close both eyes and feel me ♬

519
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,660
♬  In the deep pitch-black darkness♬

520
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,920
♬  Like a child who has lost his way ♬

521
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,420
♬  Even if I scream ♬

522
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,370
♬  No one will hear, yeah ♬

523
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:37,670
♬  Buried deep in my heart ♬

524
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,000
♬  In the memory of a shout directed at me ♬

525
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,190
Will you really be okay?

526
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,780
♬  Barely holds onto me ♬

527
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,760
I miss you.

528
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,860
♬  It's become the only light which shines under cover on me ♬

529
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,100
Be a strong son.
♬  Surviving again♬

530
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,350
You need to be on top.

531
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:01,300
A man who can win no matter who he fights.
♬  Yeah I'm alive ♬

532
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,130
♬  Look straight at me ♬

533
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:05,370
Someone who will lead Shanghai Group.
♬  I will get up once again for dozens of times.♬

534
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,350
Someone who has strength.

535
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:08,150
♬  Watch over me ♬

536
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:12,150
First, be acknowledged by the school.
♬  Now close both eyes and feel me♬

537
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:15,940
The Chairman wants a strong successor.
♬  In front of everyone♬

538
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:19,240
♬  I'll show more of myself ♬

539
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,190
♬  I'm living breathing ♬

540
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:26,800
♬  I'm newly born ♬

541
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,130
You were here?

542
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,300
Hwang Seon Ah, you haven't heard from Soon Deok, right?

543
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,460
No.

544
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,530
I think something happened to Soon Deok.

545
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,550
I think we should try going to Soon Deok's house.

546
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:09,330
Because of the kidnapping my dad won't give me permission.

547
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:13,260
Chi Ang probably knows her address.

548
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,260
I'm not going.

549
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,010
It's possible this is a good thing.

550
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,550
What are you talking about?

551
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,010
Shall we see how much you've improved?

552
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:31,930
Right now, I...

553
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,010
Stop! You'll get hurt.

554
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:59,030
You got better.

555
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:01,930
You're taking part in the Moorim Tournament?

556
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:02,910
Of course I am.

557
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:04,010
Don't participate.

558
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:05,550
What?

559
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,380
I have a reason to win this.

560
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,350
If you get in my way,

561
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:19,050
I'll destroy you, even if you're my friend.

562
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,310
Wang Chi Ang!

563
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:37,670
If you still insist and you're going to compete,

564
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:43,030
with everything I have, I will beat you and break you into pieces.

565
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,460
Ay!

566
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,480
Tae! Kwon! Do!

567
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,290
Spread your legs.

568
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:16,650
Lower. That's it. Good.

569
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:17,840
Left arm! Ay!

570
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,110
- Ay!
- That's it.

571
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:20,970
Ay!

572
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:24,030
Tae! Kwon! Do!

573
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:28,080
Not strong enough. Put more strength in your stomach.

574
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,520
Ay!

575
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,620
Tae! Kwon! Do!

576
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,210
Professor!

577
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,650
Here.

578
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,870
You really are a hidden treasure of Moorim School.

579
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:49,090
Treasure of Moorim?

580
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:53,060
If the kids heard you, they'd laugh.

581
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,720
It's good to see you've been doing well.

582
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,130
I heard there's going to be a tournament at Moorim?

583
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:04,730
What? Do you regret refusing the successor offer and leaving?

584
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:07,900
I'd be lying if I said I don't regret it.

585
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,640
But being a successor isn't my position.

586
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,240
But if I can help with anything, tell me.

587
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,180
I want to repay you. I'll do anything.

588
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,020
This is why I'm here today.

589
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:25,910
The headmaster needs you.

590
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,890
The headmaster?

591
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:32,790
It must be difficult to prepare for the tournament.

592
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:35,820
I really want to come in first place in the tournament.

593
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:41,660
Is there something you want by coming in first place?

594
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:42,390
Yes.

595
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:47,270
That's right. You're at the age where you have to get what you want.

596
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:49,190
I was the same.

597
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,220
You were?

598
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:56,140
I would stay up just to get what I want, just like you.

599
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:01,200
So, did you get what you wanted?

600
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,960
My good friend got what I wanted.

601
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,460
He was born with the perfect personality. Even his effort was perfect.

602
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:17,850
Even the woman I loved... Even the position for Moorim's successor...

603
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:23,200
He got it all.

604
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:35,930
My best friend is the obstacle I never overcame.

605
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:40,640
He is the misfortune I couldn't avoid.

606
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:45,980
I was so immature to think that...

607
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:49,350
There were moments I wished my friend would disappear.

608
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:53,880
Just like you, right now.

609
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:06,180
So what happened between you and the friend?

610
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,230
I realized after I lost the friend,

611
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:14,280
that my superficial jealousy had destroyed something very important,

612
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:21,570
that everything that was bright was because we were together.

613
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:31,170
In the moment that you think that you've lost more than you've gained, it's already too late.

614
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:38,920
Even so, didn't you win in the end and gain everything?

615
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,130
The opponent that you need to beat is not external.

616
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,710
That held true for me then, and holds true for you now.

617
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:50,200
If you could return to that time again, what would you do?

618
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:54,490
Would you just give everything up?

619
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:58,810
I am sure there will be another way. I am still searching for that other way.

620
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:09,000
If in the past you had given everything up to your friend, you would have different regrets now.

621
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:15,120
So, I can't give up.

622
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:22,670
I want to become a powerful person, Headmaster.

623
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,910
I'm going to become the kind of person who can't be overpowered, the number one.

624
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,910
Even so, if you compete, I will beat you

625
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:54,810
and I will break you into pieces.

626
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,440
It's been a long time.

627
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,790
Because I'm on edge.

628
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:45,700
Me too. When I listen to you play this lullaby, my heart becomes peaceful.

629
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,370
Without me even thinking about it, I've come here.

630
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,430
Should I keep playing?

631
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:53,160
To tell you the truth, I can't really remember

632
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:59,920
but from a long time ago this melody has been in my memories.

633
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,050
Really?

634
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:05,070
Could I have possibly heard this from my mother?

635
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:11,420
So when I listen to you play this lullaby, just like when you have a good dream, my heart becomes more at ease.

636
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,780
Also, thanks to that, my adjustment to the school was fast.

637
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:19,790
Well, that's a relief, that I was able to be of help to you.

638
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,640
- But, Hwang Seon Ah.
- Hm?

639
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:32,580
You said that I halted that light fixture on stage and opened the barrier, right?

640
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:36,360
Why that, all of a sudden?

641
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,290
It'll be okay, right?

642
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:49,830
What?

643
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:54,750
You and Soon Deok. Chi Ang.

644
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,950
And, all of us.

645
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,910
We should be okay.

646
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,230
I think I know, at least a little bit,

647
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:17,270
why I came here and what I have to do.

648
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,230
What are you going to do?

649
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,160
I am going face things head on.

650
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:36,860
No longer will I avoid the issue or run away. I am going to find out for sure.

651
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:41,560
So, what?

652
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:45,100
Cheon Ui Joo

653
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,000
and about my past.

654
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,140
Are you saying that your past and Cheon Ui Joo are related?

655
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,300
Yes, they might be.

656
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,480
No they are for sure.

657
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:17,720
Since we did a tournament last year, why don't we change it up for this year's Moorim competition?

658
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,320
I think two-on-two would be good.

659
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,320
If they have to compete while making up for each other's weaknesses, it will encourage teamwork.

660
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:29,260
If one of the two players survives all the way through the match, it will be a competition.

661
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,220
That's not a bad idea.

662
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:37,390
To not favor the new students, we will be announcing the rules the day of the tournament.

663
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,640
What's the situation with the outside competitors?

664
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,110
There were a lot more international Moorim Association applicants than we were expecting.

665
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:45,490
I'll prepare the list and put it up as soon as possible.

666
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:48,880
If we're going to be letting outsiders in to compete anyway,

667
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,740
how about inviting Moorim Association board members, and

668
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:55,160
how about inviting the families of the students as well?

669
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,610
Then there would be too many outsiders. Wouldn't that be dangerous?

670
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:04,550
For that, let's think about it a little more before we make any decisions.

671
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:12,460
What do we do about Seon Deok?

672
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,580
For now, list her in the category for Taekwondo.

673
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,150
Okay.

674
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,670
What are you going to do?

675
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,430
I don't know yet.

676
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:29,950
Are you concerned more about Soon Deok than the Moorim competition?

677
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,980
Yeah. How about you? Are you really not going to go visit her?

678
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,620
I told you I have no time for that.

679
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:54,240
I think Chi Ang is trying too hard for this competition.

680
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,710
It's not just him.

681
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:06,660
Everyone else is trying hard too, more sincerely than before.

682
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,280
Headmaster.

683
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:38,150
Follow me. I'm also going to see Soon Deok.

684
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:47,880
Can't you wash it properly? Look here! There is still food left on this one!

685
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:53,400
I know right. Why aren't they washing well today?! Both the dishes and my heart...

686
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,190
You don't seem like yourself today.

687
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:57,890
Wang Chi Ang, you don't seem like yourself either.

688
00:58:57,890 --> 00:59:02,290
It would be nice if you smiled to Si Woo like you smile around me.

689
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:07,580
Just having to look at him is difficult, but now you're asking me to smile at him?

690
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:10,890
That's a very cruel request.

691
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,780
Wang Chi Ang.

692
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:17,890
Never mind. I'm going to take the trash out.

693
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:25,350
I'll take out the trash and in return please give me some special tutoring.

694
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:26,300
Special tutoring?

695
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,590
This time, let me borrow your weights please.

696
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,080
This?

697
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,500
Do you wear this every day?

698
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,930
I even wear it when I sleep.

699
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,650
Makes me wonder how did we ended up this far...

700
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:08,000
I think it was around here that I met Soon Deok and Chi Ang.

701
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:15,870
I was planning to see Soon Deok but this brat, Wang Chi Ang, attacked me.

702
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:23,010
At that time, you must have been feeling like the world had turned its back to you.

703
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:31,600
Yes. I just didn't realize at the time that I was turning my back on the world.

704
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,540
Don't you want to return?

705
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:42,000
Instead of like before, when I was standing at the top and always fearing how I might fall,

706
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,500
standing here, and looking around, doesn't seem like a bad idea either.

707
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:53,710
You must have gained the confidence to realize that you could go back to the top at any time.

708
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:59,060
I had thought that this was just a strange school that just taught martial arts.

709
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,490
Ah, I'm sorry. Back then—

710
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:10,220
Don't be sorry. I had thought you were some strange guy back then.

711
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:14,810
I wondered why in the world you were so on edge.

712
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:21,390
What could be so scary and so difficult to handle that you were destroying your own body?

713
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:23,640
That's what I thought.

714
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:32,760
I think it's because of my hidden past that I dared not take a peek at.

715
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:38,160
Now... Are you ready to face your past?

716
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:52,880
Headmaster ... I think Cheon Ui Joo may be somehow related to my past.

717
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:01,600
You must have been very scared.

718
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:11,920
However, no matter the end result, in order to find myself, I will keep working hard.

719
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:25,520
At first, I really didn't want to come here.

720
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,070
That's how it was.

721
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:37,950
But now I think that it's a place I had to come to anyway.

722
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:42,860
No matter how much I resisted, I came here in the end.

723
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:48,990
Here, I feel like I'm becoming a different person.

724
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:53,290
Now, no matter how hard I try,

725
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:58,060
it feels like I can never go back to being the person I was before,

726
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:03,480
like I've passed the point of no return.

727
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:25,210
Hello. Is this Sim Soon Deok's residence?

728
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:27,510
Aigoo, aigoo. Yes.

729
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:30,620
Hello, I'm Moorim School Headmaster Hwang Moo Song.

730
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:33,790
I know. Of course, I know you, Headmaster.

731
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:40,450
Finally, what needed to come has come— Ah, I mean, finally the person that needed to come has come.

732
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,330
Please wait.

733
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:46,520
Soon Deok! Soon Deok's father!

734
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:55,450
What's all the commotion? Did a war erupt out here?

735
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:58,110
Hello.

736
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:04,110
Headmaster. Yoon Si Woo.

737
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:12,290
Omo, what's wrong? Are you okay?
