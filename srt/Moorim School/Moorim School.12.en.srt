1
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,320
Are you okay? I thought you'd block it!

2
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,250
Are you okay?

3
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,940
It's strange. I definitely felt the same feeling.

4
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,990
What the heck is this?

5
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,350
I wanted to try Gi Chae Sul, but it's not going well.

6
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,990
Gi Chae Sul?

7
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,910
You tried to stop Soon Deok's fist? With just your energy?

8
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,990
You were startled, right? Sorry, let's stop.

9
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,530
Stop what?!

10
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,440
Don't do that.

11
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,260
You... You'd better stop it properly this time.

12
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,860
The thing you want to protect the most.

13
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:04,060
If you protect this person with all your might, I think it might add to your strength.

14
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,480
Moorim School
- Episode 12 -

15
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,570
You're going back?

16
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,280
Yes. Even though I want to watch the Moorim Tournament,

17
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,380
I really think it will be even harder to leave then.

18
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,090
I see.

19
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,670
Thank you.

20
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,730
I'm not sure I was any help at all.

21
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,100
You really...

22
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,610
You're keeping an eye on Yoon Si Woo, right?

23
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,200
This brat found his way.

24
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:45,250
Although his strength is still incomplete, if he's able to properly control that strength...

25
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:53,760
Yoon Si Woo might actually be able to accomplish what nobody else has done.

26
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,350
Sunbae, are you leaving now?

27
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,750
I wanted to leave quietly but you caught me.

28
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,760
Do well, Yoon Si Woo.

29
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,650
I'm curious about something.

30
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,850
What? Like did Soon Deok really want to marry me?

31
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,750
It was from when she got drunk at her first year welcome party.

32
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:37,720
It's not that. Back then, why did you leave?

33
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,860
After being chosen as the successor, I heard you left.

34
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,610
There was someone I really wanted to protect.

35
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,290
My kid and my wife.

36
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,070
They were the most important to me and it's the same now.

37
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,990
So, I chose to run away.

38
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:06,140
You didn't run away, but you followed a new path, Sunbae.

39
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,900
This brat...

40
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,630
You can protect them.

41
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,680
Your precious persons.

42
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,620
I will.

43
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,730
My best friend is the obstacle I never overcame.

44
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:00,430
He is the misfortune I couldn't handle.

45
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:06,590
If you could return to that time again, what would you do?

46
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,860
Would you just give everything up?

47
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,320
Sunbae Tae Ho left?

48
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,740
He went back to his precious family.

49
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,630
Why are you not saying anything? Why didn't you mention that he was married?

50
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:52,430
Why didn't you tell me anything? You were practicing the Gi Chae Sul.

51
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,220
I wanted to surprise you when I succeeded,

52
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,960
but it's not easy.

53
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,370
Don't do too much.

54
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,320
I'm worried about Chi Ang.

55
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:20,690
I know. That's why you practiced the Gi Chae Sul, right?

56
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,850
I hope that nobody will get hurt.

57
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,290
Kids! You all suffered a lot!

58
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,580
Let's take a break and eat!

59
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,010
Shannon, this is for you.

60
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,080
Really?

61
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,350
Thanks!

62
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,760
Wow.

63
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,730
I'm pleased to see you all eating like this.

64
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,330
What is this I'm feeling?

65
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,410
Oh, wow.

66
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,110
Will your parents come tomorrow?

67
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,240
My mom is coming all the way from Thailand.

68
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,850
My dad probably already arrived.

69
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,510
Wang Chi Ang, your dad will be here too, right?

70
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,340
I'm not sure.

71
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,080
Soon Deok?

72
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,830
I don't really know.

73
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,790
How about Yoon Si Woo?

74
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,380
What's with you, really?

75
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,530
We brought them food to cheer them up. Are you trying to give them indigestion?

76
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,490
Sorry.

77
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,990
It's okay. Since Professor Yoo Di says that she's feeling motherly,

78
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,790
all the teachers can cheer me on.

79
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,050
This brat. Let's just eat.

80
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,640
Are you saying that your secret is so heavy that I can't handle it?

81
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,240
What kind of secret is it?

82
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,190
Responsibility?

83
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,560
The past, or...

84
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,690
The relationship between the two of us?

85
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,510
Dad!

86
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,340
I was checking to see if you were sleeping well, but you weren't in your room.

87
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,720
Seon Ah.

88
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,180
After the Tournament ends, shall we go on a date?

89
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah.

90
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,270
There's a key in the school that can open the real Cheon Ui Joo, so it's like...

91
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,350
My heart is pounding.

92
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,800
Cheon Ui Joo...

93
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,020
If it's really like a magical genie lamp...

94
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,810
So what?

95
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,010
What's your wish?

96
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,720
My wish would be to not gain weight.

97
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,810
Your wish is just that?

98
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,810
Just? I'm the type of person who gains weight just by breathing.

99
00:11:53,810 --> 00:12:00,210
It was only after I came to this school and lived a regulated life, meditated, and exercised that I became like this.

100
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,650
Right. When you were here...

101
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,670
I was a loser and an outcast.

102
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,760
You? What's your wish?

103
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,340
For me,

104
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,640
I want to become someone special.

105
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,030
Like?

106
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,860
I'm the fifth son of the family.

107
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,930
If I disappeared, they wouldn't notice.

108
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,470
I'm a totally invisible person!

109
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,390
That's true, and our Dong Goo looks very ordinary.

110
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,630
Also, he doesn't have any special talents and his grades are middling.

111
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,700
No one sees me.

112
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,430
Why do you think I went to the length of coming to this school to look special.

113
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,510
But the problem is...

114
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,170
I'm not that special here either.

115
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,700
How about you, Nadet?

116
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,290
I don't really need anything.

117
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,560
Of course, he's smart and good at sports.

118
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,740
Even if he left the school right now, places would be lining up to have him.

119
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:56,140
That the place that he refused Harvard and MIT for is Moorim School...

120
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,940
Mysterious guy.

121
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,720
Study that only uses your head is boring.

122
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,890
Here I can learn martial arts and learn a variety of things; it's a lot more fun.

123
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,570
What did he just say?

124
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,100
Dunno.

125
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,010
Hyung, did you figure out what you would wish for?

126
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,670
I'm going to wish that I don't give up on my dream.

127
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:20,010
Even though it's hard to believe that the Cheon Ui Joo actually grants wishes,

128
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,830
gaining something from using it,

129
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,660
wouldn't it feel like you're getting something fake?

130
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:38,510
♬ The countless tears which flowed past me ♬

131
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,340
♬ were like the end of unknown darkness ♬

132
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:46,560
Ahjumma. Please make sure to come with Father tomorrow.
♬ Both when I take another step ♬

133
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,140
♬ Both when I take another step ♬

134
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,030
♬ and let out a long sigh ♬

135
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:58,530
♬ Where does the road end? ♬

136
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,600
I can't give you up. 
♬ Good Bye Good Bye the words to me ♬

137
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,000
I will show you that I'm not a young boy.
♬ Good Bye You Please  ♬

138
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,020
Instead, 
♬ Don't Say Good Bye ♬

139
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,510
I'll show you what kind of person I really am.
♬ Baby it looks like I was young then.  ♬

140
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,560
I'm not just an "okay" guy. 
♬ Baby it looks like I was a coward then.  ♬

141
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,410
I'll do my best to show you that I can be very cool.
♬ I knew just a connection was there ♬

142
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,070
♬ I thought I could just reach out to you ♬

143
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,950
♬ Baby I will take care of you ♬

144
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,540
Tomorrow...

145
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,620
♬ Baby I'm not afraid of anything ♬

146
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,960
If I win the tournament, I'll see you.

147
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,780
♬ Will you hold me tight? ♬

148
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,600
Sim Soon Deok.

149
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,870
♬ Goodbye, you please don't say goodbye. Goodbye.  ♬

150
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:55,580
♬ Goodbye, you please don't say goodbye.  ♬

151
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,270
The school is opening its doors to the public for the first time.

152
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,480
And that too, with the headmaster opening the barrier himself.

153
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:21,210
The barrier has been opened.

154
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,620
At last, today is the day.

155
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,540
Are you ready?

156
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,810
- Let's do our best.
- Of course.

157
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,570
♫ Come to me, follow me, look at me, ♫

158
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,730
Moorim Tournament!
♫ what are you doing now? ♫

159
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,570
Let's...

00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,460

161

00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,460
♬  Let's intentionally play out of our minds.♬

163
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,890
♫ I'm different, different. ♫

164
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:14,350
What's going to happen to you, who says he'll break me into pieces, if I win.

165
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,080
Even if you win, 
♫ I'm fast, I'm fast. Feel me. ♫

166
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,130
I don't care if you end up getting hurt.
♫ I'm the king. ♫

167
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,500
♫ I'm the king. ♫

168
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,340
♫ I'm the king. ♫

169
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,460
♫ I want to make some noise ♫

170
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,420
♫ Say eh, eh, eh. ♫

171
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,970
♫ Don’t stop 'till I say stop ♫

172
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,920
♫ Say eh, eh, eh. ♫

173
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,650
♫ Let's get crazy today ♫

174
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,450
♫ I'm the king. ♫

175
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,110
Among the competitors who registered for this Moorim Tournament,

176
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,930
there was a familiar name.

177
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,010
Yeok Poong.

178
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,230
My brother's joining the competition?

179
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,730
Since it's an important tournament,

180
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,910
your family must have not been able to put their faith in only you.

181
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,850
Two rather than one. Big brother rather than little brother.

182
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,350
They're probably trying to see who has a better chance to win this.

183
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,890
Hello, Headmaster, I'm Nam Jae Sung.

184
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,640
Professor Beop Gong, nice to see you.

185
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,250
Headmaster, I'm...

186
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,180
Go for it.

187
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,870
Aren't you taking part in the Moorim Tournament?

188
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,740
Yes.

189
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,410
I really want to participate in the tournament.

190
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:02,560
How can a person whose determination is so great forget his application?

191
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,790
Ah, the application.

192
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,320
Even though we allowed an application by proxy,

193
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,470
you had more than 10 applications.

194
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,500
What are you...

195
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,800
Even with the betrayal they are still your comrades. Go see your friends.

196
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,460
I'll be looking forward to it.

197
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,140
Moorim Tournament Entrance Application

198
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,590
Jenny Oh

199
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,110
Wang Chi Ang

200
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,460
Hwang Seon Ah

201
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,710
Name: Choi Ho
Nationality : Korean
Age: 21
Location: Gongsu-do
School: Moorim School Yoon Shi Woo

202
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,510
Choi Ho? Choi Ho?!

203
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,690
Hey! You brat! I knew you'd come.

204
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,650
Did you prepare a lot for the tournament?

205
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,960
Isn't being back here great?

206
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,920
Even if we get put up against each other, I won't go easy on you. I won't go easy.

207
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,650
Stop fooling around. I'm not the same as before.

208
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,690
Hey...

209
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,320
They're not here...

210
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,470
I knew they wouldn't come anyway.

211
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,850
They'll be here soon.

212
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,430
You think?

213
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,070
Son!

214
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,890
Mom!

215
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,420
Have you been well, my son?

216
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,040
I missed you so much I got sick.

217
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,780
But you look healthy and pretty.

218
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,600
I dressed up.

219
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,920
It was probably hard for you to prepare for this tournament.

220
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,260
Your slim face is even slimmer now.

221
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,920
Hello.

222
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:16,780
Nice to meet you. I'm Chi Ang's friend, Yoon Si Woo.

223
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,560
A friend?

224
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,530
Yeah. He's my roommate.

225
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,500
Oh my! You're sharing your room with someone else?

226
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,470
I was worried you wouldn't have any friends.

227
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,590
You had such a decent looking friend? You could be a celebrity.

228
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,150
He's an idol. He's part of the famous group Mobius.

229
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,950
Oh, I thought he looked familiar.

230
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,050
From now on, take good care of my Chi Ang.

231
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,690
Yes, Mother.

232
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,490
What about Dad?

233
00:21:54,050 --> 00:22:00,950
The Chairman had an important meeting so he'll be coming straight here from the headquarters in China.

234
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,690
I see.

235
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,050
Headmaster Hwang Moo Song. How long has it been?

236
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,990
You've traveled far.

237
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:29,190
There were a lot of rumors about this place for 20 years.

238
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,330
I'm impressed.

239
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:37,730
You must have hidden it so well that a school as great as this is so unknown.

240
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:42,050
I just wanted for my students to be completely immersed in their studies and martial arts.

241
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:48,370
That you have such skilled students makes me look forward to today's tournament.

242
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,690
You won't be disappointed.

243
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,140
This is my lucky charm.

244
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,980
It has protected me since I was young, even in the fire.

245
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:16,940
Today you and I are rivals. Is it okay for you to be giving things like this to me?

246
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,590
I won't go easy on you though.

247
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:30,030
Before you are my rival, you are the person that I love.

248
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,790
Let's go.

249
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,220
Okay.

250
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,550
Thank you for coming here, even though you are all busy.

251
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:56,680
I thank you and give my greeting on behalf of the whole staff.

252
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,960
For this Moorim Tournament

253
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,930
we've opened our doors to outsiders for the first time since the founding of the school.

254
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,630
We want you to understand our school better.

255
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:15,560
We will do our best to make Moorim School a better school.

256
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,330
And to the competitors, do not forget the spirit of Moorim.

257
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,620
Regardless of victory, till the end,

258
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,500
I urge you all the do your best and show us an awesome tournament.

259
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:33,710
Then, the 15th Moorim Tournament will begin now.

260
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,560
I will explain the tournament rules.

261
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:55,110
This tournament will be in teams of two against two.

262
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,170
There will be 16 teams of 2 people.

263
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:03,210
Each team will either be in group A or group B.

264
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,530
Each team that wins a match will progress to the next level in the tournament,

265
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:12,330
The remaining team members will go one on one against each other and the overall winner will be determined.

266
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,980
You have a limit of ten minutes.

267
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,450
If one of you goes outside the boundaries,

268
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,190
or is unable to continue the match, the match is over.

269
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,670
Teammates will be determined by picking the same color balls regardless of seniority or affiliation

270
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,430
Two versus two? Interesting.

271
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:41,650
Even if they do well themselves, if their partner fails they are disqualified together.

272
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:47,720
So even if you end up as opponents, you have to protect your partner.

273
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,640
Hwang Moo Song, what plan does he have in mind?

274
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,520
Soon Deok and Chi Ang are on a team together. They'll be a formidable team.

275
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,870
You're in a judge's seat. Don't forget you have to be fair.

276
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,640
Let's try our best, Yoon Si Woo.

277
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,920
Let's try our best.

278
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,230
- Take care of me.
- Don't worry.

279
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,510
Get away!

280
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:18,270
This man is Yeop Jeong's older brother. He's Yeok Poong.

281
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,750
What? Why is his brother here?

282
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,400
He's in Seon Ah's team. Let's be careful.

283
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,130
Yes.

284
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,310
Winners: Wang Chi Ang and Sim Soon Deok, advancing to the next round.

285
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,710
Winners:Yeop Jeong and Baek Kang Ho, advancing to the next round.

299
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:13,230
[Advancing to Quarterfinals]
Yoon Si Woo, Jenny Oh, Choi Ho, Chi Ang, Soon Deok, Nadet, Sato Riye, Seon Ah, Yeop Jeong and Shannon!

300
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,000
A lot of our students made it to the quarterfinals.

301
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,050
They'll make it to the semi-finals as well, right?

302
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,640
You have to judge fairly.

303
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,820
There are more skilled students in Moorim than I imagined.

304
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:32,680
Indeed, some of them stand out more than the others.

305
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,640
They all seem impressed.

306
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,160
It's only the beginning of the tournament

307
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,400
Until it ends, safety is the most important thing.

308
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,760
Of course.

309
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,800
The real game is about to begin.

310
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,500
Wait a minute.

311
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,720
Are you perhaps the person who is looking into the Geo Ji party?

312
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,160
In the Geo Ji party, there are people who worked for the destructive force.

313
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,780
I never thought someone actually survived.

314
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,020
I was only a witness that day.

315
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,860
I never thought they'd kill in order to get the Cheon Ui Joo.

316
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,780
I really did not know!

317
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,880
So why were you following me?

318
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:39,300
I heard that the member of Geo Ji you were supposed to meet a few days ago died.

319
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,180
Still you came to find me?

320
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,110
I thought this would be the last chance.

321
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,300
My last chance to apologize for what happened that day.

322
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,750
So, I'm risking my life to see you.

323
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,860
Do you know who took my child?

324
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,900
Yes.

325
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,360
Could it be ...

326
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,100
that his name is something like Hwang Moo Song?

327
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,150
No.

328
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,970
I heard a rumor that the person who took the child is now blind

329
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,570
after being assaulted by the destructive force.

330
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,840
Hwang Moo Song is also looking into it.

331
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,810
It wasn't Hwang Moo Song?

332
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,310
No. The name of this blind person

333
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,600
is Sim Bong San.

334
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,540
Once you find him, you'll find your child.

335
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,130
Then ...

336
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,510
Sim Bong San ...

337
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,870
Madam!

338
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:01,030
- I did not want to come.
- Careful, careful. Ah, we're a bit late.

339
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,020
Are you so happy that your father came?

340
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,840
Yeah. Honestly,

341
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,850
I did not get his permission to come back here.

342
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:21,530
I wanted to show him how good I was, through this competition, in order to change his mind.

343
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,300
I see.

344
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,680
I understand his worries.

345
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,240
But, that's why I'm going to work harder.

346
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:38,530
This is where my dream is, and the people precious to me are here.

347
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,710
That's why I don't want to leave here.

348
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:50,170
Am I also one of the precious people here?

349
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,170
Of course. Of course.

350
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,680
The quarterfinals are starting soon.

351
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,140
Return to your seats please.

352
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,860
You know that Si Woo? He can fight.

353
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,870
- Really?
- Yeah.

354
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,060
Yes!

355
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,290
Yoon Si Woo is doing very well.

356
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,960
They seriously...

357
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,810
Yoon Si Woo is Yoon Si Woo. And you are you.

358
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,400
You're also very skilled.

359
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,980
Also, I'm your partner right now.

360
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,000
You're gonna win!

361
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,030
Let's win.

362
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,210
Ultimately, even in any martial art, you can't win without a knife.

363
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,100
Choi Ho & Ling Ling vs. Wang Chi Ang & Sim Seon Deok

364
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,880
Son, please don't get hurt.

365
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:34,530
Is that student Wang Hao's son?

366
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,670
Chairman Wang is taking his sweet time.

367
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,790
Panel of judges

368
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,450
Our Soon Deok just knocked down the opponent in one kick!

369
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,160
That's right!

370
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,630
It's close.

371
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:34,600
True. Wang Chi Ang mastered this skill so quickly, it's amazing.

372
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,360
Teacher!

373
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,990
Choi Ho has a knife.

374
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,390
Chi Ang!

375
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:59,400
This is interesting but it's rough.

376
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,810
Headmaster, Choi Ho might violate the rules.

377
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,120
Stop the match.

378
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,660
Wang Chi Ang!

379
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,850
What is this?

380
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,080
Stop this!

381
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,040
That bastard will never give up.

382
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:45,470
You're goal is not to win this tournament.

383
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,310
Then?

384
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,960
This tournament...

385
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,750
and the school that kicked you out, destroy them.

386
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,110
Please show us that this school does not have any principles.

387
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,120
To win, do I have to really stab him?

388
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,320
Choi Ho!

389
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:20,190
A traitor is still your comrade and also your friend.

390
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:26,920
Even if it doesn't make sense, ten people submitted an application for you for this competition.

391
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,870
I'll look forward to it.

392
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,090
Choi Ho... What are you doing now?

393
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:12,460
I am disqualified.

394
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,500
There are still other cards remaining, so don't worry.

395
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,420
Yes.

396
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,840
Thanks.

397
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:18,500
I have to win this in order to get the key to the Cheon Ui Joo.

398
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,240
What?

399
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,170
So let's do what we just did until the end and don't bother me.

400
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,900
He really is Yeop Jeong's brother.

401
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:35,080
I won't let a guy like you take what my dad has always protected.

402
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:59,070
Yeop Jeong is doing his very best right now.

403
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,650
Why is it so quiet?

404
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,980
He looks scary when he fights.

405
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,100
Semi Finals (Final Four Teams)

406
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,890
The matches will continue after an hour break.

407
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,820
Father.

408
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,700
You...

409
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,520
Thank you so much for coming today.

410
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,140
Soon Deok has been preparing so hard for this competition.

411
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:38,810
That's all for you.

412
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,340
Father, please watch over her.

413
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,430
- How much Soon Deok...
- Before,

414
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,440
you said you were Yoon Si Woo, right?

415
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,530
Do you have any memories of your childhood?

416
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:02,030
About the fire... or where you were abandoned.

417
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:07,690
Unusual things... Things like...

418
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:11,980
I just know that I was abandoned on a mountain.

419
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:19,770
I heard I was buried under leaves and crying and was discovered by a passerby.

420
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,500
Father! Are you okay?

421
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,320
With this shoulder, the next competition will be too much. It's alright to give up.

422
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,590
That's right. Si Woo and Jenny are also pretty skilled.

423
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,920
I can continue.

424
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,800
Wang Chi Ang.

425
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,640
Don't go easy just because I'm injured.

426
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,530
Winner is, regardless, a winner.

427
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,440
Let's finish it today.

428
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,400
You've come, Chairman?

429
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,370
You've worked hard.

430
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,030
Nice to meet you. I'm Wang Hao.

431
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,810
I feel it.

432
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,010
I've heard a lot about you, Chairman Wang Hao.

433
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:58,630
You helped the school so much, I apologize for not meeting you sooner.

434
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,630
Thank you for inviting us here.

435
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:07,760
I'm not a sponsor today, but a parent.

436
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,690
Don't be too burdened.

437
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:13,920
Yes. Please come in.

438
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,400
You can execute the next plan, right?

439
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,960
I won't disappoint you.

440
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,360
Must succeed, no matter what.

441
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,670
Those people... From that time...

442
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:38,540
She doesn't have what we are looking for.

443
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,550
What's wrong?

444
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:53,090
Why are those two people with your father?

445
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,940
My father?

446
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,280
Why those people?

447
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,990
That man and woman are the ones who kidnapped me during the trip.

448
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,280
I remember clearly.

449
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:14,860
Have you mistaken what you saw?

450
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,920
I said I'm certain!

451
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,370
Aren't they your father's people?

452
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,160
What's going on here?

453
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,680
Wang Chi Ang.

454
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:53,290
Isn't that strange? This accident happened in that building.

455
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,680
It already went bankrupt.

456
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,550
Does my dad know about it?

457
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:01,250
I haven't told him.

458
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:06,460
I did not want him to be any more disappointed in you.

459
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,900
You know something, don't you?

460
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,640
Wang Chi Ang.

461
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,990
Hey, aren't you going to answer me properly?!

462
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,160
Let's finish the competition and talk.

463
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:07,600
I don't know what all of this is about. Why would Chi Ang's dad...

464
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:10,730
Chi Ang knows something.

465
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,350
Chi Ang came to rescue me then.

466
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:19,680
He was even injured.

467
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:26,900
I want to believe in Chi Ang.

468
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:30,950
Alright.

469
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:59,220
Just what are you thinking, Father?

470
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:15,210
The final four of team A are starting.

471
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,830
♬ Yeah I am alive,  ♬

472
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,390
♬  Look straight at me,  ♬

473
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:31,040
♬ For dozens of times I will get up once again ♬

474
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,230
♬  Yeah I am alive, ♬

475
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,140
♬  Watch me ♬

476
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:39,220
♬  Now close both eyes and feel me ♬

477
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,870
Wang Chi Ang.
♬  In the deep pitch-black darkness♬

478
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:44,440
What exactly are you thinking?
♬  Like a child who has lost his way♬

479
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,810
Don't be thinking of unnecessary things. Just focus on the tournament.

480
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,900
Are you really thinking about going all the way?

481
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,320
♬  Buried deep in my heart♬

482
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,020
♬  In the memory of a shout directed at me♬

483
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,690
♬  Faint consciousness ♬

484
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,360
♬  Barely holds onto me ♬

485
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,600
♬  Your voice lingers in my ears♬

486
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,420
♬  It's become the only light which shines under cover on me♬

487
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:16,420
♬  Surviving again (My spark) ♬

488
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,570
♬  Yeah I am alive♬

489
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:19,550
♬  Look straight at me♬

490
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:22,120
♬  I will get up once again for dozens of times.♬

491
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,290
The young master was knocked over.

492
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,340
♬  Watch over me♬

493
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:31,970
♬  Now close both eyes and feel me ♬

494
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,470
♬  In front of everyone ♬

495
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,980
Wang Chi Ang's weakness has been exposed.

496
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,150
This is a chance for Yoon Si Woo.

497
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:42,580
It's definitely a chance.

498
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:47,000
♬  In the thickening spreading fog♬

499
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,600
♬  Like a child who has lost its way♬

500
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,260
♬  Even if there is a tortured scream♬

501
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,430
♬  There isn't even anyone who will hear♬

502
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:57,350
He's watching me.

503
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:00,040
My father is watching me!
♬  Buried deep in my heart♬

504
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,470
♬  In the memory of a shout directed at me♬

505
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:06,600
♬  Faint consciousness♬

506
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,950
♬  Barely holds onto me♬

507
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:12,420
♬  Even if the dark shadows pierce me♬

508
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,760
♬  While you shine on me everything disappears♬

509
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,740
A way where you can win without hurting anyone?
♬  Again surviving (My spark)♬

510
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,620
There's no such thing Yoon Si Woo

511
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,690
♬  Yeah I'm alive. ♬

512
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:25,050
♬ Look closely at me. ♬

513
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:27,990
Getting stronger, winning.
♬  For dozens of times I will get up once again♬

514
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,290
♬  Yeah I'm alive. ♬

515
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,390
Gathering my strength,

516
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:35,840
I'm going to protect the person who's important to me.

517
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,970
That's my way!
♬  In front of everyone♬

518
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:43,190
♬  I'll show more of myself♬

519
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,030
♬  I'm living breathing♬

520
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:48,400
♬  I'm newly born♬

521
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,420
♬  Yeah I am alive ♬

522
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:16,210
♬  Yeah I am alive ♬

523
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,100
♬  Yeah I am alive ♬

524
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,070
Gi Chae Sul.

525
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:13,570
Chi Ang.

526
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,970
Wang Chi Ang, let's go to the infirmary first.

527
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,850
I know how you feel. I know, but...

528
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,810
But you should get treated first—

529
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:51,870
You know how I feel?

530
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,030
Do you?

531
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,130
Chi Ang.

532
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,440
I was waiting for today.

533
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:04,790
I was going to beat that kid in front of my father.

534
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:06,490
And to you—

535
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:17,400
But I lost, completely.

536
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:24,000
There's no way you would understand how I'm feeling.

537
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:30,390
You had an injury. You were at a disadvantage from the start.

538
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,650
And because he knew that Si Woo didn't fully attack you.

539
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:36,510
That's what makes me even angrier.

540
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:40,850
That punk has never fully fought with me before.

541
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:44,730
It's not just today.

542
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:50,400
The one who was always struggling to win was me.

543
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,710
I didn't want to show you my incompetence.

544
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,310
I'm sorry.

545
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:07,010
Chi...

546
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:25,190
Go to Chi Ang.

547
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:34,090
The next match is about to start. What are you talking about?

548
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:37,210
You go see him.

549
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:42,850
You need to go see him more than I.

550
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:46,610
I'm telling you to go to him and comfort him.

551
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:49,350
He got hurt!

552
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:51,850
Because of you.

553
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,270
Because of me.

554
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:57,350
Because he wanted to win, he gritted his teeth and fought and got hurt!

555
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:59,610
And you're not even going to see him?

556
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:02,190
Are you really going to be like this?

557
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:40,410
Father.

558
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,570
Your mom is worried about you.

559
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:46,370
Go back to the great hall.

560
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:51,570
That man and woman are the ones who kidnapped me during the trip.

561
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,970
I remember clearly.

562
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:00,690
You knew, right?

563
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:03,790
What in the world,

564
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:06,750
did you tell Secretary Jang to do?

565
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:13,030
When she was kidnapped, Seon Deok saw Secretary Jang.

566
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,670
What are you hiding from me?

567
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:20,690
Did that situation

568
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:24,350
really have something to do with you?

569
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:31,250
Father,

570
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:34,750
why did you send me to this school?

571
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:43,210
If you're not upset because you couldn't meet my expectations,

572
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:46,710
but because of that situation, cool it.

573
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:50,870
What exactly are you plotting?

574
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:00,190
Soon Deok's kidnapping,

575
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:03,630
don't tell me that you don't know anything about it.

576
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,390
That's right.

577
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:09,430
I knew.

578
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:15,360
Then...

579
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,670
Did you really

580
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:20,990
have Soon Deok kidnapped?

581
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:23,990
It wasn't a kidnapping.

582
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:26,150
What was that if it wasn't kidnapping?

583
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,070
It wasn't meant to be Sim Soon Deok.

584
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:31,210
I had something to tell that kid.

585
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:33,110
That kid?

586
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:36,990
Headmaster Hwang Moo Song's daughter.

587
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:41,130
Was her name Hwang Seon Ah?

588
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:04,990
That kid is Hwang Moo Song's kid?

589
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:18,610
You wanted to meet with Seon Ah?

590
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:22,250
I don't understand at all. If you had sometime to discuss with Seon Ah,

591
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,830
rather than kidnapping her,

592
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,490
there was a pleasant way to do that.

593
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,150
That's right.

594
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:32,990
Couldn't you have just come to the school to meet her?

595
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:36,450
The barrier that Headmaster Hwang Moo Song erected around the school,

596
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:41,450
did you naively believe that he put that up to protect you?

597
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:45,330
Under the pretext of protecting his students,

598
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:49,290
did you not think that he might be protecting his own weakness?

599
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:50,950
His weakness?

600
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:55,290
Raising a wall against the world,

601
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:59,530
Hwang Moo Song has been hiding a secret for 18 years.

602
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,710
He hid the ugly truth

603
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:05,070
and made a barrier between this school and the outside world.

604
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:08,290
He's not letting anyone find out the truth.

605
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:12,930
I had no option but to go find her myself.

606
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:38,250
This competition will make your family proud of you.

607
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:41,290
It's going to be a good opportunity for you.

608
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:03,880
Eighteen years ago the people who were protecting the Cheon Ui Joo

609
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,770
were killed.

610
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:11,650
The one who planned this whole thing,

611
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:16,350
in order to obtain the key to the Cheon Ui Joo,

612
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:18,870
set fire to the house.

613
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:23,210
He took the four-year-old girl who had the key to the Cheon Ui Joo

614
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:25,750
and disappeared.

615
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:46,330
It's so scary!

616
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,970
Yeop Jeong!

617
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:10,130
What are you doing, Yeop Jeong?

618
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:13,430
I think we should stop the match, he could...

619
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:38,930
This man couldn't hide it any longer.

620
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:41,650
He went deep into the Moorim Mountain,

621
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,990
and created a barrier.

622
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:47,110
He hid the girl and the key.

623
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:50,890
Is that now ...

624
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:52,490
Right.

625
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:55,210
That person is...

626
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:59,430
Your school's headmaster, Hwang Moo Song.

627
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:08,990
Was what I said wrong, Headmaster Hwang Moo Song?
