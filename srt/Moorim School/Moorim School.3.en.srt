1
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,750
What do you say? It's a chance for you to prove your skills.

2
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,610
Let's see if you have what it takes to join our school.

3
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't be like this, Yeop Jeong. You know fighting means explusion.

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,920
True, Moorim School's rules prohibit any fight outside of sparring.

5
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,600
That is, sparring can take place any time, since it's not a fight.

6
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,300
Let's decide here. Is it something like, the winner stays and the loser leaves?

7
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:13,770
Why make it so complicated? Wang Chi Ang stays and Yoon Si Woo leaves.

8
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,180
Basically the same thing.

9
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,100
Great. I'll be happy if the two of you leave.

10
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,530
But today, I'm satisfied enough if one of you leaves.

11
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,380
Don't. He's provoking you.

12
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,950
What? Not feeling confident, China Boy?

13
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,950
Don't run away scared, Runaway Idol.

14
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,190
Wang Chi Ang!

15
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,580
Sorry, Ariel. I can't listen to you this time.

16
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,040
- This is crazy.
- We have to stop them.

17
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,310
I think it's too late to stop them.

18
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,570
It's not Wang Chi Ang and Yoon Si Woo fighting, it's a fight of manly pride.

19
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,750
♬  Yeah I'm Alive  ♬

20
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,900
♬  Look straight at me  ♬

21
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,130
♬ I'll get up dozens of times once again  ♬

22
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,860
♬  Yeah I'm Alive. watch over me  ♬

23
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,800
♬  Watch over me  ♬

24
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,450
- Oh, wow.
♬  Now close both eyes and feel me  ♬

25
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,370
♬  In front of everyone,  ♬

26
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,300
♬  I'll show more of myself♬

27
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:56,160
♬  I'm alive and breathing. I am newly born.  ♬

28
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,170
Huh? I think I exaggerated with this.

29
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,790
Oh, I'm doing quite well.

30
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,980
Is this a still screen?

31
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,680
Are you having a staring contest?

32
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,400
What is this? You were talking so aggressively.

33
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,490
- I was going to attack!
- You're right.

34
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,060
- Here I go.
- Come on.

35
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,750
He scratched his face.

36
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,130
What are you doing? Stop this very instant!

37
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,270
Moorim School
- Episode 3 -

38
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,030
Do you know what you did wrong?

39
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,570
We were just trying to spar.

40
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,350
Yes. We weren't fighting for real. You are being too sensitive.

41
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,920
This is Moorim after all, and we'll come to face this kind of thing eventually anyway...

42
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,770
If you would just think of it as a bit of pushing each other and almost fighting, then...

43
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,330
Do you think our school only teaches martial arts?

44
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,890
If not, then what does it teach?

45
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,750
With martial arts, if you gain basic discipline and a sense of virtue in the simplest training, it all comes naturally.

46
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,740
Oh, discipline...

47
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:30,910
You might have noticed it in the timetable, but the beginner class is only once a week.

48
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,090
Do you know why?

49
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:41,530
One who fights without wisdom and tenacity is not a martial artist, but a thug.

50
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,790
We at Moorim aim to create true human beings.

51
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:54,990
Stacking up virtues instead of credentials may not be a way to adjust to this world,

52
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,910
but it's a way to learn how to stand against its worst aspects.

53
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:07,420
So that's why we have to do stuff like laundry or cooking until we reach a higher level?

54
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,020
It's not like it's like getting water for 3 years, building the fire for 3 years, cooking for 3 years (referring to what scholars did in the past).

55
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,580
This isn't a place that teaches violence to entitled people like you.

56
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,240
It's okay even if you were forced to come here, or if you came because you have no where to go.

57
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,100
But if you don't want to learn, then you may leave.

58
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,580
I can't have you disturbing the other students' studies.

59
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,420
So what should we do?

60
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:41,310
Well, after I've watched you for a day, joining the advanced class might be quite difficult.

61
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,330
Then I'm a beginner? Look again! I know Hapkido, Judo...

62
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,330
I know a bit of martial arts from my action courses. I don't agree with being placed in the beginners' class.

63
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:58,110
I can't agree with that either. You're even worse than beginners.

64
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,590
What?

65
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,700
Total beginners have to clean the bathroom.

66
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,270
It becomes like this after only one day.

67
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,520
Are you telling me to clean the bathroom?

68
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,100
Not only here. You have to clean all the bathrooms in school. The ones at the dorms too.

69
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,440
Just like the others, you aren't exempt from cooking and cleaning your rooms.

70
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,290
After that, you'll clean the bathrooms. Got it?

71
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,870
Get cleaning already.

72
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,360
I don't think either of them has cleaned a bathroom before.

73
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,460
And total beginners' class? Their pride must be so wounded.

74
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,750
I guess.

75
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,770
Dad!

76
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,600
I'll get him and take him to the hospital, so have a rest today.

77
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,050
You don't have any part-time work today either.

78
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,690
Thank you then. Dad, call me when you're back home, okay?

79
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,010
Oh, yes, yes.

80
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,550
This color is so pretty. I'd like this one.

81
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,140
I heard that there was something women put on their eyes too.

82
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,860
You're buying that too? Just a second.

83
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,500
Then what about this?

84
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,590
I'll get it.

85
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,880
What's gotten into you? Buying me makeup and stuff.

86
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,980
Not for you, obviously. For Soon Deok.

87
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:58,900
What? Why? Why aren't you buying for me too? Why?

88
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,790
Finally, I can get some rest!

89
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:41,430
Even I can see that. Queen of Part-Time Jobs, Filial Daughter Soon Deok.

90
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,470
Why on earth would Yoon Si Woo have come here?

91
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,660
When he's such a great idol.

92
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,590
What would someone like him want to learn here?

93
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,780
I think that scandal will just pass with time anyway.

94
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,940
He's got it all already. What a greedy guy.

95
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,950
What's there to enjoy? What do you mean greedy?

96
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,090
Who? Our Oppa Si Woo?

97
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,490
You startled me.

98
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,580
Maybe he has some reasons or pain that no one knows of.

99
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,690
Why are you getting angry? You're scary...

100
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,170
Ah it's hot.

101
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,700
Why ask me to pick if you weren't going to buy me anything?

102
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,910
I can't see. If I could, I would've picked them myself.

103
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,320
You're such a picky man.

104
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,060
I eat with you, talk with you, and scratch your back.

105
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,110
Why do you never think of me at all?

106
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,160
Okay then. There were some samples or something. You take them.

107
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,010
Oh my! Do you think I'm some beggar?

108
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,760
You haven't asked me to go out with you in so long,

109
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,810
so I thought it was a date and got all excited.

110
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,950
Why are you so embarrassing? Let's go ahead. We're late for the hospital.

111
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,330
Okay then, I'll give up.

112
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,510
Give the lipstick to Soon Deok, but I still want the eyeshadow.

113
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,370
I'll buy yours later.

114
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,930
Don't you feel bad that a girl as pretty as a flower, like Soon Deok, doesn't have makeup?

115
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,660
Have you seen whether she's a flower or a rock?!

116
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,290
Anyway, until one you give me one of the two,

117
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,750
I'm not moving a single step.

118
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,550
Then, live here!

119
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:28,470
Oh my, oh my. A blind widower raising his daughter

120
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,790
was so pitiful that I took care of him until I became this old but he treats me worse than a beggar.

121
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,490
This is why they say you shouldn't be a mistress!

122
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,280
A mistress? How long ago did I make you my wife that you're saying a mistress?

123
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,860
These are my feelings. My feelings!

124
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,360
From now on, don't try to look for me!

125
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,110
I told you that I would buy it for you later!

126
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:53,490
Bang Deok! Bang Deok? Bang Deok?!

127
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,420
Will those brats really clean the bathrooms?

128
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,640
The last time I saw them, they were working their butts off.

129
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,710
How is it?

130
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,490
Well... It's alright.

131
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,630
Okay! Perfect!

132
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,020
Is there anything in the world Wang Chi Ang cannot do?

133
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,400
Yoon Si Woo! I think we're done here. Let's go upstairs.

134
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,900
Ah, that bastard is just ignoring me.

135
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,880
You can't hear my words?

136
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,720
What?

137
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,560
Hey!

138
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,410
What is it? What's wrong?

139
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,290
Are you hurt somewhere?

140
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,010
It's nothing.

141
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,750
Does your ear hurt?

142
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,870
I'm fine. You finish up.

143
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,930
Are you really okay?

144
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,430
I said I'm fine!

145
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,020
What's with him?

146
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,030
Yoon Si Woo.

147
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,580
Hey, Yoon Si Woo!

148
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,010
What?

149
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,830
Are you okay?

150
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,220
About what? Not being able to do music ever again?

151
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,630
Or being put in the beginner's class?

152
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,010
About your hand. Did that happen earlier during the cooking class?

153
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,190
It will become a scar if you leave it like this.

154
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,810
Is a scar the most important thing right now?

155
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,160
Let's go... to Seoul.

156
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,400
What?

157
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,560
The clarification interview... I'll do it.

158
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,960
The clarification interview?

159
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,740
The rumor of you running away started because of me.

160
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,380
If I do the clarification interview, you'll be able to clear your name.

161
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:18,160
Honestly, I am to blame also for what happened to you.

162
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,720
And since it seems like you're the type that can never apologize, I'll concede.

163
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,080
What are you scheming now?

164
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,280
Just take things as they are. Have you only been lied to your whole life?

165
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,710
My job is being a Moorim student, but

166
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,880
I can't just let someone's life be ruined.

167
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,030
Let's go. I said let's go.

168
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,060
See you on the bridge tonight.

169
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,940
Yoon Si Woo, this jerk. Once more, he ran away. He left.

170
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,560
Did Chi Ang's things arrive all right?

171
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,840
Yes.

172
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,330
Since I don't know a thing about that Moorim School,

173
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:29,910
I wonder if it's a place suited for my son, if the food's good,

174
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,210
if the bathrooms or washing rooms are alright...

175
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,450
My son is a bit sensitive, you know.

176
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,210
As a mom, I seem to care a lot.

177
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,620
My husband...

178
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,640
I can't understand why the chairman would insist on such a strange...

179
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,560
Everything has a purpose.

180
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,040
Yes, of course.

181
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,460
But is the chairman really busy these days?

182
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:06,170
Of course he is, of course he's busy.

183
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,380
I wonder if the total beginners are doing well.

184
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:18,920
Of course not. Do you think the Idol Prince and the rich kid can handle all that menial work?

185
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,600
Especially Wang Chi Ang. The heir of such a big company...

186
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,590
What heir? I heard that China Boy is the son of a big sponsor,

187
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,650
but he's just an illegitimate child who can't even be acknowledged.

188
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,540
Really?

189
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:36,340
If you only search the Shanghai Group online, it all comes up. He was born separately in Korea.

190
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,450
So he was kicked out into Korea?

191
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,390
That's why he came here? He seems so pathetic all of a sudden.

192
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,850
- Excuse me...
- Yes?

193
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,630
- By chance, can I take the bus to Hanbi Hospital from here?

194
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,330
- Yes, that's right.
- Thank you.

195
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,130
That damned woman, Bang Deok.

196
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,470
Can you tell me when that bus comes?

197
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,390
Miss? Where is she?

198
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,450
Wait! Wait!

199
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,410
Ah... My phone. My phone! My phone!

200
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:51,230
Honestly, even if you didn't mean to, isn't it partly your fault

201
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,130
that Oppa Si Woo turned out like this?

202
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,110
To go to Seoul, do the clarification interview.

203
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:07,330
If I come back here during the night, I probably won't be able to attend tomorrow's classes.

204
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,860
Cleaning was so much easier than I thought.

205
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,810
Let's quickly finish cleaning, and let's go see Ariel.

206
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,080
Yoon Si Woo... Instead of cleaning, where did this jerk go?

207
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,500
He is really the kind of jerk to run away.

208
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:49,270
Hey! Have you seen my Ariel?

209
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,350
Ariel?

210
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,810
My mermaid princess. Soon Deok.

211
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,170
Ah... Ariel is Soon Deok?

212
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,560
Soon Deok went out.

213
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,600
- Where?
- To Seoul.

214
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,590
My Ariel went to Seoul?

215
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:28,150
♬  When I look back to when I was young  ♬

216
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:35,440
♬  The diary of the past only has a child with a lot of worries ♬

217
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,620
♬  The hard times (in the past) ♬

218
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,410
Did he already leave?
♬ Everyone here left me by myself. ♬

219
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,030
Yoon Si Woo, he's really a funny bastard.
♬ There's no one to go to. ♬

220
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,620
What kind of responsibility does our Ariel have

221
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,220
that she has to go all the way to Seoul to do an interview for him?

222
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,930
Wait.

223
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,070
Did he ditch because he didn't want to clean the bathroom

224
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,420
since he's going to leave anyway?

225
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,160
♬  I Gotta Run Run Run Run ♬

226
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,230
♬  I Gotta Run Run Run Run ♬

227
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,660
Since that rude jerk is gone, it's nice.
♬ I'll laugh loudly When the day comes which I dreamt of seeing ♬

228
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,020
It's comfortable.
♬ Run, run, run, yeah, yeah, yeah ♬

229
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:23,350
♬ Run, run, I've got to run ♬

230
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,140
Dad, what happened?

231
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,230
Oh, Soon Deok, you're here! Soon Deok!

232
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,340
Yeah, Dad.

233
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,750
Are you his guardian?

234
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,810
Yes. But, why is my dad here?

235
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,220
He fell somewhere, so I think he was really shocked.

236
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,860
I found him wandering around, so I brought him here.

237
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,350
I lost my cellphone.

238
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,250
You probably didn't finish what you had to do. I'm sorry.

239
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,930
Still, I didn't lose this.

240
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,140
What is this?

241
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,500
Nothing much. I bought it for you.

242
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,610
You have to study and work every day.

243
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,750
You also have to take care of your father, I know.

244
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:18,220
You should try dressing up. You're at a time to be pretty.

245
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:27,430
I protected it with my life from that wretched wife of mine.

246
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,100
Is the color pretty?

247
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,070
Yeah, it's pretty. Really pretty.

248
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,850
Then, try it on. Try it, try it.

249
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,110
I'm already trying it on.

250
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,490
Oh, police officer,

251
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,380
my daughter is pretty, isn't she? Right?

252
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,370
Thanks, Dad.

253
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,690
No need. Don't cry.

254
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,540
Cry? Who's crying? I like it so much.

255
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,390
It's so pretty that my tears are gone.

256
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,810
Entertainment Reporter Han Young Kwang

257
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,120
Why isn't she coming?

258
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,260
I'm seriously going crazy.

259
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,580
Did he come back from the hospital safely?

260
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,890
Aish, I don't know, I don't know!

261
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,630
I don't care whether he comes or whether he goes.

262
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,340
Ahjumma!

263
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,290
What brings you here at this hour?

264
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,280
Because I thought you were hungry.

265
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,970
For dinner, I ate until my stomach burst, so I just ate some digestives.

266
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,690
Even so, you still probably have some space for my potato rice cakes.

267
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:42,490
Why are you like this? Why? Did your father order you to? To bring it to me?

268
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,660
Of course!

269
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,740
My dad just doesn't say anything, but he loves you so much.

270
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,890
He's not going to make you sad anymore.

271
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,290
If he was going to do this so quickly, why did he do it?

272
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,590
You're a girl too, so you must know

273
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,280
how sad I was.

274
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,640
Of course I know!

275
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,160
So, where is he?

276
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,750
Did he go to the hospital?

277
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,530
Yes.

278
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,330
I'll go meet him.

279
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,290
Sit here.

280
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,620
No, why did she suddenly drag someone

281
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,980
who didn't want to come all the way here at night?

282
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,400
Because I didn't have makeup,

283
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,850
I didn't put makeup on and so my face is said to be very dull.

284
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,900
What's so important about that makeup that you're making such a fuss?!

285
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,690
Omo, omo. Look at this.

286
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,570
You don't even know the problem here!

287
00:26:54,570 --> 00:27:00,670
The makeup isn't the problem, your feelings hidden behind the makeup is the problem.

288
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,860
Even if you don't apply makeup, you look pretty.

289
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,140
You can't even see. How do you know if I'm pretty or if I'm ugly.

290
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,900
Do I have to see it to know? You just, like this...

291
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,030
Like this...

292
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,410
You just have to touch it to know.

293
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:25,100
Omo, omo. This person is crazy, crazy.

294
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,720
Soon Deok is here.

295
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,320
You two, please carry on with your conversation.

296
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,250
No, that's not it. Soon Deok, that...

297
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,690
That's what it is.

298
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,800
Are you crazy? This old man, seriously...

299
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,030
Oh! This is hard!

300
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,890
Ah, whatever!

301
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:53,230
Aiyoo, really. Oh, look at the time.

302
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,820
Oh, right! Yoon Si Woo!

303
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,160
Hey, sorry! Ah, I'm really sorry! I had something to take care of.

304
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,950
You sure did come really fast.

305
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,290
I'm sorry.

306
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,080
The last bus to Seoul would have already left, right?

307
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,880
My car is at the bottom of the mountain. Follow me quickly.

308
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,890
Then, that's a relief. Ah, wait!

309
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,720
I'm sorry, but can we go after resting for just five minutes?

310
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,370
I went up and down the mountain a couple of times.

311
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,610
My legs... Just five minutes.

312
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:39,020
If we have to go down there again, I'm going to have to regain my energy.

313
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:47,080
Um, in the midst of being sorry, can I be sorry again for something else?

314
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,730
What? What else?

315
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:54,100
Please get me some water.

316
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,940
It's because my legs hurt.

317
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,080
Mom

318
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:18,110
What would I say after I call her?

319
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,070
If I tell her I was put in the beginner's class and am cleaning bathrooms,

320
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,130
mom will sure like it.

321
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,510
Let's endure it a bit longer, Mom.

322
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,890
Hey, I brought water.

323
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:07,100
Yes, It's $4 for two potato rice cakes.

324
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,480
What potato rice cake?

325
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,420
Hey!

326
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:18,860
Thank you. Please eat this chicken when it's hot... when it's hot.

327
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,620
Then why don't you sell only one thing?

328
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,020
You're even working a part-time job in your sleep?

329
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,160
Hey, open the door.

330
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,600
Oppa Si Woo?

331
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,780
Soon Deok! What's wrong with her? Is she hurt?

332
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,500
Don't make such a fuss, she's just sleeping.

333
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,430
She's sleeping?

334
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,890
When she wakes up, tell her to come to me immediately and that we're leaving even if it's at dawn.

335
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,560
Okay, I got it.

336
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,200
Let's go after my chicken delivery part-time job ends today.

337
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,470
Oh, I have work on weekends too...

338
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,880
Let's go right now.

339
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,920
- Do you only think your life is important?
- How much did you receive?

340
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,580
- What?
- How much did you sell your conscience for?

341
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,280
I will do the clarification interview.

342
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,780
What are you scheming?

343
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:44,150
Honestly, I am to blame also for what happened to you. I concede.

344
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,640
- You didn't leave?
- I haven't left yet, so get over there.

345
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:26,330
Ariel said she'd do the interview. Why aren't you in Seoul?

346
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,880
What fault does my Ariel have?

347
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,760
Why do you keep pestering her?

348
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,360
He's ignoring me again.

349
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,590
Are you just pretending not to hear or are you really deaf?

350
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,290
Say, is there something wrong with your ears?

351
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,080
Didn't you hear me?

352
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,240
My ears are fine so shut up and go to sleep!

353
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,410
You, seriously.

354
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,070
Do you think I'm easy because I talk to you now?

355
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:06,580
Hey, Runaway Idol, you think I'm a pushover?

356
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,000
Fine, I'm the runaway Idol.

357
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,060
- Then, what about you?
- What about me?

358
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,670
- I'm...
- Some Chinese big shot, isn't it?

359
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,830
Or only half of that.

360
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,000
- What?
- You're an illegitimate child.

361
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,070
Then your mother's a mistress.

362
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:41,460
Hey, I think someone's fighting.

363
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,210
Yoon Si Woo, Wang Chi Ang, stop it!

364
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,710
- Oh my God!
- Hey, stop them.

365
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,800
Just leave them.

366
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,830
Hey, hey, Soon Deok, get up! You shouldn't be sleeping now.

367
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,950
- Hurry, get up! There's big trouble!
- Hurry, hurry!

368
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,930
- Ah, my shoes.
- Hurry!

369
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,710
- What now?
- They're done for.

370
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,840
Game over.

371
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,580
What are they doing?

372
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,580
These rascals, seriously.

373
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,040
Stop it right now!

374
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:59,060
I'm sorry, but I just can't get along with this guy.

375
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,460
- Please change our rooms.
- I also ask this.

376
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,300
I was going to do that anyway.

377
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,400
You guys are expelled.

378
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,350
Leave this place immediately.

379
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:23,480
Headmaster, I can't get expelled.

380
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:35,810
I won't let something like this happen again in the future.

381
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:04,380
Dad, please let Oppa Si Woo off this once.

382
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:09,440
It's your one and only daughter's wish, okay. Just for once!

383
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,790
Do you want to get expelled as well?

384
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,210
It's because of me.

385
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:30,430
If I had kept my promise and gone to Seoul, this wouldn't have happened.

386
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,050
What do we do now?

387
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:58,150
Wow, I thought that they would run away by themselves but they got expelled.

388
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,480
I haven't seen the headmaster like this in the five years I've been here.

389
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,320
They were annoying, but it was cool seeing a celebrity like this. Now it's all over.

390
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,680
But why aren't they leaving?

391
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,930
I can't leave like this.

392
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,120
You, insufferable prick, tricked me into this.

393
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,560
- What?
- You were going to leave anyway.

394
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,460
After that misunderstanding was solved, you'd leave anyway.

395
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,320
Do you want to fight again?

396
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,910
Go. Running away is a habit for you anyway.

397
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,770
There's no way I'm going like this.

398
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:00,430
Kicking me out after just one fight is unfair.

399
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,190
Instead, give me some other punishment.

400
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,590
I'm different from this jerk.

401
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:12,810
- He might be here just here to have fun, but...
- Give me another chance, please.

402
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,730
Hey, don't butt in.

403
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,360
I'm not joking either.

404
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:25,660
I'm not messing around either.

405
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,790
I'd rather die here than get expelled.

406
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:35,480
I'm not going out of here on my own feet.

407
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:45,480
Please give me another chance. There may come a time I'll have to leave, but I can't go out like this.

408
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:55,340
Your pride won't allow you to get kicked out, is that it?

409
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:10,190
See that mountain? We call it Moorim Peak.

410
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,600
Up there, there's a sign from Moorim School.

411
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:22,840
I'll give another chance to the one who brings it back here.

412
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,460
Pardon?

413
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,070
What? Isn't that place really dangerous?

414
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,760
Has anyone been there before?

415
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,440
He's only sending the two of them to that dangerous place?

416
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:39,460
There's only one sign, and just the one person

417
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,680
who brings it will get to stay.

418
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,730
Got it?

419
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,670
I will do it.

420
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,950
Of course I will do it.

421
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:03,060
Alright. You'll be leaving for Moorim Peak now.

422
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:07,480
Now? Then, can I go change my clothes and shoes?

423
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,560
You're going exactly as you are.

424
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,210
Like this?

425
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:19,620
The one who fails shouldn't even think of setting foot in this school again.

426
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:24,330
No matter how much I think about this, I have to go and change my clothes.

427
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:28,650
If only one of us is to stay, I'm at a disadvantage.

428
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,020
What's this?

429
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:52,790
Isn't sending them to that place the same as telling them to die?

430
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:57,870
I guess they have no choice, if they don't want to get expelled.

431
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:05,330
Giving such a mission to none other than total beginners is a bit over the line.

432
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:09,760
From the start, they weren't people who were qualified to become students in our school anyway.

433
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,150
Yeop Jeong, I want to have a word with you.

434
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:29,750
I was going to let it slide, but the incident in the cooking class... You were behind it, right?

435
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:36,300
Yeah. I just want to get rid of kids that are not qualified to be in this school. So what?

436
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,840
How could a Moorim student do such a thing?

437
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,880
I think you must be confused. I'm not here because I like the school rules.

438
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:49,210
Etiquette? Morals? Training? You must be kidding me.

439
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,740
What's more important is making a life.

440
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:57,480
I just want to be the top in this school, go to the Moorim competition, be successful and go back to my own home.

441
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,600
So you don't care about them if they interfere with your studies?

442
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:08,920
That's right. Maybe Choi Ho, Sangman, Jenny, Shannon, those losers just want to get by peacefully,

443
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,480
but I'm not like that.

444
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,920
Cut it out, Yeop Jeong.

445
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,340
I'm not here to kill time like those losers.

446
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,390
Stop it already!

447
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,430
What? Am I wrong?

448
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,000
Hey. Get some rest and go.

449
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:07,510
Whatever happens, I'm going to stay here. So how about you go away?

450
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,950
Honestly, I don't get why you came here only to suffer like this.

451
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:16,880
If you got kicked out of Mobius, you can just make a solo comeback after a couple of years.

452
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,710
Or your name will be forgotten with the next celebrity scandal.

453
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:28,340
But I'm not like you. I just have to stay at this school.

454
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:36,360
So won't you just switch shoes with me and stay in the back?

455
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,040
I'll help you out later if you want.

456
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,620
Shut up and let's go.

457
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:51,940
So you won't give up till you die, isn't it? Okay then. Let's see who stays.

458
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:06,810
Does the headmaster think such a task is possible for kids who've just been admitted?

459
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,820
Isn't sending them there so suddenly dangerous?

460
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:14,270
The place isn't what is dangerous, the kids are just too weak.

461
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:20,780
The so called sign on Moorim Peak is actually a flag I left there.

462
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,170
What? You, Professor Kim?

463
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:28,030
Why do you say you put it there when the first class of Moorim School did it?

464
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:34,570
Even with unclear roads and not enough resources, I used to make a round trip there each morning.

465
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,120
Was the guy who got scared of a squirrel another Kim Dae Ho?

466
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,060
Oh really? And who was the one holding me because of that squirrel?

467
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,480
Are you fighting again in this situation?

468
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,020
I must have lost my mind because of how suddenly it came.

469
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,990
Why would a woman pour on perfume to go up a mountain?

470
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,710
Ah, so that's when you guys first started sprouting with love.

471
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,570
Well...

472
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:01,820
When did you come?

473
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,810
Just now. Another glass here, please!

474
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:11,940
Those newborn-like kids were sent to Moorim Peak... Well you aren't a true Moorim person if you never think of alcohol!

475
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,790
Eat up, everyone.

476
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:22,580
What are you thinking? If something goes wrong,

477
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,000
you and the entire school could be in danger.

478
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,840
- If the Moorim Convention finds out...
- Do you remember how the barrier was removed the day the two came?

479
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:38,530
Do you want to find out which of them did it?

480
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:42,280
No. That doesn't matter.

481
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,430
Then what?

482
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:48,550
Do you think this fight is something they caused?

483
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,110
If not, then?

484
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,760
They're kids who haven't even been here for two days.

485
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,280
That's what I'm saying.

486
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,620
It's an impossible task for those two alone.

487
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:07,570
So you're trying to drive them away through a very hard lesson.

488
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:13,410
How could I? Even after two days, or two hours, they are still Moorim students.

489
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:18,640
Then, don't say...

490
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:29,610
That... is being said because there are people who don't know.

491
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,950
You scared me!

492
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,080
In other people's eyes, do we seem pitiful?

493
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:21,630
How could others understand?

494
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:26,610
I wonder if they're doing well.

495
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,740
You're all right, aren't you, Son?

496
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,170
Are you okay?

497
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:05,700
You're worried? Wanna change shoes?

498
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,670
What's this? There's no path.

499
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:28,920
Where are they sending us if there's no path to there?

500
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:35,050
This won't do. Let's go down and take the other path.

501
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:39,590
You go. I'll take this way.

502
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:40,760
Are you crazy?

503
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,400
It's pathetic not to go somewhere just because there's no path.

504
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,840
If there's no path, I can make one.

505
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,140
- Don't do this!
- Are you concerned?

506
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,580
What are you talking about...

507
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:00,700
Don't worry. This guy is going to live a long life.

508
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:19,270
Seen that? I'm off first!

509
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:24,020
Hey, watch out!

510
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,880
Wang Chi Ang!

511
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:46,850
Hey, Wang Chi Ang! Say something, Wang Chi Ang!

512
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,980
Aren't you going to help?

513
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:55,620
Grab my hand.

514
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,700
Grab on!

515
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,430
Aren't you going to do it properly?

516
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:12,020
What the heck, you punk?

517
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:16,780
Did you plan to kill me so you could take the Moorim symbol by yourself and return?

518
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,980
What?

519
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,070
What's wrong?

520
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,780
Hey, Yoon Si Woo.

521
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,810
Don't you hear me?

522
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,220
Yoon Si Woo!

523
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,810
I said don't you hear me?

524
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,200
Didn't I tell you not to do it?

525
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,490
You scared me.

526
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,560
Let's go.

527
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,150
Are you really okay?

528
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:13,120
Here you go, the dining table is here, the dining table.

529
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:18,430
Here you go. Please eat.

530
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:20,730
Here.

531
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:25,010
On the right is grilled eel, in the center is scallion pancake,

532
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:28,130
and on the left are seasoned oysters.
 (The foods are believed to be aphrodisiacs. )

533
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,660
Be sure to eat a lot.

534
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,180
Why is there so much food for breakfast?

535
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,800
You already know why.

536
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,810
Know? Know what?

537
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:42,630
Tonight, Soon Deok

538
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:47,090
sent a message that she won't be able to come because of work.

539
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:51,140
Just give me a cup of water so I can eat my rice with that and sleep early.

540
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,880
What water?

541
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,750
Here, very delicious seasoned oyster.

542
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:01,760
Here, say ah. Open your mouth.

543
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,930
Ah, ah, ah.

544
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,240
You're no match against me. Just end it here and—

545
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,010
Are you still not awake from the alcohol yesterday?

546
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,700
This is ultimately a mental battle.

547
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:42,290
As expected, I can't measure the charms of a woman like you.

548
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:47,070
It's been a while since I was bored...

549
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:50,270
I wonder if the kids who went to the Moorim Peak are doing well.

550
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:53,510
Well, we'll have to hope that they'll do well.

551
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:59,110
They're kids who haven't been trained at all so I'm truly worried.

552
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,660
Can he really not hear?

553
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,670
Hey, Yoon Si Woo.

554
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,530
Hey, Yoon Si Woo.

555
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,900
Why do you keep calling me?

556
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,390
It's nothing. Go.

557
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,000
Hey, Yoon Si Woo.

558
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,980
It's nothing. Go.

559
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:45,100
Seriously?!

560
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:53,650
- Are you okay?
- How could I be okay?

561
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,400
I'm walking on a path like this with only my socks.

562
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,080
It'd be nice if someone would change their shoes with me.

563
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:16,900
HEY!

564
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:26,220
VVIP,

565
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,640
Gold, and Platinum. All of these are useless.

566
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,050
These are the ones that are the most useless.

567
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,720
- Let's go!
- Will you be okay?

568
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,310
Shoes started from leather anyway.

569
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,080
Ah, I should have done this earlier.

570
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,330
This is much more comfortable.

571
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,200
Aigoo, this feels nice.

572
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:09,260
Hey, you found them!

573
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,140
We found them here.

574
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:14,720
Let's not lose them this time, my bot.

575
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,790
Their faces became haggard and gaunt within a day.

576
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:20,700
- Right.
- They must be hungry.

577
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,780
I think they would be thirsty too.

578
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:29,270
I'm thirsty.

579
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,150
Ah, I think I can finally live now.

580
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,420
Hey! Hey, hey! Snake, snake, snake!

581
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:01,800
♫ Look at me. Look at me.
What are you doing right now? Now I'm controlling you.♫

582
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,050
♫ Everybody now♫

583
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,640
♫Let's go ahead and play, to get crazy.♫

584
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,880
They're running, they're running, they're running. Follow them, you can't lose them.

585
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,080
Who do you want me to follow? Yoon Si Woo? Wang Chi Ang?

586
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,660
Ah, just follow anyone!

587
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:22,990
What is this?

588
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:26,980
Did you send a drone?

589
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,840
Wang Chi Ang! Hey, Wang Chi Ang!

590
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:46,320
- Where's Wang Chi Ang?
- I think they got separated.

591
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,770
Is it a real competition from now on?

592
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:01,900
Yoon Si Woo! You can't hear me again?!

593
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:07,240
Ah, where did this jerk go?

594
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:29,540
It's not like we're running away from debt collectors or anything.

595
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:32,580
Moving suddenly? You're really too much.

596
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:36,320
We need to go somewhere where nobody will find us.

597
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,320
This is the only way.

598
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,890
I've cast a barrier around the house, so it shouldn't be dangerous.

599
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:45,430
Then does no one really knows about this place?

600
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:49,920
This is where I came to rest after my training on the mountain.

601
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,470
The area is very rough and steep, so nobody knows about it.

602
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:55,320
Wait!

603
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,810
W-What is that?

604
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:02,670
What...is that? There was something like that in the forest?

605
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,290
- No.
- Yoon Si Woo!

606
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:14,980
They'll be okay, right?

607
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:17,480
I have to go.

608
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,440
- Where are you going? What about class?
- Is class the problem right now?

609
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,870
For anyone going, come in front of the annex.
