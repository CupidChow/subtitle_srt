1
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,504
What is it? What's going to happen now?

2
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,633
Seo-jin, quiet.

3
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,596
That's it.

4
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,726
-Hey!
-What?

5
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,811
Hey, come and watch this.

6
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,939
I don't think the girl will come.
Kim Jong-min was baited.

7
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,734
He was totally baited.

8
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,823
Why'd you turn it off?

9
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,743
I told you to watch Seo-jin,
but you're watching TV again?

10
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,828
Who cares about a celebrity's blind date?

11
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,039
I shudder
when I hear the words "blind date."

12
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,791
Because of you.

13
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,542
If I studied more instead,

14
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,170
I'd be a judge or a doctor
and have a great life.

15
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,923
Do you think it's a good memory for me?

16
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,341
A judge or a doctor? As if.

17
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,343
Not all good students become those.

18
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,387
The good students are the ones
who become judges and doctors.

19
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,976
Well, right. Whatever.

20
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,980
Anyway, if you hadn't hit on me that day,
I wouldn't be living like this.

21
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,109
You hit on me first,
doing this with your eyes.

22
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:54,280
You kept winking at me.
I thought you had a broken eye.

23
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,032
You're remembering it all wrong.

24
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,909
You gave me the eye first

25
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:01,204
and looked like
you'd kill me if I didn't choose you.

26
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,163
Like this.

27
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,211
You did that first.

28
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,755
You even acted cute like this.

29
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,259
Don't you remember?
I chose you because I was scared.

30
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,844
You hit on me first.

31
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,763
You kept winking at me like this.

32
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,682
No, I seriously didn't. This is insane.

33
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,226
You hit on me first.
Let's call everyone and ask.

34
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,495
You're in Professor Hwang's class, right?

35
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,331
These are notes from last year.
It was hard to get.

36
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,416
You can use it.

37
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,251
It was hard to get, so you use it.

38
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,212
Nam-gil, this is new. You should try it.

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,256
It's new, so you drink it.

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,261
COLLEGE OF SOCIAL SCIENCES BULLETIN BOARD

41
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,476
Look who that is.
He still looks so tall and handsome.

42
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,478
He grew to be a good man.

43
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,775
Why did I turn down a guy like him
to date a petty loser like that?

44
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,072
Hello.

45
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,826
Nam-gil.

46
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,081
Are you here for a lecture?

47
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,820
"Are you here for a lecture?"

48
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,822
Would he be there to shoot pool?

49
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:02,784
Are you insane?

50
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,371
Or do you suddenly
feel lonely overnight and want a guy?

51
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,457
Why? I was just happy to see him.

52
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,709
I see, you were happy to see him.

53
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,255
After you humiliated him
like that yesterday?

54
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,214
What?

55
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,010
-It's Nam-gil. He's so hot.
-My gosh. Oh my gosh.

56
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,014
Hey.

57
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,100
Go out with me.

58
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,269
-No way.
-He asked her out.

59
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,186
No thanks.

60
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,313
Why not?

61
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,485
You smell like sweat.

62
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,784
How can she turn him down?
What's with her?

63
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,954
-I feel so bad for him.
-Who does she think she is?

64
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,998
I can't believe it.

65
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,874
Seriously.

66
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,671
That's ridiculous. When did I do that?

67
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,548
You did that yesterday.

68
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,551
My gosh. You didn't like him yesterday
because he smelled,

69
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,720
but you were happy to see him today?

70
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,016
You're so scary.

71
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,728
My goodness. I can't believe this.

72
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,647
That's why he looked at me
with such sad eyes.

73
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,693
Goodness, what's wrong with me?
Why did I say that?

74
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,487
How would I know?

75
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,866
Yes, I'm sure he was sweaty
because he was training,

76
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,117
you germophobe.

77
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,619
Right.

78
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:34,208
I must've been insane.
I was completely insane.

79
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,379
Are you sick?

80
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,759
HANGUK UNIVERSITY CIVIL ENGINEERING

81
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,721
It's not that kids nowadays are scary.

82
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,723
Kids have always been scary.

83
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,600
Upperclassmen are upperclassmen!

84
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,479
I know our department kids are dumbheads,

85
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,439
but I won't allow a rebellion.

86
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,857
Mind your manners.

87
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,610
Your seniors will deal with other seniors!

88
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,615
Look at these punks.
At least they play fair.

89
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,117
Gosh, this is tiring.

90
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,952
How long do we have to do this?

91
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,662
I'm about to die.

92
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,001
How long do we have to do this?

93
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,336
Don't be a baby.

94
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,964
Maintain your positions
until a girl comes into this room.

95
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,133
A girl in Engineering?

96
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,095
He's telling us to stay like this forever.

97
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,306
Damn it.

98
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,246
A girl.

99
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,258
Hey, it's a girl.

100
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,346
Come in. Please come in.

101
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,474
Come in. Please.

102
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,790
I'm sorry I'm late!

103
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,759
That jackass.

104
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,514
Dok-jae, right. Your hair.

105
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,186
Get down on the ground, all of you!

106
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,740
I mean, have you no conscience?

107
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,658
A young man like him

108
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,161
would naturally smell like sweat
after training.

109
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,413
How could you reject him so meanly?

110
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,749
Seriously, Jin-ju. You idiot.

111
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,767
-Hi, Jin-ju.
-Hi.

112
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,105
-Hi.
-What was her name?

113
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,650
-She was a student rep.
-Hey, who's the student rep?

114
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,735
-Erase the blackboard.
-Okay.

115
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,323
No, she was the student rep.

116
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,336
Hey!

117
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,422
Seol!

118
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,593
Seol, right?

119
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,846
What's with you?
She's not your long-lost sister.

120
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,891
The professor is here. Sit.

121
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,768
Goodness.

122
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,652
Right, the three of us
always stuck together around this time.

123
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,030
But she suddenly took a leave,
then cut us off.

124
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,495
Did I do something to upset her?

125
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,332
I'm not sure.

126
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,210
What did she do this morning?

127
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,795
Everyone's talking about it.

128
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,844
Everyone is so quick.

129
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,017
Why did she take a leave
without telling us?

130
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,606
PRINCE HEUNGSEON VS. EMPRESS MYEONGSEONG
WHOSE POLICY WAS BEST?

131
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,150
Now, are you all ready
for your group presentation?

132
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,818
-Yes.
-Yes.

133
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,405
I can't believe it.
I'm back taking lectures in school.

134
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:18,826
Prince Heungseon
was Empress Myeongseong's father-in-law.

135
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:22,913
They continuously fought for authority
and power over different policies.

136
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,500
Even Empress Myeongseong
couldn't avoid her in-laws.

137
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,835
How awful.

138
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,338
This led to the fall
of the Joseon Dynasty.

139
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,174
Let's see what argument you came up with.

140
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,509
The modernization
of the country was belated

141
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,679
due to his isolationist policy
on refusing to trade.

142
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,264
We're with Empress Myeongseong.

143
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,433
You're with the daughter-in-law.

144
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,604
Yes, you'll go through this later in life.

145
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,356
Good, next group.

146
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,109
Next presenter.

147
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,240
-What are you doing?
-What?

148
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,701
-Go.
-Go where?

149
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,371
Next presenter?

150
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,082
You're our presenter.

151
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,541
-Go.
-Me?

152
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,378
-Just go.
-Wait, it's me? Wait, what?

153
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,213
Just go. Go.

154
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,892
Group Three, Ma Jin-ju?

155
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,729
What do I do?

156
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,742
Well, I…

157
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,080
I forgot what arguments we came up with.

158
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,336
Did Group Three meet up ten years ago?

159
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,879
How did you forget already?

160
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,470
Then just tell us your take on it.

161
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,515
Is it the prince or the empress?

162
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,769
Well, I think

163
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,605
Emperor Gojong was wrong.

164
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,778
Emperor Gojong? Why?

165
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,574
I mean, his wife was fighting his father.

166
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,451
He should've stepped in.

167
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,120
He needed to step in
and moved out or something.

168
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,374
But this was the palace.
During the Joseon Dynasty.

169
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,835
Yes, right. Anyway.

170
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,130
When families get in such disputes,
the husbands are always at fault.

171
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,840
They don't intervene wisely.

172
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,593
No daughter-in-law
can defeat her father-in-law.

173
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:44,263
But it's not like she can give in
and do everything he wants.

174
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,183
It's not like
we daughters-in-law are slaves.

175
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,810
"We"?

176
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,983
So are you saying
Emperor Gojong caused the fall?

177
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,487
I believe he played a part.

178
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,160
That's a fresh take on this.

179
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,830
Good. Who was in her group?

180
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,053
UNABLE TO GET A GRASP OF THE SUBJECT

181
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,638
What happened?

182
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,099
How was I supposed to remember
something I did ages ago?

183
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,143
We discussed it yesterday.

184
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,604
Fine, let's say you forgot
what we discussed.

185
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,898
But what now? Emperor Gojong?

186
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,609
I mean, she asked for my opinion.

187
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:42,363
And you have no idea
how awful fathers-in-law can be.

188
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,866
He's so particular. He won't eat kimchi
made with sand lance extract.

189
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,576
I was reminded again.

190
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,578
-Of whom?
-Just someone.

191
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,206
A father-in-law
who's more like a mother-in-law.

192
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,042
May I?

193
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,752
Open up.

194
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,551
Sand lance extract?

195
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,428
I only eat anchovy extract!

196
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,305
Redo it! I won't eat this! Redo it!

197
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,015
I won't eat this!

198
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,645
He's like a mother-in-law.

199
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,938
She's so mean.

200
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,483
I mean, she asked for my opinion first.

201
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,734
I can't believe it.

202
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,571
I can't believe you.

203
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,155
Is this your new thing today?

204
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,618
FILM CLUB

205
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,589
I haven't seen an actual film in so long.

206
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,924
My gosh.

207
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,510
TOP SECURITY

208
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,137
Le Grand Bleu.

209
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,473
Hey, Flashman too?

210
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,479
Man, Brad Pitt.

211
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,358
Yes, I remember.

212
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,902
Dok-jae, your Brad Pitt hair.

213
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,196
You young rascals.

214
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,617
I can't believe I get to see you
so young again. Come here.

215
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,411
Gosh, you're so cute. So cute.

216
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,704
Stop talking nonsense.

217
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,874
Gosh, you're so cute.

218
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,752
Man, you're so cute too.

219
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,507
Gosh, it has been forever.

220
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,552
I'll kill him.

221
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,512
Hey.

222
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,682
Even so, he's an upperclassman.

223
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,060
No, I meant that jerk.

224
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,480
Are you hammered already?

225
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,857
Why did you laugh back there?

226
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,485
Do you see my hand shaking?

227
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,237
I almost lost my arm because of you.

228
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,074
Are you bored?
Does life seem trivial and insignificant?

229
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,910
So? Do you want your life to be dramatic?

230
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:57,206
Goodness, kid.
My life is already very dramatic.

231
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,167
What's that jackass saying?
Are you still drunk?

232
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,089
Fine. Let me explain this to you.

233
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,382
Listen up, babies.

234
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,717
I have no idea what's going on either.

235
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,095
But there's more than meets the eye.

236
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,305
You'll probably see me as Ban-do.

237
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,767
But I'm not the same Ban-do
you knew before.

238
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,852
If you're not Jin-ju, then who are you?

239
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,689
I'm saying I'm not 20 years old right now.

240
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,065
I came back to the past.

241
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,693
How can I remember
what happened 18 years ago?

242
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,278
So you're 38 years old?

243
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,824
No way. With a face like that?

244
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,623
I still look the same.

245
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,376
I woke up this morning and I was 20 again.

246
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,627
Back in 1999.

247
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:47,006
Right. So basically you time traveled.

248
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,175
Sort of like that movie
Back to the Future?

249
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,511
You're right.
Back to the Future. That's it.

250
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,763
As always, Jae-u. You're a smart one.

251
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,976
So what am I like in the future?

252
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,687
-You?
-Wait.

253
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,565
My hand won't stop shaking.
Can you massage it?

254
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,482
Your hand?

255
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,092
Geez.

256
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,387
Hey, how much
do I have to work out to look like you?

257
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,892
Take it easy.

258
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,852
You shouldn't get hurt at our age.

259
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,813
You two are
what we shouldn't look like at our age.

260
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,273
Hey, watch it.

261
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,485
Work out a little, will you?
My batting isn't so bad, is it?

262
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,197
But my coach keeps saying
my batting isn't as good as before.

263
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,282
I feel good about this season.

264
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,202
We have to make it
to the Korean Series this year.

265
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:05,000
CHEERLEADER FAIRY

266
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,713
You become healthy. Very healthy.

267
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,799
What about him?

268
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,343
-Will he still look like this?
-Come on.

269
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,012
Hey, watch it. He'll lose his hair.

270
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,847
Cut your hair. I hate it.

271
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,973
I'll beat you.

272
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,517
Hey, you can't say that.

273
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,436
No, Dok-jae.
Do whatever you want with your hair.

274
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,396
Perm it, dye it, bleach it, do whatever.

275
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,190
But don't shave it off.

276
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,567
-You can do that later.
-What are you talking about?

277
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,195
What about me?

278
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,198
Do I have a girlfriend?

279
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,995
A girlfriend? Right.

280
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,503
-Doing okay?
-Yes.

281
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,296
Don't worry. I'll do everything.

282
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,054
Honey?

283
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,283
You don't just have a girlfriend.
You have a wife too.

284
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,244
A director of a dance academy
and a women's rights activist?

285
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,204
Me?

286
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,206
YUN BO-REUM AEROBICS

287
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,708
Get his face.

288
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,711
Your husband is before you.

289
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,754
Get his face. Slap him!

290
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,883
And now, his stomach. Get his stomach.

291
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,718
Kill him. End his life!

292
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,761
Kick his head! Good!

293
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,139
Your husband is still there. Kick higher.

294
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,390
Keep it up.

295
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:47,102
If you hit somewhere wrong,
it'll be your loss. Keep it up.

296
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,105
I wouldn't say an activist,

297
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,107
but something like it.

298
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,195
I see. It sounds very believable.

299
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:01,074
Well, I have no idea what's going on,
and I'm dumbfounded by this.

300
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,243
Until last night, that cheap jerk…

301
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,540
Well, never mind.

302
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,751
Think of how absurd this is for me too.

303
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,003
I can't get into the details

304
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,632
with young boys like you
even before my deep wound is healed.

305
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,634
Anyway, if I seem odd,

306
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,929
just remember I came
from the future, and try to understand.

307
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,765
-I see, you're also hurt.
-I see, you're also hurt.

308
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,771
We had no idea.

309
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,065
It's fine, man.

310
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,692
Moron.

311
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,614
She's crazy. She's completely insane.

312
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,157
Is this a rerun of April Fools'?

313
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,826
She went crazy from all that studying.

314
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,995
He took his lies to another level.

315
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,288
Where's your time machine?

316
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,123
Is it parked at home?

317
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,252
Let's go see your time machine.

318
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,297
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

319
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,133
Smart girls are very meticulous.

320
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,302
How does she add
so many details to her lie?

321
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,390
It's not like
this is believable to me either.

322
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,185
Wait for me! I don't know my way around.

323
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,187
Who would believe me?

324
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,109
Man, those little rascals. Wait up!

325
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,696
Hey, I don't know my way around!

326
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,572
-Hey--
-Excuse me.

327
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,721
I've been looking at you.

328
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,264
You're so pretty.

329
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,398
Me? Really?

330
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,858
Yes.

331
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,447
If it's all right with you,
may I have your number?

332
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,700
Goodness, what's going on?

333
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,577
He said I'm pretty.

334
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,413
Well, I…

335
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:15,751
I don't think
I have a beeper or a cell phone.

336
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,628
I see. You don't.

337
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,589
Then may I have your home number?

338
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,300
My home number? What was it?

339
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,760
How could I remember that?

340
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,553
I can't remember my number.

341
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,014
I'm not making it up.

342
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,224
I really don't know it.

343
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,186
Then can you tell me
your major and where you live?

344
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,447
Oh my gosh. Wait…

345
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,741
Look, a beeper… I have a beeper.

346
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,201
Goodness.

347
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,247
Isn't he that English major?

348
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,500
What? Did you reject another one?

349
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,419
Give him your number.
It's not like it'll cost you anything.

350
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,171
It's not like you have to date him.

351
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:04,091
The pretty girls always play hard to get.

352
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,101
He really keeps saying I'm pretty.

353
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,685
Whenever I pass by,

354
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,814
he goes, "You look pretty as always."

355
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,608
He must be trying to sell you something.

356
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,069
Who's pretty? You? Are you high?

357
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,196
That's not true.

358
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,241
He says it only to me
even when I'm with other women.

359
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,577
You must look the most gullible.

360
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,998
That's not true.
It's because I'm actually pretty.

361
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,420
He was always somewhere around here.

362
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,854
You look pretty as always.

363
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,233
Goodness, thank you.

364
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,945
If it's all right with you,
may we talk a little?

365
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,749
CREATIVE THINKING WITH A FUN STORYBOOK

366
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,209
This is a children's workbook.

367
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,753
This is completely sold out in Gangnam.

368
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,381
On top of being pretty, you look like
someone who values education,

369
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,884
so I'll give it to you for half price.

370
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,344
Man, this is practically free.

371
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,639
Goodness, ma'am.
You have such beautiful skin.

372
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,933
Your skin is so dewy.

373
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,144
It shines so brightly that it's blinding.

374
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,562
You're so perfect.

375
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,314
It's completely sold out in Gangnam.

376
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:46,026
On top of being pretty, you look like
someone who values education,

377
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,736
so it's half price for you.

378
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,948
Goodness, ma'am.
You have such beautiful skin.

379
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,658
You have skin
as smooth as a baby's bottom.

380
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,913
Goodness, I didn't know
there were so many pretty ladies here.

381
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,331
I thought it was just you.

382
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,752
Anyway, that handsome young man is
also good at sales.

383
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,920
He'll make it big.

384
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,506
Let's go home, Pretty Lady One.

385
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,266
-Hey, girls.
-What?

386
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,936
Aren't I really pretty?

387
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,027
Let's go.

388
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,196
You need a good beating.

389
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,657
-Hey, wait.
-You deserve a good beating.

390
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,705
Jae-u.

391
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,415
Ban-do.

392
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,293
Drink this and wake up.

393
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,673
COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING

394
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,258
What's that?

395
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,385
"Nostradamus"?

396
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,971
THE LAST PROPHECY BY NOSTRADAMUS

397
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,307
Man, right. The doomsday prophecy.

398
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,935
Now that I think about it,
who would believe this?

399
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,144
Did you decide yet?

400
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,021
What? Decide what?

401
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,607
What will you do
during that very last moment

402
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,692
on July 24th?

403
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,569
Seriously.

404
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,280
Hey, don't believe a word of this.
It's all bull.

405
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,281
It is not.

406
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,700
Hey, the planets are lining up right now.

407
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,410
A big disaster will strike.

408
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,453
The planets may crash, killing us all.

409
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,122
Some say a war will break out.

410
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,249
Don't get me started. The weather anomaly?

411
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,460
Some force is behind this
to keep the population in control.

412
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,629
We're going to die. Complete annihilation.

413
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,339
Quiet. I'm reading.

414
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,219
Hey, can you two stay here?

415
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,972
Where are you going?

416
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,198
-Move.
-Ma'am.

417
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,366
It hurts.

418
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,911
Have you gone crazy?
How dare you touch her?

419
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:07,042
That one punch
made her forget about this affair.

420
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,376
She looked really dense,

421
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,378
so it was easy to get her to marry me.

422
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,298
But that woman
is getting sharper with age.

423
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,594
-Ye-rim.
-Hey.

424
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,678
What should we eat?

425
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:22,390
You jerk. I said
I'd kill you if we met in college.

426
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,559
You're dead.

427
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,897
The Med Students' Night
comes only once a year.

428
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,857
-You must be sad.
-I know.

429
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,151
I'm a little sad, but what can I do?

430
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,235
I have to study.

431
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,364
My gosh.

432
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,782
Goodness!

433
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,159
My gosh, I'm so sorry.

434
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,869
My mind was elsewhere.

435
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,372
Watch where you're going!

436
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,748
I'm all right.

437
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,959
I'm fine. It happens.

438
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,795
Man, I'm so sorry.

439
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,631
Here, you can have this.

440
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,924
Okay, thanks.

441
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:58,968
I'm sorry, okay?

442
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,264
Why did you let him go?

443
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,392
You're way too nice.

444
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,561
What's the point?
He didn't do it on purpose.

445
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,324
I told you that I'd kill you, jerk.

446
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,583
It would've gotten him square in the face
if not for his glasses.

447
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,335
What a bummer.

448
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,550
RAMYEON: 800 WON

449
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,552
RICE MEAL: 1,500 WON

450
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,637
No way. 1,500 won?

451
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,598
The rice meal is 1,500 won?

452
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,518
That's unbelievably cheap.

453
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,520
It's a bag of chips.

454
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,605
Hey.

455
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,527
EXPLAIN THE PRICE INCREASE!

456
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,612
FOOD PRICE INCREASE!

457
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,907
WE DEMAND AN EXPLANATION
FROM THE CHAIRMAN!

458
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,789
What kind of gold-dipped chips
do you eat that cost that much?

459
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,474
It's good. This is good.

460
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,353
Why aren't you eating?

461
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,023
Let's eat.

462
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,745
I'm full.

463
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,164
You are? I'll eat this then.

464
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,624
Me too.

465
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,046
It tastes bad.

466
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,139
How's the galbi-tang?

467
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,517
Let me have a taste.

468
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,360
The broth is good because it's boiled
in a large pot for a long time.

469
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,737
It's nothing like this
when I make it at home.

470
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,907
Did you starve for a few days?
You never share food with others.

471
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,742
And why are you eating so quickly?

472
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,912
-You'll understand once you have a kid.
-What?

473
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,375
A kid?

474
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,044
What? Nothing.

475
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,256
No, it's nothing. Eat up.

476
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,050
The spicy pork is great with rice. Eat up.

477
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,054
My stomach is about to burst.

478
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,639
I ate so well.

479
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,767
You always ate a little
so your belly wouldn't stick out.

480
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,936
I have to enjoy being able to eat a lot.

481
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,855
Do you know how sad it is when you eat

482
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,482
just to survive
because you're too busy raising a kid?

483
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,900
What?

484
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,739
All right. It's about time Jin-ju changed.

485
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,367
-I'm very glad.
-Yes.

486
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,495
-Yes.
-Good.

487
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,670
What are we doing after lunch?

488
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,673
Why do you ask? As if you don't know.

489
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,091
Why? What are we doing?

490
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,847
Date date date, group blind date

491
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,683
A group blind date? Like a real one?

492
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:34,851
What's with him?

493
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,604
Yes.

494
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,651
Why am I running into him again?

495
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,653
Let's not get involved with him.

496
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,909
Come on, Jin-ju.

497
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,703
Let's not run into each other, please.

498
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,223
Why is she here?

499
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,226
What's this? Wait, is this…

500
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,645
The day we met?

501
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,480
The day I first met this jerk?

502
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,569
Let's see how many of you
become a couple today.

503
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,954
Hey, are they raising those seagulls
on their eyebrows?

504
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,667
And did they get punched in the mouth
as a group or something?

505
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,213
Hey, did you plant that grenade?

506
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,925
Did you see their hair?

507
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,635
Are they traffic lights?

508
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,470
Red, green, yellow.

509
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,138
Forget them. Look at him.

510
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,891
-Oh my gosh.
-Seriously.

511
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:57,809
What's with him?

512
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:03,481
Yes, this is the group blind date
where I first met Jin-ju.

513
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,192
Why did that have to be today?

514
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,070
No, this is better.

515
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,781
This is my chance
to never get involved with her. Forever.

516
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,451
What a nightmare.

517
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:20,415
I cursed this moment and this day
every moment of my life, kid.

518
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,874
Let's not get involved.

519
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,209
Let's not get involved.

520
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,461
-Don't get involved.
-Don't get involved.

521
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,429
You can take it first.

522
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,139
Thanks.

523
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,975
-Darn it.
-Come on.

524
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,477
-Don't get involved.
-Don't get involved.

525
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,604
Then let's introduce ourselves.

526
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,606
Eom Won-hui, freshman, civil engineering.

527
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,442
It's not "Oh, Money," but Eom Won-hui.

528
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,031
Freshman, civil engineering major,
self-proclaimed Kim Won-jun.

529
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,240
I'm Lee Dae-hyeong.

530
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,369
I'm Go Dok-jae.

531
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,371
And it's not Dok-jae.

532
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,291
Please call me Go Dok.

533
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,171
I'm An Jae-u.

534
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,048
I like listening to the radio,

535
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,008
and my specialty is…

536
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,427
Well, I'm wondering what I should go with.

537
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,264
-A cockroach!
-Where? Where is it?

538
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,851
-There it is!
-Where? Where is it?

539
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,771
That's my friend's specialty. His speed.

540
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,987
He's such a kidder.

541
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,616
Just don't get involved with her.

542
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,455
Right. Hi, I'm Choi Ban-do,
majoring in civil engineering.

543
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,332
I'm 20 years old.

544
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,876
I was born in Byeonsan-bando,
hence Ban-do.

545
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:52,048
I'm always grateful
my parents didn't name me Byeon-san.

546
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,679
That's all.

547
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,058
You're just byeon, a load of poop.

548
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,851
That's it for the guys.

549
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,687
Shall we move onto the girls?

550
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,900
Let's start with you, Bo-reum.

551
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,153
How did you know my name?

552
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,906
What?

553
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,579
It's written on your book. "Yun Bo-reum."

554
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,582
YUN BO-REUM

555
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,667
Right.

556
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,418
Yun Bo-reum.

557
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:33,381
Gosh, that was close.
That totally slipped out.

558
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,759
My gosh, I thought he was like me.

559
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,427
Looks like we're all freshmen.

560
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,388
I'm Yun Bo-reum. I'm a history major.

561
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,603
He can't get
into this painful relationship again.

562
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,522
Don't go there, my friend.

563
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,275
History major, Cheon Seol.

564
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,069
I'm a history major too. Ko Eun-bi.

565
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,531
Wait, I see someone in you.

566
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,741
You look a bit like Suzy.

567
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,203
-Kang Susie?
-Kang Susie?

568
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:08,291
Oh, no. The Suzy
I'm talking about isn't that Susie.

569
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,127
There's this young and cute Suzy.

570
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,296
You'll come to know her later in life.

571
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,799
No way. He couldn't be.

572
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,552
History major, Seol Hyeon.

573
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,053
What?

574
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,430
Seol Hyeon.

575
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,936
I'm Ma Jin-ju. History major.

576
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,034
-Ban-do.
-Yes?

577
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,619
Your turn on bomb disposal.

578
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,412
Make sure you take her.

579
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,748
A grenade? Don't be so immature.

580
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,708
-Just go with the flow.
-But it's…

581
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,503
-It's your turn today.
-My turn?

582
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,677
But how do I know
what the grenade will put in?

583
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,888
They don't put their names
on their belongings.

584
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,640
If I don't know, I can't do it.

585
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,725
Don't play dumb with me, man.

586
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,769
It's not your first time.

587
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,479
Do your job right.

588
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,213
Why is she keep staring at me?
She's scaring me.

589
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,132
Wait, does she want me?

590
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,885
Right, I remember.

591
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,137
She hit on me first on this day

592
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,807
and made my life a total mess.

593
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,811
Sweetie, you make me shudder.

594
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,229
He said "Suzy."

595
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,356
"Suzy."

596
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,025
Okay, who wants to pick first?

597
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,071
Okay, go ahead.

598
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,213
My life was ruined because of her.

599
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,051
I curse her.

600
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,762
I hope she burns in hell.

601
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,598
I feel so bad for myself.

602
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,892
I feel so pathetic.

603
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,854
My life was ruined because of her.

604
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,108
Yes, Jae-u. You're supposed
to choose your own destiny.

605
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,818
I'll help you.

606
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,203
What's this? What is this thing?

607
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,539
What?

608
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,584
What? You picked one.

609
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,421
A giraffe earring? Hey, Suzy.

610
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,758
-It's mine.
-What?

611
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,260
How is it yours? It's obviously Suzy's.

612
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,888
Even if you like him,
you need to stick to the rules.

613
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,432
I always wear mismatched earrings.

614
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,476
So the other one was a giraffe?

615
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,145
It's hers.

616
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,775
-What?
-I said it's hers. It's not mine.

617
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,276
These brats.

618
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,404
I hear some people
wear mismatched earrings.

619
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,240
You have no idea
how this will ruin your life.

620
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,283
Not her, okay?

621
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,534
Whatever.

622
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,797
Look at this guy.

623
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,012
There are only two left.
Ban-do, your turn.

624
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,476
Ban-do, you came back too?

625
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,895
And you completely ignored me?

626
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,981
Are you looking to live a new life?

627
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:04,568
Man, what's with her?

628
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,196
There will be turmoil if we get together.

629
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,115
I'll never get involved with her.

630
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,839
Please do your job, my comrade.

631
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,633
I'll pay you back
on our next group blind date.

632
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,149
So you won't get involved with me?

633
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,280
What?

634
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,037
You traitor!

635
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,542
Why? I threw myself on the grenade.

636
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,335
What? The grenade?

637
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,754
Hey, does she look like
the grenade to you?

638
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,049
That fat, ugly girl is the grenade!

639
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,678
You really have no idea, do you?

640
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,014
She's the real grenade.
She's like dynamite.

641
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,849
She has an awful temper.

642
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:19,602
She's a shopaholic,
a germophobe, and has anger issues.

643
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,770
She's the biggest grenade.

644
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,524
She has anger issues?

645
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,068
What the heck is that?

646
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,906
It's when they have an awful personality
and get angry out of nowhere.

647
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,951
But how do you know that?

648
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,537
How else? I lived with…

649
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,164
Lived?

650
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,042
It's a rumor that I heard.

651
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:46,128
Everyone knows except for you.

652
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,338
Come on out.

653
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,467
Really?

654
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,886
Everyone knows?

655
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,721
Except for me?

656
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,142
Something doesn't feel right.

657
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,938
Hey, but still,
I really don't like that fat, ugly girl.

658
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,105
Hey.

659
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,285
Now that we're paired up, let's split up.

660
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,870
We'll head out first.

661
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,127
Thanks.

662
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,505
Don't mention it.

663
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,882
We'll get going too.

664
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,803
Anyway, I don't see
Dok-jae and his partner.

665
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,015
"That fat, ugly girl"?

666
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,434
Hey. Are you freaking kidding me?

667
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,106
How dare you call me the grenade
with your ugly face?

668
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,781
Jae… Jae-u.

669
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,158
Jae-u.

670
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,414
-Jae-u.
-Hey, look at me.

671
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,629
I'm going to go grab a drink. Follow me.

672
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:22,016
After completely ignoring me,
what is he up to now?

673
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:26,687
I picked her to dump her for good
and never see her again.

674
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,855
But how should I do it?

675
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,899
Aren't you two leaving?

676
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:34,111
What? Well, we don't have to.

677
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:40,743
But she does look kind of pretty
now that I see her like this.

678
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,705
You should've grown old like this, woman.

679
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,831
Wait, no way.

680
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:49,043
Is this jerk trying
to work things out with me again?

681
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,419
What a psycho.

682
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,380
No, no. I went crazy for a moment.

683
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,841
I'll put an end
to this awful relationship.

684
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:00,387
Well, Ms. Ma Jin-ju?

685
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,599
Now that I get a good look at you,

686
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:06,477
you have the physiognomy
of someone who should study.

687
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,562
Ms. Ma, aren't you a good student?

688
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,023
Stay-at-home moms
have no appeal, you know.

689
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,358
What will you do at home?

690
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,443
You never get full no matter what you eat.

691
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:17,613
Then what? You pester your husband
who brings a tiny little paycheck.

692
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:18,781
Listen to this punk.

693
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:22,993
Not only did you pester me,
you completely destroyed me.

694
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,539
Anyway, so don't dream
of finding a guy and getting married,

695
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,957
but keep studying.

696
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,043
You should study hard and pursue a career.

697
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,379
Isn't that cool?
Single, successful, and rich.

698
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,090
What did you just say?

699
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,218
I know. I get it. I offended you.

700
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,427
I know that. I do.

701
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:44,223
But once you get older,
you'll understand what I just said.

702
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,727
Anyway, keep studying.
Study hard. You can do this!

703
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:50,646
Goodbye, then.

704
00:44:56,068 --> 00:45:00,114
Right, I don't want you
to take this the wrong way, so here it is.

705
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,742
I just rejected you,

706
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,120
and very cruelly at that.

707
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,839
Man, I can't believe that guy.

708
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:19,883
That little…

709
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,142
What a hero.

710
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,977
How many lives did I just save?

711
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,688
You wanted to study.
Become a judge or a doctor

712
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,648
and have yourself a great life.

713
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,610
I was nice enough to be with you.

714
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,946
Other guys would've divorced you already.

715
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,448
You have no idea.

716
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,492
What?

717
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,550
Min Seo-yeong?

718
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:07,055
Don't you remember my first love,
Min Seo-yeong, the dance major?

719
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,850
I should've hit on her,

720
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,643
but I was way too naive back then.

721
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,689
Even if you go back in time,
there's no way you could get her.

722
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,483
If I go back in time, I'd date her.

723
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,485
Why would I date someone like Jin-ju?

724
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,556
That crazy jerk.
Did he choose me to tell me that?

725
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,974
I pest…

726
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,311
pestered him to death?

727
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,857
How dare he give me that bull…

728
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,193
Where did he go?

729
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,909
Did you think you were the only one
who came back? What…

730
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,038
Excuse me.

731
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,963
You're Min Seo-yeong, right?

732
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,050
What?

733
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,221
Wait, is she…

734
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,601
Goodness, I'm sorry.

735
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,521
Hi.

736
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,983
Well, by any chance,

737
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,360
do you know me?

738
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,321
You don't?

739
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:52,828
I wouldn't say I know you,
but I wouldn't say I don't either.

740
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,456
That means you do.

741
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:58,792
What?

742
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,747
You're really something, Ban-do.

743
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,124
You already found your first love.

744
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:44,087
How did he survive
if he missed Seo-yeong so much?

745
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,304
Did you give me this miraculous day

746
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,097
just to show me this?

747
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,017
That I lived my life in vain?

748
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,396
It's great, I guess.
I already divorced him,

749
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,566
so it's a good way to move on.

750
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,745
Seo-jin.

751
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,138
Seo-jin.

752
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,896
Seo-jin.

753
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,652
Oh my gosh.

754
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,827
Seo-jin.

755
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,914
That's dangerous.

756
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,666
Come here.

757
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,426
What's wrong with me?

758
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,226
You jerk.

759
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:23,979
You jerk.

760
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,314
You jerk.

761
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,849
To 31 Seongbuk-dong, please.

762
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,112
Mom…

763
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,381
We're here.

764
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:51,960
And down.

765
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,545
Fall out.

766
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,715
Hello, Chairman Jeong.

767
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,724
You're such an embarrassment.

768
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,476
Just go.

769
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,104
It's not like we have
a good father-and-son relationship.

770
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,566
You rude punk.

771
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:17,360
I told you to join the student council,
not that useless ROTC.

772
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:22,282
Why not do everything
I tell you not to do?

773
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,576
You even ended up majoring in history.

774
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,288
Go date someone while you're at it.

775
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:31,917
That's a great idea.

776
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:44,387
-It's Nam-gil. He's so hot.
-My gosh. Oh my gosh.

777
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:47,766
Hey.

778
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:50,727
Go out with me.

779
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,774
-No way.
-He asked her out.

780
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:00,570
No thanks.

781
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,617
-She's crazy. How dare she?
-What's with her?

782
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,578
How can she turn him down?
What's with her?

783
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,247
Why not?

784
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,753
You smell like sweat.

785
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,761
What's with her? Jin-ju.

786
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,688
That fool.

787
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:47,325
What's with her?

788
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:02,048
In movies, you go back in a time machine.

789
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,800
If that's not it…

790
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,053
When I wake up?

791
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,265
Aren't you going to sleep?

792
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,104
Right, no.
I'm not going to sleep. I won't.

793
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:32,370
TO MY DEAR MOM

794
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:38,251
DIVORCE, TIME TRAVEL?
DREAM? A ONE-DAY MIRACLE

795
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,137
That's hilarious.

796
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,307
He looks exactly the same.
He's the funniest guy ever.

797
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,600
I think so too.

798
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,438
What is it? What?

799
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,901
Either watch TV or go to sleep.

800
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,904
Why are you making me so uncomfortable?

801
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,539
Did I feed her something weird?

802
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,918
What's wrong with her?

803
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,921
Is she hitting puberty now?

804
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,673
As if.

805
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,050
Don't you remember?

806
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,844
She was awful in middle school.

807
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:33,056
If she has a conscience,
she wouldn't relapse.

808
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,392
You're right.

809
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,477
Then why is she doing that?

810
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,780
It was nice to see you again, Mom.

811
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,367
Mom.

812
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,828
Mom.

813
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,674
She's scaring me.

814
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,176
Me too.

815
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,019
No.

816
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,108
I can't fall asleep.

817
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:37,495
No, wake up.

818
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,134
What's going on?

819
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:52,802
What is this?

820
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,054
Why am I still here?

821
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:07,442
I didn't go back.

822
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:19,913
THE REAL 1999

823
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:35,386
Hey.

824
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,932
Hey, are they raising seagulls
on their eyebrows?

825
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:43,770
And did they get punched in the mouth
as a group or something?

826
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:47,190
Hey, did you plant that dynamite?

827
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,068
She's about to blow up.

828
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,820
There are only two left.

829
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:53,905
Ban-do, your turn.

830
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:58,868
Hey. It's your turn to take the grenade.

831
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,495
It's your turn today--

832
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,590
Everyone, let's take a picture.

833
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:15,677
Who knows? A couple here may get married.

834
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:20,974
What are you doing?

835
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,459
Give me every single penny
that our family has.

836
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,837
He's going to get into huge trouble.

837
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,464
Did you ignore me to live a new life?

838
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,383
You're such a good actress.

839
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:58,177
So now that I'm here,
I'm going to enjoy my life.

840
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,470
May I have your number?

841
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,472
-Move aside!
-Don't flirt with me.

842
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,057
I'm sorry!

843
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,560
I can't believe
I came to a nightclub with you.

844
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:06,769
What got into you?

845
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,813
If I don't do it now, when would I?

846
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:11,983
That's the guy who fell for me.

847
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,443
Director Park?

848
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:18,239
