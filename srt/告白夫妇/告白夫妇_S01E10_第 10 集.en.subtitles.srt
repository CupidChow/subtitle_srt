YEAR 2004, NEWLYWED DAYS

2
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,006
This one has

3
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,551
very strong ingredients,
so that's out. Let's see.

4
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,013
And this one is too harsh
on her stomach, so that's out.

5
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,351
Everything else should be fine.

6
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,856
-Honey, what are you up to?
-What?

7
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,693
I left only what you need,
so take just these.

8
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,863
It'll be worse
if you develop a tolerance. Okay?

9
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,909
My honey is the only one
who looks after my health.

10
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,579
-You're better than doctors.
-Of course.

11
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,791
Doctors treat your current illness,

12
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,502
but I'm going to live with you for life.

13
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,087
Isn't that right?

14
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,507
Thank you.

15
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,259
Why are you thanking me
for something like this?

16
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,761
You're pretty cool.

17
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,012
-I am?
-Yes.

18
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,350
YEAR 2017

19
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,478
-You've been anemic lately, right?
-Yes.

20
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,730
I took out the pills that cause anemia,

21
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,773
so take these.

22
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,735
Are you listening?

23
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,195
All right.

24
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:56,116
There are things we take
for granted as they get covered up

25
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,118
by familiarity and convenience.

26
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,744
Hey, wait.

27
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,122
Take that off. The cuffs are dirty.

28
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,665
Come on in and get changed.

29
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,085
I can't be bothered. I won't die
from wearing the same shirt twice.

30
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,045
Others will see it and talk.

31
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,714
And I washed this for you.
Why did you put that on?

32
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,551
-Come on in. Come.
-But I'm…

33
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,927
I'm late for…

34
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,390
The kindness of the people I love
and the happiness I had.

35
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,433
We took them for granted

36
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,019
as if they were a given.

37
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,776
Mom, hurry up.

38
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,363
We're late, Mom.

39
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,834
FUNERAL HALL FIVE

40
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:52,172
There's one thing we realize
only after we lose all of that.

41
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,718
Nothing in life is a given, not even

42
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,095
someone's existence.

43
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:14,194
YEAR 1999, GANGNEUNG

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,458
What has gotten into you? You're up early.

45
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,542
You're up.

46
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,507
I couldn't sleep. I didn't want
to waste this precious time.

47
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,019
Do you remember this place?

48
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,106
Well, somewhat.

49
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,779
Weren't there fireflies
or something around here?

50
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:00,865
Were there?

51
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,245
You asked for me last night?

52
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,958
Well, yes. Were you out somewhere?

53
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,962
Yes, I just took a walk.

54
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,048
Is it because
it's the countryside or the past?

55
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,508
The air is so fresh.

56
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,887
Do you like it here?

57
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,391
Yes, I do.

58
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,519
That's enough, then.

59
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,062
What is?

60
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,900
You got to see them regardless.
And you like it, so that's good.

61
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,854
What are you doing?

62
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,941
Me? I was organizing the stuff in the van.

63
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,610
You're always so meticulous. Thanks.

64
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,280
You were quite hammered again last night.

65
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,282
Did you cause trouble again?

66
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,076
I never caused any trouble.

67
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,953
I shouldn't ask you.

68
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,832
Hey, check your stuff before we take off.
See if anything is ruined.

69
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,334
-Whatever.
-Gosh.

70
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,586
Man, just forget it.

71
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,799
Let's eat.

72
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,426
What are those?

73
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,678
Before we leave, call everyone and…

74
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,096
What's this? Three. What?

75
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,389
What happened here?

76
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,558
Three.

77
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,445
I feel bad for all of you too.

78
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,988
Let me free you.

79
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,823
One.

80
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,160
Two.

81
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:13,915
Seven.

82
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,668
Seol.

83
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,712
I don't know why I did this.

84
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,214
And I didn't do it on purpose.

85
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,508
What the heck is wrong with you?
Come here.

86
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,260
Come here. Hey! Get back here.

87
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,096
Get back here! Hey!

88
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,514
Hey!

89
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,227
They may end up going out.
They make a cute couple.

90
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,104
Seol can do much better.

91
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,689
Seol!

92
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,608
You're right.

93
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,325
Hey.

94
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,453
You didn't shave properly.

95
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,457
Goodness, you are so impatient.

96
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,543
It wasn't my fault.

97
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,796
We don't have six-blade razors yet.
The razors aren't very good.

98
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,508
People who are bad at stuff
always blame it on the equipment.

99
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,844
-Six-blade razor. As if.
-Hey.

100
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,730
Goodness, Jin-ju worries so much about me.

101
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,649
Jin-ju!

102
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,778
I'll make sure
to have a cleaner shave next time.

103
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,580
-See you at school, Nam-gil.
-Okay.

104
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,081
Get in already!

105
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,378
Then drive safely,
and I'll see you at school.

106
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,755
What?

107
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,133
Okay.

108
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,968
What's going on?

109
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,679
We have too much stuff,
so we don't have enough room.

110
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,098
What are you talking about?
It fit in the trunk--

111
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,600
Hey, I was talking.

112
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:59,562
Jin-ju, we have too much stuff,
so you can just go with Nam-gil.

113
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,563
Drive her safely.

114
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,065
What are you talking about, no room?

115
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,485
Jin-ju, get in. We have enough room.

116
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,488
Yes, he'll get bored driving back alone.

117
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,907
-You can keep him company.
-What?

118
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,576
He doesn't need company.
He's not some grandpa.

119
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,953
Jin-ju, just get in.

120
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:37,058
Hey, why did you bring out
the stuff I put in the trunk?

121
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:41,020
He's right. Jin-ju could've come with us.
The trunk is empty.

122
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,439
Goodness, you fools.

123
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,858
Great job, Seol.

124
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,861
You're a natural-born Cupid.

125
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,240
Jin-ju should find a good man
and be happy this time.

126
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,407
She's still young.

127
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,992
Yes, this time.

128
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,204
Was there someone before?

129
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,465
This is…

130
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,205
There are so many fireflies, aren't there?

131
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,336
Should we go back now?

132
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,632
Let's go back and drink. Let's drink.

133
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,009
All right. Let's go back and drink.

134
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,763
Drink.

135
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,065
-Thank you.
-Sorry?

136
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,067
For coming with me.

137
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,363
Goodness, don't mention it.

138
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,990
When you drive long-distance alone,

139
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,618
you'll get sleepy and tired. It's bad.

140
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,204
And I get to go comfortably too.

141
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,249
Hey.

142
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,169
Did I do it properly?

143
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,589
What? Do what properly?

144
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,926
I wonder if I shaved properly.

145
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,471
Oh, that? Let me see.

146
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,894
You look fine.

147
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,106
Do I?

148
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,193
That's good.

149
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,948
If you're tired, get some sleep.

150
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:43,119
It's bad manners to sleep
next to someone who's driving.

151
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,370
I'll make you sleepy too.

152
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,580
It's fine, really.

153
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,548
The King of Pop, Michael Jackson arrived

154
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,383
at Gimpo Airport this afternoon,

155
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,677
drawing a big crowd.

156
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,930
So that amazing man did come to Korea.

157
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:03,848
He did.

158
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,226
They say someone like him
is born at most once in a century.

159
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,147
Isn't it amazing
that we live in the same era?

160
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,773
Yes.

161
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,108
That's not amazing.

162
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,361
You're more amazing to me, Mom.

163
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,825
You've been saying
the sweetest stuff lately, Jin-ju.

164
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,049
Like this. Is it like this?

165
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,468
Like this?

166
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,136
I think I can do this.

167
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,060
Like this. It's like this.

168
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,688
Like this. And like this.

169
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,607
Is that right? Right?

170
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,860
-Like this.
-Like this.

171
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,236
-Right?
-My gosh.

172
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,279
You're good.

173
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,282
Not this.

174
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,826
Like this?

175
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,578
No, you're not riding a bicycle.

176
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,086
Back. Like this. My gosh.

177
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,339
Right? Like this?

178
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,226
Drink this first.

179
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,774
We have a blender, Mom.

180
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,819
Why did you peel it? That's so much work.

181
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,321
It's not as good when I use a blender.

182
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,241
And you two won't drink it
if I include the skin.

183
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,492
That's why I peeled it.

184
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,289
It's good.

185
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,548
It's good.

186
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,300
Eun-ju, drink this before you go.

187
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,928
No, I'm not hungry.

188
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,848
Drink it.

189
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,516
Force yourself if you have to.

190
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,476
You can't skip breakfast.

191
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,937
-I don't want to. Stop it.
-My gosh, look at her.

192
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,188
That little brat.

193
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,442
-Mom, I'm leaving too.
-Okay.

194
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,654
My gosh.

195
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,575
Hey, kid.

196
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,286
You punk.

197
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,496
We need to talk.

198
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,040
About what?

199
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,335
What was that? "Hey, kid"?

200
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,298
-Show some respect to your big sister.
-Fine, Big Sister.

201
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,972
Yes, I'm your big sister.

202
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,100
What is it?

203
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,978
Can't you be nicer to Mom?

204
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,522
I'm seriously worried about you.

205
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,357
Whatever.

206
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,448
Do you think we're guaranteed
to have Mom with us forever?

207
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,451
No.

208
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,870
Why are you talking like an old lady?

209
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,208
Who else in our lives

210
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,671
do you think will peel and grind
tomatoes by hand to make us juice?

211
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,965
And make us breakfast?

212
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,261
There's no one else other than Mom.

213
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,680
Do you think your husband will?

214
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,681
Or your kid?

215
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,186
Hey, are you scared that she might die?

216
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,398
There is nothing that can't happen

217
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,859
to you and me.

218
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,282
Don't regret it later.

219
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,710
Eun-ju.

220
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,213
Eun-ju, what are we going to do?

221
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,090
Mom…

222
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,302
Eun-ju.

223
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,319
What's with you today?

224
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,917
Time slip.

225
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,752
Earthquake?

226
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,802
Hello? No, not earthquake records,
but predictions.

227
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,929
When will there be an earthquake in Seoul?

228
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,516
Is he calling
the Korea Meteorological Administration?

229
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,977
Why would we have an earthquake in Korea?

230
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,355
I thought he had been acting
very strange lately.

231
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,358
Maybe he's going to die.
What's with this nonsense?

232
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,318
Wait, you don't know?

233
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,364
All right.

234
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,451
Why aren't people prepared?

235
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,536
No region is free from earthquakes.

236
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,080
They'll wake up
only after something happens.

237
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,626
-Where are you going?
-The library.

238
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,420
The library?

239
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,631
Yes, he has gone insane.

240
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,633
FUTURE, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE
MAZE OF TIME

241
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,096
DOES TIME ALWAYS MOVE FORWARD?

242
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,434
"Stephen Hawking theoretically argued

243
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,394
we can turn back the clock and time

244
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,980
and fix the mistakes we made in the past.

245
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,524
He says in order to travel through time,

246
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:51,320
we must bend the space-time continuum
to create a thing called a wormhole."

247
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,448
What does that mean?

248
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,035
"From Galileo to The Terminator."

249
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,621
Kitty.

250
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,957
Meow.

251
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,377
Where is it?

252
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,605
What are you eating all by yourself?

253
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,774
What? Oh, breakfast.

254
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,819
And you? Is that your breakfast?

255
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,241
I came to see this cat I know,

256
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,034
but today,

257
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,829
you're here instead.

258
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,540
Oh, that's for a cat? A stray?

259
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,001
Yes, it must either be a stray

260
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,503
or have a sob story.

261
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,631
There's this kitty
that cries all the time,

262
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,424
just like somebody.

263
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,510
Who?

264
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:07,229
My gosh, your tummy
is making it obvious that you want some.

265
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,238
Here, you should eat first
before you feed that cat.

266
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,074
No, thanks. I don't eat breakfast.

267
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,873
Eat it even if you don't have an appetite.

268
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,876
You have to eat breakfast.
You're still a student.

269
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,337
I'll eat it, not because I want to,

270
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,464
but because it's from you.

271
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:36,925
Okay, sure.

272
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,386
Eat up already.

273
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,263
Goodness.

274
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:49,771
You eat so well.

275
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,607
It's good.

276
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:04,995
Are you all right?

277
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,331
Yes, I'm fine.

278
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,417
You should go ahead. Please excuse me.

279
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,002
What's wrong…

280
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,731
Goodness,

281
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,942
she'll be in pain for a while.

282
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,572
Oh no. My goodness. I don't have it.

283
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,866
I can't believe this.

284
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,327
My gosh, what am I going to do?

285
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,621
This is bad.

286
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,006
-Thanks.
-Sure.

287
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,969
I want to go again.

288
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,513
-The sea.
-And grilled clams.

289
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,099
-And shrimp chips.
-Come on, really?

290
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,437
JIN-JU

291
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,943
Why won't any of you pick up?
This is driving me insane.

292
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,331
Painkiller for period cramps, please.

293
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,083
This is effective.

294
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,965
She has a weak stomach,

295
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,217
so do you have something
with acetaminophen

296
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,802
instead of ibuprofen?

297
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,387
Let's see.

298
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:47,889
One second.

299
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,727
-Here.
-Okay.

300
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,775
Thank you. One second, please.

301
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,989
-Hello?
-Hey, it's me.

302
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,993
Could you pick up that thing for me?

303
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,412
Okay.

304
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,081
One second.

305
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,252
I'll take this too.

306
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,379
This?

307
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,133
Yes, okay.

308
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,469
Wait, one second.

309
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,430
It doesn't have wings. One second.

310
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,599
SOFTIE PADS

311
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,311
I'll take this one.

312
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,437
-This one?
-Yes.

313
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,647
-Okay.
-How much is it?

314
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,857
Thank you.

315
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,406
Hey, is Ban-do sleeping in the library

316
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,367
after cutting class?

317
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,035
Hey.

318
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,704
He's over there. There's Ban-do.

319
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,248
What is he doing there?

320
00:22:55,832 --> 00:23:00,045
-We slept at a construction site.
-Exactly. We're probably the first.

321
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,600
Man, come on.

322
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,646
Hey, Jin-ju.

323
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,530
Darn it, I can't go in there.

324
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,326
What are you doing, you pervert?

325
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,496
SOFTIE PADS

326
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,044
SOFTIE PADS

327
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,135
Are you confused about your gender?

328
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,719
Is this yours?

329
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,682
Come on, man.
Why did you suddenly push me?

330
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,641
This is awkward.

331
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,729
Look, pads with wings.

332
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,030
What is this? Is this a challenge?

333
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:09,948
Hey.

334
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,035
Don't look at me like that.

335
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,621
Jin-ju is in there. Give it to her.

336
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,040
What?

337
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,381
That mysterious lad.

338
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,181
Dok-jae.

339
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,142
That was humiliating.

340
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,186
Darn it.

341
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,275
Are you in a lot of pain?
Do you want anything?

342
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,278
No, I'm fine.

343
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,238
You should go eat lunch.

344
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,740
Are you sure?

345
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,993
Then get some rest. We'll eat quickly.

346
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,955
Okay. And take your time. I'm fine.

347
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,166
-We'll be back.
-Okay, see you.

348
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,523
Hey.

349
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,901
Goodness, I knew you'd do this.

350
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,737
I always told you
to take medicine with water.

351
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,366
You nag like an old man.

352
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,117
It's nothing compared to you.

353
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,038
Are you all right?

354
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,875
Hardly. I'm dying from the pain.

355
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,012
Here. Lie down.

356
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,354
Hey, it's okay.

357
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,897
Someone might see us.

358
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,525
Who cares? We didn't do anything wrong.

359
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,120
How about a kiss?

360
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:21,871
Are you crazy?

361
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,711
We need to do something like that
to feel like we've done something wrong.

362
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:31,339
Goodness. Seriously.
You're such an old man.

363
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,344
I'm not the only one who's old.
You're an old woman too.

364
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,349
I guess your period cramps
didn't go away with youth.

365
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,851
I'm still a woman.

366
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,769
You're right.

367
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,440
You'll develop a tolerance
if you keep taking medicine.

368
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,943
Why won't this chronic pain go away?

369
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,420
Does it hurt?

370
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,797
Yes. A bit to the left.

371
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,668
Don't you have class?

372
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,795
It's fine.
Classes aren't important at my age.

373
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,290
-It's on me today.
-What?

374
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,794
-No way, that's amazing.
-Right? I want tteokbokki.

375
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,885
High school kids these days
are very pretty.

376
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,138
You're pretty too.

377
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,306
What?

378
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,060
I mean, you're 18 years younger.
Of course, you're pretty.

379
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,232
Hey, give me a smoke.

380
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,818
-Be quiet.
-Hurry up.

381
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,695
-Give me one.
-Bring your own.

382
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,114
Hey, give her one too.

383
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,366
-All right.
-I'm not smoking.

384
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,494
-I want to get my nails done.
-Your nails?

385
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,662
Sorry!

386
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,123
Hey, this is awesome. I got it.

387
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,332
-What?
-I did it.

388
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,296
-Those young rascals.
-Hey.

389
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,798
Don't. You'll get in trouble.

390
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,008
Hey, let's go.

391
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,385
If they smoke this young,
they'll ruin their lungs.

392
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,387
-No.
-Goodness.

393
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,640
Kids these days are scary.

394
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,601
You're a man with a family.

395
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,771
You can't act recklessly
as if you have nothing to fear.

396
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,607
I'll become a widow if you die.

397
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,775
Remember that.

398
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,319
A widow? Come on.
Of all the ways to put it…

399
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,654
Come on. Let's go.

400
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,031
-Okay, fine.
-Stop. Let's go.

401
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,699
-Those rascals.
-Don't.

402
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,242
-All right.
-He doesn't smoke.

403
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,368
Okay, fine.

404
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,370
Wasn't P.E. short today?

405
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,248
-What the heck?
-You always tease me.

406
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,333
You're wrong.

407
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,013
Hey, breathe. Breathe.

408
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,097
You breathe.

409
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,815
Who cares if we have all the parts?

410
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,776
We've never used it.

411
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,989
-Lucky you.
-What do you mean, punk?

412
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,159
You have a girlfriend.

413
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,789
You jerk.

414
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,583
-I'm turning it off.
-Why?

415
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,669
Why did you turn it off?
They were about to--

416
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,045
You just imagined her.

417
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,588
Bo-reum isn't like that.

418
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,679
And the stuff?

419
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,102
Ta-da!

420
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,564
What is it?

421
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,731
Bo-reum is the best.

422
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,694
All right, this isn't a video
you get to see every day.

423
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,238
-Are you all ready?
-Yes.

424
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,447
Here we go.

425
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,336
Hey,

426
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,798
is that how it normally is?

427
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,552
Goodness, you kids. You're all so naive.

428
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,764
What's this? You talk as if you know.

429
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,684
It's not as if, I do know.

430
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,521
Wait, you haven't done it yet?

431
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,814
You have a boyfriend.

432
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:44,986
I see, do you hold to an antiquated ideal
like remaining a virgin until marriage?

433
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,198
Hey, it's not like that.
Virgin until marriage, my foot.

434
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,704
Bo-reum isn't
some national treasure to be protected.

435
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,541
I'm going to protect her!

436
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,378
I couldn't even use this. Goddamnit.

437
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,714
-Darn it.
-You're disgusting.

438
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,107
Mom.

439
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,195
Want to go to a karaoke?

440
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,073
Right now? In the middle of the day?

441
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,368
Karaoke? Me too.

442
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,537
What? Karaoke? Sounds great.

443
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,206
Yes!

444
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,085
Goodness.

445
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,672
Let's go singing.

446
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,839
Hey, go get changed.

447
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,426
Dad, no. It's this.

448
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,928
Come on, Dad.

449
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,643
Let's go.

450
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,069
BALLET AND B-BOYING
MIN SEO-YEONG AND JUNK CREW

451
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,241
What's this?

452
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,702
Do you remember the b-boying crew
I danced with last time?

453
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:20,581
Yes. Do you mean that time
I pushed you into the circle?

454
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,252
Those b-boys came looking for me.

455
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,255
-They want to perform with me.
-Really?

456
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,550
Gosh, this is amazing.

457
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,552
I'm so glad.

458
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,138
I'm going to keep doing ballet,

459
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,473
but I'll perform as a hobby.

460
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,310
-Come and watch.
-Of course. I'll be there for sure.

461
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,772
Hey, I helped you out with this.
You can't forget me later.

462
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,108
I know.

463
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,241
It's tomorrow.

464
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,422
-Hello?
-Where are you?

465
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,718
Me? Seo-yeong has a show today,
so I'm going to watch that. Why?

466
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,804
Darn it. Jae-u is out on a date,
and I'm bored now.

467
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,931
I'm bored.

468
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:19,849
Come on.

469
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,484
-My goodness.
-Hi. Are you going somewhere?

470
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,527
Hello.

471
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,281
Yes, I have to be at some place.

472
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,200
Excuse me, then.

473
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,210
What? Why is she following me?

474
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:48,711
Goodness.

475
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,390
By the way, how's your friend,
Ma Jin-ju from history?

476
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,725
Is she all right?

477
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,688
I heard from other med students

478
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:12,235
that they think he went to Jin-ju
to cause trouble that night.

479
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,986
I heard that he hit her.

480
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,367
Yes, karaoke!

481
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,161
There are actually places
that are open during the day.

482
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,039
Why isn't Jin-ju coming in?

483
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,707
Right? Why isn't she coming in?

484
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,002
Ta-da.

485
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,754
Goodness.

486
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,965
You need to drink when you sing.

487
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,050
Yes. Daytime drinking.

488
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,053
Hey, Jin-ju. You seem like
you're about to party.

489
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,264
Something like this
won't happen every day.

490
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,849
-Sounds great.
-Here.

491
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:43,933
Mom, you sing first.

492
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,352
What are you talking about?

493
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,104
I can't sing this early.

494
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,897
My voice is gone. I can't sing.

495
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,024
-No, you sing.
-Goodness.

496
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,442
Honey, you can do it.

497
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,194
Now, let's all make a toast.

498
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,863
-All right.
-Okay.

499
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,365
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

500
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,370
I heard from other med students

501
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,249
that they think he went to Jin-ju
to cause trouble that night.

502
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,501
I heard that he hit her.

503
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,336
COLLEGE OF MEDICINE

504
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,173
Park Hyeon-seok!

505
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,186
You asshole.

506
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,648
Hey, shouldn't we stop them?

507
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,822
Do you think I let you
boss me around because I'm an idiot?

508
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,451
How dare you touch her? How dare you?

509
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,289
How dare you lay a hand on her?

510
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,002
How dare you?

511
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,796
I'm relieved you didn't mess up
with Director Park.

512
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,799
Does that jerk still make you
manage his mistress?

513
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,676
Well, something like that.

514
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,929
It hurts. It really hurts.

515
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,224
I-I didn't do that on purpose. I…

516
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,811
Have you gone crazy?
How dare you touch her?

517
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,732
How dare you touch her?

518
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,736
I really like you.

519
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,488
Director Park.

520
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,906
Darn it.

521
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,785
If you keep doing this,
we'll stop using your company's drugs.

522
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,203
I'm sorry.

523
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,666
Behave, okay?

524
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,460
-Darn it.
-I'm sorry, sir!

525
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,292
How dare you hurt her?

526
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,630
Let go of me! Let go!

527
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,841
Let go of me!

528
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,303
How dare you hurt her? Let go!

529
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,045
Darn it. I only got to sing one song.

530
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,589
You only let Mom sing.

531
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,631
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

532
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,259
-Come on.
-You sing so well, honey.

533
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,847
May I have that thing I asked for?

534
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,890
Right. One second.

535
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,437
Goodness, your mother is a great singer.

536
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,521
Right?

537
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,775
FUN KARAOKE

538
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,075
I've never seen anyone
who's crazier than I am.

539
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,161
I'm sure he let it slide
because he did something.

540
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,746
You've been quiet for a while,

541
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,831
but you go and pull this crap.

542
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,378
Ban-do.

543
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:44,256
He will become a doctor in the future.

544
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,510
He'll save over 1,000 people in his life.

545
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:50,054
Why did you beat up
someone like that so badly?

546
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,766
I don't care if he saves
1,000 people or 10,000 people.

547
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,477
Why is that my concern?

548
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,439
It's not mine either.

549
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,192
I'm just saying.

550
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,504
Anyway, hey.

551
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,842
Did you get home safely last night?

552
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,012
Why do you have a phone
if you won't pick up?

553
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,722
You called me?

554
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,142
I didn't see it. Why?

555
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,103
Director Park…

556
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,523
Never mind. Forget it.

557
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,942
What about Director Park?

558
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,652
Finish your sentence.

559
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,654
I called when something happened,

560
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,783
but what did I expect?

561
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,785
What do you mean?

562
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,583
I mean you were never there
when I needed you.

563
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,676
My gosh, Michael Jackson is amazing.
His show is the best.

564
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,345
Tell me about it.
When will he ever come back?

565
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,014
Maybe next year.

566
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,061
WOMEN'S DORMITORY

567
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,238
-Is it locked?
-Yes, it's locked.

568
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,701
Oh no.

569
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,406
Isn't it uncomfortable down there?

570
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,742
No, I always sleep on the floor.
I'm a floor guy.

571
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,328
Okay.

572
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,627
Wait, you haven't done it yet?
You have a boyfriend.

573
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:31,215
I see, do you hold to an antiquated ideal
like remaining a virgin until marriage?

574
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,818
What is this? He's not even interested.

575
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:07,167
Until that day
When the waters of the East Sea run dry

576
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:11,005
And Mount Baekdusan is worn away

577
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:17,344
God protect and preserve our nation,
Hurray to Korea

578
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,110
What is it?

579
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,112
I need to go out and get something.

580
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:36,780
What?

581
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,329
What? Where is he going this late?

582
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,956
He startled me.

583
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,179
What? No way. Is he…

584
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:03,849
Oh my gosh.

585
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,102
That's cold.

586
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:11,982
What?

587
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,668
Did I wake you?

588
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,294
I'm sorry.

589
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,965
The cheer squad is great and all,
but your knees always get hurt.

590
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,766
You're so cute.

591
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,889
MOM'S VOICE

592
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,025
MOM'S VOICE
TO MY DEAR MOM

593
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,008
GRAPES

594
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,511
-What's this?
-Grapes.

595
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,805
That's not what I meant.

596
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,813
What is wrong with me?

597
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,110
Nothing ever…

598
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,199
goes the way I hoped it would.

599
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,243
I have…

600
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,664
always been true.

601
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,293
I always tried my best.

602
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,926
But why is everything a mess
just like this day ten years ago?

603
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:51,892
Taxi!

604
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,523
-Hey.
-Goodbye, sir.

605
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,525
-Hey, Mr. Choi.
-Yes, sir.

606
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:03,028
Stop by my hospital
with your medicine, okay?

607
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,112
Do you mean it, sir?

608
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,698
-Bye.
-Thank you. Salute!

609
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,036
Goodbye, sir.

610
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:21,338
-Hey, you. You.
-Hey.

611
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:24,258
Rock-paper-scissors, shoot.

612
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,759
What are you doing?

613
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,052
Hey, get up.

614
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,595
These rascals.

615
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,931
That's hilarious.

616
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,016
Give me a smoke. A smoke.

617
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,142
Hey, kids!

618
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,228
You rascals.

619
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,939
Hey, the one on the ground. Come here.

620
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,025
-Come here, it's okay.
-Who's that?

621
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,485
Look, it's an old man.

622
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,571
-What is he doing?
-Man.

623
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,822
Are you all right?

624
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,324
Go home. Run along.

625
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,785
I can't believe this.

626
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,789
Haven't you rascals learned
anything better than to bully your friend?

627
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,708
I don't care if you drink or smoke,

628
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,294
that's your body, so it's your choice.

629
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,504
But don't bully others.

630
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,798
What is he saying?

631
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,135
-He's trying to look cool.
-He's so fake.

632
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,970
What the heck?

633
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,513
Hey, honey.

634
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:16,268
Ban-do, please come quickly.

635
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,688
Ban-do, come quickly.

636
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,733
Okay, I'm on my way.

637
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,945
Hey, old man. We need to talk to you.

638
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,324
-Get away!
-How dare you?

639
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,909
-Hello?
-You stupid old man.

640
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,744
-You're dead.
-Hey.

641
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,078
Hello?

642
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:36,872
Hello? What's wrong?

643
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,082
What's wrong, honey?

644
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,585
What's going on?

645
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,296
Oh no. What am I going to do?

646
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:45,380
Mom.

647
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,382
Oh no.

648
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,594
No, sir. I just need to talk to him.

649
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,721
Detective, I have to go.

650
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:57,059
-No. You were in a fight.
-Detective, I have to go. Please.

651
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,102
What's wrong with you? Get him away.

652
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,396
-No, I have to go, Detective.
-Gosh. Seriously.

653
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,231
I have to go right now.

654
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,735
-Detective, please. I have to go.
-Geez.

655
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:09,237
Let me go. Hey, let me go!

656
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,336
What's wrong with you?

657
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,800
Why must you do this?

658
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,937
Why must you do this?

659
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,110
FUNERAL HALL FIVE

660
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,531
It's your fault.

661
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,867
Because of you,

662
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,287
my mom passed away without seeing me.

663
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,728
I'm sorry.

664
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,273
I'm sorry, Mother.

665
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,692
I'm sorry.

666
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,236
I'm sorry.

667
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:51,214
I'm sorry.

668
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:00,724
I kill myself trying…

669
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:06,396
to give it my all and live a better life.

670
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,567
But why do I always end up apologizing

671
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,694
and being sorry?

672
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,033
Like you did…

673
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,996
I missed my mother-in-law too.

674
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,753
I missed my mother-in-law just like you.

675
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,443
What is he talking about?

676
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,320
Mom.

677
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:24,266
The King of Pop, Michael Jackson,
died at his home today, June 25th.

678
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:28,228
On this day ten years ago,
June 25th, 1995.

679
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,981
-He performed in Korea.
-What's she saying?

680
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,733
Many fans in Korea are also grieving.

681
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,443
-I can't believe it.
-Are you serious?

682
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,570
MICHAEL JACKSON IS DEAD

683
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,573
On the day my universe,
my mother, disappeared,

684
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,078
the world was bustling with something else
they were interested in.

685
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,623
And my sadness

686
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:52,210
seemed to have been buried
as being petty and ordinary,

687
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,173
even to the person closest to me.

688
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:01,720
THREE MONTHS AFTER EUN-SUK'S FUNERAL

689
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:42,969
I'm home.

690
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,263
Guess what I got.

691
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,975
Ta-da. Your favorite, boiled pork.

692
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,810
Aren't you proud of me?

693
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,354
Just stay right there.

694
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:55,023
I'll set it up as soon as I get changed.

695
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,650
Okay? Stay right there.

696
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:33,621
