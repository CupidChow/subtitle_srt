00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,435
Goodness.

6
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,023
She was hurt.

7
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,108
Goodness, she should've been careful.

8
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,402
What are you doing? I told you to watch…

9
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,071
Okay.

10
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,491
What were you doing? No way.

11
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,534
Come on, stop it.

12
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,747
Are you a young kid burning with desire?

13
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,749
You'll be 40 soon.

00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,459
What's wrong with you?

15
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,294
Porn?

16
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,422
What? I wasn't watching porn.
What do you take me for?

17
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,132
A horny old man, that's what.

18
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,426
When I saw that folder
with the suspicious name…

19
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,469
Seriously.

20
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,347
Why are you bringing up
something from years ago?

21
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:41,226
Here. Take a look. Fine. Look.

00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,235
Why did you look her up?

25
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,530
Even a married couple
must respect each other's privacy.

26
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,825
-I wondered how she was doing.
-Why are you curious about her?

27
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,036
Why do I need a reason?
I just wanted to know.

28
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,540
To men,
our first love lasts for a lifetime.

29
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,875
It's not like
I'll meet her and cheat on you.

30
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:12,173
It's like this unfinished homework
that resides in a part of my heart.

31
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,176
That's first love.

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,470
Goodness, you and your first love.

33
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,973
That's unfair for people
without a first love.

34
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,894
Why don't you have a first love?
Your first love is

35
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,688
right here.

36
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,150
I'm your first.

37
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,278
Your first love is
your first boyfriend and first husband.

38
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,031
You got it all.
So you wouldn't know how I feel.

39
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,743
How is it living with your first love?
Is it amazing?

40
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,745
How is it? Tell me. It's great, isn't it?

41
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,873
Tell me. I'm curious. Very curious.

42
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,457
How is it? Great, right?

43
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,460
You're wrong. You're not my first love.

44
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,628
I have no first love.

45
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,633
That woman.

46
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,470
Hey, everyone has a first love.

47
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,014
I'm your first love.

48
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:04,851
Why do you get to decide my first love?
It's for me to decide.

49
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,020
And how do you define it anyway?

50
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,439
The first one you dated? Kissed?

51
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,817
Then I'm your first love,
not Min Seo-yeong.

52
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:16,946
No. It's the first person
who made your heart race and tremble

53
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,781
when you see or think of them.

54
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,867
That's your first crush, not first love.

55
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,829
And my heart never raced
or trembled when I was with you.

56
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,873
By my standards, you aren't my first love.

57
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,209
Unbelievable. You aren't it.

58
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,045
A person's first love
is the most dramatic,

59
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,465
pure, and genuine kind of love
in this world.

60
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,385
However, its definition and standard

61
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,973
are equally as ambiguous
as the meaning it holds.

62
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,017
You're so cute. Do you want to go down?

63
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,562

Goodness.

70
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,218
Mom, go inside.

71
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,055
What's wrong with you? This young man--

72
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,390
Mom, just go inside.

73
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,725
Go inside, okay? Go inside.

74
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,144
-Go inside. Just get inside.
-Wait.

75
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,404
I was just in the area.

76
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,157
How dare you come here?

77
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,455
Did you come to see my mom?

78
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,503
Don't you lurk around my house again.

79
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,979
Do you know him?

80
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,150
-No.
-Then why did you do that?

81
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,193
That young man helped me out.

82
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:24,073
If he helps you out again,
just give him a good kick.

83
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,951
-That jerk.
-Listen to this girl.

84
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,204
He looked very gentle and dependable.

85
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,873
The least you can do is thank him.

86
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,292
Why did you call
that perfectly good boy a jerk?

87
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,462
He just is to you and me.

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,881

-Gosh.
-Great work today.

92
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,154
-We're done.
-Good work.

No.

96
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,420
This knee goes with this arm.
Stretch it out.

97
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,713
Make a diagonal line.

98
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,841
-Like this.
-Oh, a diagonal line.

99
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,094
Now, one more time. Ready, go.

100
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,727
Hey.

101
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,648
How much harder do I have to practice
to get a uniform like yours?

102
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,441
What did you say?

103
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,570
You know, how much do I have to practice
to be like your partner

104
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,239
who did those moves with you?

105
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,075
You know, like this.

106
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,036
He lifted you up like this and stuff.
Things like that.

107
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,928
-Stay right there.
-What?

108
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,682
Lift me up.

109
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,354
You couldn't even talk to her.

110
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,815
You liked her so much
that you couldn't talk to her.

111
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:07,403
First love is very beautiful
when you reminisce on it.

112
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,947
What? You had a first love too?

113
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,949
Of course, he did.

114
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,534
The orchard owner's daughter.

115
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,661
His heart still aches for her.

116
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,538
Hey.

117
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,708
Goodness, I had no time to like anyone

118
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,002
because I was busy
looking after your uncles.

119
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,047
You should've just liked anybody.

120
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,175
-It's unfair.
-That's nothing to feel unfair about.

121
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,052
What good is being his first love?

122
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,095
I just need to be his last love.

123
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,724
How do you know that for sure?

124
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,228
Why? Do you think he'll have an affair?

125
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,231
Come on. Let's eat dinner.

126
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,360
My gosh, look at him.

127
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,029
-Come on.
-Yes, ma'am.

YEAR 2010

129
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,709
Remarriage?

130
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,712
Yes, it's too lonely to live alone

131
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,214
and everyone recommends it.

132
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,634
Stop joking around, Dad.

133
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,055
Shouldn't I let your mom go now?

134
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,894
Let Mom go?

135
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,608
Has it been a decade or two
since Mom died?

136
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,652
It hasn't been a year.

137
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,239
Can you let her go that easily?

138
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,116
Can you?

139
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,701
Hey,

140
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,078
you should hear him out first.

141
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,331
You only need one year to let go of Mom
after 40 years of marriage?

142
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,335
I still…

143
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,800
I still feel like
Mom will greet me with a smile.

144
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,178
I feel like she'll pick up if I call.

145
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,682
That's why I can't come over or even call.

146
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,020
In case I do let her go.

147
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,024
And you can let her go like that?

148
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,901
That easily?

149
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,324
This just makes me feel so bad for her.

150
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,958
I have to go.

151
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,920
-Jin-ju.
-Jin-ju.

152
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,131
One second, Father.

153
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,982
What are you doing?
He was about to eat that.

154
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,152
It's yours. You eat everything, Mom.

155
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,989
It's all yours.

156
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,299
Did I do something
when I came home drunk recently?

157
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,218
No, you didn't.

158
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,137
You were the same as usual
when you're drunk.

159
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,973
-My daughters, Dad's home.
-He's drunk.

160
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,058
Okay, Dad.

161
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,976
-Give me a kiss.
-Come on, Dad.

162
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,061
Stop him, Eun-ju.

163
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,021
-You don't like me?
-Dad, stop it. Mom!

164
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,107
You hugged the girls and kissed them.

165
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,817
Then you talked to the plants.

166
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,571
I, Ma Pan-seok,
still have my game going strong.

167
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,824
You know that, right?

168
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,578
That's it.

169
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,373
She hates it when I kiss her.

170
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,168
No, I doubt she'd sulk for that long
just because of that.

171
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,963
You haven't been reading her diary either.

172
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,175
That's it.

173
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,886
You read it again?

174
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,681
I did it very secretly.
How did she find out?

175
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,766
Good going.

176
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,977
Why do you read a grown girl's diary?

177
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,187
You're really weird.

178
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,647
I was just worried.

179
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,859
What if she gets involved
with weird guys now that she's of age?

180
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,026
She's an adult.

181
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,571
She should try dating
weird guys or good guys.

182
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,324
No, I can't let my precious girl
date just anybody.

183
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,285
This world is a scary place.

184
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,788
And all men are just vulgar jerks.
They're all vulgar.

185
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,002
Yes, a vulgar jerk.

186
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:38,424
Whomever she brings home,
I'll give him ten auditions.

187
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,634
Goodness.

188
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,305
There's no way
my daughters will ever get married.

189
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,434
Then I'll live with them
for the rest of my life.

190
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:49,977
My girls.

191
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,481
My girls.

192
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,349
I miss you, Seo-jin.

193
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,434
I miss you.

194
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,625
Seo-jin.

195
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,765
Why didn't you come out if you were up?

196
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,936
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

197
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,896
It's not nothing. You were crying.

198
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,400
-I just had an odd dream.
-Really?

199
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,362
You've been so weird lately.

200
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,365
You even dreamt that I died.

201
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,119
Should I get you some herbal tonic?

202
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,874
What's with you?

203
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,710
Mom.

204
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,629
My mom.

205
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,216
This is so nice.

206
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:50,973
Goodness, you've been very odd.

207
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,726
Why is this grown-up girl
hugging me all the time?

208
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,728
Goodness.

209
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,250
Off to school already?

210
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,462
No, I'm going with you.

211
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,345
She has had dialysis
for the last five years.

212
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,013
Nothing seems odd.

213
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,225
Well, she may be fine now,

214
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,102
but if she keeps getting dialysis,

215
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,607
she might have complications
in about ten years.

216
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,819
Complications could arise
in ten years or tomorrow.

217
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,406
But we can't go without doing dialysis
because we're afraid of that.

218
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,078
But is there something you can do
to prevent those complications?

219
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,831
Her treatments are designed
to minimize the risk of complications.

220
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,417
Your mom will live for a long time,

221
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,753
so don't worry so much.

222
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,526
Long? How is that long?

223
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,406
She has only ten years left.

224
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,706
Her kids studied a lot about her illness

225
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,040
and the complications.

226
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,084
Her son came by yesterday.

227
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,045
Ms. Ko doesn't have a son.

228
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,632
-She only has two daughters.
-What?

229
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,050
Ban-do, wake up.

230
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,434
I told you to wake up.

231
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,228
What? You're up already?

232
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,858
Good morning, Mother. Father.

233
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,571
I won't take those from you.

234
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,614
Not everyone can be rich.

235
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,200
You're too scared and suspicious.

236
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:19,663
Where did that little rascal
learn to speak like a conniving snake?

237
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,623
You never woke up no matter what I did.

238
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,208
What happened to you?

239
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,630
-Cabbage juice?
-At least have a sip.

240
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,299
It's really good for your GI…

241
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,432
Tastes like dirty rags.

242
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,018
It may taste gross,
but it's great for your GI system.

243
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,147
Thank you. I'm going to school.

244
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,193
He always refused to drink it.

245
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,112
What got into him today?

246
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,135
To 31 Seongbuk-dong, please.

247
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,472
We're here.

248
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,071
In sync!

249
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:39,451
Left.

250
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,994
Morning drill?

251
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,706
-Yes, sir.
-Is everything going well at school?

252
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,168
Let me know if you need anything.
I'll make anything happen.

253
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,380
Put in a good word for me to your father.

254
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,217
In that case,
since I don't want to be at school,

255
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,886
can you just say I attended
and give me a diploma?

256
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,014
Even better
if you give me a scholarship too.

257
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,352
Right, goodness.
I forgot that I had a meeting.

258
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,436
See you next time.

259
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,398
Goodness, is that you, Jeong Yu-ra?

260
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,819
Isn't he the school president?

261
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,155
See? I'm telling you. Either his family

262
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,323
owns a conglomerate or is in politics.

263
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,408
-Politics?
-Yes.

264
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,243
Who's talking during a drill?

265
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,164
My gosh.

266
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,374
What is this?

267
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,626
Go away.

268
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,545
Wait.

269
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,597
FOOD PRICE INCREASE

270
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,985
Food tastes bad if you eat alone.

271
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,448
I'm not here alone.

272
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,916
-Snack food is always the slowest.
-Tell me about it.

273
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,084
Not you, me.

274
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,004
What's with this guy?

275
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,257
He told me to stop coming onto him.
What is this guy thinking?

276
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,183
What's going on?

277
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:37,027
Nam-gil, things must be hectic lately
because of Jin-ju.

278
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,447
That was the first time
a guy told her he liked her.

279
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,658
-She's so lame.
-Stop it.

280
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,910
-He doesn't like me.
-What?

281
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,412
He doesn't like me.

282
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,666
I didn't say I liked her.

283
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,794
I'm hitting on her.

284
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,925
Are you done eating?

285
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,682
Come on. Let's go.

286
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,227
Go with him.

287
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,980
-Go with him. Go.
-What? Why?

288
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,275
Go.

289
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,489
He obviously likes Jin-ju, right?

290
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,409
Right? He's hitting on her
after she turned him down.

291
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,662
Then he'll like her
no matter what her situation is.

292
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,583
You know,
even if she's divorced with a kid.

293
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,129
Why is the situation so extreme? Eat up.

294
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,639
I mean, I know
this is a confusing time for kids,

295
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,809
but I have no idea
what this guy is thinking.

296
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:55,022
So, you told me to stop coming onto you.

297
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,648
That you didn't like me.

298
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,443
But you're flirting with me?

299
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,364
Not me, you.
You're flirting with me right now.

300
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,325
Why would I?

301
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,118
I never flirted with you.

302
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,745
You've been flirting with me

303
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,080
for the last few days,
and rather aggressively.

304
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,625
I can't believe this.

305
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,086
I've had guys flirt with me,

306
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,298
but I've never flirted
with a guy first in my entire life.

307
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,551
Well, the thing
at the gate was an accident.

308
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,137
And the archives?
That was also an accident…

309
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,268
Right, is your leg all right?

310
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,896
Does it hurt?

311
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,941
You should keep icing it
so it doesn't bother you later.

312
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,737
Once you sprain something,
it'll bother you for life

313
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,614
unless you treat it well.

314
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,075
See? You're flirting with me.

315
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,202
Stop saying I'm flirting with you.

316
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,537
-This is flirting with me.
-What?

317
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,706
If you're going to flirt,
help me carry this.

318
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,210
You're responsible.

319
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,089
You don't seem to be
in so much pain that you need help.

320
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,675
I don't show it,

321
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,720
but it feels like
my flesh is being ripped with every step.

322
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,015
Really? Goodness, this is really bad.

323
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,266
Hey, wait.

324
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,186
What kind of a girl…

325
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,355
You're moving too fast.

326
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,736
What's with him?

327
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:32,994
What is this?

328
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:34,913
You startled me.

329
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,123
Hey.

330
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,667
Why? Are you surprised?

331
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,170
You're so cool.

332
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,714
What was that?

333
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,008
No, I mean it.

334
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,387
A ballerina and hip hop.

335
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,639
Yes, it's cool.

336
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,934
I thought
you'd only listen to classical music.

337
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,645
So you like this kind of music.

338
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,692
-Isn't it energizing?
-Yo.

339
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,319
There's energy in the beat in hip hop,

340
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,238
unlike boring classical music.

341
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,867
Wouldn't it be really fun
to dance to this?

342
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,869
Then give it a try.

343
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,997
I can't dance hip hop.

344
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,624
No, I mean ballet.
Ballet is a type of dance too.

345
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,002
Can you not do ballet to hip hop?

346
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,423
I can't. How can you do ballet
to hip hop music?

347
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,049
Really?

348
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,928
Anyway,
I really didn't know much about you.

349
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,597
We only met recently.

350
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,433
Exactly. That's why I should find out.

351
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,393
Find out what?

352
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,770
Things I didn't know about you.

353
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,858
And what I was like in the days past.

354
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,532
I don't remember her rejecting me.

355
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,204
Then why did I give up
without asking her out?

356
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,373
What did you give up?

357
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,834
Were you folding cranes for someone?

358
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,920
Hey, cranes are ancient.

359
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,088
Roses are the thing right now.

360
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,467
Hey.

361
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,012
What's that rag on your head?

362
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,263
Don't call it a rag.

363
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,933
Don't you know?
It's the bandana that H.O.T. wore.

364
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,228
Liar. You're afraid
someone might recognize you as the guy

365
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,521
who got his head stuck.

366
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,190
This is all your fault.

367
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,821
This is way too bitter.

368
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,448
Okay, herbal tonic.

369
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,746
Hey, he hasn't brushed his teeth
since he kissed Bo-reum yesterday.

370
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,624
Come on. You're so gross.

371
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,337
Wait, are you dating Bo-reum?

372
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,298
Why are you so shocked?

373
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,843
My life was ruined because of her.

374
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,973
I curse her.

375
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,559
I hope she burns in hell.

376
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,852
I feel so bad for myself.

377
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,313
I feel so pathetic.

378
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,232
My life was ruined because of her.

379
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:12,487
Why is he trying to repeat
his painful history?

380
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,698
Dating, my ass.

381
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,659
Hey. She gave you a peck.
It wasn't a real kiss.

382
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,289
-Same difference.
-It's not the same thing.

383
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,207
It was just a peck, not a kiss.

384
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,627
People give pecks
as greetings to say hi and bye.

385
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,298
I give my nephew pecks all the time.
Does that mean I'm dating him?

386
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,719
We kissed because we're dating.

387
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,512
Why would we kiss if we weren't?

388
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,891
There are some girls
who are that open-minded.

389
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,476
That's just greetings overseas.

390
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,438
Man, I didn't think Bo-reum was like that.

391
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,857
She's one open-minded girl, isn't she?

392
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,610
She sounds amazing.
She's open in all directions.

393
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,404
What an amazing girl, Bo-reum.

394
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,322
Are we good?

395
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,242
Come on. She wouldn't just kiss me

396
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,286
if she didn't want to date me.

397
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,997
I mean, I'm a man too.

398
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,668
ASURA

399
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,633
-Hi.
-I thought you'd run away. But you came.

400
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,515
What was that? That's it?

401
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,560
Hold me like this.

402
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,603
Okay, right here.

403
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,021
-Two, three.
-And up?

404
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,648
-Yes, lift me up like that.
-Okay.

405
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,237
There are some girls
who are that open-minded.

406
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,115
Man, I didn't think Bo-reum was like that.

407
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,701
She's one open-minded girl, isn't she?

408
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,457
-Okay.
-That was nice.

409
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,211
That was good.

410
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,428
Give me your bag.

411
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,265
You asked me
to follow you around to carry this thing?

412
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,643
"This thing"? That's very expensive.

413
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,063
Nam-gil.

414
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:13,400
I stayed up all night baking this.

415
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,443
It's good. Please try some.

416
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,196
Goodness, what a good age.

417
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,492
You stayed up all night baking it,
so you eat it.

418
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,707
Goodness.

419
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,302
I took this disgusting thing
out of a garbage can, so try it.

420
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,805
Will you take it if I say that?

421
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,433
She was probably excited all night baking.

422
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,976
Why won't you accept it?

423
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,520
And then what? Nothing in life is free.

424
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,982
If I get something,
I have to do something for her.

425
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,651
Why would I take something
from a girl I don't even like?

426
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:01,281
I mean, it's not like
she wanted something big.

427
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,323
She just likes you.

428
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,659
She wanted to make you something to eat.

429
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,203
You know, like parents.
Something like that.

430
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,289
Think of how sweet that was.

431
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:14,753
Do you really think
parents don't expect anything in return?

432
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,921
What's with him?

433
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,132
He's so cynical.

434
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,177
-Give it to me.
-What?

435
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:24,929
You told me to eat it.

436
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,348
Wasn't it because you wanted to feed me?

437
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,726
No, not me.

438
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,319
See you here at 7 p.m.

439
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,363
I can't drive.

440
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,575
Take this.

441
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,868
Bring it with you later.

442
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,204
Bye.

443
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,539
You're perfectly fine.

444
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,340
What? Is he really hurt or not?

445
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,136
They won't kick you out if you do this?

446
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,389
I have to volunteer
to avoid getting demerits.

447
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,310
It's all because of Jae-u, that traitor.

448
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,313
Hello.

449
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,440
Okay.

450
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,527
Number 85. You're all set.

451
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,324
Why is that young kid so masculine?

452
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,076
He's older. Don't you know him?

453
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,621
He's very famous.
The hottest guy at Hanguk University.

454
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,333
He's tall, handsome,
and is in great shape.

455
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,544
Some say
he's the grandson of a conglomerate.

456
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,087
Really?

457
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,714
Others say he's the son
of the Minister of Defense.

458
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,092
But I think
his family is something bigger.

459
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,804
He's a golden boy.

460
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,347
What? Golden what?

461
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,308
A golden boy.
You know, a guy that has it all.

462
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,855
Do you know him well?

463
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,276
Forget it.

464
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,989
Hey, can you take these
to the locker room?

465
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,407
Come on.

466
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,412
-The women's locker room?
-You lunatic. Forget it.

467
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,093
CHOCOLATE BAR

468
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,305
She's Ma Jin-ju, a history major.

469
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,849
Hey, what if Ye-rim finds out?

470
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,184
You worked so hard to get her.

471
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,313
I wouldn't let her find out.
I'm just playing with her.

472
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,732
Look at her. She's pretty,

473
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,401
but she looks totally poor.

474
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,778
She's a perfect toy.

475
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,865
And Ye-rim is my bank for life.

476
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,575
I won't let her go.

477
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,787
What a big jerk.

478
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,341
SHOWERS

479
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,317
What was that?

480
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,488
Goodness. Gosh, I'm so sorry.
I thought you were my friend.

481
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,698
What? You pushed me very hard.

482
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,160
Right, I'm sorry. Bye.

483
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,710
Seo-yeong, I'm so sorry.

484
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,004
I feel bad. The tickets will go to waste.

485
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,676
No, it's okay.
I can go alone. You should go.

486
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,345
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine. Go.

487
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,805
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

488
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,861
Then give it a try.

489
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,781
Can you not do ballet to hip hop?

490
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,951
See? You can do it.

491
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,286
Why did you stop?

492
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,247
I just wanted to see
if it was possible. It was for fun.

493
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,250
Don't do it for fun. Do it as your career.

494
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,794
Then it'll become a fun career.

495
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:49,670
What?

496
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,966
It's not easy to find a job
that you can have fun doing.

497
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,053
What you want to do
isn't always what you have to do.

498
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,223
If it doesn't happen, make it happen.

499
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,810
If you do everything
just because you have to,

500
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,312
you won't have anything left
when you're done.

501
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,273
If you did something fun,
it'll stay with you.

502
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,400
You have a way with words.

503
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,902
I mean it.

504
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:18,407
What if you get hurt
and can't do this anymore?

505
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,536
Nothing lasts forever.

506
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,789
So do whatever you want to do
when you want to.

507
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,707
Is that so?

508
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,253
While we're on the subject,
what do you want to do now?

509
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,632
-Here.
-Returning it so soon?

510
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,925
Follow me.

511
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,972
You lied.

512
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,184
I don't think you're in any pain.
You seem fine.

513
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,646
I'm going to the hospital.

514
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:50,898
A hospital?

515
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,734
Gosh, I'm sorry.

516
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,904
I'll take the bag too. I can carry it.

517
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,032
I'm stronger than I look. Your bag.

518
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,204
He must really be in pain. My gosh.

519
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,039
Gosh.

520
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,837
Seriously? You got these tickets for us?

521
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,673
No, my friend canceled on me.

522
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,843
This is the third time
I'm telling you this.

523
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:21,888
What?

524
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,351
-Gosh.
-Come on.

525
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,604
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

526
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,653
-Come on.
-What is he doing?

527
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,495
Hold on.

528
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,336
It's your loss if you fall over.

529
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,600
-Drive more carefully.
-Please.

530
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:20,029
Look at those veins.
You got it going on, Ban-do.

531
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,782
Yes, you're the man.

532
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:30,998
MATRIX, SHIRI

533
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,709
Is this the theater?

534
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,964
Does it have to be here?

535
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,049
We have to watch it here, right?

536
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,760
Yes, I got the tickets for this theater.

537
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,305
Come on, no way.

538
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,058
It's pretty big. I won't run into him.

539
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,445
-That'll be 3,000 won.
-Okay.

540
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,623
I need to use the restroom.

541
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,964
Here you go.

542
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,802
Why did it have to be here?

543
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,929
Gosh, this is really bad.

544
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,850
Wait, no.

545
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,270
I'm not committing a crime.
I'm not cheating on her.

546
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:38,524
Yes, Ban-do. Be confident. Stand tall!

547
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,942
That's it! Let's go!

548
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,709
Yes, it's not like this is a sin.

549
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,588
But why do I feel so weird?

550
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,008
Hey.

551
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,762
Wait, why is she here?

552
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,847
Darn it.

553
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:19,815
The golden boy?

554
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,151
THEATER ONE, THEATER TWO

555
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:24,820
What's wrong?

556
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,865
Why are we here? This isn't the hospital.

557
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,993
I'll be better after I watch a movie.

558
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,079
It's not as good alone.

559
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,039
See? I knew you were faking it.

560
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:38,250
My gosh. I shouldn't be seen here.

561
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,212
I'm sorry. I was in a bit of a rush.

562
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,505
-I see.
-Gosh.

563
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,674
This is so good.

564
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,929
Right, Nam-gil.

565
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,932
Do you remember
when you told me you liked me?

566
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:57,061
-I said that wasn't--
-I meant when you asked me out.

567
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,146
Yes.

568
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,857
Quite a bit of time
has passed already, hasn't it?

569
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,570
I'm your first love.

570
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,364
I never had a first love,

571
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,907
but I was someone's first love.

572
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,786
-Who?
-You don't believe me?

573
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:17,665
An upperclassman in my department.
This rich, hot, and popular guy.

574
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,126
-He said he liked me.
-Seriously?

575
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,254
You've watched too many dramas. You liar.

576
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,006
Why would a hot,
rich, popular guy like you?

577
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:26,966
He's not insane.

578
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,884
I'm serious.

579
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,220
This woman is seriously ill.

580
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,182
It was you. The insane guy.

581
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,101
The golden boy.

582
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,019
But why?

583
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,312
Has he gone cuckoo?

584
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:44,567
Goodness, yes. It's better
when she's just your first love.

585
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,944
-You haven't watched this, right?
-What?

586
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:50,197
Right, no. I haven't. I couldn't.

587
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,491
It must be good if it's this popular.

588
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,994
I hear it's sad and makes everyone cry.

589
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:59,999
Goodness, even if it's sad,
I'm sure it's just a typical flick.

590
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,126
Why would I cry over this?

591
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,716
THE REAL 1999

592
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,136
This is so sad. Don't do that.

593
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,601
YEAR 2004

594
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,651
YEAR 2017

595
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,404
No, stop.

596
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:36,911
Goodness. Anyway, it has been so long
since I came to this theater.

597
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,829
I came here all the time in college.

598
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,791
You're still in college,
and a freshman at that.

599
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,419
You sound like an old man at times.

600
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,421
What?

601
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,426
An old man? I'm not old.

602
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,512
No, I like it.

603
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,806
I like how relaxed you seem.
I feel at ease with you.

604
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,102
I see. So you like it?

605
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,077
You're not crying.

606
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,317
-Great work.
-Great job.

607
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:55,406
Do guys hate it
when girls kiss them first?

608
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:58,284
No way, I'd love that. I'd be grateful.

609
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,620
-Hey, set me up with her.
-No, me first.

610
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:03,747
What's going on, then?

611
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,584
What if a girl asks you out?

612
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,505
If a girl asks me out?
I don't really like that.

613
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,966
Why not? Why does it matter?

614
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,135
Hey, guys still have our pride.

615
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:20,097
You should give the guy
the chance to ask you out. Right?

616
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,312
-Come and grab a drink!
-Come on in.

617
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,813
-You're late.
-We started.

618
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,023
Come on over.

619
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,107
Hurry up and come.

620
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:35,571
For a man, his first love
stays with him until he dies.

621
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,864
When was your first love?

622
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,949
Me? Back in middle school.

623
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,242
An older girl at church.

624
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,704
And you, Jae-u?

625
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,247
-Me?
-Yes.

626
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:49,918
In kindergarten.

627
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,297
It made my heart race and all that.

628
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,968
This goody-two-shoes started early.

629
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,054
-I was mature.
-Gosh, Jae-u.

630
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,014
Eat up.

631
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,226
Those were all crushes, you morons.

632
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,645
Did you date any of them?

633
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,648
I mean, how can I date my ethics teacher?

634
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,399
She didn't know me.

635
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,860
If you did nothing,
it's not first love, but a crush.

636
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,695
You guys are all confused.

637
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:20,032
Your first love isn't someone
you liked for the first time.

638
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,825
It's the first one you dated.

639
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,537
A man and a woman
must start dating to call it love.

640
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:28,082
You have to give and take.
It must go both ways.

641
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,543
If you don't date each other,
it's nothing but a crush.

642
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,045
A crush.

643
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,299
No, she was my first love.

644
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,177
She still makes my heart race.

645
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,771
Why did she kiss me
if we aren't even dating?

646
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:55,150
Gosh, is it that hard to ask me out?

647
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,861
I'll catch a deadly disease while waiting.

648
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,673
Hey, Jae-u.

649
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:20,384
If you take another step, it's over.

650
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,018
What? It's not like we did anything.

651
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:31,687
We weren't dating.

652
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,523
-I had a crush on you, that's all.
-What?

653
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,358
You may be free-spirited

654
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,695
and kiss someone
you're not going out with as a greeting.

655
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:40,946
But not me.

656
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,116
Why did you kiss someone
you weren't dating?

657
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,286
It might mean nothing to you
because we're not dating, but for me…

658
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,331
you're my first love.

659
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,169
You said it was in kindergarten.

660
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,254
You said your heart raced and all that.

661
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,089
How could I remember that far back?

662
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,467
You said it was a crush
if I didn't date her.

663
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,302
Yes, then you're crushing on me too.

664
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,012
No, you're my first love.

665
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,768
So what do you want to do with me?

666
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,772
-Do what?
-What do you want to do with me?

667
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,151
I want to date you.

668
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,029
I don't want to crush on you.

669
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,615
I want to go out with you.

670
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,415
You said it, okay? You asked me out.

671
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,094
You're not crying.

672
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,514
Love stories aren't sad
enough for me to cry.

673
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,016
Life is full of tears anyway.

674
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,184
"Full of tears."

675
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:53,977
You little…

676
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,525
Excuse me.

677
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,569
Goodness. Hello, Fa…

678
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,322
Who are you?

679
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,744
A passerby. Just a passerby.

680
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:12,955
Goodness.

681
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,421
He's an upperclassman. Nothing more.

682
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,799
This is my dad.

683
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,594
Yes, hello. My name is Jeong Nam-gil.

684
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,143
I'll take that.

685
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,522
Well, I hurt my leg, so I had to…

686
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,233
Don't make assumptions.

687
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,860
He's really just an upperclassman.

688
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,362
Yes, hello. Nice to meet you.

689
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,825
Jin-ju, I'm getting off now.
Do you want to go home together?

690
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,743
No, you can go first.

691
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,620
Okay, then.

692
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,665
In that case, have fun.

693
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:03,547
To hang out more?

694
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,426
Did your leg finally get better
thanks to Dr. Han Suk-kyu?

695
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:12,306
I'll consider your leg fully healed
as of today, so please excuse me.

696
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,516
Jin-ju.

697
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,730
I found something,
so I have to go to the police station.

698
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:20,939
Come with me.

699
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,326
Why did you do that?

700
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,410
What?

701
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,078
Right.

702
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,873
He looked like someone I know.

703
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:41,293
I see. He must've been a father.

704
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,587
-What?
-A Catholic priest?

705
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,547
Are you Catholic?

706
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:49,134
Yes, he's a father.

707
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,178
How do I put this?

708
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,837
Jump in if you want to dance with us.

709
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,883
She'll go!

710
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,136
Hey.

711
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,284
Hey, ballet to hip hop music?

712
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:35,282
I can't believe that was possible.
Ballet to hip hop music.

713
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,076
I think it worked
because they danced with me.

714
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,203
-Did you have fun?
-Totally.

715
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,997
Aren't you glad I pushed you in?

716
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,168
It's destiny.
You were meant to dance there.

717
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,961
Yes, I guess it was destiny

718
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,255
that we watched a movie together.

719
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,841
She learns very quickly.

720
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,630
I remember losing it in a taxi.

721
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,883
And I remember picking it up at school,
at the parking lot.

722
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,439
How did you know it was mine?

723
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,191
It's not like my ID was in it.

724
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,319
I asked around.

725
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,490
Are you giving me an attitude
after I found your wallet?

726
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,202
Well, I…

727
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,038
Thank you.

728
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,750
That's why I'm buying.

729
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:12,170
But I know you're lying
about your sprained ankle.

730
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,881
You must care a lot
whether or not I'm in pain.

731
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,842
If you're hurt, I'd feel bad.

732
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:20,512
I was worried
that I hurt someone's precious son.

733
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,640
You seem rich.
If you're hurt, see a doctor.

734
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:26,518
Me? What makes me look rich?

735
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,311
Don't you have a mirror?

736
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,523
You're decked out
in designer brands from head to toe.

737
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:34,734
And your watch. Think about your car too.

738
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,194
You're made of money.

739
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,989
Hey, that's very sharp.

740
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,701
Other kids never know
how expensive my stuff is.

741
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,955
-Are you materialistic?
-Materialistic?

742
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,459
Well, that's easy to figure out.

743
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,636
Kids these days might not know.

744
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,689
You're an odd one.

745
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,110
Do you have a dual personality?

746
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:22,657
Or do you keep crying
because your tear duct is broken?

747
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:24,701
What?

748
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,537
What are you saying?

749
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,840
What is his problem?

750
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,967
He's making me uncomfortable.

751
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,768
Well, since you found my wallet,
I'll treat you to something big.

752
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,649
What do you like?

753
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:58,735
You.

754
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,990
I think I do.

755
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,036
I think I like you.

756
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:40,110
You didn't have to walk me home
with your sprained ankle.

757
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:43,363
-I could've come alone.
-I got all better after the movie.

758
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,242
Then I'm sure you'll be fine tomorrow.

759
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:52,455
Although you looked fine today too.

760
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,626
Bye.

761
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,169
Okay.

762
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,608
Make yourself comfortable and sit.

763
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,920
You're in the same department?
What year are you in?

764
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:41,963
I'm a senior.

765
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,090
-So you'll graduate soon.
-Yes, sir.

766
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,843
What did you do after the movie?

767
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:50,555
Sorry? Right. We grabbed a beer.

768
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:52,182
A beer? Literally just one beer?

769
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:55,018
No, sir. I had about four.

770
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,188
She had three, I think.

771
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:00,106
Three? She can drink three beers?

772
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,651
Three small glasses? Or three mugs?

773
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,320
Three mugs.

774
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,906
I see. So she's pretty strong.

775
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:12,160
-What do your parents do?
-Well, they're in education.

776
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,329
And they're…

777
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:17,415
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

778
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,210
Actually,
he's the chairman of our university.

779
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,675
Of Hanguk University?
The one that Jin-ju attends?

780
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:32,680
Yes, sir. But please don't tell her.

781
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,140
Nobody knows.

782
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:38,978
All right. And please don't tell Jin-ju
that I met with you.

783
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,271
Man to man, okay?

784
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,483
-Yes, sir.
-So?

785
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,944
-Do you like her a lot?
-Sorry?

786
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,405
You must like Jin-ju a lot
to watch a movie

787
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,490
and drink four beers with her.

788
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,535
Right. Yes, sir.

789
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:54,619
A bit.

790
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:56,913
No.

791
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,499
A lot, sir.

792
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,074
Hi.

793
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,661
Why are you here?
Don't you have an umbrella?

794
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,872
It wasn't raining when I came.

795
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:41,875
Is there anywhere to get one?

796
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,127
You don't have to. I have one here.

797
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,963
Let's share. Come on in.

798
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,932
Eat this and stop crying.

799
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,976
Why do you always cry?

800
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,228
Like that girl.

801
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:27,003
Why is this umbrella so weak? Goodness.

802
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,451
Just let it go. It served its time.

803
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,623
Right.

804
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:07,126
Then just to the College of Humanities.

805
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:29,691
This little kid is so smooth.

806
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,277
He's getting this old lady excited.

807
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,113
Is he a player?

808
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,991
-Hey.
-Yes?

809
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,744
Could you come a little closer?

810
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,163
See? He is.

811
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,624
If we walk like this, I'll get drenched.

812
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,589
I mean, it's my umbrella.

813
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:57,093
Right. Goodness, I'm sorry.

814
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,481
It'll stop soon, right?

815
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:11,816
Probably.

816
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,612
The poor festival.

817
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,402
EPILOGUE

818
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,779
THE REAL 1999

819
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:58,863
Let me pour you one.

820
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,534
What's your plan after graduation?

821
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:09,624
Anything. I'll do anything
to make sure Jin-ju doesn't starve.

822
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,751
Yes, so what exactly?

823
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,920
What do you want to do? What do you like?

824
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:17,173
What… What I like is Jin-ju.

825
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,550
So whatever Jin-ju likes

826
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:23,388
is what I like too, sir.

827
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:25,515
Don't you have a dream, kid?

828
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:26,933
No, sir. I have a dream.

829
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:31,854
My dream is to have kids with Jin-ju
and live a happy life together.

830
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:35,566
What? Just because you're with me now
doesn't mean you can go out with her.

831
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,403
This is the first round.
Like the application round.

832
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,823
You still have to make
the preliminaries and the finals.

833
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,866
Yes, sir. I won't give up.

834
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,661
I'll do my best and survive to the end.

835
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,248
Stop smiling. You'll grow on me.

836
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:51,958
I'll lose my objectivity.

837
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,961
Yes. I'm sorry, Father.

838
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,423
I'm not your father.

839
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,218
Well, then Father-in-law?

840
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:03,928
Father-in-law?

841
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,723
Well, then…

842
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:07,932
Mister?

843
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,644
Good grief.

844
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:40,798
We don't know when we'll go back,
but you already found a guy?

845
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,425
You were stuck to him.

846
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:43,843
Look who's talking.

847
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,137
He never came to the festival.

848
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,430
What's gotten into him?

849
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,641
Nam-gil, where have you been?

850
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:51,851
Are you hungry?

851
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,019
Hey, Jin-ju.

852
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,105
-What's going on?
-One of the contestants didn't show up.

853
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,774
You're no May Queen.

854
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,525
Pray you don't come in last.

855
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:03,446
College of Humanities, Ma Jin-ju!

856
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,823
Isn't she the girl you're working on?

857
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,201
Make it quick. You may lose your chance.

858
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:12,330
