1
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,962
Yes, him.

2
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,047
YEAR 2017

3
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,923
The student rep from our freshman year.

4
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,217
He used to discipline us like crazy.

5
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,303
Why does he want to see you?

6
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,346
Is he selling insurance?

7
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,474
What? No way.

8
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,019
He always said
how he wanted to be an architect.

9
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,854
He's probably in that field.

10
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,357
Hey, I'm here now.

11
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,526
Okay. I'll call you later.

12
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,458
Hey.

13
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,336
Hey.

14
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,385
What did I tell you?

15
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,596
When someone suddenly calls you,

16
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,891
it's either to sell you insurance
or they're in a pyramid scheme.

17
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,061
Who knew he'd end up like that?

18
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:46,856
Wasn't he all cocky before,
saying he'll become an architect?

19
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,441
Yes, he was a huge show-off.

20
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,401
Hey, it's just life.

21
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,320
We were like him too.

22
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,948
We used to go around
saying we'd become film directors.

23
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,157
Don't you remember?

24
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,289
I begged them to let you be
a part of the production.

25
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:04,791
No mistakes, okay?

26
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,084
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

27
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,128
-We'll do our best.
-I'll do a good job!

28
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:09,879
We'll give it our all.

29
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,340
-We'll do our best!
-We'll do our best!

30
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,092
Hello, ladies. Have some water.

31
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,094
Director, please have some water.

32
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,595
Have some cold water.

33
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,972
Hey, over there.

34
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,015
The sun is setting. Clean this up already!

35
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,725
Yes, I'll do it!

36
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,936
-Take it over there.
-Yes, sir. Hurry.

37
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,689
There were days

38
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,568
when we had nothing,
so we had nothing to lose.

39
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,698
Our sparkling eyes
and desperate dreams were

40
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,909
the only weapons we had
to fight against the world.

41
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,413
Suck it up, man. Let's go.

42
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,632
Can't 100 million won fall from the sky?

43
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,801
You can't do crap with that.

44
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:01,055
There were days when we had no idea

45
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,849
how tough the world was.

46
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,446
How will Hyeon-seok
show his face at school?

47
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,240
He got screwed big time
after trying to play a girl.

48
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,827
She was in the May Queen Pageant, right?
Ma Jin-ju from history.

49
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,496
Forget that.
You know him. He'll make her pay.

50
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,249
He looked rabid when he stormed out.

51
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,918
What if he does something?

52
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,127
He wouldn't.

53
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,151
I wonder if she got home all right.

54
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,587
Why won't he pick up?

55
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,716
What?

56
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,553
Who is she talking to at this hour?

57
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,692
Hello?

58
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,030
Where are you?

59
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,868
You have no fear, do you?

60
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,832
No. I'm the one who has nothing to fear.

61
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,959
What do you think you're doing?

62
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,669
Go away before I scream.

63
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:58,006
Go ahead. Go ahead and scream. Do it.

64
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,717
Scream, damn it!

65
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,432
You ruined everything.

66
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,476
Do you know
how tough it was to stick around

67
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,770
next to an ugly girl like Ye-rim?

68
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,564
I don't know about that,

69
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,234
but I do know
that you're unbelievably pathetic.

70
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,529
Didn't I tell you?

71
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,283
I beat women.

72
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,286
I'll beat you up and go to prison.

73
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,663
I'll go to prison!

74
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,799
Why bother going to prison?

75
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,635
I'll send you up there.

76
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,438
What? Where did she go?

77
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,613
Seriously.

78
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,664
Hi.

79
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,670
Did you really run away?

80
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,298
You're something.

81
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,678
Seriously.

82
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,601
Answer your phone, will you?

83
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,522
Who the heck are you?

84
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,399
I'll get you jerks!

85
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,401
Oh my gosh.

86
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,905
Keep coming at me
if you really want to die.

87
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,281
Darn it!

88
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,081
Stop it. That's enough.

89
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,126
It's okay. I'm sure
he's a precious son to his parents.

90
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,002
What use is beating him?

91
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,172
Why the heck are you doing this to me?

92
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,842
Because I pity you. You're pathetic.

93
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,637
You put on an act
to fool a girl you don't even like.

94
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,974
I pity how you're wasting
your precious youth.

95
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,727
You should be glad that he came.

96
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,521
Otherwise, I would've killed you.

97
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,650
You wicked little twerp.

98
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,153
Let's go.

99
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,743
Also, don't live your life like that,

100
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,037
bullying a poor salesman.

101
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:36,998
What?

102
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,753
I hope my son won't turn out like him.

103
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,009
What are you doing? Let's go.

104
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,052
What?

105
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,472
Okay.

106
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,861
Gosh, I was scared to death.

107
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,821
Why are kids so scary?

108
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,992
I would've been in big trouble
if it hadn't been for you.

109
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,453
What's this?

110
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,830
You were acting tough back there.

111
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,334
I need to show him that I'm not a pushover

112
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,627
to keep him away for good.

113
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,383
Anyway, thank you.

114
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,265
But what brings you here?
This is my neighborhood.

115
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,938
I was taking a walk.
The air felt nice tonight.

116
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,024
A walk? All the way here? This far?

117
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,985
Yes, this neighborhood
is perfect for walks.

118
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,654
Why?

119
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,701
Hey.

120
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,120
I'm asking just in case.

121
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,872
Do you really like me?

122
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,169
I think I've heard that before.

123
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,090
I told you last time
that I think I do like you.

124
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,968
Since when?

125
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,971
You said you didn't like me
when you asked me out.

126
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,848
I didn't back then.

127
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,642
After that.

128
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,478
That's after I came back in time.

129
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,482
So you like older girls.

130
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:31,153
Well, a lot of guys like older girls
when they're in their 20s.

131
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,863
I like you. You.

132
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,907
What are you talking about?

133
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,617
Oh, never mind.

134
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,331
But it's probably better
if you don't like me.

135
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,542
Why not?

136
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:49,130
Of course, I may look
young and pretty at the moment,

137
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,883
but there might be a mom in this body.

138
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,635
What are you talking about?

139
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,059
Wait, are you…

140
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,605
possessed?

141
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,400
-By a mom ghost?
-Hey, come on.

142
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,530
Well,

143
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,575
instead of liking me,

144
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,244
why don't you work for your dream?

145
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,831
You can become
the best history lecturer in Korea.

146
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,959
How did you know my dream?

147
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,628
What?

148
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:30,880
Right.

149
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,175
Your physiognomy.

150
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,053
You have the face of a celebrity lecturer.

151
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,890
I'm sure you could make
about 60 billion won.

152
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,143
Don't turn your back on me
when that happens. Okay?

153
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,853
What are you saying?

154
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,563
You should go.

155
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,190
Thanks. Bye.

156
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,983
-I'm leaving.
-What is she saying?

157
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,320
Hey, how did you know? Hey.

158
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,284
How did she know?

159
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,089
I know you're young,
but you're very reckless.

160
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,175
What? You told me
to leave home and tell them,

161
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,635
"I'm gone with the wind."

162
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,053
That's…

163
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,808
I said that as a joke.
You can't take that seriously.

164
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,893
It was a joke. A funny remark.

165
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,647
You have to be careful
about what you do in front of kids.

166
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,950
Hey, you should pick up. They'll worry.

167
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,660
My parents never worry.

168
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,538
They'll just scream at me.

169
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,209
You should talk to them.

170
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,544
Tell them you're an adult,

171
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:55,047
so you want to decide
whether or not to compete in a contest.

172
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,135
Would I have left home
if they were that reasonable?

173
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,011
But you can't leave without a plan.

174
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,013
Where will you go now?

175
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,517
Why? Do you think I have nowhere to go?

176
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,728
Goodness. My goodness.

177
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,158
I don't want to!

178
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,828
You can't pack your stuff
and come out to see a guy.

179
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,663
The world is a scary place.

180
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,752
If I go home, I'll have to live
the rest of my life as my parents' puppet.

181
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,670
No puppet rebels like you.

182
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,548
-What?
-Regardless, this isn't right.

183
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,550
Get permission first.

184
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,219
Then it wouldn't be running way. No.

185
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,847
Why you… This girl.

186
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,142
My gosh, you're more stubborn
than you seem.

187
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,393
Hey!

188
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,562
Every parent worries about their kids.

189
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,480
Seo-yeong!

190
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,363
You rascal!

191
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,491
Dad.

192
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,458
Well… So…

193
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,376
Nice to meet…

194
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,217
you, sir.

195
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,641
Have you eaten?

196
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:34,146
Well, she just had something.
It wasn't a proper meal though.

197
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,738
Come with me.

198
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,659
No, I'm not going home.

199
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,828
Why you…

200
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,042
There are times
when I want to perform on stage,

201
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,587
but at times,
I don't even want to look at it.

202
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,631
Why don't you ever ask how I feel?

203
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,058
I get it, so come home.

204
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,519
Let's talk at home.

205
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,175
Go.

206
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:05,070
Gosh. Kids are a headache
even at that age.

207
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,782
So how old is he?

208
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,368
He doesn't look that much older than me.

209
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,015
-Her boyfriend?
-You?

210
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,436
Says who?

211
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,855
Freeze.

212
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,608
What's wrong with you? You're scaring him.

213
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,318
No, I'm fine.

214
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:48,072
My baby sister,
are you angry at your brothers?

215
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,031
Over a guy?

216
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:53,285
See? There is no use
raising your baby sister with love.

217
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,878
What are you doing?

218
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,172
-Eat up.
-Sorry?

219
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,343
-Eat up.
-Yes, sir. Thank you.

220
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,431
Why did you all come here?

221
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,560
I mean, we couldn't reach our baby sister.

222
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,562
You wouldn't say yes to our family trip.

223
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,524
So why are you in a dorm
when you have a perfectly nice home?

224
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,775
Like you don't know?

225
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,161
Baby Bo-reum, make sure you eat well.

226
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,707
And Jae-u, we'll be seeing you.

227
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,791
See what?

228
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,168
Don't you dare contact him.

229
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,087
-Fine.
-Go.

230
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,965
-Just go.
-Bye.

231
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,717
Goodbye.

232
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,760
Get home safely.

233
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,474
So you have four older brothers.

234
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,436
Gosh, you have a huge family.

235
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,697
-What?
-Press zero.

236
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,244
POUTY JAE-U

237
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,123
One isn't the first number. Zero is.

238
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,042
You're number zero.

239
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,003
It means I like you so much
that I can't put a number on you.

240
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,839
Number zero?

241
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,133
Oh, number zero?

242
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,719
That's really good, then.

243
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,309
But why?

244
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,770
Because I'm easy?

245
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,022
Yes, because you're easy.

246
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,027
I'm not that easy, you know.

247
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,112
I like people who are easy to figure out.

248
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,823
Someone I can tell
if they're annoyed, angry, or happy.

249
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,701
Someone who's predictable
around the clock.

250
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,578
I like someone like that.

251
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,829
Someone like you.

252
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,712
Gosh, so that was what you meant.

253
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:14,051
Not like physically easy,
like easy to grope and kiss?

254
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,386
It's really hard for me to kiss you too.

255
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,349
I may do it often, but I think
at least ten times before I do it.

256
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,059
What? Ten times?

257
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,783
Hey, you.

258
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:41,912
Wait.

259
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,164
Sorry.

260
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,751
I only thought about it five times.

261
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,927
I thought about it

262
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,762
ten times.

263
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,609
Time for school.

264
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,585
What's wrong?

265
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,005
She has been quite odd lately.

266
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,631
She was always odd.

267
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:38,260
Goodness, you have
zero interest in your sister.

268
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,934
What's with you now? Is something wrong?

269
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,019
What?

270
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,022
Well, so…

271
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,025
Never mind.

272
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,610
What is it?

273
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,908
What do you think
about Jin-ju marrying into a rich family?

274
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,453
Such as the family
of a chairman of a university.

275
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,625
I should work harder and make more money.

276
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,460
Her mother-in-law will pick on her

277
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,504
and put her down
because our family has no money.

278
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,716
There you go again,
worrying about nothing.

279
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,928
Rich mothers-in-law aren't
the only ones who are abusive.

280
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,263
Poor fathers-in-law can be even scarier.

281
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,113
Why are you wasting water like this?

282
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,367
You're splashing more water
than the water you actually use.

283
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,035
Everything is money.

284
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:48,497
You're flushing money down the drain.

285
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:53,377
You need to save water.
That's how we can afford to eat.

286
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,464
My gosh. Will my saving water
put food on the table?

287
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,508
You cheapskate old man!

288
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,095
What? A cheapskate?

289
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,346
Yes, you cheapskate!

290
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,266
A cheap… My goodness.

291
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,143
I'm getting a stiff neck. Goodness.

292
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:14,231
Mom, that's a bit harsh.
How could you call him a cheapskate?

293
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,234
Right? Don't you think she was too much?

294
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,695
He goes out and works hard
to make a living for us.

295
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,863
Don't call him a cheapskate.

296
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,993
How dare you call me a cheapskate?

297
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,745
It's not like
he doesn't want to make a lot.

298
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,580
He doesn't want to be cheap.

299
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,250
Yes. What?

300
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,044
I know his salary is pathetic, but still.

301
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,754
You shouldn't be so harsh, Mom.

302
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,258
Do you know how hard he has to work
to make that pathetic salary?

303
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,928
Don't be so harsh, Mom.
You make me sad too. I'm going to school.

304
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,263
Goodness.

305
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,265
You punk.

306
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,350
What? Pathetic salary?

307
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,478
Are you happy
that your dad gets paid a pathetic salary?

308
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,523
Then you go out
and make something pathetic too.

309
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,775
I'm trying to help you out!

310
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,278
-You punk.
-What's wrong with you?

311
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,821
Hey, you!

312
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,240
Tell me the truth.

313
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,327
I know something is going on with you.

314
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,246
What? Nothing is going on.

315
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,082
Nothing, my foot. You can't fool me.

316
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,712
Who's Seo-jin?

317
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,925
Mom, how did you…

318
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,635
Who is this guy named Seo-jin

319
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,055
that you cry over him every single night?

320
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,311
Seo-jin.

321
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,149
Seo-jin.

322
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,568
Seo-jin.

323
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:50,160
I assumed the guy you like rejected you
and wanted to pretend I didn't know,

324
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,995
but this has gone on for days.

325
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,247
So who is this Seo-jin?

326
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,251
See? Look at you.

327
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,755
How much did you like him?

328
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,387
-Hey, Mom.
-Yes? Tell me.

329
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,102
Let's go to a bathhouse.
I'll scrub your back.

330
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,396
What?

331
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,650
Let's go.

332
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,365
LECTURE, A SUCCESSFUL LIFE ON CAMPUS

333
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,829
I wasn't supposed to tell you,

334
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,665
but I thought you should know.

335
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,794
She's taking a leave of absence?

336
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,089
Yes. She didn't share any details.

337
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,299
She just said
it was due to family matters.

338
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,593
I see.

339
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,310
What happened, Seol?
I can't even reach you.

340
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,813
So? What happened?

341
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,232
I'll compete in this next contest,

342
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,526
but I can rest after that.

343
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,449
What a relief.
See? You needed to talk to them.

344
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,284
How could they know you hated it?

345
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,077
It's their first time raising you.

346
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,707
I swear,
you totally sound like an old man.

347
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,876
Come on, don't call me an old man.

348
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,755
Look at my face and how fit I am.
What about me is like an old man?

349
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,757
There you go again.

350
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,217
You mean this?

351
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,138
What a relief.

352
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,016
I thought maybe
I shouldn't have come back.

353
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,059
That I turned you into a delinquent.

354
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,228
Did you go somewhere?

355
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,274
No, I'm just saying I was worried.

356
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,400
You…

357
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,236
don't like me, do you?

358
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,155
What?

359
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,408
What are you talking about?

360
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,077
I thought you liked me.

361
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,623
But I felt something odd yesterday.

362
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:05,003
My dad and I had a long talk face-to-face,

363
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,631
then I saw you in my dad's eyes.

364
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,053
What do you mean?

365
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:18,183
When someone likes someone,
their eyes are filled with love.

366
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,854
But the look in your eyes were
the same as the look in my dad's eyes.

367
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,525
You even say the same things too.

368
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,864
That was because you worried me.

369
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,199
Anyway.

370
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,411
If you really do like me,

371
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,997
I'm sure you regretted
sending me home last night.

372
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,626
You're still out of your mind.

373
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,391
-That's so cool.
-Stop.

374
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,394
Boys, Napoleon once said this.

375
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,313
"If you reach your dream,
you become someone else's dream."

376
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,399
You don't dream just to dream.

377
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,442
You're supposed to make it come true.

378
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,946
So what's this?

379
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,156
This? This one? It's a pool.

380
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,536
-Hey, what's going on?
-Did you make it yourself?

381
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:23,164
The student rep is showing off
his model for a contest.

382
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,249
Write it down.

383
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,252
He should study architecture,
not civil engineering.

384
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:30,338
It's not like we want to be here.
It's because of our grades.

385
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,972
Hey, is his screw loose?
What's wrong with him?

386
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:42,142
No idea,
he called Bo-reum a witch yesterday,

387
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,395
but today, he's all over his phone,
kissing it and licking it.

388
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,981
I have nothing more to say to you.

389
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,234
Don't fall too deeply in love.

390
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,029
I'll return the reports you wrote

391
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,489
on the first week of class
on your life in 20 years.

392
00:26:56,573 --> 00:27:00,285
Keep it with you,
then read it after 20 years.

393
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,912
Why don't a few of you read them aloud?

394
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,956
"In 20 years, I would have reached

395
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,042
my lifelong dream
of becoming an architect.

396
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,628
I'll be working hard
on environmental-friendly designs

397
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,047
which have never been created
in our country."

398
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:18,136
It sounds
as if you've become an architect already.

399
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,804
I'll make it happen.

400
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,477
LIFE INSURANCE

401
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,936
It's like a savings account,

402
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,981
so you can get everything back
if you don't fall ill.

403
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,232
It's a great plan.

404
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,319
Can you help me out?

405
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,287
Thank you.

406
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,391
"My Life in 20 Years"?

407
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,813
LIFE PLANS, MY LIFE IN 20 YEARS
BY CHOI BAN-DO

408
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,982
"I would've become
the best film director in Korea.

409
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,237
I'll win the Grand Prize
at the Baeksang Arts Awards.

410
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,447
I'll be invited
to the Cannes Film Festival."

411
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,204
I had such big dreams.

412
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,019
Goodness.

413
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,231
What's the rush?
You need to dry your hair well.

414
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,150
-Let me do it.
-I'm fine. Dry yours.

415
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,944
You'll catch a cold
if you go out like this.

416
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,419
Goodness.
You and your daughter are so sweet.

417
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,756
-Are you a college student?
-Yes.

418
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:21,634
My eldest daughter too.
She goes to Hanguk University.

419
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:25,513
Goodness, really?
She goes to Hanguk University too.

420
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,514
Really?

421
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,726
You must've been a good student.

422
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,936
Only smart kids get in.

423
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,732
My daughter studies so hard

424
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,235
to get a scholarship
so I won't have to work as hard.

425
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,739
Goodness, you must be so proud.

426
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:43,907
Good for you.

427
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,201
She keeps me going.

428
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,787
She's the only thing I have to brag about.

429
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,706
Excuse me, I'd like to be scrubbed.

430
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,500
Okay, coming.

431
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,751
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

432
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,546
Mom, here you go.

433
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,383
GEONYEONG MART

434
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,761
Why did you suddenly
want to come for a bath?

435
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,222
You were too embarrassed
to go to bathhouses.

436
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,225
Just because.

437
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,561
When will I get to scrub your back again?

438
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,564
Why? Are you done
after doing it just once?

439
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:18,733
No.

440
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,402
Goodness.

441
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,373
-My gosh.
-This is nice.

442
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,793
Wait here for a moment.

443
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,964
You're so cute.

444
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,759
Goodness, do you like
Mommy's milk that much?

445
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,136
Your cheeks are so chubby.

446
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,722
Oh my goodness. You're so cute.

447
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,724
Is he adorable?

448
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,936
Of course, he is.

449
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:59,274
You know, you were the cutest
when you were that small.

450
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,443
Your cheeks were about to explode
because they were so chubby.

451
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,155
You're so cute. Goodness.

452
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,826
You're so cute. So adorable.

453
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:24,382
You would adore my son a lot.

454
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,385
Goodness.

455
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,221
You're thinking about having a son?
You're not even married.

456
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,892
My goodness. You're still a kid.
You can't have a kid yet.

457
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:39,105
But still, if he takes after you,
he'll be very adorable

458
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,399
with your milky-white skin
and cute features.

459
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,817
Right?

460
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,486
What's wrong?

461
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,286
What's wrong with you?

462
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,706
NURSERY

463
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,125
-Goodness, look.
-Look at that.

464
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,543
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

465
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,211
Look at that boy.

466
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,421
MA JIN-JU

467
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,214
He looks exactly like his dad.

468
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,593
Goodness, he looks just like you.

469
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,846
His nose and lips
look exactly like Ban-do's,

470
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,600
and with his ears and eyes,
he looks exactly like Ban-do as a baby.

471
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,185
He has milky-white skin too.

472
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,519
Right, honey?

473
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,272
Goodness,
Jin-ju's skin is milky-white, not his.

474
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,649
He was always tanned.

475
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,567
No kids are tanned from birth.

476
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,903
He was milky-white when he was this tiny.

477
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,237
He looks just like him.

478
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,530
-Goodness.
-You're so cute.

479
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,075
Gosh, Jin-ju. It must've been tough.

480
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,118
I heard the labor was long.

481
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:38,539
Childbirth is really tough.
You've done well, Jin-ju.

482
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,793
I'm fine. Everyone does it.

483
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,338
Goodness, look at his smile.

484
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,341
-He looks exactly like Ban-do.
-Exactly.

485
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,677
Hey, I'm your grandpa.

486
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,595
I think he knows who we are.

487
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,075
Mom.

488
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,160
Mom.

489
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,624
Mom.

490
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,674
What's wrong? What is it?

491
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,929
It must've been hard.

492
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,223
What?

493
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,394
It must've been hard to give birth to me.

494
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,230
What?

495
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,735
Goodness, what has gotten into you?

496
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,820
Thank you, Mom.

497
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,826
All right. I got it. Stop crying. Hush.

498
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,512
Seol is gone.

499
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,143
All right, I'll be there too.

500
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,813
Hey, Seol suddenly went missing.

501
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:31,277
You're right. She suddenly took
a leave of absence around this time.

502
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,946
-Are you psychic?
-What?

503
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,865
I didn't say she took a leave.

504
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,326
Well, it's obvious.

505
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,330
Jin-ju is going to meddle with this.

506
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,208
Move aside. Move.

507
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,586
-Where are you going?
-To get money.

508
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,463
What?

509
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,257
He said he ripped his dad's wallet.

510
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,676
He must be getting money to save his life.

511
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,136
Where will he get the money?

512
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,388
Where else would he go for money?

513
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,890
His dad's safe.

514
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,267
JIN-JU

515
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,894
She left these on her desk.

516
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,229
Yours and mine.

517
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,605
Hey.

518
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,817
We have this at home.

519
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,778
-I see.
-Why would that be at your place?

520
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,114
-What?
-She made that.

521
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,075
Seriously.

522
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,827
Why is he here?

523
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,579
I had nothing better to do.

524
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,707
She might not want to talk about it,

525
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,417
so should we wait for her to call?

526
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,294
She won't call.

527
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,052
Or she might come back next semester.

528
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,554
She won't return.

529
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,642
-Hey, is this a challenge?
-Hey, stop.

530
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,895
Goodness, come on. Hey, cut it out.

531
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,983
He's right. If we want to find her,
we have to do it now.

532
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,111
She won't come back.
Did you call her home?

533
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,781
Yes, but her mom doesn't know either.

534
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,783
I didn't tell her so she wouldn't worry.

535
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:04,495
You should. It's a big deal.
She took a leave of absence.

536
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,746
Her parents should know.

537
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,249
Of course, you should tell her.

538
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,126
Parents always worry about their kids.

539
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,388
Bo-reum still scares me
although I'm much older.

540
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,348
Her eyes are frightening.

541
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,143
I remember how harsh she was
when she dumped Jae-u.

542
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,020
Hey, watch your mouth.

543
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,022
I will. I'm not a kid.

544
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:32,940
But you know, right?

545
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,194
-Know what?
-I mean, Bo-reum.

546
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,572
She coldly dumped Jae-u out of nowhere.

547
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,449
I'm sure she told you why.

548
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,868
Whatever. It's none of your business.

549
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,538
Anyway, where did Seol go?

550
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,543
Either someone took her money,
or she's training for a pyramid scheme.

551
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,755
These are the main reasons
why people suddenly disappear.

552
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:56,714
Hey.

553
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,467
It was just a joke.

554
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,344
Worrying will change nothing.

555
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,554
You can start looking tomorrow.

556
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,891
You told me not to look for her
when she went missing back then.

557
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:11,062
I was too young.
I thought I was being considerate.

558
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:15,149
And even if I tell you
not to look for her, I know you will.

559
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,902
-What?
-That coaster.

560
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:22,114
The worn-out coaster I always asked you
to throw out. Isn't that it?

561
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,117
Yes, you're right.

562
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:29,664
If you kept it for 18 years, it means
you were that concerned about Seol.

563
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,462
Not using it is one thing.
I can't throw out something a friend made.

564
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,840
Exactly. This time,
make sure you find her.

565
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,303
Gosh, you're way too warm-hearted.

566
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,726
Anyway, hey.

567
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,231
Did you get home safely last night?

568
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,861
Why do you have a phone
if you won't pick up?

569
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,530
You called me?

570
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,116
I didn't see it. Why?

571
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:07,952
Director Park…

572
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,414
Never mind. Forget it.

573
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,708
What about Director Park?

574
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,001
Finish your sentence.

575
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,753
I called when something happened,

576
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,882
but what did I expect?

577
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,593
What do you mean?

578
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,182
I mean you were never there
when I needed you.

579
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,185
Wait, what?

580
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,566
Bye. I'm going in.

581
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,415
I mean you were never there
when I needed you.

582
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,755
Ban-do, please come quickly.

583
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,676
Ban-do, come quickly.

584
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,435
It's your fault.

585
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,606
Because of you,

586
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,151
my mom passed away without seeing me.

587
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,139
It's you, right? That student from before.

588
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,266
The one who helped me there.

589
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:58,729
Hello.

590
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,982
Yes, I am.

591
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,824
If he helps you out again,
just give him a good kick.

592
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,659
That jerk.

593
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,747
-Let me take that.
-Wait.

594
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,919
By any chance, are you

595
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:24,922
Seo-jin?

596
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,093
Sorry?

597
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:31,846
It must be you.

598
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,808
Thank you for your help last time,

599
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,561
I don't like a guy
who makes my daughter cry.

600
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,146
What do you mean?

601
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:45,693
That girl was crying a river every night,
so I thought you were someone amazing.

602
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,905
Anyway, thank you
for your help last time, Goodbye.

603
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,783
He's just so-so. What does she see in him?

604
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,744
It's Choi Ban-do.

605
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,331
My name is…

606
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,339
Choi Ban-do.

607
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,219
So you're not Seo-jin?

608
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,014
No.

609
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,320
Darn it, Seol.

610
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:34,325
So you have a drunken habit too.
It's okay. You can fix it.

611
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,952
-Good luck.
-Where are you going? Hey!

612
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,079
Hey!

613
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,874
You got drunk and did this!

614
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,835
Wait until I catch you.

615
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,777
Look at how careful he is.

616
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,321
But I've been taking money for years.

617
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,114
Obviously, I have one of these.

618
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,617
Man, my dad thinks so little of me.

619
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,289
Hey, what are you doing?

620
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,169
Go. Go away.

621
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,178
I told you to be quiet. Go.

622
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,638
Darn it, go away.

623
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,224
Dad.

624
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,851
Go Dok-jae!

625
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,229
-Dok-jae!
-Wait, Dad.

626
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,398
It's not like that. I'm sorry, sir.

627
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,358
-I'm sorry.
-There's a customer.

628
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,403
-Get back here!
-No. That's not it.

629
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,863
-Come here. Get back here.
-I'm sorry.

630
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,533
Get back here!
I told you to get back here.

631
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,867
I'm sorry, Dad!

632
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,497
Come out! I said come out!

633
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,583
There's no way. I'll die then.

634
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,086
-Dok-jae?
-Oh my gosh.

635
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:12,881
Seol?

636
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,009
Why are you here?

637
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,845
And why are you here?

638
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,265
I raised my kid to be a thief!

639
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:25,477
Okay, you can starve to death in there
or come out and die by my hands!

640
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:29,690
Dad, have you ever seen a man
starve to death in a kitchen?

641
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,027
You rascal. Come on out! Come out!

642
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,280
I see. So this is your restaurant.

643
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,365
-I didn't know.
-Yes, it's ours.

644
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,409
-Good luck, then.
-Okay. Good luck.

645
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,287
Hey. Stop. Where are you going?

646
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,371
Out.

647
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,915
Hey, I'll seriously die
once you open this door.

648
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,919
That's right.
I'm in this mess because of you.

649
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,173
Give me the money for my wallet.

650
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,842
-What?
-"What?"

651
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,554
My wallet you destroyed
when you got drunk.

652
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,806
I mean, my dad's wallet.

653
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,727
You can't run away.

654
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,730
I won't fall for that twice.

655
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,857
You rascal, come out!

656
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:17,029
Goodness, Dad. I found a hostage in here.

657
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,658
You know that if she works after hours,

658
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,618
you'll have to pay her overtime.

659
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,079
Hey, just let him get mad at you.

660
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,538
It's fine.

661
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,958
My jaw got dislocated once
when he hit me a while back.

662
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:35,297
Dad, you can either
pay her a fortune in overtime

663
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,757
or give up and go home.

664
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,302
What a pickle, right?

665
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,304
-Stop it.
-It's fine.

666
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,310
You're taking time off from school? Why?

667
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:52,189
I don't like my major
and there's nothing I want to do.

668
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,316
I'll just make money.

669
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,610
You can make money later.

670
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:00,072
If I start early, I'll make a little more.

671
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,368
The world isn't like that anymore.

672
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,121
You can't catch up with the rich.

673
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:12,668
You really can't tell anyone
that I'm here, okay?

674
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,420
Not even your friends.

675
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,798
Fine.

676
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,301
Once my lips are sealed,
nothing can open them.

677
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,600
-Come here!
-My ear will fall off.

678
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,145
-You won't die.
-Dad! My ear will fall off!

679
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,272
-When will you stop? Come here.
-I love you!

680
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,356
-Come here!
-Dad.

681
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,317
I love you, Dad.
I'll be good to you. Dad, please.

682
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,986
Your only son is dying!

683
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,322
Our financial situation
became a little tough.

684
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,033
Her dad is bedridden
ever since he hurt his back.

685
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,871
She matured early,

686
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:52,040
so I didn't tell her about her dad
because I knew she'd do this.

687
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,920
It looks like
her younger sibling told her recently.

688
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,512
She didn't even let it show.

689
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,723
We had no idea for months.

690
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:12,019
And I had no idea twice.

691
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,353
This is where you are.

692
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,192
You haven't found Seol?

693
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,651
-No.
-What?

694
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,196
Wait, is Seol gone?

695
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,615
Yes. You haven't seen her, right?

696
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,910
I have.

697
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,703
-Really?
-Where?

698
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,207
Over there in Busan.

699
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,835
-What?
-Busan.

700
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,338
That movie, Her, that I like.

701
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,131
Wasn't that what you meant?

702
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,426
You freak. How can you joke right now?

703
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:48,222
Don't look for her. She's not a kid.
I'm sure she's doing well somewhere.

704
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,767
If you disappear without telling anyone,

705
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,602
then we won't look for you.

706
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,271
Her mom reported her missing,

707
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,315
so we should wait.

708
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,570
What? She reported her missing?

709
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:10,786
Hey, Seol!

710
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:13,956
You little brat.

711
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,045
What are you doing here?

712
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,464
You really hurt my feelings.

713
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,675
My gosh.

714
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,053
Have you been well?

715
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,773
During the IMF crisis,

716
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,609
even big companies went bankrupt.

717
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,487
So how could
my dad's small business hold out?

718
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,658
Going to college was a stretch.

719
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,952
My dad is a day laborer

720
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,496
and my mom works at a sauna.

721
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,374
They make like nothing.
How could I go to college?

722
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,169
You know,

723
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,381
when I buy a book for my major,

724
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:08,218
I think, "This is how much
my mom makes for scrubbing a stranger."

725
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,971
When I look at my tuition,

726
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,809
I think, "My dad's back hurts,
but he can't take a day off this month."

727
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,187
That's how I always felt.

728
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,858
You should've told us.
Why did you keep it in?

729
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,028
How could I?
I didn't want to depress you too.

730
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,948
I had fun whenever I was with you,

731
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:33,452
but I wondered
if I should be there laughing.

732
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,748
I felt detached and all alone.

733
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,958
I gave this a lot of thought.

734
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,545
I couldn't just continue to study

735
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,882
while my parents
worked hard day and night.

736
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,217
-Hey.
-That's how it is.

737
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,846
Parents are supposed to work hard

738
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,223
and the child is supposed to
go out and study.

739
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,101
Do you think your mom and dad

740
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,729
will be thrilled that you made money?

741
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:10,030
Why did you become so mature this early?

742
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,240
Do you know

743
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:17,037
how many women my mom scrubs in a day?

744
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,040
Over 20 people.

745
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,711
Her wrists hurt so much
that she can't even lift a spoon.

746
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:26,922
But she goes back out.

747
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,050
How can I return to school?

748
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,136
So what? I enjoy doing it.

749
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,555
Mom.

750
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:42,020
I do it to send my child to school.

751
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,481
Why do you act
like you don't have any parents?

752
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,734
If our business fails,
can we not be parents?

753
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,321
You're still a kid.
Stop acting like a grown-up.

754
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:56,326
We failed in business, not in life.

755
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,246
Until the day you two get married,

756
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,957
your dad and I can get back
on our feet again and again.

757
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,795
How dare a kid act like a grown-up?

758
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,339
It breaks my heart.

759
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,264
Mom.

760
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,852
I'm sorry, Mom.

761
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,898
I'm sorry, Mom.

762
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,402
That's right.

763
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,446
Good job.

764
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,951
I'm glad that went well.

765
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,121
We almost never saw her again.

766
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,623
Exactly.

767
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:47,836
Hey, Jin-ju. How did you get the idea
to ask her mom to come?

768
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,132
She's the one
who should know before everyone else.

769
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,467
Her mom.

770
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:57,512
You're right. She would've been hurt
if she found out later.

771
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,098
You seem like

772
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,976
a grown-up.

773
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:07,522
Actually, you've changed so much
in just a few weeks.

774
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,232
Like an old lady?

775
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,943
-Yes, a little.
-Really?

776
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,489
-It shows?
-So you know.

777
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,121
Goodness, I'm sorry.

778
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,124
My daughter has been odd lately,

779
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,292
so I've become a bit sensitive too.

780
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,961
Do you mean Jin-ju?

781
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,797
That's right. You know her, right?

782
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,759
Anyway, I'm sorry.

783
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,594
Right.

784
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,266
Take these.

785
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,895
Jin-ju loves peaches,
so we always keep some at home.

786
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,397
You can have these.

787
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,947
Eun-ju, then everything but peaches.

788
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:40,574
Okay.

789
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,450
My sister is sending us fruit.

790
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,119
-Really?
-Thank you.

791
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,745
-What?
-Everything but peaches.

792
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:55,547
She's right. She loved peaches.

793
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,931
Why are you sitting there?

794
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:06,975
Hey.

795
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:10,145
Why are these here?
You're allergic to peaches.

796
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,188
My goodness.

797
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:13,857
That little…

798
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,026
Hey, kid.

799
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:17,819
Hey.

800
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,251
CHILDREN'S JURASSIC DINOSAUR MUSEUM

801
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,597
-Seo-jin.
-Mommy.

802
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,307
Do you like dinosaurs or Mommy?

803
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,060
-Mommy.
-Mommy? Do you really?

804
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,978
-Really?
-Daddy?

805
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,356
Kiss the daddy dinosaur. Kiss.

806
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,399
Goodness, great job.

807
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:59,861
You're about to get sucked into the TV.

808
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,281
Do you love dinosaurs that much?

809
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,742
Goodness, you're so excited.

810
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,875
Do you love dinosaurs that much?

811
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,690
Are you Seo-jin?

812
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:40,735
That girl was crying a river every night,
so I thought you were someone amazing.

813
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,237
Seo-jin.

814
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,865
Seo-jin.

815
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:55,745
What?

816
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,039
Why am I here?

817
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,293
Ban-do, wake up!

818
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:12,262
Jin-ju.

819
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,355
What's wrong? Goodness.

820
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,403
We're back,

821
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:30,697
aren't we?

822
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,324
What a relief.

823
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,577
It's such a relief.

824
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,290
It's such a relief.

825
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,425
Hey, thanks so much.

826
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,553
Don't mention it.
I needed a good plan anyway.

827
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:54,929
EPILOGUE

828
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,557
Eat up. This place is really good.

829
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:58,892
Thank you.

830
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,356
Do you stay in touch
with anyone from school?

831
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,274
Of course.

832
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:10,403
You were the student rep,
but you cut ties with everyone.

833
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,114
Civil Engineering is
all about our loyalty.

834
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,325
If you call them, they'll all get a plan.

835
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:18,119
Right? But I was too ashamed
to see the underclassmen,

836
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:21,748
so I couldn't go to reunions
or stay in touch.

837
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,375
Why were you ashamed?

838
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,961
I always went around
saying I'll be an architect.

839
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,088
It's embarrassing

840
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,966
and it kind of kills my pride

841
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,135
to ask for a favor like this.

842
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,430
Well, everyone had a dream in college.

843
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,182
You're right.

844
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:41,726
But you know,

845
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:46,147
once I had a kid,
there was nothing I couldn't do.

846
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,779
My gosh.

847
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,370
A boy or a girl?

848
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,580
-A boy.
-Hey.

849
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,332
-Do you want to see him?
-Show me.

850
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:06,751
Look.

851
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,504
-He's handsome.
-Do you have a kid?

852
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,464
I have a son too. He's three.

853
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,636
-Isn't he cute?
-He's adorable.

854
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:22,600
The youth may have strong weapons
called dreams and passion.

855
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:26,646
But we have something
that brings us victory every time,

856
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,481
no matter what we are up against.

857
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,153
Seo-jin.

858
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,407
I'm your daddy.

859
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,410
Daddy.

860
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:41,744
MA JIN-JU

861
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,455
Look at how cute his feet are.

862
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,207
It's so amazing.

863
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,420
Ban-do, let's be good parents.

864
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,548
Let's keep him safe for life.

865
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,135
Okay.

866
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,556
Seo-jin, Daddy will keep you safe forever.

867
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:05,602
Gosh, this is what you look like, my baby.

868
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:09,439
Mommy really wanted to meet you.

869
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:10,773
My gosh.

870
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:53,691
