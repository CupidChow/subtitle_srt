1
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,837
Seo-jin, what's wrong? Oh no.

2
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,839
Go to Ms. Kim right now.

3
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,174
My wife is onto me.

4
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,384
Jin-ju, isn't this your husband?

5
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,679
-How dare you touch her?
-Let it go quietly, okay?

6
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,348
How could you do this to me?

7
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,892
We're done.

8
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,935
Fine. Let's get divorced!

9
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,357
I woke up this morning and I was 20 again.

10
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,776
Back in 1999.

11
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,946
You couldn't even imagine
what's happening to me right now.

12
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,199
Hello. Nam-gil.

13
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,910
Are you insane?
You didn't like him yesterday,

14
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,370
but you were happy to see him today?

15
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,206
A group blind date? Like a real one?

16
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,248
Why is she here?

17
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,751
You have the physiognomy
of someone who should study.

18
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,878
Did you think
you were the only one who came back?

19
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,379
You're Min Seo-yeong, right?

20
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,091
How did he survive
if he missed Seo-yeong so much?

21
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,098
In movies, you go back in a time machine.

22
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,474
When I wake up?

23
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,977
-What is this?
-I didn't go back.

24
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:58,243
YEAR 2004

25
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,290
Hello?

26
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,251
What?

27
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,170
I can't hear you.
I'll go outside and call you back.

28
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,755
It's nothing.

29
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,715
I was just bored.

30
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,260
Okay, go party.

31
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,888
You clubbing addict.

32
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,810
Let's just eat.

33
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,357
Minus the loan payment.

34
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,610
The maintenance fee.

35
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,780
Right, it's Father's birthday soon.

36
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,158
My entire paycheck isn't enough.

37
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,618
There's never enough money
to cover our expenses.

38
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,124
We used so much. Goodness.

39
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,837
People say there are rights
we get to enjoy at certain times.

40
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,259
Hello, my friends.
So? Is it the two of you?

41
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:57,927
Us too.

42
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,850
In our teens, we have the right to see
the beauty in life, not the wickedness.

43
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,393
Hello, Director.

44
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,896
I'm Choi Ban-do.
I'm new at Korea Pharmaceutical.

45
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,689
Director, could you take a look?

46
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:13,193
I was trained… I mean, I heard
that our drugs contain good ingredients.

47
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,485
Please take a look.

48
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,121
And in our 20s, we have the right

49
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,499
to enjoy our youth,
which sparkles like diamonds.

50
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:36,341
While everyone else
passionately enjoyed their youth,

51
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,763
to us, it felt like spring
that came and went

52
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,431
before we could enjoy it.

53
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,233
SEOUL, 1999

54
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,610
People say our youth fades in an instant

55
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,529
just like the cherry blossoms.

56
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,658
Before your youth passes you by,

57
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,369
just do it, no matter what it may be.

58
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,746
Whether it's partying, traveling,

59
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,706
or passionate love.

60
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,092
Our food's here.

61
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,929
You must like drinking very fast.

62
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,598
I'm like a local train right now.

63
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,267
I'm going very slowly.

64
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,563
You don't have to keep up with me.
Drink at your pace.

65
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,734
I'll pour you one--

66
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,822
-What are you doing?
-Sorry?

67
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:44,701
You never pour a drink for a woman,
nor do you make a woman pour you one.

68
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,370
We pour our own drinks, got it?

69
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,289
Our own.

70
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,064
This song.

71
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,443
I hate it.

72
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,069
What?

73
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,534
He's drunk and won't remember,
so he'll say whatever the heck he wants.

74
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,119
Then he claims he blacked out.

75
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,912
Do they have alcoholic dementia?

76
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,081
Unbelievable. Don't you agree?

77
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,125
Yes, right. You're right.

78
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,127
I find it appalling too.

79
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,421
I hate it when they get drunk
and don't remember.

80
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,839
I don't do that.

81
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,470
How would I know that? We just met.

82
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,935
You should drink slowly. You'll get drunk.

83
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,160
Spicy cartilage.

84
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,079
Buy me some spicy cartilage.

85
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,997
-Come here.
-Spicy cartilage.

86
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,918
-Buy me spicy cartilage.
-Let's go.

87
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,420
Cartilage, please.

88
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,588
I'll kill you.

89
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,757
I'm a heavy drinker.

90
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,385
No, don't go.

91
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,770
MEN'S DORMITORY

92
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:42,985
What's this?

93
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,363
Hey, get up.

94
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,490
Get up.

95
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,951
Why are you sleeping here?

96
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,536
Why am I here?

97
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,005
What is this?

98
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,882
What's wrong?

99
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,135
-My gosh. Mom!
-What is it?

100
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,054
Look, she must have pink eye.
Hey, don't even look at me.

101
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,265
Goodness, you pain in the neck.

102
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,934
It's too early for this crap.

103
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,144
-Goodness.
-What?

104
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,109
What is this? Why is everything the same?

105
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,578
I didn't go back.

106
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,461
What if she gives it to me?
I have a group blind date tomorrow.

107
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,546
And who gets pink eye? How gross.

108
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,052
Hey, don't come near me, okay?

109
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,221
What's with her?

110
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,433
And why did she sleep in your room?

111
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,560
And what happened to her eye?

112
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,813
Even my kids
who lived inside of me don't know me.

113
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,648
How would I know what's in your heads?

114
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,528
TO MY DEAR MOM

115
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,000
Jin-ju, is something going on?

116
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,711
I mean, are you mad at me?

117
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,754
No.

118
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,797
I see. Right.

119
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,757
Do you need

120
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,967
some pocket money?

121
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,135
I don't.

122
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,935
Did she relapse into puberty
over the last two days?

123
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,395
Why is she only cold to me?

124
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,946
This means
I don't know when I will go back.

125
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,157
Maybe never.

126
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,870
Wait, that means
I have to serve in the army twice.

127
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,831
No, that's much better
than being a divorced man.

128
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,001
Whatever.

129
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,277
Man, look at me.

130
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,738
Should this big boy show you how to party?

131
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,038
What did he just ask for?

132
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,625
Mom, Dad, give me all of your savings
and the title to this house.

133
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,878
Give me every single penny
that our family has.

134
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,922
Everything.

135
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,800
How dare you young twerp…

136
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,469
Come on, I'm not a young twerp.

137
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,724
I'll multiply the money several times over
and let you live in luxury.

138
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,351
I'm going to be a good son.

139
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,232
If you invest that money
in Gwanggyo or Pangyo,

140
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,234
you'll be set for life.

141
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,777
How do you know that?

142
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,655
How many times do I have to tell you?
I came from the future.

143
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,158
Goodness, I'm getting a stiff neck.

144
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,785
Oh no, honey. Ban-do, enough already.

145
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,829
-Are you okay?
-Dad.

146
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,748
This is nothing to get stressed about.

147
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,542
You'll get to live
with your head held high.

148
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,463
I'll help you make the kind of money

149
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,883
you'll never save up
with your salary, so bring it.

150
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,926
That damn punk.

151
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,306
Where are you going?

152
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,308
Is it in your room?

153
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,977
Dad, bring everything. Everything we have.

154
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,273
Mom, should we take out a loan?

155
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,775
Are you out of your mind?

156
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,445
Hey, were you trained
by a professional scammer?

157
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:58,074
Just you wait.
You'll see what great things I do.

158
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,284
Like hell.

159
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,287
-Our lives will be hell.
-You punk.

160
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,000
I may bring home a small paycheck,

161
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,003
but did I ever make you starve
or stop you from going to school?

162
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,964
-No, Dad. Wait.
-Goodness, honey!

163
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,050
You punk. Get over here.

164
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,552
How dare you ask for our family's savings?

165
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,471
You ungrateful bastard!

166
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,806
Have some faith in me.

167
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,726
I can't believe I cooked for your mom
after she gave birth to you.

168
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,728
And I ate it all.

169
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,814
Stop cursing my birth and trust me.

170
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,607
-Trust what?
-Goodness, stop.

171
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,776
Trust you? You punk.

172
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,528
Trust you? You?

173
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,578
Let me count it.

174
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,418
He sold everything he cherished?

175
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,837
He's going to get into huge trouble.

176
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,006
Come on, Dad. I think he already did.

177
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,973
I feel as light as a feather
now that I'm young again.

178
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,599
Hey.

179
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,187
All right. Ready, go!

180
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,702
Excuse me. Stop! Please stop the bus.

181
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,501
All right! I win!

182
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,796
I'll keep running to school. Go!

183
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,214
Hey, Ban-do!

184
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,592
I win!

185
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,604
I need to meet with Ban-do first.

186
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,235
You can't pay
with a credit card on a taxi.

187
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,364
I paid with this yesterday.
Why can't I use it?

188
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,533
There are no taxis
that accept credit cards.

189
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,951
This isn't a department store.

190
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,079
Young lady, is this part of your scheme?
To avoid paying?

191
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,709
-Give me cash.
-Wait, I really paid with this yesterday.

192
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,795
Fine.

193
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,882
My wallet… Goodness, where's my wallet?

194
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,648
Why you…

195
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,150
One second.

196
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,362
I don't have any cash on me.
What do I do now? Wait.

197
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,656
Oh, I do have some.

198
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,679
-He's so cool.
-It's Nam-gil. My gosh.

199
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,931
-He looks so cool.
-He's so fine.

200
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,474
He's really hot.

201
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,309
I get it now.

202
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,104
He just let me go
knowing that I left my wallet.

203
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,898
If I find that taxi driver, I'll…

204
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,442
What is this?

205
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,739
I'll try to convince Mom
to buy you a cell phone.

206
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,826
Whatever.

207
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,872
Anyway, where's Ban-do?

208
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,339
Gosh, darn it.

209
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,927
Salute.

210
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,017
Hello.

211
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,395
Nam-gil.

212
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,481
Are you here for a lecture?

213
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,908
Why did I see him first thing
in the morning? I feel so bad.

214
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,952
I turned him down brutally,
then greeted him happily the next day.

215
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,871
He probably thinks I'm a psycho.

216
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,291
Goodness,
what is wrong with you, old lady?

217
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,709
-What are you doing?
-My gosh.

218
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,670
I see.

219
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,508
I guess you're human after all.
You actually do have a conscience.

220
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,386
I guess you're not the girl
from the future today.

221
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,891
Go away. What if he sees us?

222
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,142
What are you all doing?

223
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,313
Hey, guys. It's me from yesterday.

224
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,649
Hey. It's Go Dok.

225
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,775
This is Jae-u.

226
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,779
But don't girls
usually chat in the restroom?

227
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,824
Why are you girls chatting
next to a garbage can?

228
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,078
-Go. Just go.
-What?

229
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,174
-You may go.
-Salute.

230
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,308
Darn it.

231
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,897
What's with your outfit?

232
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,609
Are you Bruce Lee?

233
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,112
It's our uniform.

234
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,782
-The color of chicks.
-Chicks?

235
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,951
Clueless, helpless, and icky?

236
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,911
Hey, you're very quick.

237
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,330
And you got beaten up yesterday, right?

238
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,627
And you're psychic.

239
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,963
-I saw you.
-You should've stopped her, then.

240
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,717
Why should I? We'll get going.

241
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,634
Let's go.

242
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,306
Right, I need to see you later.

243
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,767
Me?

244
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,478
Why me?

245
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:04,982
Hey.

246
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,984
Where's Ban-do?

247
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:28,005
You have to hand it to Seo-yeong.
Your fanboys are here again.

248
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,674
She's looking over at us.

249
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,053
That yellow one didn't come
yesterday and today.

250
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,514
That civil engineering guy
who steals a look and runs away?

251
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,645
There he is. He's here.

252
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,022
Where?

253
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,943
I'll do it today for sure.

254
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,927
She saw you. Why did you just hide?

255
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,471
My gosh, come on.

256
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,223
Hey, here he comes.

257
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,547
As expected,
Seo-yeong is as beautiful as ever.

258
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,633
She's like a goddess.

259
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,976
Even if you go back in time,
there's no way you could get her.

260
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,477
If I go back, I'd date her.

261
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,271
Why would I date someone like Jin-ju?

262
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,733
Yes.

263
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,612
I failed myself back then,

264
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,030
but it's different now.

265
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,660
Seo-yeong, the yellow guy is here.

266
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,122
He's not wearing the yellow uniform today.

267
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,540
He's coming.

268
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,752
Hi.

269
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,588
Hey.

270
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,717
Sorry for flustering you yesterday.
I was just happy to see you.

271
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,013
I'm Choi Ban-do of civil engineering.

272
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,389
One second.

273
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,062
You're good.

274
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,523
Oh, thanks.

275
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,859
Right. Here.

276
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,153
Here.

277
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,447
It's for all of you.

278
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:01,867
See you around.

279
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,081
Right.

280
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,629
May I have your number?

281
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,426
Next time, I'd like to say hi
as someone you know.

282
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,099
Stop lying.

283
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,395
Goodness, you haven't said
a word to her for months.

284
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,648
-He's totally lying.
-Give it to me.

285
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,777
Yes, try calling it now.

286
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,488
You didn't know we'd do that. What now?

287
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,740
-Hello? Who's this?
-Serves you right.

288
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,116
-Hey.
-What?

289
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,451
It's really her.

290
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,747
Hey, this is dope.

291
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,333
-Wait, hey. Look.
-What?

292
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,711
Really? You really got her number?

293
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,673
You, the guy who stutters around her,

294
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,716
actually talked to her and got her number?

295
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,426
Why are you stuttering?

296
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,136
You think I used sign language?

297
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,305
I'm not the old me anymore.

298
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,057
Not only do I have the expertise

299
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,229
of a middle-aged man, but I also have
this Iron Man armor called youth.

300
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,232
What the heck are you saying?
What man's what armor?

301
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,443
Fine, then. Okay.
Did you tell her you like her?

302
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,405
Yes, that's right. Did you?

303
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,825
Why would I tell her
that I like her out of nowhere?

304
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:28,078
There's a process in relationships too.

305
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,579
There are steps to it.

306
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,640
Dating? Do you think Seo-yeong is crazy?
Why would she date you?

307
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,144
If everyone who likes her lines up,
it would make ten laps around the field.

308
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,104
Yes, tell her you like her and end it.

309
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,690
What's with this weird logic?

310
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,444
If I'm not going to date her,
why would I tell her that?

311
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:04,197
You only tell a girl that you like her
if there's a chance of getting together.

312
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,074
You dating eunuchs.

313
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,705
What? Eunuchs?

314
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,500
Hey, have you ever seen me in the morning?

315
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,626
When my boy is angry?

316
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,587
Shut up, you idiot. You're embarrassing.

317
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,340
He never saw it.

318
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,550
I'm getting a stiff neck.

319
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,804
Why do I talk to these young kids?
I'll just stop talking.

320
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,681
I'm tired from laughing so hard.

321
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,312
It's so bitter.

322
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,023
Why did Mom get me
something even more bitter?

323
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,816
Darn it, Mom. I hate you.

324
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,818
Hey, wait.

325
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,280
Why do you keep throwing this out?
It's very precious.

326
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,782
Give it to me. I'll have it.

327
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,284
You have no appreciation.

328
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,998
Hey, that girl, Ma Jin-ju.
She's looking for you.

329
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,666
She is? Why?

330
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,002
Let her be.

331
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,214
She's already trying
to complain about what I said.

332
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,717
She had a nasty temper
even when she was young.

333
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,513
-We got here on time.
-Let's sit.

334
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,935
Hey!

335
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:25,779
Hey.

336
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,240
We need to talk. Come here.

337
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,952
Gosh, the class is about to begin.

338
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,287
Hey, get ready. Open your book.

339
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,581
Come out. I need to talk to you.

340
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,460
Do you have
something to say to me? I don't.

341
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,716
-Hey.
-Let's get started. Please take a seat.

342
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,470
I'll see you later.

343
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,191
What happened yesterday?

344
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,776
We had a friendly talk earlier…

345
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,488
My gosh, she's scary. She's glaring at us.

346
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,658
Don't mind her.

347
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,413
Maybe she has
that anger management thing you mentioned.

348
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,664
What's that?

349
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,292
You know, when people
can't control themselves.

350
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,086
Don't get involved with me again
and ruin your life.

351
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:24,713
It's this thing.

352
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,048
Write down the things

353
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:31,344
about a person you wish to observe here.

354
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,139
What is that person thinking?

355
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,307
What's on their mind?

356
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,267
And of course, it'll be anonymous.

357
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,314
OBSERVATION OF:

358
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:54,326
OBSERVATION OF: CHOI BAN-DO

359
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:58,580
Did you all receive
your classmates' anonymous analysis?

360
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,123
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

361
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,958
The similarities you see there

362
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,045
tell you how other people see you.

363
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,004
How do you feel?

364
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,381
PARK WAN-KYU, DANDRUFF, GROSS

365
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,300
You're no rocker. Dandruff.

366
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,927
Park Wan-kyu. A wig.

367
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,846
Shave your head off and serve in the army.

368
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,099
Goodness, he must be in a huge shock.

369
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,818
Poop. Pathetic salary. Wuss.

370
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,947
Cheapskate.

371
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,951
Cheapskate.

372
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,203
Cheapskate!

373
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,181
-What?
-We need to talk.

374
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,309
Whatever. I'll be late for my next class.

375
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,272
We have to talk.

376
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,482
Do you have something to say? I don't.

377
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,736
You little…

378
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,072
-Follow me.
-That hurts. Let go.

379
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,284
Hey, what's with them?

380
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,954
Are they crazy in love or something?

381
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,038
What's going on?

382
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,374
No idea.

383
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,757
You had me completely fooled.

384
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,388
Going to Cannes?
You're such a good actress.

385
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:39,806
You should go into acting.

386
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,309
-Should I?
-You little…

387
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,646
Forget it.
When did you figure out that I was me?

388
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,690
Did you ignore me to live a new life?

389
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,693
You're unbelievably frightening.

390
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,362
Give me a freaking break.
That's what I want to say.

391
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,157
What? I should study? Be rich and single?

392
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,575
I didn't ruin your life,

393
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:02,162
but you completely ruined mine,
you cheapskate.

394
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,915
My gosh, you're scary. You're so scary.

395
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,460
It's frightening to have you
nag at me with this face.

396
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,920
My goodness.

397
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,674
-What are you doing?
-Don't you get it?

398
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,844
I'm comforting myself
for living with a scary woman.

399
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,182
-You're such a loser.
-I'm a loser. You didn't know?

400
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,267
What? Have you never seen a loser before?

401
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,187
Forget it. So what's going on?

402
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,605
Why are we here?

403
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:30,857
How would I know?

404
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,362
I thought I'd be back once I woke up.

405
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:38,531
I figured it was just one miraculous day.
But we didn't go back.

406
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,035
That means we might be here for good.

407
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:43,953
For good.

408
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,500
-Then I'd be grateful.
-What?

409
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,293
It's like winning the lottery.

410
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,421
Think about it.
I woke up one morning and I was 20 again.

411
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,965
I'm so grateful.

412
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,678
Even if we go back, we'll just be divorced

413
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,970
and we'll be old.

414
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,639
Why would you want to go back?

415
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,433
-I didn't say I wanted to.
-Exactly.

416
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,604
So now that I'm here,
I'm going to enjoy my life.

417
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,898
Let's each live a new life.

418
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,609
Neither of us
wants to get involved with each other.

419
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,862
Of course, not. My sentiments exactly.

420
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,365
Exactly. Okay.

421
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,201
Goodbye, comrade.

422
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,870
Fine. Goodbye.

423
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,041
Goodness.

424
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,751
You can do this.

425
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,556
What is this? This means
we came back in time together.

426
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,015
But why?

427
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,355
Was that too harsh?

428
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,442
I want a divorce. We're unhappy.

429
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,902
I'm miserable.

430
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,863
Whatever.

431
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,073
This is for the better. You were unhappy.

432
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,705
Now that we're here,
I'm going to enjoy my life.

433
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,374
Let's each live a new life.

434
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,379
I would do anything to be young again.

435
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,967
It may sound like I'm nagging,

436
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,594
but if I were your age,

437
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,804
I wouldn't hold back. I'd play

438
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,389
and do everything I want.

439
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:31,478
You'll never have your youth again.

440
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:35,398
Youth won't wait for you.

441
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:41,070
Now, each of you,
come up with a bucket list.

442
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:57,670
BUCKET LIST

443
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:05,637
Hey. Come on. Let's hang out.

444
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,473
Why are we here? We don't have much time.

445
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,433
We are hanging out.

446
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,102
No one has as much free time as we do.

447
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,562
What's wrong?

448
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:20,610
I meant that we should go out
and do something.

449
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,572
I'm exhausted.
I had classes since the morning.

450
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,450
You young punks.

451
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,285
Why are you tired?

452
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,412
Do you think
you'll always have that energy?

453
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,373
Fine.

454
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,917
So what? What do you want to do? Tell me.

455
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,337
What do kids these days do for fun?

456
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,881
What's with these word choices?

457
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,508
Are you Seol's mom?

458
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:48,012
Ma'am, kids these days
drink and dance for fun.

459
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,722
It's called partying.

460
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,516
We hang out at nightclubs.

461
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,017
At nightclubs?

462
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,353
I want to go too.

463
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,065
What? You want to go to a nightclub?

464
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:02,527
Yes, that nightclub you're always at.

465
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,321
I've only been there twice.

466
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,073
I'm not an addict.

467
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,202
The Jin-ju who refused
to go clubbing even once

468
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,371
wants to break out of her shell.

469
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,666
In that case, why don't we…

470
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,627
go party?

471
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,511
WOMEN'S DORMITORY

472
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:01,044
I said we shouldn't wear such high heels.

473
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,756
I forgot about the hill.

474
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,634
Let's go.

475
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,148
Hey, wait. Hey!

476
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,066
-Oh no.
-Oh no.

477
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,152
Hey, move! You'll be hurt!

478
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,154
No, move aside!

479
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,489
Move!

480
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,200
-Oh no.
-Move aside!

481
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,621
-Oh no.
-You'll get hurt!

482
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,206
Oh no.

483
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,667
You over there, move aside!
You'll get hurt!

484
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,377
Move aside!

485
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,077
If you've stopped, get off of me.

486
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,204
I must smell bad.

487
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:27,922
Right.

488
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,634
I've never worn such high heels before.

489
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,053
It's very steep, isn't it?

490
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,431
Anyway, you don't smell at all.

491
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,894
What's wrong with my life?

492
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,314
I'm sorry!

493
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,359
I'm sorry!

494
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,070
What on earth is wrong with her?

495
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:55,908
Gosh, why did you have to fall
into his arms?

496
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,828
Seriously.

497
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,707
I'm not just an idiot, I'm a nuisance.

498
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,750
Goodness.

499
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,839
Wasn't that an accident?

500
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,468
Let's go stand there starting tomorrow.

501
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,681
That's a wonderful idea.

502
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,408
He's really hot.

503
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,332
I can't believe I came to a nightclub
with you. What got into you?

504
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,585
If I don't do it now, when would I?

505
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,588
You're right. When would you?

506
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,549
You're supposed to live
as if it's your last day on earth.

507
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,928
Hey, Seol. Lose those glasses.
You look much prettier.

508
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,097
Put on some makeup.

509
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,016
I did.

510
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,894
You know, you'll end up
hanging your heads in shame.

511
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,229
What?

512
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:07,772
At our makeup?

513
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,441
Nonsense.

514
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,904
Why did we go around looking like this?

515
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,156
Why was this makeup in style back then?

516
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,952
Tell me about it.

517
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,412
All my pictures from back then
look ridiculous.

518
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,791
How did I look older when I was 20?

519
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,796
I totally hang my head in shame.

520
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,065
Did you call for me?

521
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,862
Hey, put it down.
You use it to call the waiter.

522
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,613
Are you trying
to tell everyone you're new?

523
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,116
Oh, is this your first time?

524
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,201
You should come out and meet guys, then.

525
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,203
Meet guys?

526
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,580
Hey, let's go.

527
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,540
I haven't seen such an anxious girl.

528
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,917
Sounds great. Let's go. Okay.

529
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,043
Come with me.

530
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,463
I just came to dance today.

531
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:18,092
No one comes to a club just to dance.
Don't be so prude.

532
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,597
Come this way. Over here.

533
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,016
Over here.

534
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,643
Yes, I'm still at the library.

535
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,438
I'm not a doctor
just because I'm in medical school.

536
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,733
I should study a little more
while other people are sleeping.

537
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,861
Don't worry about me,
and go to sleep, my princess.

538
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,322
Okay. Goodnight. Bye.

539
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,248
BEST NIGHTCLUB IN KOREA, JULIANA

540
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,255
Is your princess asleep?

541
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,466
Man, that girl won't go to sleep.

542
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,343
She's like the girl in Misery.

543
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,429
So? Any pretty girls?

544
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,765
Please make way. Over here.

545
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,183
-Here.
-What about her?

546
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,102
She looks tough. She's totally my type.

547
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,564
Girls like her don't give it up easily.

548
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,608
Get a girl you can get in bed with.

549
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,736
Be careful. Watch your step. This way.

550
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,988
Over here. Be careful.

551
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,792
Man, I haven't been to a club in forever.

552
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,544
Hey, think about how old we are.

553
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,214
Our life has been
way too G-rated until this day.

554
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,425
Let's notch up the ratings tonight.

555
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,221
We're partying rated R tonight. Okay?

556
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,641
So why don't we order
a bottle of liquor too?

557
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,310
-Hey, that's expensive.
-Right?

558
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,355
Hey. Just order it.

559
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,732
Your boy here has money. Order it.

560
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:00,069
You need to order liquor
while you're here. Order it!

561
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,616
Okay, we're partying tonight.

562
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,411
Right, don't give it to just anybody.

563
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,870
If you like her, hard liquor.

564
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,373
If you don't, give her beer. Don't forget.

565
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,417
-Right, Jae-u.
-Yes?

566
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,462
I'm telling you not to give
expensive liquor to ugly girls, okay?

567
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,881
Okay, why are you pestering me?

568
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,433
My gosh. Hey.

569
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,647
I want some liquor.

570
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,026
Beer makes me full.

571
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,612
No, wait.

572
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,377
What's your major?

573
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,630
-Civil engineering.
-What's that?

574
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,507
We use natural resources

575
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,260
to plan, design, and construct buildings,

576
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,803
then maintain those buildings.

577
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,514
In a nutshell,
I'm studying this to become an expert

578
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,017
who knows the theories
yet has practical experience.

579
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,687
I started studying this
because my father was a carpenter.

580
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,231
He never wanted to be a carpenter,

581
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,233
but he wanted to do…

582
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,906
I have another one.

583
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,574
What do you call a pig thief?

584
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,659
-A pig thief?
-A pig thief?

585
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,244
A hamburglar.

586
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,414
A hamburglar?

587
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,209
What kind of work do pigs do after school?

588
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,585
Hamwork.

589
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,755
-Gosh.
-He's hilarious. He's so funny.

590
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,299
That's all.

591
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:47,843
Let's go.

592
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,473
It's all right.
It's not like we come here often.

593
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,231
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

594
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,699
-How old are you?
-Thirty-eight…

595
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,247
How old do I look?

596
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,000
I doubt you're a teenager, so 20?

597
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,550
You're like a baby. So cute.

598
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,010
I'm 26 years old. That means I'm older.

599
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,388
I guess so.

600
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,684
You. You haven't met her before.
Why are you getting all casual?

601
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,603
What? I'm sorry if I offended you.

602
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,275
Goodness, no. It's fine.

603
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,777
It's all right. You can speak casually

604
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,446
with me.

605
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,158
Don't do that. He's cute.

606
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:56,036
Man, you're very haughty.
You're just my type.

607
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,330
If you're 20, I doubt you can drink much.

608
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,668
The more you drink, the better you'll get.

609
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,129
Here.

610
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,933
Hey, let's go. It's techno.

611
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,313
Can we just hang out here?

612
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,484
-Just come. Let's go.
-Let's go.

613
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,785
PARK HYEON-SEOK

614
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,205
See you around.

615
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,583
Okay.

616
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,715
-Hey.
-Hey.

617
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,925
Hey.

618
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,887
Darn it.

619
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,525
Hey.

620
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,445
Unbelievable. You came to a nightclub?

621
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,156
You'll hurt your knees, old lady.

622
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,619
You said you'd live a new life,
and it seems like you're loving it.

623
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:42,953
How did you hold back?

624
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,080
Right? How did I hold back all that time?

625
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:48,375
I need to be here to meet a girl
and start a new life.

626
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,378
Do you think guys will look at you
if you dress like this?

627
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,213
Wake up, old lady.

628
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,674
That little…

629
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,220
Jerk.

630
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,106
-Oh no.
-My gosh.

631
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,942
You over there, move aside!

632
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,795
Is there something on the gate?
What are you staring at?

633
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,338
No, it's nothing.

634
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,968
Hey, have you ever hugged someone?

635
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,553
What? Mugged someone?

636
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,473
No, a girl…

637
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:48,310
Never mind. Forget it. Let's go.

638
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,729
What was that?

639
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,986
What happened between you and Jin-ju?

640
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,655
She flat out refused to come.

641
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,740
I wonder. Is it because of you?

642
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,117
She seems to despise you.

643
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,661
That's what I want too.

644
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:13,711
Man, I shouldn't be drinking with Bo-reum.

645
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,380
Okay. I won't mess with her.

646
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,466
Hey, Purple.

647
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,678
You don't drink much?

648
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,849
Well, I guess it helps
when girls can't drink too much.

649
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,851
It's odd when girls are better drinkers.

650
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:31,437
It doesn't look good, am I right?

651
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:32,855
Why? What?

652
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,858
-Stop it.
-Why? Do you agree?

653
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:44,116
I was having so much fun.
Why did he show up and ruin everything?

654
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,208
Ta-da.

655
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:57,129
Hey, Jin-ju. You're a popular girl.

656
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,424
Goodness.

657
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,430
-Come and meet the guys once.
-No, thanks.

658
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,724
-Just once.
-I don't want to.

659
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,395
Over here.

660
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,064
Over here. I'll go.

661
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,913
Hey, okay. You win. I'm done.

662
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,625
-Feel free to challenge me.
-You're the best.

663
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,419
But next time, it won't end with this.

664
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,758
What was that? Did you just laugh?

665
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,762
What? Nothing. You were cute.

666
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,432
I can't believe my luck today.

667
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,392
Are you challenging me too?

668
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,355
No. No way.
Please don't take it the wrong way.

669
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,315
I know you're a good drinker.

670
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:07,199
I asked to see you later,
and we meet again here.

671
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,410
You.

672
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:13,914
Me?

673
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:15,833
Do you remember yesterday?

674
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,129
-You'd better answer this right.
-Yes.

675
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:26,009
Well, I think I do, probably.

676
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,428
Probably?

677
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,347
You said you remember.

678
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,307
Well…

679
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,936
Then keep your promise. Okay?

680
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,063
Promise?

681
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,072
Excuse me,
your friend is completely wasted.

682
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,031
Hurry.

683
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,162
-What?
-What's she doing?

684
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,124
What is she doing up there?

685
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,625
What's going on?

686
00:47:58,709 --> 00:47:59,793
Hi.

687
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,253
-Hey.
-She's drunk.

688
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,756
Mic check.

689
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,968
Mic check.

690
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,888
Has she lost it? Hey, Jin-ju!

691
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,849
Bo-reum, get down here.

692
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,100
Darn it.

693
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,313
That old woman has gone senile.

694
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,982
Why did she drink so much?
She can't handle her alcohol.

695
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,528
-Hey, cheapskate.
-Look at her.

696
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:30,449
Come down here. Get down here, cheapskate.

697
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,246
Cheapskate.

698
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,499
Hey, get down here.

699
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,128
I'm young too. You're not the only one.

700
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:50,010
I even got someone's number
because I was pretty.

701
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,016
I'm the best

702
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,483
That's the guy who fell for me. Right?

703
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,198
Director Park?

704
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,450
I'll call you.

705
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,494
Jin-ju, come on.

706
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,372
She has no idea what he's like.

707
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,958
That jerk.

708
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,752
Hey, cheapskate.

709
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,254
You're the reason

710
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,841
my life was utterly ruined.

711
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,596
But what about Seo-jin?

712
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,438
Seo-jin.

713
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:47,985
What about him?

714
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,789
-Is she mental?
-I know, right?

715
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,666
What's with her?

716
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,136
What is this?

717
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,311
-Darn it.
-That's gross.

718
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:26,982
-What the heck?
-Gross.

719
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:28,817
-Oh no.
-This is so gross.

720
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,318
What is this?

721
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:33,864
Cheapskate. I mean you. Choi Ban--

722
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,532
What are you doing?

723
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,469
Man, I'm about to die.

724
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,602
BIG SHOW AT JULIANA NIGHTCLUB

725
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:06,104
-Darn it.
-Come on.

726
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,231
-You idiot.
-I'll kill you.

727
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,108
-I'll get you.
-I'm flying.

728
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,861
-I'm flying.
-Hey, long hair!

729
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,405
Don't ever come back here, okay?

730
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,784
Goodness, that guy is wasted.

731
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,954
Mister, go home and sleep.
You'll get sick out here.

732
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,877
-Hey, get up. Get up now.
-Wait, I'm fine.

733
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,630
You're embarrassing.
Why did you drink so much?

734
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:34,299
Goodness, you idiot. Hey, Ban-do.

735
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,469
Who's Seo-jin? Why is she asking for him?
Sounds like a guy's name.

736
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,262
Where are you going?

737
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:42,474
See you tomorrow.

738
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:47,938
Hey. Wait, hey.
Who's going to get rid of this shit?

739
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,773
-Ban-do, wait.
-Do I smell bad?

740
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,109
Wake up.

741
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,030
What about Seo-jin?

742
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,241
Seo-jin.

743
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,244
What about him?

744
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,770
My fellow schoolmates,
are you all having a good morning?

745
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,939
Spring has finally come.

746
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,578
-Hey, I can't wait anymore.
-Hey, you.

747
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,122
Darn it, whatever.

748
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,333
Go.

749
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,337
Are you feeling okay?

750
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,426
Hey, Jin-ju.

751
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,679
What are you doing?

752
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,141
-Darn it.
-What is he…

753
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:09,102
-Come with me.
-Hey, wait. What do you…

754
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,770
Hey.

755
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:13,356
You.

756
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,526
You said to live our own lives,
so don't talk to me.

757
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,154
"Don't talk to me"? You…

758
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,325
Do you know what kind of jerk he is?

759
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,286
What?

760
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,373
-Give it to me.
-What?

761
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,126
That jerk's number from the nightclub.

762
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,879
Do you really think you're 20?

763
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:39,799
What's with you?
Who are you to demand it from me?

764
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,011
Why do you care
if a guy gave me his number?

765
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:47,140
Great going. What a great mom you are.

766
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:51,394
You got drunk and made a huge scene.
Great work, woman.

767
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,943
Don't get in touch with him.
He's a scumbag.

768
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:02,614
Hey, mister. Why do you care
if I get drunk, make a scene,

769
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,407
or date a scumbag?

770
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,451
Why do you care?

771
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,871
Fine, if we're strangers,

772
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,499
why do you keep talking about it
and getting us involved?

773
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,001
Are you telling everyone we're divorced?

774
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,628
Fine, go tell everyone

775
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,797
that we left our kid behind
to live a new life.

776
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,425
That can happen when people get drunk.

777
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:26,429
And why wouldn't I? It's a fact.

778
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,266
Fact, my foot.

779
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:33,395
If this gets out there,
both of our lives will be over.

780
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,398
It's not the same for us.

781
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:45,323
If this gets out there,
both of our lives will be over.

782
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,538
It's not the same for us.

783
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:55,542
You're a married man
who's hitting on his first love.

784
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,586
Does your first love know
you're a married man with a kid?

785
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,798
Why am I a married man? We're divorced.

786
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,971
No one here knows I was married.

787
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,389
What about you?

788
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,892
A married woman with a kid
fell into a young guy's arms,

789
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,644
and couldn't get it together.

790
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,063
That's a real soap opera, old lady.

791
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,357
-What's a soap opera?
-They're both cheating?

792
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,900
That woman is dope.

793
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,737
Yesterday? That was an accident.

794
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,325
You'd better pay your alimony.

795
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,368
I'll make sure to get every last bit.

796
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,162
I'm a student

797
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,955
without even a pathetic salary.

798
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,665
Students don't have any money.

799
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,292
I can't. I won't.

800
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,377
I won't. Why should I pay you?

801
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,004
This is awesome.

802
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:42,839
He's married?

803
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,183
You cheapskate.

804
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,979
Why? You love pathetic salaries.
Pathetic salaries.

805
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,198
EPILOGUE

806
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:11,368
NEWLYWED DAYS, YEAR 2004

807
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,369
You know what?

808
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,246
We're out of money for the month.

809
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:17,916
We have to be frugal.

810
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,627
Really? Already?
But it's the beginning of the month.

811
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:24,923
What are we going to eat?

812
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,592
You can feed on my love.

813
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:30,512
You're right.

814
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,140
What was that all of a sudden?

815
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,231
How was your day?

816
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:44,776
Well, I cleaned the house, cooked,

817
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,278
and logged our spendings. What about you?

818
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,238
Me?

819
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,700
I sealed a deal today.

820
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,872
I'm the first new recruit to seal
so many deals in such a short time.

821
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:58,790
Isn't that amazing?

822
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,043
Hey, you'll soon become
the best salesman in history.

823
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,670
Great job.

824
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:16,182
Anyway, what do you think
we'd be doing if we weren't married?

825
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,852
What do you think?

826
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,604
We would be wasting money,
splurging, and partying.

827
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,189
Maybe.

828
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,359
But I do want to try splurging.

829
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,862
Why? Is there something you want to do?

830
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,907
-What about you?
-Me?

831
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:38,621
Should we say it together?

832
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,375
One, two, three.

833
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,418
-Clubbing.
-Clubbing.

834
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,817
Our youth
that was like a spring day that ended

835
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,778
before we could enjoy it boomeranged back

836
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:15,158
and came back to us
more passionately and fiercely.

837
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,915
BUCKET LIST
1. GO TO A NIGHTCLUB

838
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:32,592
Didn't Jin-ju throw that away?
Why did you bring it back?

839
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,428
I can bring it back alive.
It's not dead yet.

840
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,038
There are students here who got divorced.

841
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,915
They're a piece of work.

842
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,708
Are you asking me out?

843
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,129
You should've been more careful
when you saved me.

844
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,340
Look after yourself first.

845
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,510
Why did you suddenly do that?

846
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:18,179
You asked me for my number
and came to see me.

847
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,222
You seem different.

848
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,266
What's wrong with you?

849
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,142
Why was your heart racing right then?

850
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,395
I'd like to get to know you more.

851
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:31,526
