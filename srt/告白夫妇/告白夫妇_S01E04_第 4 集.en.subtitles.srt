00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,130
WINTER OF 1998, BAN-DO, 19 YEARS OLD

2
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,257
But I don't like civil engineering.

3
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,634
This isn't your dinner.

4
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,762
You bombed your CSAT.

5
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,472
You don't like what now?

6
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,390
You don't get to choose your major.

7
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,020
The deadline has passed.
We're closing the doors.

8
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,105
Wait!

9
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,374
Wait! Wait one second.

10
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,461
INFORMATION

11
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,837
Thank you.

12
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:42,143
Inside the chests of the youth
lives a huge thing called the heart.

13
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:48,274
It embarrasses them, and beats loudly
with no regard for time or place.

14
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,238
Thus, it turns us into cowards
who can't do anything.

15
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,115
I got this.

16
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,117
Be bold. Stay confident.

17
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,378
Goodness! I just fell.

18
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,880
You can have that.

19
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,388
Why? Come on. Why?

20
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,431
Wait a second.

21
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,478
Thank you.

22
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,742
Director, you have a good eye
for the best products.

23
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,746
However, when we became adults
who could control our hearts,

24
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,041
that stupid heart stopped moving.

25
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,586
Did it harden and die?

26
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,629
Is it even alive?

27
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,842
It went so deep into hiding
that I don't know.

28
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,072
-Walk on your own. I'm tired.
-The road is too stiff.

29
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,700
Why did you drink
more than you can handle?

30
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:25,121
Hey, it's not like I wanted to drink.
I had to drink.

31
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,749
Goodness, she drinks like a fish.

32
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:31,336
What kind of a girl
wants to beat a guy in drinking?

33
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,297
Why not? She looked cool.

34
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,513
Wait, is this locked?

35
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,226
We'll get kicked out if we miss roll call.

36
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,603
Everything is going wrong today
because of you.

37
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,980
Hey, man. don't worry.

38
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,482
Hey kid.

39
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,276
We can just go in.

40
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,569
What's your plan?

41
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,239
-Hey.
-Here I go.

42
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,660
You got through.

43
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,704
See? I got through. I'm going in now.

44
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,915
-All right.
-Hey.

45
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,959
Hey, I think it might work.

46
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,086
-Over here.
-Wait, what's wrong here?

47
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,630
Wait, I think I'm…

48
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,175
I need to back out.

49
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,802
Okay, pull your head out.

50
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,514
What's wrong?

51
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,392
Hey, this hurts.

52
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,143
Okay, I'm pulling it out.

53
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,815
Man, this is really awkward.

54
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,775
One second. I'll be out soon.

55
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,151
Hey, Jae-u.

56
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,778
Hey, like this.

57
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,323
What am I going to do now? Hey.

58
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,702
Hey, Go Dok.

59
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,412
What are you…

60
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,415
Why are you there?

61
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,250
The door was open.

62
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,376
What?

63
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,430
-Here we go.
-Okay.

64
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:17,025
You jerk. Don't be mean
just because it's not your face. It hurts.

65
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,652
Put that away. Damn it.

66
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,114
You jerk. Come here.
Just because it's not your face.

67
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,866
Try being in my shoes.

68
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,539
It's hopeless for me.

69
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,167
Just go.

70
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,214
What?

71
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,842
It's too late for me.

72
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,720
Just go.

73
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,182
At this rate, we'll both go down.
At least you should live.

74
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,017
Be there for roll call.

75
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,270
You fool.

76
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,646
Go to roll call.

77
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,983
Then make sure you come back for me.

78
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,777
No.

79
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,863
No, you fool. I can't go.

80
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,366
Just go. Hurry up and go.

81
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,660
-No.
-Go! Hurry!

82
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,913
Get lost, you fool!

83
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,998
Go, Jae-u! Go!

84
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,629
Jae-u?

85
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,924
Why is this punk so quick?

86
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,176
Sir, wait. I'm here.

87
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:29,180
I'm sorry. My friend is stuck at the gate…

88
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,516
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,314
PAYPHONE

90
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,654
It's Bo-reum.
Student Union Room 201, tomorrow at 2 p.m.

91
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,578
Is she asking me out?

92
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,586
Jae-u.

93
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,965
Jae-u.

94
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,635
Have they still not taken roll call?

95
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,185
Rain?

96
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,274
There's no way it'll rain too. No way.

97
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,276
I'm Go Dok-jae. I'm not some--

98
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,947
Jae-u!

99
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,908
An Jae-u!

100
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,119
It's raining, man!

101
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,362
Sir.

102
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,698
Is he hurt? Sir.

103
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,367
-Water.
-Sir! Shit!

104
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,785
Water.

105
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,662
-Water. Water, Jae-u.
-What the heck?

106
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,581
Jae-u, water.

107
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,084
Water, Jae-u. Jae-u.

108
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,140
Change your major to business management.

109
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,434
History isn't worth anything.

110
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,603
If you like it that much,
you should go to school.

111
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,772
You're doing this on purpose.

112
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,149
You've been doing everything
I told you not to.

113
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,152
I'm not interested in you enough
to intentionally defy you.

114
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,238
Either transfer and learn
business management

115
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,157
or join the student council
and learn the school system.

116
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,618
-Make your choice.
-I see.

117
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,121
The system that takes
money from poor college kids?

118
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,414
What did you say?

119
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,916
Goodness, stop it.

120
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,545
Take this. You came late,
so I couldn't give it to you yesterday.

121
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,837
It's for your birthday.

122
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:11,342
You two can just live a happy life.
You don't have to mind me.

123
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,929
But please take this.
Mom bought this for you.

124
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,978
That little punk.

125
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,522
He has it too easy.

126
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,441
I should just cut off all his funding to…

127
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,651
Don't you dare.

128
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:37,660
Chairman Jeong,
explain the food price increase.

129
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:43,666
Chairman Jeong,
explain the food price increase.

130
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,395
-Hello?
-Why is it so tough to talk to my son?

131
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,272
Why won't you pick up?

132
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,648
What is it?

133
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,068
What else could it be?
Give your mom some money.

134
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,112
I have no money.

135
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,323
Why not? Your dad won't give you any?

136
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,200
I can't believe those two jerks.

137
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,161
That's enough.

138
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:23,205
What is? Do they know
how hard it was to have you? I want money!

139
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,333
Yes, so how hard was it?

140
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,461
Don't you even know the date?

141
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,257
It's today. The day you gave birth to me.

142
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,511
If you need money, call him yourself.

143
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,306
Stop dragging me into your problems!

144
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,158
To 31 Seongbuk-dong, please.

145
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,048
What's with that girl?

146
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,808
-How did he get stuck?
-This is dope. Is he stupid?

147
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,645
Kid, if you couldn't get it out,

148
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,439
why did you push your head in?

149
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:36,153
Goodness, kids these days
are just weird. My gosh.

150
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:40,866
Sir, can you please be gentle?

151
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,578
That's a power saw.

152
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,580
What are you going to do with that saw?

153
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,125
Why do you want to chop my head off?

154
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,794
Fine, if we're strangers,

155
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,588
why do you keep talking about it
and getting us involved?

156
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,799
Are you telling everyone we're divorced?

157
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,594
Fine, go tell everyone that we left
our kid behind to live a new life.

158
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,763
That can happen when people get drunk.

159
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,266
And why wouldn't I? It's a fact.

160
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,351
Fact, my foot.

161
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,480
If this gets out there,
both of our lives will be over.

162
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,483
It's not the same for us.

163
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:22,116
If this gets out there,
both of our lives will be over.

164
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,330
It's not the same for us.

165
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,334
You're a married man
who's hitting on his first love.

166
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,421
Does your first love know
you're a married man with a kid?

167
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,591
Why am I a married man? We're divorced.

168
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,764
No one here knows I was married.

169
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,223
What about you?

170
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,727
A married woman with a kid
fell into a young guy's arms,

171
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,437
and couldn't get it together.

172
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,939
That's a real soap opera, old lady.

173
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,150
-What's a soap opera?
-They're both cheating?

174
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,735
That woman is dope.

175
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,529
Yesterday? That was an accident.

176
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,201
You'd better pay your alimony.

177
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,286
I'll make sure to get every last bit.

178
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,873
I'm a student
without even a pathetic salary.

179
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,168
Students don't have any money.
I can't. I won't.

180
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,212
I won't. Why should I pay you?

181
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,671
This is awesome.

182
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,590
He's married?

183
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,725
You cheapskate.

184
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,521
Why? You love pathetic salaries.
Pathetic salaries.

185
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,356
Okay, fine.

186
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,359
I have nothing more
to discuss with a loser like you.

187
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,403
My stomach hurts so much.

188
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,573
Of course, your stomach hurts.
You were wasted, old lady.

189
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,411
Only those
who have partied can party properly.

190
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,290
Hey, you'll ruin your life
trying to party hard, old lady.

191
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,002
What?

192
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,254
BROADCASTING CLUB

193
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,552
She scared me.

194
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,972
Darn it. My stomach hurts.

195
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:08,931
Hey, Jin-ju!

196
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,724
What?

197
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,644
Don't call that guy from the club.

198
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,479
Don't get involved with him.

199
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,857
You must be excited because you think

200
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,317
he gave you his number
because you're pretty.

201
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,779
But Director Park
toys with girls like you. Get it?

202
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,532
I see, so he's a director?

203
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,287
-What?
-Over there? A hospital director?

204
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,999
-I--
-I knew he had great taste.

205
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,835
Now that I'm here,
I'll go turn my life around.

206
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,503
Thanks for that information.

207
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,422
Wait, hey.

208
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,965
Hey!

209
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,514
How long are we going to stay here?

210
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,474
Gosh.

211
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,148
-Hey.
-Darn it.

212
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,442
-Did you leave the door open?
-No idea.

213
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:06,280
A NIGHT FOR THE COLLEGE OF SOCIAL SCIENCES

214
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,992
He left his devoted wife
and kid for his first love.

215
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,620
And his first love doesn't know
that he was married.

216
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,704
Are you serious?

217
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,290
Hey, what's with the ruckus
so early in the morning?

218
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,127
-They're a piece of work.
-What?

219
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,671
There are students
who got divorced before they came.

220
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,132
What? Seriously?

221
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,010
Hey, wait. If they're still students,

222
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,012
when did they get married and divorced?

223
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,598
That's not what's important.

224
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,392
They're both having affairs.

225
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,144
-Affairs?
-Wait.

226
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,647
Well, they're divorced,
so they're not really affairs.

227
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,523
But they even have a kid.

228
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,402
A kid? My gosh. Kids these days are scary.

229
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,864
Hey, and the guy told her
he had no money to pay alimony

230
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,450
and threw a huge fit.

231
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,161
That jerk is a piece of garbage.

232
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,289
He is.
Garbage that can't even be recycled.

233
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,542
He said he doesn't even get
a pathetic salary because he's a student.

234
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:05,506
Then the woman freaked out,
calling him a cheapskate.

235
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,760
Cheapskate?

236
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,472
Hey, who did you hear this from?

237
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,850
That thing.

238
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,269
It was broadcast live.

239
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,854
I'm sure everyone heard it.

240
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,525
He refused to pay alimony.
He's the biggest loser.

241
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,442
Loser.

242
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,027
-He's a piece of garbage.
-Right?

243
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,278
Garbage.

244
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,156
A mother should raise her kid at home.

245
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,409
Why is she at school
hitting on a younger guy?

246
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,620
This world has come to an end.
It has gone completely nuts.

247
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,164
I'm about to go nuts.

248
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,876
That means they could've gotten married
and had a kid in high school.

249
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,295
-That woman must be something.
-Exactly.

250
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,175
Why do you keep mentioning her?

251
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,928
-Why are you disparaging women?
-Who are you?

252
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,139
"Who are you?"

253
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,017
Is this a challenge?

254
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,938
Hey, stay down.
She's History's Drinking Nutjob.

255
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:04,982
Don't mess with her.

256
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,862
She's so cool.

257
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,948
It's so cool how she got divorced.

258
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,160
Why should the woman make sacrifices?
She wanted to live her own life.

259
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,162
Gosh, she's so cool.

260
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,249
Maybe that was scripted
by the broadcasting club.

261
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,501
I mean,
they sometimes perform audio dramas.

262
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,255
This is the broadcasting club.

263
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:32,092
The accident that just broke out
is completely unrelated to our club.

264
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,762
We're in the process
of investigating the incident.

265
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,930
Darn it.

266
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,270
WE DEMAND AN EXPLANATION
FROM THE CHAIRMAN!

267
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,646
They recently got divorced.

268
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,940
The first love he's with now
goes to this school.

269
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,651
-It's disgusting.
-I know.

270
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,488
The guy's first love goes here too.

271
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,324
Hey.

272
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,957
What are we going to do now?

273
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,667
What do you want me to do?

274
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,170
Forget the guy.

275
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,090
What about the girl?
She had a kid at such a young age.

276
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,382
That bastard.

277
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,010
Asshole.

278
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,182
Seol, did you just curse?

279
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,143
He lured an innocent girl
and got her pregnant.

280
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,688
That asshole. I'll kill him.

281
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,733
Well, he didn't get her pregnant.

282
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,819
They were married. A married couple.

283
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,071
He won't even give her alimony!

284
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,325
Why are you yelling at me?

285
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:42,663
Anyway, neither of them
wanted the kid and abandoned it.

286
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,873
-That's bull.
-That's nonsense.

287
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,462
What's with you two?

288
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,383
The entire campus
is trying to track down the couple.

289
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,218
There aren't many leads,

290
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,679
but seeing
how ruthlessly they were fighting,

291
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,514
they must really hate each other.

292
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,058
Do you know people
who fight for no reason?

293
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,353
You never see
what's right under your nose.

294
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,605
I'm not sure.

295
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:13,402
Hey, Jin-ju.
Do you know anybody like that?

296
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:18,115
I'm not sure. I don't think so, Ban-do.

297
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,201
I see. You don't.

298
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,495
Enjoy your lunch.

299
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,873
-The soup is refreshing.
-Is it?

300
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,334
The soup is refreshing.

301
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,170
Neither of them wanted the kid.

302
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,380
They're despicable human beings.

303
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,132
He always beat the girl.

304
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,301
Really? What a scumbag.

305
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,594
She was a gold digger.

306
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,679
She planned everything to get alimony.

307
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,473
-The guy is a total scumbag.
-So is the girl.

308
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,225
They're the same.

309
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,944
All they know is our voice.

310
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,614
Yes, and no one has noticed.

311
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,825
How could they call me a gold digger?

312
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,285
You hit on me.

313
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,913
Hey, I'm a domestic violence offender.

314
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,457
But you're the one who beat me.
I never even touched you.

315
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,460
Forget it. We can never fight
when we're with the others.

316
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,420
Okay.

317
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,964
Why'd you drag me into the studio?

318
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,426
I didn't think it was on.
This wouldn't have happened

319
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,303
if you agreed not to see Director Park.

320
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,931
-Are you saying it's my fault?
-What?

321
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,308
Then is it my fault?

322
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,518
What's going on?

323
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,520
Whose fault is what?

324
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,776
It's the group blind date's fault
that we became good friends.

325
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,071
Yes, we all became friends
thanks to the group blind date.

326
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,741
Let's go.

327
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,203
Let's go, Seol.

328
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,581
We'll get going, Ban-do.

329
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,668
Okay, Jin-ju. Goodbye.

330
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:06,848
Excuse me.

331
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,520
-The nightclub.
-Director…

332
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,191
-The note.
-You remembered.

333
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,652
So you go to my school.

334
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,363
You were awesome on stage yesterday.

335
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,990
What is he doing?

336
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,618
Anyway, it seems like
I made a mistake last night.

337
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,203
Like what?

338
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,623
I should've asked for your number,
but I gave you mine.

339
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,669
But I guess we're meant to be.
We met again.

340
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,716
This time,

341
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,176
may I have your number?

342
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,137
I…

343
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,725
Yes, of course.

344
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,185
-I'll give you my number.
-That stupid woman.

345
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,481
Here's my phone number.

346
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:58,942
I'll call you.

347
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,902
Okay, goodbye.

348
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,076
She needs to be stabbed in the back
to come to her senses.

349
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,828
She has no idea what he's like.

350
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,372
What? Who?

351
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,751
What? No, it's nothing.

352
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,586
Whatever.

353
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,880
Why should I care? It's her life.

354
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,674
What is it? Who?

355
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,051
It's nothing.

356
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,219
SLIPPERY FLOOR, NO RUNNING, NO DIVING

357
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,064
You over there, move aside!
You'll get hurt!

358
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,732
Move aside!

359
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,042
Leave me alone, will you?

360
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,837
Are you really going to do it?

361
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,006
I have to. I need to do something.

362
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,971
Help!

363
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,682
Please, help me!

364
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,352
Help me, please!

365
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,947
Come to the Literature Archive room
as soon as your classes are over.

366
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,199
This event is for all freshmen,

367
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,202
so make sure you all show up. Got it?

368
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,703
-Yes.
-Yes.

369
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,762
Is he here to complain?

370
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,684
Gosh, oh no. He looks emaciated.

371
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,396
Well, I kind of led him on
after he asked me out

372
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,731
and did all sorts of stuff
to give him hope.

373
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:07,070
Anyway, did he really not get married
because he never got over me for 18 years?

374
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,533
-Hey.
-What?

375
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,578
"Hey"?

376
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,580
I'm asking

377
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,666
just in case.

378
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,671
You don't think
I actually like you, do you?

379
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,589
What?

380
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,049
Well, it's…

381
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,843
What is he talking about?

382
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,305
You did. Man.

383
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,724
You did think that.

384
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,310
Well, you said you liked me.

385
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,436
I did not.

386
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,189
I mean, you asked me out.

387
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,025
-Yes, but I never said I liked you.
-What?

388
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:50,113
What's with him?
Is he getting revenge for rejecting him?

389
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:53,617
You have to like someone
if you want to date someone.

390
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,911
-Then why did you ask me out?
-You were there.

391
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,790
Because I was there?
What if someone else was there?

392
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,167
I would've asked her.

393
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,424
Are we in the clear now?

394
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,218
Then stop coming onto me.

395
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,678
Don't do stuff like…

396
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:18,934
That stuff.

397
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,978
Don't do it.

398
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,438
Goodbye.

399
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,321
He asked me out because I was there?

400
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,073
Wait, this means

401
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,825
he didn't like me back then.

402
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,911
Why is he telling me now?

403
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,454
It has been 18 years.

404
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,459
He shouldn't have told me.

405
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,297
Why did he tell me?

406
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:08,316
It's Bo-reum.
Student Union Room 201, tomorrow at 2 p.m.

407
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,452
Powerfully!

408
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,454
Arms.

409
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,707
Arms.

410
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,669
Who are you?

411
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,717
APPLICATION FOR ASURA CHEERLEADING SQUAD

412
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,386
APPLICANT, AN JAE-U

413
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,472
Stop joking.

414
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:44,144
My body isn't built
for this kind of stuff.

415
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,313
There's no way I would've signed up.

416
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,064
But you did. You signed it.

417
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,691
Look at it.

418
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,319
Well, yes, I guess.

419
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:56,281
But is this fingerprint mine?

420
00:26:56,364 --> 00:27:00,702
Hey, I don't do weird things
to a drunk guy.

421
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,666
What's that?

422
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,169
This? Applications for my club.

423
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,837
It's for applicants.

424
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,798
Do you want to join?

425
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,884
Me?

426
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:17,761
If you join,

427
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,097
you'll practice with me every day.

428
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,434
Really?

429
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,063
Should I, then?

430
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,692
Here.

431
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,239
APPLICANT AN JAE-U

432
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,743
ASURA

433
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,787
Three, four.

434
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,247
One, two. Keep the beat.

435
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,918
Hey, have you been on a tour?

436
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,419
Why are you so tired already?

437
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,712
Again, from the top.

438
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,895
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

439
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,235
Sorry.

440
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,962
Seo-yeong, stay focused.

441
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:02,801
You're the principal dancer,
but you're obviously too heavy.

442
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,302
You need to stay in shape.

443
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,970
I'm doing my best.

444
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,515
But it's hard for me
to gain or lose weight.

445
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,308
You call that an excuse?

446
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,606
-Have some soda too.
-Thanks.

447
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,941
Have some of this too.

448
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:21,194
-I'm on a diet, though.
-Is it good?

449
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,695
I'll start my diet tomorrow.

450
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,407
It's good.

451
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:30,286
Seo-yeong, come here.
He brought snacks for you.

452
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,122
Hi. Did you go somewhere?

453
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,457
Yes.

454
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,251
Hi.

455
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,335
Sit with us.

456
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,093
I chose the sweetest ones
in case you were low on energy.

457
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,970
He's very considerate.

458
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,764
We crave sweets a lot after practice.

459
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,642
-How did you know?
-I could tell.

460
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:56,396
Life is bitter, you know.
And so is practice.

461
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,314
At times, we need something sweet.

462
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,942
You can enjoy the bitterness
knowing this is coming.

463
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,236
-You have a point.
-You're funny.

464
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,575
Here. This way,
you won't get it on your hands.

465
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,410
No, I'm fine.

466
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,998
-I think I have indigestion.
-Oh, I see.

467
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,959
Who is that punk?

468
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,336
He's not her boyfriend, is he?

469
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,797
I've never even talked to Seo-yeong.

470
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,553
Hey, boys. Come on in. Eat with us.

471
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,096
What? Us?

472
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,433
-Are you talking to us?
-Yes, you guys.

473
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,147
Look at them.

474
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,694
-Thanks.
-That was good.

475
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:45,987
That was nice.

476
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,115
Okay, then. Get back to practice.

477
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,784
I'll come back
with something sweet again next time.

478
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,623
Hey, I'll get going now.

479
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,627
I'm leaving. Bye.

480
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,046
-Bye.
-Bye. Come again.

481
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,216
I didn't know what he was like,
but he's pretty cool.

482
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,971
This was perfect. Going after her friends.

483
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,599
He must really like you
if he's that nice to us too.

484
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,142
Really?

485
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,688
Thanks for the donuts.

486
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,815
You didn't have to include us.

487
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,152
That was a part of the plan too.

488
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,404
That shows how laid back I am.

489
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,281
Sure. Keep it up.

490
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,704
Seo-yeong, are you okay?

491
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,289
Seo-yeong, get up.

492
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,041
-Oh no.
-My gosh.

493
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,585
-What happened?
-What's going on?

494
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,629
-Should we call an ambulance?
-Oh no.

495
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,880
-Give me a hand.
-Okay.

496
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,093
-Where's the infirmary?
-At the end of the hallway to the right.

497
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,222
-Oh no.
-Seo-yeong.

498
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,849
-My gosh.
-Oh no, Seo-yeong.

499
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,560
She's light as a feather.
Why is she so thin?

500
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,646
Attention.

501
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:05,608
That building you see over there is
the History Archives.

502
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,446
I'm sure you've already heard

503
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,031
that a long time ago,

504
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:16,619
a freshman hanged herself
and died in the archives.

505
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,496
Ever since that day,

506
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:23,042
more and more people
keep saying they saw that girl's ghost.

507
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,632
If any of you go in there

508
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,634
and bring the document you're told,

509
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,762
the drinks are on us.

510
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,229
Just an FYI, no one has ever succeeded.

511
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,232
We have to go in there?

512
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,067
I'm scared.

513
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:54,407
How is that scary?
They are all completely full of it.

514
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,744
Hey, wait.

515
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,287
-It's okay.
-What did you see?

516
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,290
-What is it?
-Calm down, man.

517
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,750
-There's a ghost.
-Seriously?

518
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,835
Darn it, I'm so scared.

519
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,212
Who wants to go next?

520
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:09,922
You should go.

521
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,924
-What? No one?
-It's really scary.

522
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,510
At least one more should try.

523
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,474
Gosh. They're all cowards this year too.

524
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,560
No one will go in. Hey.

525
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,063
Ma Jin-ju?

526
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,698
It really feels haunted.

527
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,659
Where is it?

528
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,287
Red sticker.

529
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:46,125
Red sticker. Where's the red sticker?

530
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,378
Not here.

531
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,512
My goodness.

532
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,194
Mommy! I can't do this!

533
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,530
Mommy!

534
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,244
Gosh, that was really scary.

535
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:24,580
Oh my gosh!

536
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,208
What is this?

537
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,512
Oh my gosh! Get back!

538
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,849
No! Stop it! Leave me alone!

539
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,017
Stop it! Please!

540
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,817
Mommy!

541
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:01,951
Mommy!

542
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,085
Help.

543
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,589
Help.

544
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,928
-It's a ghost!
-Get me out of here.

545
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,685
I remember how you were hiding here.

546
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,145
You can't fool me twice.

547
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,691
It's a ghost!

548
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,484
Another one got scared and left.

549
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,280
Anyway, why did a freshman die here?

550
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:40,948
How scary.

551
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,663
Please get me out of here.

552
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,297
Okay, I got rid of everyone.

553
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,424
Let me find the document.

554
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,142
-The ghost.
-Yes, the ghost.

555
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,936
-I saw her too.
-I saw her.

556
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,820
Is it over or not?

557
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,249
-Man.
-A red envelope.

558
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,627
Let's see.

559
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,089
A red envelope.

560
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,259
Found it.

561
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,893
Goodness.

562
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,355
They're all going to party thanks to me.

563
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,316
What's so fun about this?

564
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,403
Goodness, these kids.

565
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,613
I found it.

566
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,818
I got up thanks to that tummy alarm.

567
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,533
Did the alarm wake you up too?

568
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:32,912
What?

569
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,960
If you're up, let's go.

570
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,046
Go where?

571
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,683
Yes, you two are a couple
that should never break up.

572
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,361
That's it. This is it.

573
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,612
Gosh, this is so good.

574
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,782
What are you doing?

575
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,367
I'm not eating.

576
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,994
-Okay, don't.
-What?

577
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,872
The nurse said
you've been trying to lose weight.

578
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,667
Don't eat and then blame me.
Just don't eat.

579
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,003
Then why am I here?

580
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,088
One second.

581
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,215
So good.

582
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,135
Please just watch me.

583
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,012
I was craving pork belly,
but I had no one to come with.

584
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,266
You can do that for me, can't you?

585
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,980
Do you want to try one? Just one piece?

586
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:41,897
What?

587
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,903
No, never mind.

588
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,573
What am I doing to a girl
who's trying to lose weight?

589
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,408
No, you can't do that. I'm sorry.

590
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,912
Hey.

591
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,373
Why should I just watch?
I'm not a spectator.

592
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,542
I can eat one piece.

593
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:07,173
But I shouldn't let you eat.

594
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,093
It's so good.

595
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,942
Didn't you say you'd eat only one piece?

596
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,200
One meal.

597
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,577
I meant one meal.

598
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,578
I see.

599
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,331
Okay, eat up.

600
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,917
If you enjoy it, it's zero calories.

601
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,836
-Who says that?
-That's just how it is.

602
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,351
What's wrong with you?

603
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,896
Why was your heart racing right then
for this little kid?

604
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:04,897
Man.

605
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,278
Well,

606
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,156
it's my first time getting this far.

607
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,493
Why didn't you say you were there?

608
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,744
I was hiding.

609
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,329
You have a point.

610
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,749
He's so prickly. Seriously.

611
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,251
I told you not to be clingy.

612
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,420
I don't think this one is on me.

613
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,633
You rushed over yourself and saved me.

614
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,885
I'm sure it was just because I was there,

615
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,304
but thank you.

616
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:46,021
I think it's over. Aren't you leaving?

617
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,314
I'm fine. You can go.

618
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,528
Did you get hurt?

619
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,739
Let me take a look. Let me see.

620
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,241
Hey, wait.

621
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,202
You can't grab a man's leg like that.

622
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,204
Goodness.

623
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,998
This kid thinks he's a man.

624
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,375
Come on. Let me see.

625
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,006
My gosh, it's swollen.

626
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,301
You should've been more careful
when you saved me.

627
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,678
That must hurt.

628
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,639
Once you sprain it, it lasts forever.

629
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:21,682
My gosh. Oh no.

630
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,977
Try to move it a little. Goodness.

631
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,937
Try to move it a little like this.

632
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,314
I'm fine.

633
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,360
And stop talking down to me.

634
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,696
Right.

635
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,454
Goodness.

636
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,207
What are you doing?

637
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,711
Just go. You can't even walk properly.

638
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,964
-I told you not to do this.
-Be careful.

639
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,470
Thank you.

640
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,727
Oh no. Darn it.

641
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,567
I must've gone insane.

642
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,572
THE BEST MEAT IN SEOUL

643
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,470
Excuse me. I'll take these.

644
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,809
Let's go. You enjoyed it,
so let's make it zero calories.

645
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,103
What?

646
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,322
Instead of being stressed

647
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,324
because you can't eat or do what you want,

648
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,952
isn't it better to just do it
and then fix it afterward?

649
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,370
You need to eat to survive.

650
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:10,207
This isn't that tough
compared to what I just ate.

651
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,085
Life only gives you
as much as you can handle.

652
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:16,296
Everything can be fixed after you do it.

653
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,007
Even doctors tell pregnant women

654
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,218
to just have coffee or alcohol
once in a while

655
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,179
because it's worse
to get stressed out about it.

656
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,181
No way, pregnant women can't do that.

657
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,559
I'm serious. My wife…

658
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:35,149
I mean, the doctor said that
when my sister got pregnant. Right.

659
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:36,984
I see.

660
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,946
So, why did you suddenly do that?

661
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,116
What? What do you mean?

662
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:49,872
I mean, until recently,
you couldn't even talk to me.

663
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,040
You'd run away and hide.

664
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,001
What?

665
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,085
But all of a sudden,

666
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,005
you asked me for my number
and came to see me.

667
00:45:58,797 --> 00:45:59,840
You seem different.

668
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,511
You knew I was watching you in hiding?

669
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,348
Yes. I had never seen anyone
hide so poorly.

670
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,604
Right.

671
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,483
Please forget that guy
from a few days ago.

672
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:19,902
I was a loser, right?

673
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,117
What did that smile mean?

674
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:28,994
Darn it.

675
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,386
Gosh, this is nice.

676
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,516
Yes, the air in Seoul
used to be like this.

677
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:54,394
I can see everything ahead
without a speck of fine dust.

678
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,147
What's that? "Fine dust"?

679
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,193
It's this famous Chinese air.

680
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,070
Do the Chinese sell air?

681
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,115
Later on, they probably will.

682
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,200
What are you saying?

683
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,664
But this is nice.

684
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,416
I've never been somewhere like this.

685
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,219
How did you know my shoe size?

686
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:28,887
What?

687
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,558
Well, I just estimated.

688
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,560
Come on.

689
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:01,420
There is no future
for those who forget history!

690
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:11,054
Never in my wildest dreams
did I think Jin-ju would succeed.

691
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,598
That's amazing.

692
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:17,352
-Ma Jin-ju!
-Ma Jin-ju!

693
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,147
Ghosts aren't scary.

694
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,024
People are scarier.

695
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,124
Here.

696
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,462
Put this on your ankle.

697
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,005
It was badly swollen.

698
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,548
Don't mind me.

699
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:50,344
Seriously.
You really won't listen, will you?

700
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,845
Give me your leg.

701
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,683
Hey, what are you doing?

702
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,812
You got hurt because of me.

703
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,273
How can I be
so inconsiderate and not care?

704
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,692
Why are you acting like a teenager?

705
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,820
Be a man. Stop being such a prude.

706
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:13,033
Don't remove it
until the swelling goes down.

707
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,248
Jin-ju, where have you been?

708
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,917
-Let's drink.
-Drink up.

709
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,420
What was that?
Does she think she's a doctor?

710
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,756
-Gosh, this is nice.
-Great work.

711
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,007
What a stress relief.

712
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,259
-Cheers!
-Drink up.

713
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,387
Anyway, why does she
keep talking down to me?

714
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,388
Drink up.

715
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,357
-This is nice.
-Jin-ju, you should chug one.

716
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,275
No, not me. No, stop.

717
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,903
-You said it, so you do it.
-Chug.

718
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,571
-Chug.
-Chug.

719
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,867
-All done.
-Pour her another.

720
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,005
This is nice.

721
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,761
Seol, why do you drink juice
instead of beer?

722
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,098
You and I don't usually drink.

723
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,225
Right.

724
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,812
But still, try some.

725
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:28,025
Once you get married,
you won't have the time to drink.

726
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,443
Married?

727
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,987
Still, I don't like how people

728
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,281
lose control after drinking.

729
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,329
Seol, I realized
after living all those years…

730
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:43,623
It's okay to lose control.

731
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,918
If you can't have fun
because of what people think,

732
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,086
it's only your loss.

733
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,589
There's a time to lose control.

734
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:53,383
It's worse if you do that
after you get older.

735
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,177
Okay?

736
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,220
This is the time

737
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,890
to drink and party.

738
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:06,605
All right. Tonight, let's not worry.
Let's drink freely. The slogan!

739
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,650
There is no future
for those who forget history!

740
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,652
-The best, History!
-The best, History!

741
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,917
-Who forget history.
-Who forget history.

742
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:34,299
Hey, what's Seol doing over there?

743
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,844
I'm going to take this home.

744
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:42,307
I'll take the spicy chicken home too.

745
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,521
Half fried, half spicy. Half and half.

746
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,369
Ouch.

747
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,916
Hey, is the table all right?

748
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,214
Oh no, I think it's broken.

749
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,346
Gentlemen.

750
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,183
Please take Seol back home safely.

751
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,352
Please take me home safely.

752
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,438
Roll call.

753
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,817
She'll be in huge trouble
if she's late for roll call.

754
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,778
We still have hours until roll call.

755
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,739
Hey, you should go.

756
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,785
In that case, I'll get going.

757
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,588
Hey, do you want one?

758
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,966
Do you want one?

759
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,147
Look after yourself first.

760
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,868
Tell me whenever you want to do this.

761
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,038
I'll help you turn it into zero calories.

762
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:39,210
You're way too young
to hold back all the time.

763
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,506
No. Thanks for today,

764
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,133
but don't do that again.

765
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:51,639
I've never lost a youth competition.

766
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,351
Because I held back.

767
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:57,520
I held back no matter how tough it was.
That's how I got here.

768
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,647
It wasn't that easy.

769
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,234
Anyway, thanks.

770
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,740
I'd like to get to know you more.

771
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,332
-My bus is here.
-Okay.

772
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,002
-Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

773
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:27,801
Bye.

774
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,651
Gosh, great job.

775
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,819
Great job.

776
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,383
It's still hot at this hour.

777
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,968
I guess it really is summer.

778
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:31,114
-Honey.
-I said it's hot.

779
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:34,784
It's hot. I said it's hot.

780
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,082
Hey. It's hot.

781
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,560
I'm still here.

782
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:17,660
Goodness.

783
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:22,040
What has gotten into you?
Why are you doing the dishes?

784
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,459
Getting ready for marriage?

785
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,962
That's not the only reason
to do the dishes.

786
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,547
Sit down and get some rest.

787
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,883
Move. I'll do it.

788
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:34,385
You'll do it for life
once you get married. Don't do it now.

789
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,055
You'll do it until the day you die.

790
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,806
Did you finally grow up?

791
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,227
I may become immature again someday,

792
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,479
so just take me as I am when I do.

793
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,022
What are you talking about?

794
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,233
Get some rest.

795
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,487
Sit down, Mom. Get some rest.

796
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,911
How much is the watermelon?

797
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,454
The big one is 5,000 won.

798
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,414
This is 5,000 won?

799
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,708
Mom, you love grapes.

800
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,586
Goodness, it looks delicious.

801
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:12,507
It's all right.
I'm the only one who eats that.

802
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,843
You two and Dad are
all crazy about watermelon.

803
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,972
Get the grapes.

804
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,891
I want grapes like crazy today.

805
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,936
You don't eat grapes.

806
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:28,273
I love grapes. I take after you.

807
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:39,450
That's right.

808
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,495
I forgot to pick up the photos.

809
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,039
Goodness, I've been so out of it.

810
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:48,001
-The studio next to the marketplace?
-Yes.

811
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,628
You can go home. I'll pick it up.

812
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:53,172
I'm sorry.

813
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,102
What's this?

814
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,230
TO MS. KO EUN-SUK

815
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,566
Who left this here?

816
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,374
My goodness.

817
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,003
Young man.

818
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:36,299
If you hit someone,
you should apologize before you go.

819
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:38,509
Don't you see
what happened because of you?

820
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,597
Then you should carry them better.

821
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,808
What? I was standing by my home.

822
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,852
You hit me. I didn't hit you.

823
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:51,606
Man, what's with this old lady?
Why are you ruining my day?

824
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,275
So? What do you want from me?

825
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,070
-You want a piece of me?
-What's wrong with you?

826
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,574
What's your problem?
A kid should be polite to an adult.

827
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,869
What? A kid?

828
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:07,163
This day just keeps getting worse.

829
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,457
What's with this neighborhood?

830
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,335
If you hit an elder, you should apologize

831
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:15,338
or at least compensate them,
you young punk!

832
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,758
That's right. You young punk.

833
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:23,554
Man, I can't believe my luck.
What's with these two?

834
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:27,141
-Who are you? Why are you meddling?
-Me?

835
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,646
I'm her son. So what?

836
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,439
Her son?

837
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:37,235
Goodness, I knew it.

838
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,532
Consider yourselves lucky. Damn it.

839
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,242
What now?

840
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,661
That rude little punk.

841
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,332
Ma'am, are you all right?

842
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:53,584
I am.

843
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:00,133
Here.

844
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,301
Thank you.

845
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:06,514
Your mom must be happy
to have a son like you.

846
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:08,349
I only have two daughters.

847
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:19,694
Why do you look so happy
about marrying your daughter off?

848
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:22,572
Your mom looks so thrilled.

849
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,532
Of course, I'm thrilled.

850
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:27,618
I never had a son,
and I finally got one for free.

851
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,706
He's very handsome.

852
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,796
Hey!

853
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:43,760
Goodness.

854
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,096
Mom, go inside.

855
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,892
What's wrong with you? This young man--

856
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,268
Mom, just go inside.

857
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,604
Go inside, okay? Go inside.

858
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:57,148
-Go inside. Just get inside.
-Wait.

859
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:09,535
I was just in the area.

860
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:13,289
How dare you come here?

861
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,587
Did you come to see my mom?

862
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:36,729
I'm sorry.

863
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,608
I'm sorry, Mother.

864
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,194
I'm sorry.

865
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,655
I'm sorry.

866
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,907
You've been so weird lately.

867
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,535
You even dreamt that I died.

868
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:33,744
Are you dating Bo-reum?

869
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,663
Dating, my foot.

870
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,540
It was just a peck, not a kiss.

871
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,208
Food tastes bad if you eat alone.

872
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,086
Does it have to be here?

873
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:46,132
I'm not committing a crime.
I'm not cheating on her.

874
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,508
Why is she here?

875
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,468
Why are we here? This isn't the hospital.

876
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,970
You told you weren't coming onto me.

877
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,139
That you didn't like me.

878
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,224
I didn't say I liked her.
I'm hitting on her.

879
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:59,520
