00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,548
THE REAL 1999, AFTER THE HISTORY
AND CIVIL ENGINEERING GROUP BLIND DATE

2
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,133
Follow the arrows.

3
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,793
The trail ends here.

4
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,254
Is someone pulling a prank?

5
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:39,265
Hi, I'm Choi Ban-do of civil engineering
from the group blind date.

6
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,142
Do you want to go watch a movie?

7
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,902
Back then, we were never calculating.

8
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,863
We stayed true to our hearts,

9
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,700
and it seemed like
the universe revolved around us.

10
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,077
Can't I just walk you home?

11
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,538
No, you have to catch the last bus soon.

12
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,750
You should go home for today.

13
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,569
Hey.

14
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,779
How did you get here?

15
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,532
-I got something, so I took a taxi.
-What?

16
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,077
How lucky. I missed you anyway.

17
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,914
Let's see what your excuse is.

18
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,460
Ban-do, are you okay?

19
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,340
Look, you already got a rash.

20
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,925
Why did you get this?

21
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,970
You love them. Who cares about my allergy?

22
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,683
Well, you might get me
that star in the sky soon.

23
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,103
I can't reach it, but if I could, I would.

24
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,606
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

25
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,358
You're impossible.
Do you have money to take a taxi?

26
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,194
-No.
-How will you go home?

27
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,362
I can just walk. I can find a way.

28
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,908
We once wanted to catch the stars
and the moon for each other.

29
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,117
Where did that time

30
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,745
and feelings all go?

31
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,416
Where in the journey
are we standing right now?

32
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:57,987
What?

33
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,323
Why am I here?

34
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,702
Ban-do, wake up!

35
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,212
Jin-ju.

36
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,178
What's wrong? Goodness.

37
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,475
We're back,

38
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,228
aren't we?

39
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,606
Where's Seo-jin?

40
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,777
You need to sober up, okay?

41
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,113
I'm not drunk.

42
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,116
I had such a ridiculous dream.

43
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:48,913
Jin-ju.

44
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,708
Jin-ju?

45
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,169
Honey.

46
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,587
Honey.

47
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,007
Honey.

48
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,468
I said to get up already.

49
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,886
You have to go to school.

50
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,181
Goodness, that rascal. My gosh.

51
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,489
Mom, take me hiking with you this weekend.

52
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,907
Okay.

53
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,659
-I'm going to school.
-Okay.

54
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,461
She has been doing
a lot of things with you lately.

55
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,795
She won't leave you alone.

56
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,922
Exactly. Tell me about it.

57
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,134
We'll have a big crowd
for our weekend hike.

58
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,470
Hey, let's take Eun-ju too.

59
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,806
Not you. Just the two of us.

60
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,184
-Without me?
-Yes.

61
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,604
Why are you leaving me out?
No way. I'm going.

62
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,647
I'm your other half.

63
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,399
You're not hers, you're mine.

64
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,193
My gosh.

65
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,863
-Goodness.
-But seriously.

66
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,741
SUICIDE RATE RISES AFTER IMF

67
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,160
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME, MOM
BUT LIFE IS TOO HARD

68
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,292
It must've been hard.

69
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,796
It must've been hard to give birth to me.

70
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,466
Wait, could she…

71
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,313
TO MY DEAR MOM

72
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,279
-Mom, what are you doing?
-Eun-ju, look at this.

73
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,700
-She's acting weird.
-What?

74
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,077
She wrote you a letter.

75
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,373
It's not a suicide note, is it?

76
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,376
A suicide note? Are you crazy?
Don't even imagine that.

77
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,670
Then it wouldn't be just for you.

78
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,506
It's your birthday soon,
so it's probably for that.

79
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,590
Right.

80
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,093
My birthday.

81
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,303
Mom, I want breakfast.

82
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,723
And I know she's your daughter,
but don't go through her stuff.

83
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,442
What? This is my house.

84
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,985
Why can't I do that?

85
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,207
-Hey.
-Hi, are you going to school?

86
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,919
Yes, I have nowhere else to go
at this hour.

87
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,630
Hop in. I'm headed there too.

88
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,718
I…

89
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,678
Well, I…

90
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,984
My gosh, she even has a driver?

91
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,196
But then again,
that's why that scumbag hit on her.

92
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,281
That jerk.

93
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,742
Thank you for what you did.

94
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,328
Right, don't mention it.

95
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,413
I got to take revenge too.

96
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,999
Did Hyeon-seok do something to you?

97
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,918
No one else compares.

98
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,962
I wake up in the middle of the night angry
because of him.

99
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,716
I let him do that to make a living,
but if I wanted, I would've just…

100
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,927
That little kid, darn it.

101
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,011
Don't let him do that.

102
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,804
Of course, I won't. I will…

103
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:40,144
No. I need to make a living
to provide for my family.

104
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,938
I won't let him do that to you.

105
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,190
Sorry? What?

106
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:48,528
I can help you
so that he doesn't do that to you anymore.

107
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,363
What?

108
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,866
Right. Okay.

109
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:58,955
What's with her?

110
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,957
Why is she getting all shy?

111
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,041
Stop it.

112
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,421
So, are you feeling better?

113
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,966
All thanks to you.

114
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,764
-I have to use the restroom.
-Okay.

115
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,184
-I got it.
-Wait.

116
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,105
This is day one of your new life,
so this one is on me.

117
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,566
Excuse me, can you ring us up?

118
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,692
Okay.

119
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,152
Oh my gosh! Oh no!

120
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,279
Hey.

121
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,697
You'll get hurt.

122
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,075
-What?
-Who did this?

123
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,327
I got this abroad in Thailand.

124
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,579
-I'm sorry, I--
-Goodness.

125
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,291
I touched it gently,
but I somehow ended up dropping it.

126
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,794
I'll go on a business trip
to Thailand in about 13 years,

127
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,713
so I'll get you the same one.

128
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,465
-I promise.
-You smooth talker you.

129
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,384
I'll clean it up now.

130
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,941
This is a bit uncomfortable.

131
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,612
Don't be uncomfortable
just because I'm older.

132
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:17,283
I don't have prejudice
against dating younger guys.

133
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,743
What?

134
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,955
Right, okay. Sure.

135
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,042
By any chance, do you have a girlfriend?

136
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,627
What?

137
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,468
Well, not at the moment.

138
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,430
-Hello, Director!
-Hello, Director!

139
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:41,891
Good work.

140
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,267
Keep it up.

141
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,820
I'm in the mood
for the queen of fruit, durian.

142
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,073
I'll go get it, sir!

143
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,075
Hey, you're still here?

144
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,789
Ms. Kim is here.

145
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,874
-Hello, Ms. Kim.
-Hello, Ms. Kim.

146
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,880
Honey.

147
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,967
No, I can't.

148
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,427
What? You can't what?

149
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,639
No, nothing. Goodbye.

150
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,144
Wake up. Get a grip.

151
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,439
Ban-do, you can always make money.
Of course, you can.

152
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,652
Jin-ju?

153
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,325
Did she see that? Darn it.

154
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,618
I didn't do anything wrong.

155
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,329
Why are you avoiding her? Gosh.

156
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,125
What's going on with them?

157
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,298
Watch where you're going!

158
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,135
My gosh. Are your eyes just for show?

159
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,304
Gosh, darn it. What am I going to do?

160
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,725
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I--
-Don't touch me.

161
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,520
Do you know how much this is?

162
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,441
You couldn't afford this
even if you sold yourself. Get it?

163
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,483
Hey, you!

164
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,902
"Hey, you"?

165
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,407
How can an adult speak to a kid like that?

166
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,534
How much is it?
More expensive than a person?

167
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,453
Who knows what she'll be later on?

168
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,205
Who do you think you are?

169
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,958
You're younger than my son.
How dare you talk back to me?

170
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,252
If you think your son is precious,

171
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,963
you need to know
how precious other people's kids are.

172
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,967
People like you are the reason
good moms are called vermin moms.

173
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,553
What? "Vermin moms"?

174
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,142
How dare you speak down to me?

175
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,144
Do you think I'm--

176
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,442
-Stop.
-That's not it.

177
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,028
It's not. This is no way
to treat your mom.

178
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,572
It wasn't me. She started this.

179
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,407
Let me go!

180
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,784
Why are you doing this?

181
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,829
Let me go. Hey, let go of me.

182
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,126
What's wrong?
Why are you doing this to your mom?

183
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,878
I didn't start this.

184
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,713
She's the one who picked a fight.

185
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,799
Why are you blaming me?

186
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,676
I didn't do anything wrong. Okay?

187
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,220
What kind of a son are you?

188
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,973
-Hey, you're my son. What's with you?
-Hey, thanks.

189
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,643
No, don't mention it.

190
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,647
I just can't stand people like her.

191
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,278
Anyone can fall in love,

192
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,906
but not everyone can stay in love.

193
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,949
Why is this?

194
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:50,454
Erich Fromm, an American psychoanalyst
and a philosopher said this about love.

195
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:09,473
He said true love isn't an emotion

196
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,810
anyone can covet without self-betterment.

197
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,770
If you wish to stay in true love,

198
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:19,108
you must make an effort
to strive to become a mature person.

199
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:24,071
However, Fromm didn't just focus
on the individual's existential effort.

200
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,949
I hope you all have a great weekend.
See you next week.

201
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,369
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, Professor.

202
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,414
May I have your attention?

203
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,917
We're taking signatures to have
the chairman resign. Please participate.

204
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,963
Yes, our chairman is pretty awful.

205
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,257
We can't afford to study
with such high tuition.

206
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,801
He's taking advantage of us for money.

207
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,847
What?

208
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,851
WE DEMAND JEONG GI-DO'S RESIGNATION

209
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,776
Goodness, why do students
have to take this so far?

210
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,696
I didn't know she was your mother.

211
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,657
I mean, it wasn't like
she could change out of her clothes.

212
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,785
I can see why she was mad.
I shouldn't have done that.

213
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,997
Who's my mom?

214
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,834
That lady you just…

215
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,087
JEONG NAM-GIL

216
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,554
I don't have a mom.

217
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,890
Mind your own business.

218
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,193
He's angry.
But I didn't know she was his mom.

219
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,201
Does he have to go this far
to hide that he's his dad?

220
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,423
It's not. This is no way
to treat your mom.

221
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,342
It wasn't me. She started this.

222
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,761
Let me go.

223
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,596
She's the one who picked a fight.

224
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,848
Why are you blaming me?

225
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,693
Hey, if you became this age again,
what would you want to do the most?

226
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,320
What are you saying?

227
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,534
Let's say you're 38 years old.

228
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,661
But one day, you suddenly became 20 again.

229
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,538
-What would you want to do?
-For me, dating.

230
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,499
By 38, I'd probably be married.

231
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,626
Then I'll have to live with her for life.

232
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,171
No, I can't. It sounds too boring.

233
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,091
You won't live that life, punk.
Don't worry about it.

234
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,802
He'll probably be
a worse party monster than now.

235
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,763
You should ask someone
who came back in time, not us.

236
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,559
I have no idea either. That's why.

237
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,562
I went clubbing, so…

238
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,482
What about girls?
What would a girl want to do the most?

239
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,276
-For me, dating.
-Yes, I get it.

240
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,069
Ask girls. Why are you asking us?

241
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,571
What's with you?

242
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,530
Hey.

243
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,783
Did you take down the poster
for our club in the hallway?

244
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,826
Why would we?

245
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,412
You guys fought with me about our clubs.

246
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,623
Hey, we don't even know
which club you're in.

247
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,666
That punk.

248
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,756
What does he take us for?

249
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,551
STUDENT UNION ROOM

250
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,678
What's this?

251
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,474
Hey, hide it. Hide that.

252
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,933
What is it?

253
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,270
COME! LET'S GO! SPONTANEOUS TRIPS!

254
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,898
-"A spontaneous trip"?
-That was close.

255
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,451
-Hi.
-Hi.

256
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,702
Oh, hey.

257
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,294
Hello.

258
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,171
Hey, Seol. You're here.

259
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:14,176
Seol, we have
a group reservation today, so…

260
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,806
Where did she go?

261
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,686
I'll be in front of the mart.
You can take your time.

262
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,771
Okay.

263
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,236
Tissue. There it is.

264
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,072
Towel.

265
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,199
GEONYEONG MART

266
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,088
What are you doing? Who are you?

267
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,382
-Ta-da!
-Ta-da!

268
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,094
What is this? What are you guys doing?

269
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:01,140
What do you think?
It's a spontaneous trip!

270
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,101
What?

271
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,104
ROMANTIC YOUNG RUNAWAYS!

272
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,527
Let's see. Bean sprouts.
Tofu. And ice cream?

273
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,070
Who's eating ice cream?

274
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,158
Bongbong.

275
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,330
Honey!

276
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,250
-Honey!
-Why? What is it?

277
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,918
-What is it?
-Honey.

278
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,797
Bongbong. It's Bongbong. It's gone.

279
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,966
What are you talking about?
Who's Bongbong?

280
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,885
Our car, Bongbong.

281
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,971
My baby. My car. Bongbong is gone.

282
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,808
Right, Ban-do was going through
the drawer this morning.

283
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,059
He must've taken it.

284
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,686
-What?
-Goodness.

285
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,564
Your license is suspended anyway.

286
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,482
-Let him take it.
-What?

287
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,234
What are you talking about?

288
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,279
How can he drive? He doesn't have

289
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,698
a license…

290
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,576
My neck.

291
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,997
Here's my driver's license.
Learn to trust people, will you?

292
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,665
Wait, let me see this.

293
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,001
Hey, this was issued a month ago?

294
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,753
What?

295
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,464
Hey, stop the car.
I'm getting off. Bo-reum, let's go.

296
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,591
You idiot. Then instead of this sign,

297
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,468
it should say you're a new driver.

298
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,844
A new driver, my foot.

299
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,680
Hey, I've been driving for 15 years.

300
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,390
A new driver? How ridiculous.

301
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,601
Jin-ju, tell them.

302
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,270
Hey, forget it.

303
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,689
Stop the car on the shoulder. I can't go.

304
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,067
Seol, don't you have work?

305
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,862
Yes, I do, but he got me off.

306
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,406
Why? I think it's fun.

307
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,283
Let's go. It'll be a good memory.

308
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,787
We can't be this spontaneous again.
Seol will get busy soon.

309
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,373
She's right. I think it'll be fun too.

310
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,874
Let's go, Jin-ju.

311
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,417
Let's go.

312
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,421
Okay, let's go. Fine, let's do it.

313
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,842
Let's go.

314
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,595
-Are you excited?
-Let's go to the beach!

315
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,434
Let's go. Keep going.

316
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,144
Let's go!

317
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,859
Let's go!

318
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,862
Keep going!

319
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,584
A trip?

320
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:39,423
Yes, her friends
suddenly snatched her or something.

321
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:43,969
But still, how could she leave
the jugs there like that?

322
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,388
It's fine.
We found them, so it's all good.

323
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,392
Goodness, those kids.
Why are they so spontaneous?

324
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,185
They're at that age.

325
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,772
Wait, are you sure
she went with her friends?

326
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,858
Did you hear other girls?

327
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,694
You're starting that nonsense again.

328
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,154
If it was a guy, even better.

329
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,364
-We can marry her off quickly.
-No.

330
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,866
I haven't decided

331
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,618
if I should let her marry
into that rich family.

332
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,246
What do you mean?

333
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,958
Is that Seo-jin or something
from a rich family?

334
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,002
Was it in her journal?

335
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,253
Who's that?

336
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,630
No? Then…

337
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,883
Was it Choi Ban-do?

338
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,219
Choi Ban-do? That wasn't his name either.

339
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,722
It was something Nam-gil.

340
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,974
Kang Nam-gil? Kim Nam-gil?

341
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,602
Anyway, he's the son

342
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,438
of the chairman of Hanguk University.

343
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,481
What?

344
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,983
Why would he like my daughter?

345
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,487
You need to stop that nonsense.

346
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:50,786
You know, that guy.
Choi Ban-do. He's the best.

347
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,456
He looks very clever,
so he'll never make her starve.

348
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,417
Hey, Ban-do. I'm hungry.

349
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,630
It's the right route.

350
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:06,176
Are we going to arrive
within the day, Mr. Driver?

351
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,887
You don't know the way, do you?

352
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,265
Do you think
the pharmaceuticals sold themselves?

353
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,268
I went all over the country to sell them.

354
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,896
The Korean map is already in my head.

355
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,981
My goodness.

356
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,693
It's about time we went through a tunnel.

357
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,864
What tunnel?

358
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,325
Daegwallyeong Tunnel.
Gangneung IC is right there.

359
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,868
We're almost there. Wait up.

360
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,996
-Hey.
-Be quiet and wait, will you?

361
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,873
No, that's not it.

362
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,501
Where's Daegwallyeong Tunnel?

363
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,419
What?

364
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,963
It's not on the map?

365
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:46,550
Wait, was it not around in 1999?

366
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,926
Darn it.

367
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,554
What's going on?
I'm starving. Just pull in anywhere.

368
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,514
What tunnel? This is ridiculous.

369
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,942
My back hurts.

370
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,863
Goodness.

371
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:11,032
I didn't know
Daegwallyeong Tunnel hadn't been built.

372
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,785
Where on earth are we?

373
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,912
I know, right? I can't see anything.

374
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,706
I don't see anything.

375
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,500
-Lose the sunglasses.
-Right.

376
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,669
-Are you hungry?
-I am.

377
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,921
I'm so hungry, I can eat a horse.

378
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,674
Korea's map is in your head? Like hell.

379
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,678
Hey, did you go grocery shopping?

380
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,555
Of course, we did.

381
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,848
Ta-da.

382
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,478
If we don't eat pork belly
when we're on a trip, pigs will be sad.

383
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,938
-Of course.
-How many geun did you get?

384
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,525
One geun per person, two geun for guys,
so a total of nine geun.

385
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,569
-What?
-Nine geun?

386
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,697
Did you never have meat
in your previous life?

387
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,658
Three would've been enough.
Who will eat all of this?

388
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,535
Isn't one geun one serving?

389
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,915
You didn't bring just meat, did you?

390
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,501
Of course, we didn't.
What do you think of us?

391
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,294
We got charcoal.

392
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,258
All right, then.
Let's eat meat until we drop.

393
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,219
Our tummies will be shocked.

394
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,639
-Let's eat.
-Sounds great.

395
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,476
Give me a second.

396
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,273
Okay, you're all at that age
when you eat a lot.

397
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,108
It's done. Dig in. Eat up.

398
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,485
-Nice.
-Gosh.

399
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,072
It's hot.

400
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,448
It's so good.

401
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,160
My gosh, this is amazing.

402
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,454
-Let's make a toast. Cheers.
-Cheers.

403
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,877
It feels like a real trip. I'm so happy.

404
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,792
That was awesome!

405
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,588
And bow.

406
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,322
-What are they doing?
-Hey, wake them up.

407
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,574
-Wake them up.
-Hey, guys. Wake up.

408
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,951
-Wake up.
-What is this?

409
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,120
-You can't do this here.
-Wake up.

410
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,830
Get up already.

411
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,998
-Get up.
-What have you kids done?

412
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,963
What do you think you're doing?

413
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,756
-I'm sorry.
-What is this nonsense?

414
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,009
What are you doing? Clean up. Hurry.

415
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,803
-I'm sorry.
-You can't do this.

416
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,852
What do you want?

417
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,775
What's going on? Hey.

418
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,986
Jin-ju, wake up.

419
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,908
Hey.

420
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,785
Hey, what happened to your face?

421
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,747
What happened to you? My gosh.

422
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,792
Gosh, these kids are so immature.

423
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,002
Hey, what is this?

424
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,967
Ban-do, you immature jerk!

425
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,731
That's the masterpiece of the century.
Your portrait.

426
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,900
You look like that when you get mad.

427
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,943
That stupid jerk.

428
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,654
Look at her.
She looks exactly the same. The same.

429
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,657
-Hey, why are you wiping it off?
-Seriously.

430
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,201
But it's hilarious.

431
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,453
Stop laughing.

432
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:53,625
Hey, go look in a mirror.
Your face is funnier.

433
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,503
Hey, wait. Why are you wiping it off?

434
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,342
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

435
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,846
You always look great in your uniform.

436
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,724
Is everything okay at school?

437
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,144
I think people are discussing
your dad's resignation.

438
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,230
He fell into the pond that he let rot.

439
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,023
What?

440
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:23,071
He'll find the dirtiest ways
to stick around, so don't worry.

441
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,907
That's not what I…

442
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,784
You--

443
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,869
What the heck? Let go.

444
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,123
Let go. I said let go. Hey! Let go.

445
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,626
Hey, let me go. Let go. Let go of me.

446
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,753
My goodness.

447
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,176
I should've yanked her hair.

448
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,595
It's your fault.

449
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:32,974
If that family even dares
to covet my son's money,

450
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,894
I'll just… Darn it.

451
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,487
Get out.

452
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,323
Take me to Cheongdam.

453
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,494
Do you pick up garbage you threw out?

454
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,123
What are you talking about?

455
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,709
I'm not your son.

456
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,670
You discarded me like garbage,

457
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,089
so don't pick it up.

458
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,426
You're disgusting.

459
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,429
What did you say?

460
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:17,060
My gosh. I can't believe it.

461
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,940
I didn't just come.

462
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,317
I brought you a gift.

463
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,927
NATURAL HOSPITAL GRAND OPENING

464
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,373
-Dok-jae.
-Yes?

465
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,291
-Look to your right.
-My right?

466
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,299
Hey, wake up!

467
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,261
It's the sea to our right. It's the sea.

468
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,559
It's so pretty.

469
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,022
-Look at the waves.
-My gosh.

470
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,314
The waves!

471
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,154
I love it!

472
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,113
It's the sea.

473
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,409
We'll be arriving shortly!

474
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,453
Everyone, scream!

475
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,125
ROMANTIC YOUNG RUNAWAYS!

476
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,141
Jin-ju, why aren't you coming in?

477
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,311
I'm fine! Have fun!

478
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,733
It's cold!

479
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,327
Gosh, they're so young.

480
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,306
The bathrooms are locked.

481
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,642
I didn't even wash my face.

482
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,645
Kids who never wash at home
always wash when they're away.

483
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,230
Just make do with what we have.

484
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,149
Yes, just wash up here.
We won't find anything else.

485
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,442
Hey, man.

486
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:12,985
Come on.

487
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,077
Hey, you.

488
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,247
-You're all dead.
-Hey, stop.

489
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,707
Come on, man. Stop.

490
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,000
Stop. I said stop.

491
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,588
Come at me!

492
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,388
-Sorry.
-We're sorry.

493
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:47,728
You little jerks. You're all dead.

494
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,648
Hey, Ban-do.

495
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,234
Stop that.

496
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,531
Honey, have some water.

497
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,662
Are you tired?

498
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,748
Why do you always ask?
We come here all the time.

499
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,499
I'm completely fine.

500
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,046
Anyway, I wonder if she's having fun.

501
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,549
Why doesn't she stay longer?
Why is she coming tomorrow?

502
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,052
Hey, she has to go to school.

503
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,931
Goodness, she won't die
from skipping a day of school.

504
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,724
Kids have to play.

505
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,726
Hey, you're right.

506
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,187
-It's our turn.
-Okay.

507
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,022
This is nice.

508
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,528
Mister.

509
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,698
Don't you see the jugs lined up?

510
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,866
It's our turn.

511
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,494
Then you should've come earlier.

512
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,913
You got here late, so I got to it first.

513
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,501
It took me ten seconds
to walk from over there.

514
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,919
How was I late?

515
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,672
Ten seconds? One, two, three.

516
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,509
Ten seconds are enough
to fill up half a jug.

517
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,845
You can go ahead. Honey, we'll be up soon.

518
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,847
Honey, did you cut the line again?

519
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,641
Goodness, come on.

520
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,477
-I'm sorry. Stop it.
-Why are you sorry?

521
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,437
Let me go. Hey.

522
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,274
There are ethics and rules
even at a spring.

523
00:37:56,357 --> 00:38:00,569
If there's no one at the water,
it's good manners to put the next jug in.

524
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,780
What a selfish old man.

525
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,657
What? "Selfish"?

526
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,326
How dare you
talk like that to a man, woman?

527
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,788
What? What did you just say? "Woman"?

528
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,415
How dare you talk to her that way?

529
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,792
Goodness, don't touch him, mister.

530
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,794
-Let him go.
-Let me go.

531
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:17,920
-Let go!
-You jerk.

532
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,882
-You jerk.
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

533
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,634
My goodness.

534
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,511
Honey.

535
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,763
How dare you touch me, you jerk?

536
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,808
What a great example
you must set for your kids.

537
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,310
I'm getting a stiff neck.

538
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,645
-You.
-Stop it.

539
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:40,151
Worry about your own kids. I'm scared
my son-in-law will be like you, old jerk.

540
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:44,447
How dare you pour water on me, woman?

541
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,824
I'm scared
my daughter-in-law will be like you!

542
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,285
-Honey, are you okay?
-Hey, you. I'll get you.

543
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,368
CLAM YARD

544
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,285
Is this it?

545
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:33,829
Hey.

546
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,707
Isn't that Nam-gil?

547
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,754
Why is he here?

548
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:46,133
This feels more like destiny
than a coincidence.

549
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,055
-Did you call him?
-Why would I?

550
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,141
Hey, I called him.

551
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,685
-What?
-What?

552
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,613
CLAM SPECIALTY

553
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:13,160
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.

554
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,996
How could you skip
the ceremony for an officer's wedding?

555
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,249
It wasn't easy to find a stand-in.

556
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,917
I'll buy dinner sometime.

557
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:21,794
I'm really sorry.

558
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,385
JUNE 1 TO 30, 1999
GANGNEUNG

559
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,763
OUR TOWN ATTRACTION, FIREFLIES

560
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,437
Exactly.

561
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,360
I don't have a mom.
Mind your own business.

562
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,365
It's all dry.

563
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,992
That dried quickly.

564
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,626
Hey.

565
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,171
Stop glaring.

566
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,340
The more the merrier.

567
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,550
Exactly.

568
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,678
Anyway, why did you suddenly call him?

569
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,848
Wait, do you like him?

570
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,227
-Should I set you up?
-Me? No.

571
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,563
He likes

572
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,482
her.

573
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,486
He rushed over
when I told him that she was here.

574
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:34,700
Come on. Don't tell everyone that.

575
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:38,537
Come on.
Why did he come here looking like that?

576
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,291
Shouldn't I take a photo
and report him to the ROTC?

577
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,375
Okay.

578
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,836
He's ruining their reputation.

579
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,297
Why? He looks nice.

580
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,090
Women fantasize about men in uniform.

581
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,510
Fantasize about men in uniform?
What the heck is that?

582
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,893
-Ta-da.
-Ta-da.

583
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,022
Why are they doing this?
Are you in kindergarten?

584
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,357
You should think of us too.

585
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,901
You may put it on, but we have to see it.

586
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,945
Hey, do you want to fight?

587
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,363
No.

588
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,033
Do you know how tough it was
to find this? You're just jealous.

589
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,410
-Right?
-Yes.

590
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,372
We have two more for tomorrow.
Do you want those?

591
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,124
No.

592
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,758
It's done.

593
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,428
-It looks good.
-That cooked nicely.

594
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:58,659
Why did you come here
in that uncomfortable uniform?

595
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,786
It's quite uncomfortable to look at.

596
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,913
-I'm fine.
-Me too.

597
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,959
I came to get some air.
I was stressed out.

598
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,211
You came quite far just for some air.

599
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,215
Why are you being rude
to someone who's much older?

600
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,842
Show some respect.

601
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,177
Are you crazy? I'm much older.

602
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,265
-He's crazy.
-He's insane.

603
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,766
It's fine.

604
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:26,353
I don't care about people
who are not my concern.

605
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,398
I'm not your concern?

606
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:31,817
Why not?

607
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,279
You should be greatly concerned about me.

608
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,156
Once you find out the truth,

609
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,450
you'll be so concerned
that you'll go crazy--

610
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,701
-Hey!
-Hey!

611
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,707
I mean, so…

612
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,837
Stop being rude
to a guest that I invited. Stop it.

613
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,256
Yes, exactly.

614
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,635
But you do seem a bit uncomfortable.

615
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,596
She's right. Don't you have
anything to change into?

616
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,222
It's fine.

617
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,099
I'm in this often.

618
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:08,103
He looks so nice in his uniform.
He's very handsome too.

619
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,022
-Right.
-Thanks.

620
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,566
A man's looks
won't bring food to the table.

621
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,109
Give me that.

622
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,320
What? This one?

623
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,072
Not that one. The one next to that.

624
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:18,989
Which one?

625
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,549
Anyway, this is great.
I've never been to Gangneung before.

626
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:41,762
Really? Then it's both of our first time
in Gangneung.

627
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,684
Have you two been to Gangneung?

628
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,400
I don't know. I don't remember.

629
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,073
Hey. You're so clumsy.

630
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,873
Man, I just dried this.

631
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,626
It's okay. It'll dry soon.

632
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,294
But it'll smell like beer.

633
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,046
Yes, it'll smell.

634
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,631
This isn't good.

635
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,926
-Ta-da. Put this on.
-Okay.

636
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,180
Then I'll wash it before I return this.

637
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,599
Hey, may I wear that too?

638
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,311
My uniform is uncomfortable.

639
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,982
Right? I knew it. It seemed like it.

640
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,650
Hey.

641
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:39,570
I want this.

642
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,989
Why? Your shirt is dry.

643
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,159
I think it shrank when it got wet.
It's uncomfortable.

644
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,536
Let go.

645
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,540
I look a bit more uncomfortable.

646
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,751
If it's that uncomfortable, lose the tie.

647
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,923
Let go. Now.

648
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:00,966
Let go.

649
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,931
Then you can wear my uniform.

650
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,558
I'm going to wear this.

651
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,496
-Look at them.
-They look ridiculous.

652
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,413
Seriously.

653
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,956
Look at them.

654
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,458
This is the best.

655
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,168
Gosh. Seriously.

656
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,295
This is hilarious.

657
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,886
MY LOVE, MY LOVE

658
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,142
This is so nice. Isn't it?

659
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,560
Yes, it is.

660
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,271
-Thank you.
-For what?

661
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:57,981
For everything.

662
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,902
If you didn't find me,
and I had taken a leave,

663
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,445
I would've regretted it forever.

664
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,114
I wouldn't have
any memories like today.

665
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,116
These will all be fond memories.

666
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,202
I'm really glad I came to college.

667
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,956
I want to make lots of memories too.

668
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,625
I'll make so many memories
so that I won't get bored

669
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,378
no matter how much
I look back on them when I get old.

670
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,172
-Then I want to be a part.
-Sounds great.

671
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,176
Wait, what is it?
Why are you leaving me out?

672
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,970
I want to be a part of it. What is it?

673
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,180
You're already a part of it.

674
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,017
I mean, why are you a part of this?

675
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,312
You got some air now, so go home.

676
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,273
The others said it's fine.

677
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,985
You're the only one against this.
Six to one.

678
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:46,905
Darn it.

679
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,078
Look at them.

680
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,876
Stay right behind us!

681
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:03,046
Why? You two make a cute couple.

682
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,466
Can you let them keep them?
They look great in them.

683
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,302
Yes, you can have that.

684
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,386
Nam-gil, keep it.

685
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,596
-No!
-No!

686
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,141
They like it. They're happy.

687
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,602
Darn it.

688
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,228
Hey, get closer.

689
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,231
This is awesome.

690
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,652
Hey, cute couple over there.

691
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,947
Eat up, okay?

692
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,119
-You have it.
-No, you.

693
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,667
I feel so bad for you.
You're missing your head

694
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,754
and your tail.

695
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,255
Shrimp, are you okay?

696
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,512
Let's eat all these poor shrimps for her.

697
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,272
Not this. No.

698
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:08,445
No, I mean food. We have no food.

699
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,280
What do you mean? You have food here.

700
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,367
We have shrimp crackers
and peanuts. Eat these.

701
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,911
I feel bad for the shrimp.

702
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,002
You should feel sorry for me the most.

703
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,840
You always do this when I'm washing up.

704
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:32,386
What do you mean? You're always here
when I'm about to wash up.

705
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,182
You must be thrilled.

706
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:41,895
But do you know that hot guys
are not worth crap in the end?

707
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,941
Jeong Nam-gil, the star lecturer
worth hundreds of billions. Remember?

708
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,445
Jeong Nam-gil?

709
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:55,033
Hey, look at him. That's amazing.

710
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,869
The man who reads history, Jeong Nam-gil.

711
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,455
Hey, that guy.

712
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,832
He liked me.

713
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,375
-Really?
-Yes.

714
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,711
Feel free to be delusional.

715
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,045
I'm serious.

716
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,257
Jeong Nam-gil, a lecturer
who makes 60 billion won a year.

717
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,591
I'm so jealous.

718
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,595
Right.

719
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,725
Yes, history major Jeong Nam-gil.

720
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,352
You're a smart one, Jin-ju.

721
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,187
You're after him because he's rich?

722
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:30,986
He liked me first.

723
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,779
I mean, he's perfect,

724
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,490
and he has great taste in women, right?

725
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,492
Goodness.

726
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:44,458
And what? I'm after him because he's rich?

727
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,917
Look who's talking.

728
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,837
After cursing Director Park
for doing the same thing.

729
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,464
What are you talking about?

730
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:55,052
You two looked great together.
What a beautiful couple.

731
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,851
Hey, that's not it!

732
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,980
What does she take me for?

733
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,525
Then I began to do this.

734
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:15,238
And then one more, two more.

735
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,158
Hey, did you come
all the way here to watch TV?

736
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,828
Hey, why did we come
to Gangneung of all places?

737
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,955
There's a good reason.

738
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,124
Are you going out?

739
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,044
Yes. Hey, have you seen Jin-ju?

740
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,046
No idea.

741
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,674
Hey, have you seen Jin-ju?

742
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,969
Yes. She went out for a walk.

743
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:01,118
-What are you up to?
-I took a look around.

744
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,579
I see. Then can you take another look?

745
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,582
I want to go for a walk.

746
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,423
I guess there used to be a lot of stars.

747
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,759
Or is it a countryside thing?

748
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:19,678
Hey.

749
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,390
About the other day. I was a little…

750
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:27,686
"I don't have a mom.
Mind your own business." That?

751
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,689
When did I say it like that?

752
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,900
You were tall,
so I thought he was a grown-up,

753
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,986
but he's still in the rebellious stage.

754
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,821
I meant the latter one.

755
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,782
Not that you don't have a mom?

756
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,994
Everyone has a mom.

757
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,163
They might be abroad or in heaven,

758
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,539
but they're somewhere.

759
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,543
Are you Park Hyeokgeose of Silla?
Did you come from an egg?

760
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,378
Everyone has their story.

761
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,422
You're right.

762
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,383
Every family has a story.

763
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:01,136
But you should still love them a lot
while you can see them

764
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,888
and touch them.

765
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,033
You'll regret it later.

766
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,954
Anyway, you keep talking down to me.

767
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,332
So does that punk.

768
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:35,170
Well, right. This neighborhood is pretty.

769
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,758
Look over there. It's very pretty.

770
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:04,574
I think we came too far.
Is this a dead-end?

771
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,034
I guess so.

772
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,954
Let's go.

773
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,248
Hey.

774
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,711
-I see something over there.
-Stop scaring me.

775
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,328
This is…

776
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,339
Fireflies.

777
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,136
Right, it's firefly season.

778
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,101
Gosh, they're so pretty.

779
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:45,633
You're cold.

780
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,220
But so am I.

781
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,238
I think this is the right place.

782
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,034
This is it.

783
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,475
Have you seen Jin-ju?

784
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,352
No.

785
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:40,814
Bring her out when I call later, okay?

786
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:41,856
Come on.

787
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,316
Hello?

788
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,652
Hey, Ban-do. Hey.

789
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,570
Why isn't he talking?

790
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,141
Have you two been to Gangneung?

791
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,648
I don't know. I don't remember.

792
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,025
There was…

793
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,281
also a time when my entire universe

794
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,451
revolved around you.

795
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,176
EPILOGUE

796
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,677
Goodness.

797
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:38,306
They say late bloomers party the hardest.

798
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:39,891
They were talking about her.

799
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:02,705
Let go.

800
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:04,541
You let go.

801
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,877
-Let go.
-You let go.

802
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,059
Darn it.

803
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,525
Old habits die hard, kid.

804
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,166
Darn it.

805
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,339
Hey.

806
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:23,030
Jin-ju should find a good man
and be happy this time.

807
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,323
She's still young.

808
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,784
Bo-reum isn't
some national treasure to be protected.

809
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,036
-Ta-da!
-I'm going to protect her!

810
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,373
Do you think we're guaranteed
to have Mom with us forever?

811
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,375
Don't regret it later.

812
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:38,045
Are you okay?
Why don't chronic illnesses heal?

813
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:41,132
I heard from other med students

814
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:44,969
that they think he went to Jin-ju
to cause trouble that night.

815
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,847
No, not earthquake records,
but predictions.

816
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,974
When will there be an earthquake in Seoul?

817
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:54,353
