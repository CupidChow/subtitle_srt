1
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,668
Stop shaking. Your knees are knocking.

2
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,254
Shaking? Who's shaking?
This is no big deal.

3
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,173
All I have to do is walk forward.

4
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,175
Okay, so stop shaking.

5
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:33,885
Look right here!

6
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,430
Here comes the groom.

7
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,022
The young groom is nervous.

8
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,823
It's fine.
As long as you're walking forward.

9
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,329
Here comes the bride.

10
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,088
-Dad, you're on my dress.
-What?

11
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,215
You're on my…

12
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,593
-Goodness.
-Jin-ju!

13
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,720
-Oh no.
-My goodness.

14
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,764
Are you okay? Did you hurt your leg?

15
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,724
You scared me.

16
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,740
Weddings are always a happy ending

17
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,576
in romantic dramas.

18
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,620
For the protagonists
who overcame trials and tribulations,

19
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:46,291
marriage is the fruit
and the destination of their love.

20
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,883
Our protagonists,
who only have happy days ahead,

21
00:02:55,383 --> 00:03:00,096
opened the door of blessing
and lived happily ever after.

22
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,903
Choi Ban-do and Ma Jin-ju's divorce
has been granted.

23
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,449
COURTHOUSE

24
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,952
FOURTEEN YEARS LATER

25
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,795
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

26
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,095
What?

27
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,723
Thanks for trying.

28
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,017
I should at least try to console you.

29
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,228
Fine.

30
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,650
Sure, asshole.

31
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,320
You tried hard for the last 18 years.

32
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,863
Man, you psycho.

33
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,990
Just make sure to pay alimony on time.

34
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,826
Not like it's that much money.

35
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,246
I might not make a lot of money,

36
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,499
but I'll make sure
to pay on time, you cheapskate.

37
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,668
You're such a petty loser to the end.

38
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,504
Gosh, you just figured that out?
That's who I am.

39
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,842
Hey, Jin-ju.

40
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,222
What?

41
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,103
Please let me see

42
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,438
Seo-jin often.

43
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,151
Okay.

44
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,704
Did the protagonists in romantic dramas

45
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,581
continue to live happily ever after?

46
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,885
FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE DIVORCE

47
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,304
ONE MONTH BEFORE THE DIVORCE

48
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,848
Mommy?

49
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,688
-Seo-jin, Mommy is in here.
-Mommy.

50
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,315
Mommy is in here.

51
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,442
Mommy.

52
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,028
Mommy.

53
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,034
Goodness, Seo-jin, are you happy now?

54
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,160
You couldn't wait?

55
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,039
-Goodness.
-My gosh.

56
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,500
You startled me.
Close the door when you poop.

57
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,299
And why are you holding the kid
while pooping?

58
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,639
Goodness, Seo-jin. Let's play.

59
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,308
Look, there's your toy.

60
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,937
Hey!

61
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,482
What?

62
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,158
Forget it.

63
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,620
Goodness, Seo-jin. Hi there.

64
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,538
All right. What's that?

65
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,792
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY

66
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,835
What did I expect from him?

67
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,504
What did I expect?

68
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,549
My goodness.

69
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,970
My gosh. Why did he…

70
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,474
Gosh, he didn't have to get me anything.

71
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,105
He has pretty good taste.

72
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,314
These look expensive.

73
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,234
Why did he get me these?

74
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,152
Are these too fancy?

75
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,279
Hey, you!

76
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,823
Why did you open this?

77
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,659
-Why? It's for me--
-It's Director Lee's wedding anniversary.

78
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,828
It's for his wife. Don't touch it.

79
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,830
Why did you open it?

80
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,747
Give me that.

81
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,588
What's the front door code?

82
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,298
What are you talking about?

83
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,260
What's the front door code?

84
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,762
Why are you doing this again?

85
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,514
It's 0720. Why?

86
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,682
What day is that?

87
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,268
Our wedding anniversary. July 20th.

88
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,314
That's today.

89
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,406
Honey, put that down. Calm down.

90
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,200
Let's talk it out, okay? Let's talk.

91
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,203
-Talk?
-No, wait.

92
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,705
Do you want us all to die?

93
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,331
I can't work without that.

94
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,584
A salesperson's planner is like bullets.

95
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,962
I'll die if I go to war without it.
It's suicide.

96
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:46,424
Everything from doctors' birthdays
to appointments is in there.

97
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,010
Okay! I'll buy one for you.

98
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,887
I'll buy you something even better!

99
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,180
Forget it.

100
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,516
Hey, wait. Hey!
I've been too patient with you.

101
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,935
That's what puts food on the table.
You're so dumb.

102
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,106
You think this planner
puts food on the table?

103
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,484
Even if I went and sold gum,
I'd still make more than you.

104
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,403
Don't get cocky
about your pathetic salary.

105
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,071
You cheap, petty jerk!

106
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,658
What? Petty?

107
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,578
My neck.

108
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,121
-My neck.
-Goodness.

109
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,290
Okay, fine. I'm petty.

110
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,125
And yes, my salary is pathetic.

111
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,546
So please just put that down.
Let's talk after you put it down.

112
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,591
You're really sad.

113
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,967
Is this a treasure chest?

114
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,260
Of course, it is!

115
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,262
That paid for the food you eat,

116
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,473
the clothes you're wearing,
and the diapers.

117
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,142
If anything happens to that, I swear

118
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,602
I'll divorce you.

119
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,438
-What?
-I'll divorce you!

120
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,953
Hey! You!

121
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,372
Seriously?

122
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,208
Man.

123
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,628
KOREA PHARMACEUTICALS

124
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,730
-Hello, Director Kim.
-Mr. Choi.

125
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,732
You're supposed to deliver the IV today.

126
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,193
-Excuse me?
-What's wrong with you?

127
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,738
Right, I'm sorry.
I'll head over in ten minutes.

128
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,414
Seriously. Darn it, Jin-ju.

129
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,332
KOREA PHARMACEUTICAL

130
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,445
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,196
My planner got wet…

132
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,282
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,622
Hey, Seo-jin. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

134
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,876
Goodness, I'm sorry. Mommy is sorry.

135
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,175
I told him to change the light bulb.

136
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,595
Okay, all done.

137
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,682
Hey, this one is about to go out too.

138
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,143
You should change it now.
It'll ruin your eyes.

139
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,896
I'm really good at changing light bulbs.

140
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,648
I'll take that.

141
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,192
Here. Give it here.

142
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,909
Goodness, it's hot. It's very hot.

143
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,703
Do we have any reports?

144
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,413
-It's due tomorrow.
-Is it?

145
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,672
SEO UNIVERSITY

146
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,232
Hey, lady.

147
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,650
Lady!

148
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,905
-Me?
-I said to move out of my way.

149
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,324
Right. Okay.

150
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:41,218
As always,
Mr. Choi puts on the best shows.

151
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,053
All done!

152
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,600
For Director Min, a shot of sweet cola.

153
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,519
-Here.
-What a smart guy.

154
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,148
-Don't do that again.
-Yes, sir!

155
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,692
Seriously. You never make mistakes.

156
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,943
What happened today?

157
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,028
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,989
Wake up, idiot. Wake up.

159
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,868
Please enjoy as much as you'd like.
It's on me.

160
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,413
While we're on the subject,
should I order 15 more bottles of liquor?

161
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,999
Goodness, no. This is enough.

162
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,376
Good thing
you didn't mess up with Director Park.

163
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,047
Does that jerk still make you
manage his mistress?

164
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,090
Well, something like that.

165
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,719
Does he think salesmen are his minions?

166
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,679
It's because his in-laws are rich.

167
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,266
He hits on young nurses in the hospital
his father-in-law opened for him.

168
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,768
That jerk.

169
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,478
Seriously.

170
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,607
Shall we have a drink?

171
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,361
Seo-jin, what's wrong? Oh no.

172
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,321
Why do you keep throwing up?

173
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,448
What do I do?

174
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:54,208
Okay. It's all right. There, there.

175
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,673
What is he doing? Why won't he pick up?

176
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,675
There, there.

177
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,222
May I please take this?

178
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,893
Hello, Director Park.

179
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,104
You need to go to Ms. Kim right now.

180
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,481
My wife is onto me. Darn it.

181
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,526
Wait, right now?

182
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,152
Yes, right now.

183
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:25,823
Yes, sir.

184
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,328
-You need to come out.
-My gosh, why?

185
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,496
Come quickly.

186
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,999
My wife might beat her to death.

187
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:38,711
Make sure she doesn't lay a hand on her
until I get there, okay?

188
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,004
You need to hurry.

189
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,047
-My gosh.
-Come on. Hurry.

190
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,509
Why? I'm meeting Director Park here.

191
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,094
This day sucks.

192
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,014
You'll be bleeding before he gets here.

193
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,057
-We have to hurry. Now.
-What's with you?

194
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,017
You!

195
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,103
I'm screwed.

196
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,064
You bitch. I got you.

197
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,985
Ma'am, one second. Please.

198
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:08,866
How dare a young brat like you
hit on a married man?

199
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,161
Ma'am, it's not like that.

200
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,205
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Do you think you're the first one?

201
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,083
Wait, ma'am. Please calm down.

202
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,878
Please talk it out. Let's be civil.

203
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,421
You again?

204
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,591
Are you Hyeon-seok's shield
for covering his affairs?

205
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,551
Why do you keep butting in?

206
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,221
Move aside. I said move aside. Move.

207
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,016
Ma'am. That really hurts. It hurts.

208
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,185
It hurts. It really hurts.

209
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,313
You jerk.

210
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:43,317
Goodness, ma'am.
I didn't do that on purpose. I…

211
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,616
Have you gone crazy?
How dare you touch her?

212
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,663
Honey.

213
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,877
He'll be fine now.

214
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,798
It was acute enteritis,
so be careful what you feed him.

215
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,883
-Thank you.
-Sure.

216
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,105
Seo-jin.

217
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,774
Mommy is sorry.

218
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,284
FROM GOLD CARD, TO MR. CHOI BAN-DO

219
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,088
I said keep my girlfriend safe,

220
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,798
not hurt my wife.

221
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,136
How dare you touch her?

222
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,518
That one punch
made her forget about this affair.

223
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,147
You know
I didn't mean anything when I hit you.

224
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,108
I hit you on purpose. To put on a show.

225
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,782
I hear you're one of the top salespeople.

226
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,536
It's understandable.
I buy so much through you.

227
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,789
Let it go quietly, okay?

228
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,499
Bring any new medicine you have.

229
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,461
You need to keep your numbers up, right?

230
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,011
That jerk. I should just…

231
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,732
Are you feeling better?

232
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,321
Why? Did anything happen?

233
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,739
No, your face.

234
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,493
I got drunk and fell down.
I should quit drinking.

235
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,040
I really like you.

236
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,125
I knew I could count on my alumnus.

237
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,586
Why didn't I know you back in college?

238
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,756
Civil Engineering, right?

239
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,007
Yes, you're right.

240
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,551
I wish I'd known you back then.

241
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,805
I was really bad with girls.

242
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,685
Right? I'm sure
we must've run into each other.

243
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,149
If I'd known you back then,
I would've killed you already.

244
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,113
Here. Thanks for letting me use your name.

245
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,991
Why? You can keep using it. Go ahead.

246
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,285
I'm not even paying. It's just my name.

247
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,496
Even if the statements don't come home,

248
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,872
she figures it out.

249
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,083
Man, she looked really dense,

250
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,252
so it was easy to get her to marry me.

251
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,796
But that woman
is getting sharper with age.

252
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,434
CREDIT CARD STATEMENT

253
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:05,978
What is this?

254
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,982
"Motel. Hotel."

255
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,244
MIN-JEONG

256
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:26,290
Jin-ju, isn't this your husband?

257
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,250
I just saw him while passing by.

258
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,668
Just wanted to make sure.

259
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,128
I can't come home today.

260
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,608
I can't go home looking like this.

261
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:52,960
Hey.

262
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,712
How could you do this to me?

263
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,756
How could you?

264
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,846
I'm not in the mood to fight today.

265
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,015
I don't even have the energy.

266
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,602
Do you have any idea
how much you've ruined my life?

267
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,105
My life has become a crap hole

268
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,233
because I met you.

269
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:18,986
What about me?

270
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,032
Do you know
what kind of abuse I take while working?

271
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,829
I'm treated like I'm subhuman.

272
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,248
Do you have any idea

273
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,293
what my life is like?

274
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,340
My life is also a mess because of you!

275
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,926
Is that my fault?

276
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,137
Then whose fault is it?

277
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,015
Is it mine?

278
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,352
I want a divorce.

279
00:21:58,984 --> 00:21:59,818
What?

280
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,237
We're unhappy.

281
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,032
I'm miserable.

282
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,577
I shouldn't have met you.

283
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,080
I want to undo it all.

284
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:16,501
I want to turn back time
and undo everything.

285
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,006
Let's get a divorce.

286
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,968
We're done.

287
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,556
Fine.

288
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,811
Let's get divorced.

289
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:37,981
Let's get divorced.

290
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,110
Let's get divorced!

291
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,134
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY

292
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,736
KO EUN-SUK RESTS HERE

293
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,155
Have you been well, Mom?

294
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,033
I'm sorry I couldn't come more often.

295
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,078
I'm such a jerk.

296
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,833
I was busy raising my own kid
and forgot about my mom.

297
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,668
Right?

298
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,462
But I'm sure you wouldn't be angry
if you saw Seo-jin.

299
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,549
He's really adorable.

300
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,927
Much more than your daughter.

301
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,681
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

302
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,395
What's with me? I'm so silly.

303
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,358
Mom, your daughter has become

304
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,735
a crybaby with age.

305
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,453
URI MART

306
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,122
-How much is it?
-That's 3,000 won.

307
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,041
-Long time no see.
-Right.

308
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,543
Why are you home?

309
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,587
Did your wife run away?

310
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,047
Forever.

311
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:31,094
Goodness, you're all grown up,
but you're still such a prankster.

312
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,763
-Have a good night.
-Thanks.

313
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,104
Are you okay?

314
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,564
Did you do it?

315
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,275
Did the judge really bang the gavel
granting your divorce?

316
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,363
-Hello?
-Why won't you tell us?

317
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,365
Did the judge bang the gavel?

318
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,660
I told you not to call.

319
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,120
No, wait.

320
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,580
What about the alimony?

321
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,749
How much do you have to give her?

322
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,167
Give it to me.

323
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,253
Hey, it's me. Jae-u.

324
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,255
He's completely hammered. Yes.

325
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,967
Get some rest
and call me when you're better.

326
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:11,885
Okay.

327
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,436
What? I'm curious.

328
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,940
Why are you curious
about someone else's divorce?

329
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,775
Because I want to do it too.

330
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,153
You're a jerk.

331
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,822
Why? You've never been married.

332
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,951
Do you know the pain
of the 12 million married men in Korea?

333
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,702
No idea. How would I know?

334
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,204
I'm so jealous.

335
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,332
I hope you never find out
until the day you die, jerk.

336
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,833
Are you taunting me?

337
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,382
What is this?

338
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,635
Did you put charcoal on your head?

339
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,304
It's hair thickening spray!

340
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,807
My hair transplants are falling out as is.

341
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,225
My precious hair.

342
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,686
Man. Give me a freaking break, will you?

343
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,564
Anyway, why did they
suddenly get divorced?

344
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,482
That's life.

345
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,486
Even the all-consuming love like theirs
doesn't last forever.

346
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,198
I mean, look at you.
You're a perfect example.

347
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,703
I told you not to mention Bo-reum.

348
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,830
I didn't.

349
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,332
I was talking about you in college.

350
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,753
You and your first love.

351
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,384
Hey, you.

352
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,845
Well, it's great weather to die.

353
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,182
-What's great?
-I told you to never mention Bo-reum!

354
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,643
Hey, man.

355
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,437
Are you going to do that again?

356
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,314
Hey! Do whatever the heck you want.

357
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:58,700
YUN BO-REUM AEROBICS

358
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,703
Stretch!

359
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,666
Stretch! I want more energy!

360
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,420
Stretch! We'll keep going!

361
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,299
Stretch! You're all doing great!

362
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,596
Hey, Jin-ju. Are you free to talk?

363
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,432
What about Seo-jin?

364
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,684
Did you get custody?

365
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,479
What a relief.

366
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,731
Seems like just yesterday

367
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,192
when you were thrilled
to finally get pregnant.

368
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,069
How did this suddenly happen?

369
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,071
What made you do it?

370
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,614
DIRECTOR YUN BO-REUM

371
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,742
Wait, was Ban-do having an affair?

372
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,411
No, it's nothing like that.

373
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,537
Bo-reum.

374
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,375
I'll tell you later when I feel up to it.

375
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,876
Okay.

376
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,800
It's the eighth year after his death…

377
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,301
-Hey, Uncle Ban-do.
-Hey.

378
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,053
Where do you think you're going?

379
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,098
You rotten bastard.
Stop getting into trouble.

380
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,849
Why do you care?

381
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:05,850
That little…

382
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,147
Goodness, that dumbhead.
I should just enlist him in the army.

383
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:15,235
Ja-yeon, don't call your son a dumbhead.

384
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:18,947
You dumbhead.

385
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,075
Wait, I…

386
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,079
Why did you have an affair, you bastard?

387
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,790
Dang it.

388
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,967
What are you looking at?

389
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,699
What's happening?

390
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,204
Sir!

391
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,624
Wait, sir!

392
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,543
But this is unfair and…

393
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,983
-Mom!
-My gosh.

394
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,527
Are you okay? The earthquake.

395
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,487
What earthquake?

396
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,906
You're giving my head an earthquake.

397
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:25,907
Go back to sleep!

398
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,496
The bus just shook very violently.
Very dramatically.

399
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,914
It was an earthquake.

400
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:37,585
Hey, lady. It's not like I was going fast.
What do you mean, it shook?

401
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,797
My stomach hurts.

402
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,635
Gosh, my stomach.

403
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,138
It's killing me.

404
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,270
Mom, can you make bean sprout soup?

405
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,188
Bean sprout soup, my foot.

406
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,690
I'm heartbroken too.

407
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:51,993
URI MART

408
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,671
Gosh, disinfection trucks are
still a thing?

409
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,798
Goodness, my stomach hurts.

410
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:11,429
Yes, when my tummy hurts,
what I need is something fiery and spicy.

411
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,681
Wait, what's with the expiration date?

412
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,186
What? This one too.

413
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,897
Ma'am. The expiration dates are all weird.

414
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,816
I know retro is the fad right now,

415
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,235
but you can't go retro
with expiration dates.

416
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,321
What are you talking about?

417
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,699
What do you mean? It's still far from now.

418
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,162
Wait. What happened to your face?

419
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,497
What about my face?

420
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,873
You look too young.

421
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,502
Goodness, come on.
There you go, joking around again.

422
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,380
-How old do I look?
-Forty?

423
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,466
Are you teasing me? I'm only 30.

424
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,761
And why are you calling me "ma'am"?
Goodness.

425
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:55,223
Did you get Botox? Yes, you did.

426
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,392
-Did you get something?
-No.

427
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,602
Botox? What's that?

428
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,313
Wait! Step aside! Quickly!

429
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:07,068
What's going on? What's with my face?

430
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,949
Mom! Dad!

431
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,410
What?

432
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:19,998
What is it?

433
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,210
MAY 1999

434
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:29,674
I think…

435
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,386
I came from the future.

436
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,556
Mom.

437
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,977
Mom.

438
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,895
Jin-ju, what's wrong?

439
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:48,317
Jin-ju. What's wrong, Jin-ju?

440
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,527
Jin-ju.

441
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,030
What's wrong?

442
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,244
Mom?

443
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,835
You never showed up in my dreams.

444
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,130
What a lucky dream.

445
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,468
Mom. Goodness, Mom.

446
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,927
Goodness, Mom.

447
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,180
-What's with you?
-Mom.

448
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,265
I'm sorry, Mom.

449
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,145
I couldn't tell you yesterday,

450
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,439
but I got divorced, Mom.

451
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,735
I wanted to make our marriage work, but…

452
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,528
I'm sorry, Mom.

453
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,783
Should I just die and go to you?

454
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:42,538
Please take me with you.
Take me with you, okay?

455
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:46,417
I want to go be with you, Mom.

456
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,171
Have you finally lost it?

457
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,340
Am I Death?
Why would you die to be with me?

458
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:56,135
If you want to die, die alone.
I'm going to live forever.

459
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,971
What nonsense is this
first thing in the morning?

460
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,019
It hurts. Why does it hurt?

461
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,360
Goodness. My gosh.

462
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,279
My gosh, it hurts. But why?

463
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,572
Why does it hurt?

464
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,032
-You beat yourself.
-Ouch.

465
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,200
-That's why.
-Ouch.

466
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,493
Get up and go to school.

467
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,291
That hurt.

468
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,452
My denim vest.

469
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,228
How does this make any sense?

470
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,189
How could this happen?

471
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,611
Get to school!

472
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,280
Is it good?

473
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,823
You're so adorable.

474
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:41,782
-Mom.
-Yes?

475
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,076
He needs to go
to the school for gifted kids.

476
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,245
Other kids don't start talking this early.

477
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,291
-He crawled and flipped over early.
-Right?

478
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,252
Mom, I'm really going to school, right?

479
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,587
Then what? You won't?

480
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,380
Mom, I'm really 20, right?

481
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,465
Then are you 40?

482
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,509
Mom, am I really Choi Ban-do,
Civil Engineering freshman?

483
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,721
Yes, you are. You're right.

484
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,681
You're right, you punk-ass.

485
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,517
Why are you talking crazy
so early in the morning?

486
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,812
-Dad, that hurt so much.
-What?

487
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,398
I love it. It means this isn't a dream.

488
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,275
Dad, can you hit me again?

489
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,152
Come on.

490
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,447
What the heck is up with you?

491
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,242
You've gone completely cuckoo!

492
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,159
Gosh!

493
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,621
Are you nuts?

494
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,756
Right. Ja-yeon. He's a total dumbhead.

495
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,549
You should have him enlisted now.

496
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,301
How dare you call him a dumbhead?

497
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,719
You said it yourself.

498
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,763
Have you gone insane?

499
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:46,764
Hey!

500
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,351
What's wrong with him?

501
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,110
Goodness, honey. It's too early--
Oh my gosh.

502
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,572
-Hey, Mom.
-What's with you? You're grossing me out.

503
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,865
Come on.

504
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,576
Is this your new strategy?

505
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,538
Do you think I'll buy you a cell phone?

506
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,498
Dream on.

507
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,586
Goodness, Mom. My gosh.

508
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:54,749
KO EUN-SUK RESTS HERE

509
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,176
What are you doing?

510
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:11,557
You couldn't even imagine
what's happening to me right now.

511
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,477
Is this a reward from above?

512
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,521
I don't know what's happening right now,

513
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,358
but I think I know what's about to happen.

514
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,486
-Go away!
-That's cold.

515
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:27,156
Why are you following me around
all morning?

516
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,824
Go to school!

517
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,369
That was cold. So cold.

518
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,661
This is cold.

519
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,251
Honey! Take her with you!

520
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,380
I don't want to. What school?
Why would I go to school?

521
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,882
-Why would I go?
-What's with you?

522
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,008
Okay.

523
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:50,096
Jin-ju, just come here.

524
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,056
She won't fall for it.

525
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,059
Why did you take out your suitcase?

526
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,479
We said we'd leave home
if you don't buy us cell phones.

527
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,022
Jin-ju and I will keep our word.

528
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,236
How old are you?

529
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,197
What? You'll leave home
if she won't get you a phone?

530
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,990
How dare you threaten Mom?

531
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,202
Are you crazy? I'm your older sister!

532
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,956
Yes, you are my older sister.

533
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,083
But I'm older now.

534
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:23,337
How dare you threaten your mom
who raised you? You ingrate.

535
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,924
You're going to regret this so much
once she passes away.

536
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,510
-Okay? When she passes away.
-Hey!

537
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,473
You've been going on about this
since this morning.

538
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,350
Are you wishing for my death?

539
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,730
-Honey!
-Yes. I'm coming.

540
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,108
-Dad.
-I'll take her.

541
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,402
Stop causing a ruckus. Come out.

542
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,487
-Go.
-Wait.

543
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,239
No. I want to stay with you.

544
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,324
If you ever say you'll leave home again,

545
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,702
I'm going to kill you, okay?

546
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,289
This wasn't even my idea.
You came up with this yesterday.

547
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,127
I did?

548
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,176
It's because we're all talk.

549
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,635
We need to show them.

550
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,055
You need to pack up too.

551
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,850
Everyone else has a phone but us.

552
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,520
I'm leaving home.

553
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,564
They can live by themselves.

554
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:27,818
Goodness.

555
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:31,947
Wait, you…

556
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,037
They bought you one.

557
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,080
You only got her one.

558
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:45,836
I want one too. I want a phone, Mom.

559
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,797
-Go to school.
-Mom, stop.

560
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,466
-Go.
-Why are you hitting me?

561
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,801
-I'm staying with you.
-Go to school.

562
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,345
-No, stop!
-What now?

563
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,472
-I'm not going to school.
-I want a phone.

564
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,892
-Just take her to school already!
-That stings.

565
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,311
-Wait, Mom!
-I'm not leaving!

566
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,527
We can never have
a quiet day at home because of you girls.

567
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,197
Stop asking Mom for a phone. End of story.

568
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,248
Why are you staring at me?

569
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,096
It's real. This is really my school.

570
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,847
Is this a dream?

571
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,642
It can't be a dream. It's too real.

572
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,194
Why am I at school?

573
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,957
Jin-ju.

574
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,502
Should I ask Mom for the phone?

575
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,173
See you later.

576
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:22,349
Wait, why is she pouting?

577
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,059
And she's speaking politely too.

578
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,192
Goodness, they're all so adorable.

579
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,747
Gosh, I'm so pretty.

580
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,416
Look at my skin. Goodness.

581
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,838
Goodness.
No medicine in the world can cure that.

582
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,674
Okay. All right!

583
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,769
I used to drink all the time over there.

584
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,190
My gosh, a CD player?

585
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,572
Denim on denim. Awesome.

586
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,284
NOTICE

587
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,536
The year 1999.

588
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,330
Salute!

589
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,217
Let's never wake up from this dream.

590
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,933
YOUTH MISSION CAMP

591
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,018
Everything is the same as before.

592
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,690
No, I'm in the past.

593
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,650
What is happening to me?

594
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,111
Whatever. That's not important.

595
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,324
Gosh. Enjoy it while you can.

596
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,915
Goodness, no. I went out on this day…

597
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,461
DOOMSDAY IS NEAR
THE LAST PROPHECY BY NOSTRADAMUS

598
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,674
A GUIDE LECTURE FOR FRESHMEN

599
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,728
Youth is so wonderful.

600
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,578
Ban-do?

601
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,542
What? Jin-ju?

602
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,272
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

603
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,191
CHOI BAN-DO, MA JIN-JU

604
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,569
My life was ruined because I met you.

605
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:24,323
If there is a god,
I'd sell my soul to avoid meeting you.

606
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,581
We shouldn't have met.

607
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:37,127
I want to turn back the time
and undo everything.

608
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,963
I want to undo it all.

609
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:10,869
What's this?

610
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,540
Are we strangers right now?

611
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,168
Is that so?

612
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:21,588
We're still strangers.

613
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,675
Fine, let's stay as strangers forever.

614
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,678
There's no reason for us to meet.
My goodness, seriously.

615
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,140
I was in a good mood.
Why did I have to see him?

616
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,727
He always looked like a wuss.

617
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:39,022
What did I ever see in him? Darn you.

618
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,027
Anyway, where am I supposed to go?

619
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,738
Ready, halt!

620
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,532
-Salute!
-Salute!

621
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,076
-Fall out.
-Fall out.

622
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,457
My goodness, what are they doing?

623
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,168
You're making this old woman's heart race.

624
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,087
Who are those guys?

625
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,136
He's…

626
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,567
You're going to get sick. Slow down.

627
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,776
I won't take your food.

628
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:29,531
What? Hey, I already ate.

629
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,199
Why would I take your food?

630
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,284
Seo-jin.

631
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,661
He won't last long.

632
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,539
He'll get whiny soon.

633
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,628
That's dirty. Give it to Mommy.

634
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,466
Where is the mysophobic Jin-ju

635
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,010
who never even shared stew
with other people?

636
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,721
Try raising a kid. See if that's possible.

637
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:56,224
Well, Seo-jin is so cute,

638
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,185
mysophobia can't win against him.

639
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,437
You must be so happy all the time.

640
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,481
Isn't that right, Seo-jin?

641
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:06,360
The man who made Korea
fall for Korean history.

642
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,903
The man who reads history.

643
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,030
-Jeong Nam-gil.
-He's a big shot now.

644
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,949
He's always on TV.

645
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,992
-He is a book publisher.
-Who?

646
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,870
-And he recently got into the business…
-I remember him.

647
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,873
He used to like me.

648
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,000
He asked me out too.

649
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,711
Yes, I remember.

650
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,713
You turned him down in a weird way.

651
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,883
I didn't turn him down in a weird way.

652
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,553
"I don't know much about men yet."

653
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,222
That's all I said.

654
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,727
Anyway, that's amazing.
Sales of 60 billion won?

655
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,730
But then again, he was always a big shot.

656
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,525
Right, we found out much later

657
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,360
that he was a son of a chairman.

658
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,862
Yes, we found out after we graduated.

659
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,281
Gosh, Jin-ju.

660
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:56,910
Why did you kick away
a walking pot of gold like him?

661
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,162
I must've been out of my mind.

662
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,874
And I had no idea he was a pot of gold.

663
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,335
Anyway, I hear he's still single.

664
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,714
Is it because he never got over you?

665
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:11,967
That's right.

666
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:17,097
For a man,
his first love stays with him for life.

667
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,479
Look at how elegant he looks.

668
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,733
He looks like
he'll never run out of money.

669
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,820
I must've been insane
to turn down a guy like that.

670
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,081
Wait, what was that?

671
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,791
Did he just look away?

672
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,376
Is he nervous?

673
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,795
Come on.

674
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,883
My gosh. Goodness.

675
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,010
Hey.

676
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,769
Goodness. My gosh.

677
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,438
Gosh, Bo-reum.

678
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,857
What? What is it?

679
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,819
Yes, you were this young.

680
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,614
Gosh, look at your skin.

681
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,865
And no neck wrinkles.

682
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,327
What has gotten into you?
Do you feel sick?

683
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,997
The unimaginable just happened to me.

684
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,959
I'm 20 years old again, and so are you.

685
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:31,088
Yes, I'm sure that's unimaginable.

686
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,717
Gosh, I haven't been on campus in ages.

687
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,886
Sure. Not in 17 hours.

688
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,098
I envy their youth.

689
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,682
Youth? What?

690
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,810
Why are you being so cringy?

691
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,899
Man, even the air is different.

692
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,068
It's great to be young.

693
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,829
-Look at her skirt.
-Look at that.

694
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,961
Excuse me, young lady.

695
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,088
Your skirt.

696
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,886
There's no reason
to give those babies a peep show, right?

697
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,891
Goodbye, then.

698
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:27,769
"Young lady"?

699
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,313
Hey, Professor Kim.

700
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,399
Hello.

701
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,402
Yes, College of Engineering.

702
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:39,614
I knew it. My crazy good memory. Okay.

703
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,120
Hey.

704
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,463
You came like that?

705
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,133
Who is this skinny dude?

706
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,929
Jae-u, you little rascal.
You look the same as before.

707
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,057
Hey, where are your muscles?

708
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,976
Where did your muscles go?

709
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:12,731
And what are you wearing?

710
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,817
Yes, I remember. The yellow uniform!

711
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,153
We used to walk around in this.

712
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,489
Yes, you're right.

713
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,326
And you didn't

714
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,078
wear it? Why not?

715
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,873
Did you lose your mind
before facing death?

716
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,959
Darn it, this is making me sick.

717
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,880
Hey, why would I die?

718
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,049
And how can we go around in this?

719
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,383
What are we, chicks?

720
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,180
HANGUK UNIVERSITY CIVIL ENGINEERING

721
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,191
Are you out of your mind?

722
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,318
Or are you a new rebel?

723
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,780
You knew we were gathering today
but didn't wear the department uniform.

724
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,491
Man, what are the chances?

725
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,661
Am I being hazed at this age?

726
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,456
Goodness, you young kids.

727
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,875
Your eyes might pop out.

728
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:17,796
Did you laugh?

729
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,507
Hey, he just laughed.

730
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,841
He's laughing.

731
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,470
Okay, it happens.

732
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,013
A uniform isn't important.

733
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,392
Exactly. I completely forgot to wear it.

734
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:33,061
Do you know

735
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,772
why everyone is gathered here?

736
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,818
Tell me.

737
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,282
Yes, a mad dog

738
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:49,244
from the freshmen class

739
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,330
got into another fight with upperclassmen

740
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,249
from Physical Education.

741
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,294
Did you get that?

742
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,673
Who was it? What ignorant idiot
went out and got into a fight?

743
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,883
And with upperclassmen at that.

744
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,760
I mean, in this day and age?

745
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,054
How dare you
throw punches at upperclassmen?

746
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:12,309
He needs to be beaten with a bat
until it breaks to learn his lesson.

747
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,269
Who was it? Who's the jerk?

748
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,353
Hey!

749
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,689
It was you.

750
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,232
Sorry?

751
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,193
CIVIL ENGINEERING,
PHYSICAL EDUCATION

752
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,739
Hey, freshmen.

753
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,615
Nice uniform. Are you chicks?

754
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,534
-Chicks, peep-peep.
-Peep-peep.

755
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,244
-Peep-peep.
-Peep-peep.

756
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,998
What did you jerks say?

757
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,625
How dare you yell at upperclassmen?

758
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,128
Goodness, this psycho is acting up again.

759
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,172
Will you please just sit down?

760
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,592
He just called us chicks by our uniform.

761
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,720
This is about the pride
of Civil Engineering.

762
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,138
Let go of me.

763
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,183
You're not in Civil Engineering.

764
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,518
How dare you Physical Education losers…

765
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,687
You're all dead!

766
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:03,401
-The toughest, Civil Engineering.
-The toughest, Civil Engineering.

767
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,570
-One!
-Upperclassmen are…

768
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,781
-Two!
-Like the sky!

769
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,533
-The toughest, Civil Engineering.
-The toughest, Civil Engineering.

770
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,952
That was drunken courage.

771
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,830
Goodness, you psycho.

772
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,832
I know it was a tough age,

773
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,918
but why were you so hot-headed?

774
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,795
Hey, you idiots. Step it up!

775
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:25,840
Didn't I tell you
to behave when in uniform?

776
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:30,678
Why are those young brats
disciplining us over nothing?

777
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,056
You're only a few years older.

778
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,892
Goodness, how cute. Adorable.

779
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,270
COLLEGE OF SOCIAL SCIENCES BULLETIN BOARD

780
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,615
Goodness.

781
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,160
They're so cute.

782
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,456
COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING NEWS

783
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,334
Goodness,
are you here touring the Natural Farm?

784
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,669
Natural Farm?

785
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,589
I haven't heard that name in ages.
It hasn't been changed yet?

786
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,344
I know it changed to Everland
three years ago.

787
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,013
-Don't be such a show-off.
-Come on.

788
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,649
Look who that is.
He still looks so tall and handsome.

789
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,067
He grew to be a good man.

790
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:31,990
Why did I turn down a guy like him
to date a petty loser like that?

791
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:37,370
Hello.

792
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,291
Nam-gil.

793
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,337
Are you here for a lecture?

794
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:24,417
CIVIL ENGINEERING 1, CIVIL ENGINEERING 2

795
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,920
-Two!
-Like the sky!

796
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,547
-The toughest, Civil Engineering.
-The toughest, Civil Engineering.

797
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,352
Choi Ban-do! Come out!

798
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,327
EPILOGUE

799
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,912
That's refreshing.

800
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:04,290
-What are you doing?
-Suzy is in here.

801
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,125
Korea's first love.

802
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:10,129
Why does everyone's first love
look like her?

803
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,381
It's just like that.

804
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:14,551
They're all fair and slender.

805
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,095
Hey, don't you remember
my first love from college?

806
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:18,596
Min Seo-yeong, the dance major.

807
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,766
She was really pretty.

808
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:25,853
I should've hit on her,
but I was way too naive back then.

809
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,983
You weren't naive. You were ignorant.

810
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:33,695
Even if you go back in time,
there's no way you could get her.

811
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,446
If I go back in time, I'd date her.

812
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,490
Why would I date someone like Jin-ju?

813
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,868
Take a look. Look at him.

814
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,331
Isn't he adorable?
He's unbelievably cute, right?

815
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,627
He even says "Daddy" now.

816
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,838
He's way ahead of other babies.

817
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:56,259
Choi Ban-do,
the short-tempered lunatic is gone now.

818
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,052
Maybe he's a genius.

819
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,930
Hey, does a school
for gifted kids cost a lot?

820
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:05,018
Suzy, move away from him. Avoid him.

821
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,440
Seo-jin, give Daddy a kiss.

822
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,179
Do you want your life to be dramatic?

823
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:43,598
My life is already very dramatic.

824
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,224
I'm not 20 years old right now.

825
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,060
I came back to the past.

826
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,896
I said I'd kill you
if I met you in college.

827
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,439
You're dead.

828
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,192
You're Min Seo-yeong, right?

829
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:56,903
How did he survive
if he missed Seo-yeong so much?

830
01:00:56,986 --> 01:01:00,365
If I go back in time, I'd date her.
Why would I date someone like Jin-ju?

831
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,117
A group blind date? Like a real one?

832
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:04,452
Why is she here?

833
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,954
Wait, is this the day
I first met this jerk?

834
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:12,043
