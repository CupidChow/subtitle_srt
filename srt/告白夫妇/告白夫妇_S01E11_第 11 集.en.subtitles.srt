1
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:48,673
Honey.

2
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,147
Please come quickly.

3
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,733
Ban-do, come quickly.

4
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,568
I have to go right now.

5
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,237
Detective, please. I have to go.

6
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,364
Let me go. Hey, let me go!

7
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,954
What's wrong with you?

8
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,420
FUNERAL HALL FIVE

9
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,588
It's your fault.

10
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,049
Because of you,

11
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,385
my mom passed away without seeing me.

12
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,952
Sometimes,
situations create rifts between people

13
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,871
without anyone being at fault.

14
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,010
EAT

15
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:05,870
Honey.

16
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,081
You're home.

17
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,166
-I'm home.
-Have you eaten?

18
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,542
Not yet. I'm hungry.

19
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,586
Wash up. I'll make you dinner.

20
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,091
-Okay.
-What should we do for Father's birthday?

21
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,010
Is it his birthday already?
What should we do?

22
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,890
We shouldn't have ignored it
and let it fester,

23
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,475
believing that time will heal.

24
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:33,439
Perhaps we should've tried
to untangle our hearts one knot at a time.

25
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,113
I want a divorce.

26
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,783
We're unhappy.

27
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,411
I'm too unhappy.

28
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:48,871
Let's get divorced.

29
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,790
Let's get divorced.

30
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,917
Let's get divorced!

31
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,926
Before the tangled knot snowballs

32
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,137
and swallows us whole.

33
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,411
GRAPES

34
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,831
-What's this?
-Grapes.

35
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,167
That's not what I meant.

36
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,216
What is wrong with me?

37
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,929
Nothing ever…

38
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,976
goes the way I hoped it would.

39
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,021
I have

40
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,442
always been true.

41
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,071
I always tried my best.

42
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:10,703
But why is everything a mess
just like this day ten years ago?

43
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,669
I kill myself trying

44
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,258
to give it my all and live a better life.

45
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:30,515
But why do I always end up
apologizing and being sorry?

46
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:35,853
Like you did…

47
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,858
I missed my mother-in-law too.

48
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,615
I missed my mother-in-law just like you.

49
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,264
What is he talking about?

50
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,224
Mom.

51
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,642
Mother-in-law?

52
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,397
You seem young,

53
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,566
but you must be married.

54
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,071
Why are you crying?

55
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,198
What about you?

56
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,245
Wait.

57
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,414
What's going on between you two?

58
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,293
No. It's not like that.

59
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,503
Mom, don't get any weird ideas.

60
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,630
No, it's nothing like that.

61
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,133
It's not like that, Mother…

62
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,053
Ms. Ko, it's nothing like that.

63
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,764
Something unfortunate

64
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,894
just happened to our friend at school.
So that's why we cried. Right?

65
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,399
Mom, let's go inside. Let's go.

66
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,650
Come on.

67
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,742
Have you eaten?

68
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,038
Sorry?

69
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,296
Mom. Why did you bring him in?

70
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,798
You said he's a friend.

71
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,551
He helped me out before

72
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,138
and he came as I was making dinner.
I can't just send him away.

73
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,015
And he says he's hungry too.

74
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,782
Please let me marry Jin-ju!

75
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:57,537
No! She's still young.
You'll only make her suffer.

76
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,373
Dad, let me get married.

77
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,874
We have to get married.

78
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,584
There's a reason.

79
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,002
A reason?

80
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,213
Did you get pregnant or…

81
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,384
You little…

82
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,053
You've lost your mind.

83
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,639
-You've lost your damn mind.
-No, ma'am.

84
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,558
-You're crazy.
-No, that's not it.

85
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,059
You brat. Get back here.

86
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,436
-You brat.
-Why did you say it like that?

87
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,565
Goodness, that's not it.

88
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,234
I don't want to be away from him
even for a day.

89
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,153
-You brat.
-Wait, Mother.

90
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,655
-Mother.
-Move aside.

91
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,782
Mom, please don't do this.

92
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,702
-No!
-Wait, Mother.

93
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,669
Mother.

94
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,509
Mother, this is for you.

95
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,178
Goodness, again?

96
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,221
No, you keep it.

97
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,599
Stop giving me your hard-earned money.

98
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,518
I make money so I can do things like this.

99
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,395
To give you spending money.

100
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,690
If you don't take it, you'll make me sad.

101
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,901
My goodness. All right.

102
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,280
Thank you, my son-in-law.
I'll put it to good use.

103
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,948
And it's a secret.

104
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,992
-Of course.
-Ban-do.

105
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,619
Yes, Father! Coming!

106
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,562
They say heaven gets jealous

107
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,440
when a couple is happy and splits them up.

108
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,903
If I had known, I would've fought with her
from time to time.

109
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,783
But I'm glad to have you,
who's like a son to me.

110
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:03,037
I couldn't bring myself to cry
in front of my girls.

111
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,714
Thank you, Ban-do.

112
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,638
Name.

113
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,601
-Choi Ban-do, sir.
-Age.

114
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,314
I'm 20 years old, sir.

115
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,318
Did you drink?

116
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,321
-Sorry?
-What's wrong with you?

117
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,698
Are you taking a census?

118
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,951
It's because he helped me out,

119
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,162
but then I made a faux pas.
That's why I invited him to dinner.

120
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,123
It's all right, ma'am.

121
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,750
Don't mind him and eat.

122
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,837
All I did was add another place setting.

123
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,256
I'm not sure
if the food will be to your liking.

124
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,173
Thank you.

125
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,973
Thank you, Mother.

126
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:08,018
I went to the market so that I can make
your favorite, braised spicy chicken,

127
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,854
but they had no chicken.

128
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,274
This is already a feast.

129
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,570
If you keep making me
a huge feast like this every time,

130
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,364
I'm coming every day.

131
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,076
You're a pro at buttering people up.

132
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,620
I'm not buttering her up. I mean it.

133
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,581
All right. Eat up, everyone.

134
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,249
Thank you.

135
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,927
Jin-ju, you too.

136
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,726
Right.

137
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,980
My kids won't eat fish
unless I remove the bones for them.

138
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,858
I washed my hands. Is that all right?

139
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:58,944
Yes.

140
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,946
All right. Eat up.

141
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,699
Like you did,

142
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,827
I missed my mother-in-law too.

143
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,707
I missed my mother-in-law just like you.

144
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,090
-Why aren't you eating?
-What?

145
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,009
Eat slowly. Don't get sick again.

146
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:29,058
Come on, Mom.
Stop giving them to me and eat.

147
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,478
You eat. Here. Have some of this too.

148
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,063
-Eat this.
-Goodness.

149
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,816
-Just eat it.
-You should eat too.

150
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,567
I'll feed myself.

151
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,110
Eat up.

152
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,947
-I just made this fresh.
-Okay.

153
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,785
Just eat already.

154
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,286
-Is it good?
-Yes.

155
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,788
-It's good.
-Eat up.

156
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,676
-Thank you for dinner.
-Sure.

157
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,011
I didn't make much tonight.

158
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,347
Next time,
I'll make you something delicious.

159
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,599
-What do you like?
-Sorry?

160
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,644
Braised spicy chicken.

161
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,564
I see. Braised spicy chicken.

162
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,691
I have an excellent recipe for that.

163
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,527
Come by again.

164
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,280
Okay.

165
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,124
Why did you walk him out?
He's not your son-in-law.

166
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,377
Just because.
I haven't seen him that many times,

167
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,671
but my heart goes out to him every time.

168
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,007
The way he looks at me…

169
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,761
It's the same way
Jin-ju has been looking at me lately.

170
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,638
That's odd.

171
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,517
Honey, do you think they're dating?

172
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,813
You know that other kid? I don't like him.

173
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,274
Is there any guy you actually like?

174
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,821
Is he my long-lost son?

175
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,744
Goodness, I can't even joke around you.

176
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,805
Did you decide to abuse
your body now that you're young?

177
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,475
What happened here?

178
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,940
Why didn't you tell me

179
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:42,942
about Director Park?

180
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,487
It could've been dangerous.

181
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,448
Who told you about that?

182
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,493
Nothing happened, so it's all good.

183
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,579
You were right.

184
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,791
I was never there

185
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,710
when you needed me.

186
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,380
You're right.

187
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,887
I thought
that I always kept you safe by my side,

188
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,393
but now I finally understand
why you were unhappy.

189
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,400
I never asked you to keep me safe.

190
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,195
Instead of keeping me safe,

191
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,990
you should've just been there.

192
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,745
You shouldn't have tried
to make a living for us.

193
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,665
You should've tried to live with me.

194
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,752
When I cried, you should've cried with me

195
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,547
and been sad with me.

196
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,676
I'm home.

197
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,803
Guess what I got.

198
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,682
Ta-da. Your favorite, boiled pork.

199
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,683
Just stay right there.

200
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,644
I'll set it up as soon as I get changed.

201
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,187
Okay? Stay right there.

202
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,203
No matter how much time passes,

203
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,376
my heart refuses to forget.

204
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,546
I know it wasn't your fault.

205
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,591
I know the situation was inevitable.

206
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,095
That's why…

207
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,807
whenever I felt myself
wanting to resent you,

208
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,268
I suppressed it and held back.

209
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,940
So why did you treat me

210
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,651
as though nothing was wrong?

211
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,988
You made my sadness feel petty.

212
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,577
Why was everything so trivial to you?

213
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,421
That was when things started to go south.

214
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,300
Why didn't you check in on me?

215
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,095
Why didn't you hug me?

216
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,683
Why didn't you

217
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,019
cry with me?

218
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,527
There's no use

219
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,695
discussing this now.

220
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,374
I wanted to make you smile.

221
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,710
I felt

222
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,214
so guilty toward you and Mother.

223
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,927
I couldn't do anything.

224
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,181
At the time,

225
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,019
I thought
that was the only thing I could do.

226
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,776
I didn't want to make you cry.

227
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,780
I wanted to make you smile.

228
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:19,992
That was all.

229
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,873
I can't believe

230
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,585
we're talking about this now.

231
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,475
I'm hungry. I'm so hungry.

232
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,060
Let's eat.

233
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,149
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

234
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,367
-Why is the soup so salty?
-Is it?

235
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,165
This isn't salty. It's too bland.

236
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,376
What are you talking about?
It tastes like seawater.

237
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,012
Why is the rice salty too?

238
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,681
Hey.

239
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,691
What? Why is only my food salty?

240
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,568
Hey, woman.

241
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,363
What is it now?

242
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,531
Why are you angry this time? What now?

243
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,373
What's with your mom?

244
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,667
What else besides you?

245
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,253
Think hard about what you did wrong.

246
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,713
You must have some idea.

247
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,507
You've been with her for 26 years.

248
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,052
Even if I live with her for 100 years,
there's no way I can read her mind.

249
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,513
If she's angry, she should tell me.

250
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,890
How else would I know?

251
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,728
You wanted to go out for lunch,
so I took you out!

252
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,855
So why are you angry?

253
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,525
You have to tell me what it is!

254
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,236
Do I have to say it in words?

255
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,323
Of course, I can't read minds!

256
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,367
How am I supposed to know how you feel?

257
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,662
I took you out to lunch and everything.

258
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:32,916
I said I wanted to eat out
because I didn't want to eat home cooking.

259
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,877
So how could you take me
to a home-cooked food place?

260
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,963
You old cheapskate!

261
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,881
What's wrong with you?

262
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,218
Then you should've said so at the time!

263
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,803
You didn't say a word until now!

264
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,055
Do I have to spell out everything for you?

265
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,682
Are you an idiot?

266
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:52,728
Of course.
How would I know what you're thinking?

267
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,980
You need to say what you feel!

268
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:58,817
What will you do with your mouth?
Make soup with it?

269
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,861
Goodness, I can't believe this.

270
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,364
What's with Ban-do lately?

271
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,825
And where did Jae-u go?

272
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,205
This is why men are impossible.

273
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,959
They throw out their friends
like an empty can when they date…

274
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,339
It's an empty can.

275
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,299
Have you been abandoned too?

276
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,720
So what the heck are you looking at?

277
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,682
-Darn it.
-Are you okay?

278
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,061
-Who did that?
-What?

279
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,563
Dok-jae. You.

280
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,109
I'm sorry!

281
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,446
Why did those fatsos get in my way?

282
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,992
Are you out of your mind?
You hit me on purpose, right?

283
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,704
What? Why would I hit a senior on purpose?

284
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,457
Darn it, I was already having a bad day.

285
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,000
I should just…

286
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,921
-Watch it. I'll kill you.
-I'm sorry.

287
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,464
Darn it.

288
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,347
Darn it, you pig. Take this. And this.

289
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,807
HANGUK UNIVERSITY CIVIL ENGINEERING

290
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,730
You punk.

291
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:20,941
You're the best.

292
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:22,901
The best.

293
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,034
Dok-jae!

294
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,997
-You're back.
-Yes.

295
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,418
I thought you walked him to the market.
What took you so long?

296
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,673
Hey, was that for us?

297
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,842
Maybe he forgot to take it.

298
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,720
No, it's for you.

299
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,141
-Me?
-Yes.

300
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,655
I felt

301
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,033
so guilty toward you and Mother.

302
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,994
I couldn't do anything.

303
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,621
I didn't want to make you cry.

304
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,791
I wanted to make you smile.

305
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,669
That was all.

306
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,184
Why didn't you check in on me?

307
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,644
Why didn't you hug me?

308
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,149
Why didn't you cry with me?

309
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:57,913
One.

310
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,414
Two.

311
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,874
Three.

312
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,292
Four.

313
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,169
Jae-u.

314
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,714
If you have no talent,
you could always leave the squad.

315
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,424
Do you have to do this?

316
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,136
Who are you to judge me?
You think you're all that?

317
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,307
That's not what I meant.
Look, your body isn't built for this.

318
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,311
-I don't think you'll ever get there.
-Speak for yourself.

319
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,938
Go over there.

320
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,815
You're humiliating me
by making people compare us.

321
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,318
Attention.

322
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,695
Freshmen, you all come here too.

323
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:35,283
The schedule
for the National Cheer Competition is out.

324
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,370
ASURA CHEERLEADING SQUAD

325
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,997
We're fighting for our school,

326
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,875
so freshmen, make sure
you're ready for the preliminaries.

327
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,126
-Okay!
-Okay!

328
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,044
That's all.

329
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,508
Bo-reum will definitely be the center.

330
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,012
Come on.
You don't have to state the obvious.

331
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,307
Then the fight will be fierce

332
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,726
to become your partner.

333
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,020
Let's see.

334
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,064
Lee Byeong-gyu. He's good too.

335
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,403
And Yong-taek.
He's good enough to be the center.

336
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,154
Thanks.

337
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:14,781
Let's see.

338
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,751
Hey, why aren't you mentioning Jae-u?

339
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,088
He can't even pull off the basic moves.

340
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,924
She's right. I doubt
he'll make it past the preliminaries.

341
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,551
Cheer is cheer, okay?

342
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,429
Hey, what if he makes it?

343
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,140
Don't judge people so rashly.

344
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,518
-Okay.
-Okay.

345
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,066
Are you sure the chairman is in?

346
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,110
Yes, he is.

347
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,571
Let's make sure to humiliate him today.

348
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,323
He's dead.

349
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,452
The school isn't his playground.
Resign, Chairman Jeong.

350
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,078
-Resign!
-Resign!

351
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,747
Resign, Chairman Jeong Gi-do.

352
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,123
-Resign!
-Resign!

353
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:08,793
This is not a school.
Resign, Chairman Jeong.

354
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,503
-Resign!
-Resign!

355
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:14,049
You have no regard for students' freedom.
Resign, Chairman Jeong.

356
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,717
-Resign!
-Resign!

357
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:19,971
Come and watch.

358
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,307
Of course. I'll be there for sure.

359
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,560
It's tomorrow.

360
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,396
Park Hyeon-seok!

361
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,152
Right.

362
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,742
Hey, I'm so sorry.

363
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,912
Something important came up
on my way there.

364
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,747
I'm sorry.

365
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,505
Hey, I'm just messing with you.
Do you think I waited for you?

366
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,465
You didn't?

367
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,925
I'm not stupid.

368
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,427
Why would I wait for a guy
who doesn't even like me?

369
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,974
You won't even deny it.

370
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,396
I just gave it to you

371
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:13,274
since I found a new hobby thanks to you.

372
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,068
As a thank you.

373
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,947
I'm relieved that you didn't wait.

374
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,950
So, did it go well?

375
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,284
I was really curious.

376
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,994
Of course, it did.

377
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,790
Ballerinas don't have a long career.

378
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,544
Many of them become nervous
and depressed by the time they retire.

379
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,799
But in about 20 years, I'll do this.

380
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,593
I think it might be more fun.

381
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,887
People will always find a way out.

382
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,682
Once you retire,
you can always do something else.

383
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,308
You should take it easy.

384
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,310
You should do that too.

385
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,772
You don't even know where your heart is.

386
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,774
Or are you denying it?

387
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,944
What are you talking about?

388
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:01,072
You like that girl. Jin-ju.

389
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,991
It was obvious to me.

390
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,452
You're always like a dad to me,

391
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,705
but your eyes are full of love
whenever you look at her.

392
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,334
Hey, you're the only one who doesn't know.

393
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,256
Right, she might not know either.

394
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,346
-Resign!
-Resign!

395
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,558
You have no regard for students' freedom.
Resign, Chairman Jeong.

396
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,268
-Resign!
-Resign!

397
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,353
-They're protesting.
-Resign, Chairman Jeong!

398
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,940
-Resign!
-Resign!

399
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,609
The chairman?

400
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,027
-Resign, Chairman Jeong!
-The…

401
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,279
-Resign!
-Resign!

402
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,782
-Resign, Chairman Jeong!
-Resign!

403
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,035
Are you all right?

404
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,412
Yes, I'm fine.

405
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,457
You should go ahead. Please excuse me.

406
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,209
What's wrong…

407
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,216
She won't give me a chance.

408
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,718
-Resign!
-Resign!

409
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,136
Resign, Chairman Jeong!

410
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,971
-Resign!
-Resign!

411
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,681
Resign, Chairman Jeong!

412
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,391
-Resign!
-Resign!

413
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,643
RESIGN, CHAIRMAN!

414
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,814
-Resign!
-Resign!

415
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,526
-Resign!
-Resign!

416
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,195
-Resign!
-Resign!

417
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,490
Oh no. My goodness.

418
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,659
-Resign!
-Resign from your position.

419
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,411
-Resign!
-Resign!

420
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,496
Goodness.

421
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,833
Hey… Go.

422
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,001
-Resign!
-Resign!

423
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,628
-Resign!
-Hey, you.

424
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,380
Don't come here.

425
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,465
Oh no. What is he going to do? Go.

426
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,759
-Resign!
-Resign!

427
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,804
My gosh, do they have to take it this far?

428
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:52,851
I can't believe his son has to see this.
I feel so bad for that poor kid.

429
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,519
Goodness.

430
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,604
-Resign!
-Resign!

431
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,024
-Resign!
-Resign!

432
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,861
-Resign!
-Resign!

433
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,030
-Resign!
-Resign!

434
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,949
-Resign!
-Take pictures.

435
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,119
-Goodness.
-Resign!

436
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,415
Have you eaten?

437
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,836
Let's eat.

438
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,341
RESIGN, CHAIRMAN JEONG GI-DO!

439
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,261
Goodness.

440
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:39,188
FOOD PRICE INCREASE! WE DEMAND
AN EXPLANATION FROM THE CHAIRMAN!

441
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,360
Why is this young kid
so good at hiding his feelings?

442
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,491
Why aren't you eating?

443
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,579
Then I'll eat it.

444
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,417
Sure. Eat up.

445
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,007
You can't express your feelings, can you?

446
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,551
What?

447
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,178
You never say anything

448
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,347
when you're hurting, sad,

449
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,806
or angry.

450
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,768
You never talk about your feelings.

451
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,271
Then no one else can worry about you.

452
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,482
Why?

453
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,026
Will you worry about me?

454
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,866
No one worries about me anyway.

455
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,537
So it's fine.

456
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,293
Gosh.

457
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,431
-Is he there?
-What are you up to?

458
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,309
Damn it! Get off of me, will you?

459
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,104
Come on, man. Hide me.

460
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,399
I'm dead if that fatso catches me.

461
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,776
I flipped him off to his face.

462
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,946
You've lost your mind.
I'll be at your funeral soon.

463
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,572
What's wrong, dude?

464
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,825
Isn't that Jin-ju?

465
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:14,742
Where?

466
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,086
-Dok-jae!
-My gosh, that was scary.

467
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,844
I say get down on your knees
and beg for forgiveness.

468
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,513
No, that won't work. He'll kill me… Hey!

469
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,684
Hey, Ban-do, wait.

470
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,519
Save me. Don't go.

471
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,063
Say your draft notice came.

472
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:47,442
You're insane. Drafted? What? Hey, man.

473
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,200
Hello. We should talk, right?

474
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,955
I'm sorry. I had lost my mind back then.

475
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,791
I see. You had lost your mind?

476
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,711
You should've held onto it.
Why didn't you?

477
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,464
Well… Well, you know.

478
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,508
-Well, I got my draft notice.
-Your draft notice?

479
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,927
No, not a draft notice.

480
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,555
I mean, my wisdom tooth.
No, that's not it.

481
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,348
I'm sorry.

482
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,934
Let's go drink.

483
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,605
What?

484
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,988
You'll make my heart race with that look.

485
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:39,077
This is called a mommy smile,
not a romantic one.

486
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,581
I knew it. You're…

487
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,916
Nam-gil.

488
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,588
COLLEGE OF HUMANITIES

489
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,008
Hello.

490
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,302
I ran over as soon as Mr. Kim called.

491
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,720
What's going on?

492
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,555
Is everything all right?

493
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,849
Yes, I'm sure he's fine.

494
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,519
You should call him before you go. Bye.

495
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,689
No.

496
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,151
I don't mean your dad. I mean you.

497
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,952
I came because I was worried about my son.

498
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,705
Are you all right?

499
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,510
So he has two moms.

500
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,555
But he said he had none.

501
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,436
HUMANITIES, NATURAL SCIENCE

502
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,648
Six hundred and forty-seven.

503
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,734
Six hundred and forty-seven.

504
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,362
It's gone.

505
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,323
Did someone check it out?

506
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:15,798
TIME ONLY FLOWS FORWARD?

507
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,842
Looking for this? Time slip?

508
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,469
I was just curious.

509
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,099
Don't bother.

510
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,727
It wasn't that helpful.

511
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,187
I see.

512
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,149
I was just curious.
I guess I won't have to read it.

513
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,322
-I'll get going then.
-Okay.

514
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,375
Why? What is it?

515
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,757
Goodness, those young kids.

516
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,302
Hey, let's go out. Why should we hide?

517
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,223
It'll be weirder if we go out now.

518
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,058
And look, they're cute.

519
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,311
Just wait. They'll leave.

520
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,730
Goodness.

521
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:14,041
Hey, why aren't you mentioning Jae-u?

522
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,294
He can't even pull off the basic moves.

523
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,297
She's right. I doubt
he'll make it past the preliminaries.

524
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,549
Cheer is cheer, okay?

525
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,018
Stop that. Listen to me, will you?

526
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:36,564
ASURA

527
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,402
Forget it. I'm done with this.

528
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,364
I'm done.

529
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,371
I'm done. I'm done!

530
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,045
A soldier must always stay disciplined.

531
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,463
If you stay disciplined,

532
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,590
you'll have an easy life in the army.

533
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,176
Discipline. I'll remember that.

534
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:09,263
Hey, Dok-jae. Every religious activity
serves different types of snacks.

535
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,475
Some places give
two candy bars and some give one.

536
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,977
-Make sure you pick the right one.
-Yes, sir.

537
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,771
Hey, man. Hang in there.

538
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,815
You think you'll never get out,
but you will.

539
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,236
Of course. I'm a Korean man.

540
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,947
I'll gladly serve two years in the army.

541
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,159
-Man, Dok-jae, you're a real man.
-You're amazing.

542
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,869
-Drink up.
-Drink.

543
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:43,506
But if I don't go,
they'll be onto me very soon.

544
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,133
Should I cut my hair?

545
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,761
No, not my hair.

546
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,140
Well, I survived today,
so I'll think about it tomorrow.

547
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,604
Hello? Hey, Mom.

548
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,523
Dok-jae, your draft notice came.

549
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,067
What are you talking about?
It can't come out already.

550
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,026
I just turned 20.

551
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,736
Your birthday is early.

552
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,658
Are you serious?

553
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,085
Dok-jae, come on over!

554
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,086
-Come.
-Come on over.

555
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,588
Okay.

556
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,263
You must be the calmest guy
who got drafted.

557
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,515
-You're not even crying.
-Exactly.

558
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,933
Drink up. Drink.

559
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,286
It's all right.

560
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,121
It's all right, man.

561
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,473
Bye, now.

562
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,557
Jin-ju.

563
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:18,976
Yes?

564
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,895
That ring mark.

565
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,313
Yes?

566
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,315
How long did you have that?

567
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,443
Since I got here.

568
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,372
Hello.

569
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,832
I'm looking for a ring.

570
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,417
There's a line on the inside.

571
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,627
Is this everything?

572
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,801
There's a line on the inside.

573
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,720
This isn't it. One second.

574
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,807
Is this everything you have?

575
00:41:58,891 --> 00:41:59,975
Hello.

576
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,520
This isn't it.

577
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,939
-This one.
-It's very simple.

578
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,023
Something simple?

579
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,859
Are these all the rings you have?

580
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:11,946
Thank you.

581
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,658
I think this was it.

582
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,743
Please.

583
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,623
-Hello.
-I'm looking for a ring.

584
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,166
It's…

585
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,134
These are pretty. Let's get these.

586
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,386
-These?
-Yes.

587
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,179
-Do you want to see these?
-Yes.

588
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:45,980
Seo-jin.

589
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,191
Seo-jin.

590
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,528
Seo-jin.

591
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,073
Seo-jin.

592
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,951
Were you asleep?

593
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,622
I'm going for a walk.
I was wondering if you wanted to come.

594
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,083
-Get back to sleep, then.
-No, Mom.

595
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,794
No, I'll go with you. One second.

596
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,567
Give me a hug.

597
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,362
I love your hugs the most.

598
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,530
Goodness.

599
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,908
You've been too cute lately.

600
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,119
-Let's go.
-Okay.

601
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,628
Why aren't you eating?

602
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,505
-What?
-Eat slowly. Don't get sick again.

603
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,549
Have some of this too.

604
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,344
I'm fine. You eat. This is warm.

605
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,220
Goodness, I can feed myself.

606
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,264
Eat everything and chew well.

607
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,224
I can feed myself.

608
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,352
Eat up.

609
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,687
It's good.

610
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,650
Where should we go?

611
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,693
Let's see. To the park?

612
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,570
-Shall we?
-Okay.

613
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:37,633
His stepmother must be good
to that upperclassman.

614
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:42,221
I think so, but I think
he's too young to know that.

615
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,807
Maybe because of his birth mom.

616
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,059
Isn't he older than you?

617
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,018
Yes.

618
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,771
You're right. He's older.

619
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:54,191
His birth mom or someone else
is consuming him,

620
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:57,653
so he doesn't see the person
taking care of him by his side.

621
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,532
But that kid must have had a tough time

622
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,492
after his parents got divorced.

623
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:04,910
What?

624
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:09,832
Mom.

625
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:15,671
What if I got married,
then wanted to get divorced?

626
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,715
What would you say?

627
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:21,343
I wouldn't let you get married
to a weird guy you'd want to divorce.

628
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,976
It's not like
I like your dad all the time.

629
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,771
I doubt he likes me all the time either.

630
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:37,443
If you think about it that way,
you'll learn to just let it go.

631
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,404
You can't nitpick over everything.

632
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,115
You're right.

633
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,202
I'm sure my partner
won't like everything about me.

634
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:48,912
You?

635
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,708
You have such a particular personality.

636
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,879
Well, you've been better lately.

637
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,721
If I had you in my life,

638
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,057
would life have been easier?

639
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,187
You have me right here.

640
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,065
Nothing is easy in this world.

641
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,777
It's all trial and error. That's life.

642
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,702
-What are you looking at?
-What?

643
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,167
Are you looking down on me too? Are you?

644
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,211
Are you looking down on me?

645
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,921
Get away from me.

646
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:44,551
Don't look down on me. I'm a person too.

647
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,012
Sir, pull yourself together.

648
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,847
Let me go. Hey.

649
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:52,476
Just because I lower myself
to try to make a living,

650
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,437
you think I'm beneath you, don't you?

651
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,356
Darn it, man.

652
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,484
Listen!

653
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,988
I am a person too!

654
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,324
I'm not a dog!

655
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,118
What more

656
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,414
must I do? What do you want from me?

657
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,795
My life is tough enough.

658
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,676
Don't look down on me.

659
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:30,097
Hey! I'm doing my best, okay?

660
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,935
-What more can I do?
-That poor man. Life must be so tough.

661
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,105
I'm doing my best!

662
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,316
I've been doing my best!

663
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:47,281
What more can I do?

664
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,076
-What more can I do?
-What about me?

665
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:55,414
Do you know what kind of abuse
I take while working?

666
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,374
I'm treated like…

667
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,210
I'm treated like I'm subhuman.

668
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,337
Do you have any idea

669
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,424
what my life is like?

670
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:09,511
What is wrong with me?

671
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,139
I have

672
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,392
always been true.

673
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,853
I always tried my best.

674
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:22,482
I kill myself trying to give it my all
and live a better life.

675
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:26,778
But why do I always end up
apologizing and being sorry?

676
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,409
Stop looking down on me.

677
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:36,580
Hey! I'm really doing my best!

678
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,998
I am…

679
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,294
I'm doing my best too.

680
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:44,671
I am.

681
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,061
Why aren't you coming in?

682
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:00,979
Mom.

683
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,192
You won't let me get married
to just anyone, right?

684
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:09,071
Even if I whine and throw a fit,
you'll choose a good guy, right?

685
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,907
Of course, I will.

686
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,034
I won't give in
just because you throw a fit.

687
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,496
I'll choose a great guy for you to marry.

688
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,164
Someone who won't make you cry.

689
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:24,962
Mom, go in first.
I have to go see someone.

690
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,840
What? Hey, Jin-ju!

691
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,638
What's with her?

692
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,087
I didn't want to make you cry.

693
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,965
I wanted to make you smile.

694
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,260
That was all.

695
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,267
His birth mom or someone else
is consuming him,

696
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,437
so he doesn't see the person
taking care of him by his side.

697
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,295
Hello?

698
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,922
Where are you right now?

699
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:52,841
What?

700
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,677
I'm crying right now.

701
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,431
Must I cry alone again?

702
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,770
Don't cry. I'll be right there.

703
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,147
I'll go. Stay there.

704
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,588
What is it now?

705
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,007
Thank you…

706
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,636
for saving Jin-ju.

707
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,180
I mean it. Thank you.

708
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:53,735
What is he saying?

709
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,743
What was that? Why is he thanking me?

710
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,212
Jin-tae!

711
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,172
Jin-ju!

712
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,715
No.

713
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,176
Ban-do.

714
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,182
No, Ban-do!

715
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,392
Honey!

716
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,732
No.

717
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:56,816
No.

718
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:02,364
No. Get up. Please.

719
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,615
No.

720
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,413
No.

721
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:40,360
Seo-jin. I'm your daddy.

722
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,446
Seo-jin, Daddy will keep you safe forever.

723
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,031
MA JIN-JU

724
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,222
Honey!

725
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,350
Honey!

726
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:15,854
Get up.

727
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,606
Get up!

728
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,697
Get up.

729
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,409
Honey!

730
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:37,542
If we knew then what we know now,

731
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:43,006
would we not need to be here right now?

732
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:58,813
EPILOGUE

733
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,483
You don't have to get out. You should go.

734
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,611
Okay. Good night.

735
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,697
Bye. Thank you.

736
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,972
Hey.

737
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,183
Why are you here?

738
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,810
Why are you so late?

739
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,770
You left way before we did.

740
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,775
That's odd. We didn't make any stops.

741
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:47,070
How could you get into a car
with a stranger like that?

742
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,656
He just got his license.

743
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,075
What if he got into an accident?
It's dangerous.

744
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,077
Do you have nothing else to worry about?

745
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:55,787
Goodness.

746
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:03,503
So? Do you feel better
now that you got to see the sea?

747
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:05,755
Yes.

748
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,843
How long has it been since we took a trip?

749
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,388
I don't even remember the last time.

750
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,099
Maybe that's what it is for us.

751
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,309
What is?

752
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:24,107
We might be here on a short trip.

753
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,151
A vacation.

754
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,696
That makes sense.

755
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,907
God may have taken pity on us

756
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,993
and sent us on this trip.

757
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,204
An exciting one at that.

758
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,789
But you know what?

759
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,919
-What?
-It's only a trip if we go back home.

760
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:05,899
Well, if you don't go back,
it's called moving. Moving.

761
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:19,949
