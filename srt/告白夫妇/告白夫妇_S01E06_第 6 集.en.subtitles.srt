1
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,338
Seo-jin, Mommy's dress is here.

2
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,721
I haven't bought a dress in years.

3
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,514
Right?

4
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,728
TO MA JIN-JU, FROM U AND I SHOPPING

5
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,737
Gosh, why is this so short?

6
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,865
Goodness, Seo-jin. If I carry you

7
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,742
while wearing this dress,

8
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,995
Mommy will end up showing
my underwear to everyone, right?

9
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,876
I'll have to return you too.

10
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,713
But it's so pretty.

11
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:34,135
When I was younger,
I thought age was just a number.

12
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,429
That I was simply in this world
as Ma Jin-ju,

13
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,683
and that age was just a number
that becomes a part of me.

14
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,686
I'm a mother in my late 30s.

15
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,439
Is it okay to wear a dress
that falls above my knees?

16
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:50,735
Do you all wear short skirts
after you had kids?

17
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,906
I couldn't wear short skirts
once I hit my mid-30s.

18
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,909
I'm afraid I'll be that old lady
who's desperate to look young.

19
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:01,788
Me too. I only wear long skirts or pants
ever since I had kids.

20
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,957
I think it's fine if you look good in it.

21
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,339
Yes, right?
If I look good in it, I'll wear it.

22
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,099
-Ta-da.
-My gosh.

23
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,518
What do you think? Isn't it pretty?

24
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,108
Are you a kid?

25
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,194
Don't show your legs, old lady.
Act your age.

26
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,196
Seo-jin, where are you?

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,323
Seo-jin, Daddy's home.

28
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,534
Seo-jin, where are you? Daddy is here.

29
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:42,036
Where are you, my Seo-jin?

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,205
-He's asleep.
-He is?

31
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,009
However, as the number grew
year after year,

32
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,803
I realized that my age
didn't become a part of me,

33
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,931
but that I began
to adjust myself to that number.

34
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,769
That's how I got used to my age.

35
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:20,867
YEAR 1999, SEOUL

36
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:26,307
Why is this umbrella so weak? Goodness.

37
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,917
Just let it go. It served its time.

38
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,380
Right.

39
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,092
Then just to the College of Humanities.

40
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,697
What do you like?

41
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,656
You.

42
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,328
I think I do.

43
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,040
I think I like you.

44
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,756
This little kid is so smooth.

45
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,383
He's getting this old lady excited.

46
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,762
Is he a player?

47
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,639
-Hey.
-Yes?

48
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,184
Could you come a little closer?

49
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,770
See? He is.

50
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,772
If we walk like this, I'll get drenched.

51
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,444
I mean, it's my umbrella.

52
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,239
Right. Goodness, I'm sorry.

53
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,960
It'll stop soon, right?

54
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,212
Probably.

55
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,423
The poor festival.

56
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,014
Does he think he's a professional swimmer?

57
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,560
His shoulders aren't that broad,
but it's drenched.

58
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,731
We're about the same.

59
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,801
Why did you bring two umbrellas?
We could've just shared one.

60
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,386
This isn't some romance movie.

61
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,305
We'll get wet. Let's go.

62
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,074
So are you two in a romance movie,
while we were in a reality show?

63
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,161
What a jerk.

64
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,497
Who? Me?

65
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,457
No. Come on.

66
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:24,921
Settle down.

67
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,672
The rain has stopped, so I know

68
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,133
you're all dying
to be out there for the festival.

69
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,968
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

70
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,095
You can't focus on a day like this.

71
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,348
What the heck? Class canceled.

72
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,229
Go out and have fun.

73
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,105
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

74
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,037
We're about the same.

75
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,872
Man, that kid.

76
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,712
First love? Sure.

77
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,631
Go get the girl you never got to date,

78
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,466
but at my dad's theater? Please.

79
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,719
It's not like I wanted to go there.
I just ended up there.

80
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:15,972
And you know,

81
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,724
he doesn't know who I am anyway.

82
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,060
And you almost told him, didn't you?

83
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,645
"Hello, Father…"

84
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,522
You idiot.

85
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,400
It came out instinctively.
I did it for 18 years after all.

86
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,111
Also, we don't know when we'll go back,

87
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,573
but you already found a guy?
You were stuck to him

88
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,074
like glue.

89
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,493
Look who's talking.

90
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,372
Just don't get suckered
by a wicked witch and cry.

91
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,750
I didn't want to rat on her,

92
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,211
but Seo-yeong
had an umbrella this morning.

93
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,381
-She had an umbrella?
-That's right.

94
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,719
You have no idea
how cunning kids are these days.

95
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,346
Really?

96
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,267
What's with you? Have you gone crazy?

97
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,060
She's so cute.

98
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,187
She did that to share my umbrella.

99
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,981
That's not an evil witch.

100
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,066
That's what happens in romance movies.

101
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,029
All you can think about is
absurd soap operas.

102
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,198
What? Soap operas?
That's not a romance movie!

103
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,950
It's an old man's scandalous affair!

104
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,160
It's like Love and War.

105
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,786
-"Scandalous affair"?
-My gosh.

106
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,913
"Love and War"?

107
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,336
May I borrow it?

108
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,632
Well, which type do you like?

109
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,008
Western? Japanese?

110
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,219
My gosh, Jin-ju.

111
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,307
He has a folder full of them
by type. About 1,000 of them.

112
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,558
Ask him for it.

113
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,393
Why you…

114
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,064
You're one healthy man.

115
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,900
It's not like that. Move.

116
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,528
Yes, it is.

117
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,824
1999 HANGUK UNIVERSITY FESTIVAL

118
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,124

Maintain order by drinking
only as much as you can at the festival!

123
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,855
Maintain order by drinking
only as much as you can at the festival!

124
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,440
Maintain order by drinking…

125
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,942
CIVIL ENGINEERING WATER BOMB

126
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,281
Where are the freshmen punks?

127
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:56,298
In the end,
you chose to go on that journey.

128
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,554
The future I've seen is correct.

129
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,516
The day was good. The day was just right.

130
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,812
So you ended up making that choice.

131
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,690
You foolish human.

132
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,233
Are you a ghost?

133
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,861
A goblin. A 38-year-old goblin.

134
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,488
What the heck is that psycho saying?
Be happy for me.

135
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,622
Is this the best for you? Are you sure?

136
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,960
You need to think hard about this.
You shouldn't decide on a whim.

137
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,754
It's about 18 years of your life.

138
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,964
Are you jealous
that I got a girlfriend first?

139
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,841
Goodness, you're so frustrating.

140
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,677
I'm telling you. I'm against this.

141
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,054
So? So what if you're against this?

142
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,438
In about 11 years,
when you're exactly 31 years old,

143
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,941
the moment Park Ji-sung scores
the winning goal in South Africa,

144
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,986
you will regret this moment in tears

145
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,947
as you throw a fit,
asking me why I didn't stop you.

146
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,785
Let me make myself clear.
I told you to stay away from her.

147
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,164
Darn you. You foolish human.

148
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,839
I made myself clear.
I'm against this relationship.

149
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,678
Hey, girl. You should be
happy for me, not against it.

150
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,763
Let me go.

151
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,059
If you make this choice now,

152
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,395
you'll be an old maid at 40,
daydreaming of the ways you can kill him,

153
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,981
whether you should
rip him apart or burn him.

154
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,316
I can't do anything then.

155
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,904
-My goodness.
-How did you make that leap?

156
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,157
You don't know
if you'll die today or tomorrow.

157
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,910
Why should I think about
what will happen 18 years later?

158
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,495
I like him now. That's enough.

159
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,247
"I want to date you.

160
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,791
Not crush on you.
I want to go out with you!"

161
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,338
That was awesome. Isn't he cute?

162
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,884
Fine. You're ruining your own life. Gosh.

163
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,803
Then when did you two start dating?

164
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,515
-I'll give you 100 won on your 100th day.
-Hey, Seol. You know what's up.

165
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,560
Anyway, who cares when it was?
Nobody counts those things.

166
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,527
You're so frustrating.

167
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,662
Day two of our relationship.

168
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,132
My friends, are you ready?

169
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,509
Wait, are you…

170
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,847
Goodness gracious.

171
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,478
Why do sad premonitions always come true?

172
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,147
Do you remember?

173
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,149
We waited for this day since day one.

174
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:05,279
Campus Song Festival!

175
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,656
I do remember.

176
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,911
The moment that makes me
hang my head in shame that will follow me

177
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,204
until I die.

178
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,250
FROM NURSE MI-GYEONG, CAMPUS SONG FESTIVAL

179
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,880
-Don't you think it's him?
-I think so.

180
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,424
Mr. Choi.

181
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,801
Isn't this you?

182
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,222
I didn't know you had this side to you.

183
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,525
I hear this is you, Mr. Choi.

184
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,945
Where did you find this outfit?

185
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,488
You look so cool. Very…

186
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,033
I was just a little insane back then.

187
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,332
I get it now.

188
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,835
I was sent back for this moment.

189
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,047
I got this.

190
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,591
My friends.

191
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,804
The idea you have in your heads?
Lose them. And these?

192
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,932
Don't do it. Don't.

193
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,308
And I won't either.

194
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,061
What are you talking about? Hey.

195
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,814
You wanted to be on TV back then,

196
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,399
so you planned the whole thing.

197
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,110
Yes, he found all these props for us too.

198
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,653
What's with the sudden change?

199
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,489
If we do this,
we'll remember our college days forever.

200
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,533
-Right?
-Yes.

201
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:36,954
And that memory
will haunt you until the day you die.

202
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,333
Anyway,

203
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,211
-I'm off. Good luck.
-You can't leave, Ban-do!

204
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,091
You'll really go to the library?
You won't go to the festival?

205
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:54,221
Underclassmen will complain
if old seniors like us show up at the pub.

206
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,224
Well, I guess
you never cared about these things.

207
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,064
I haven't been to a festival in forever.

208
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,942
I thought you didn't care for it.

209
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,193
I guess you do.

210
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,196
Festivals and parties are great things.

211
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,364
Party while you can.

212
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,158
You'll have to pay for this later.

213
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,617
Pay for festivals?

214
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,119
There will be

215
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,622
all kinds of festivities
all around the country.

216
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,500
And you're lucky
if you have the time and money to go.

217
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,378
That's our department's pub.

218
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,548
Goodness.

219
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,718
Hold this. It looks heavy.

220
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,137
-I'll do it. I got it.
-What?

221
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,805
-Should I stack these there?
-Yes.

222
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,807
You young girls are too weak for this.

223
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,517
-My gosh.
-Thanks.

224
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,020
-Over here.
-Where? Here?

225
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,648
-Thanks. Thanks a lot.
-Sure.

226
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,525
Hey, watch out with the water.

227
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,570
You're in trouble
if water splashes into the oil.

228
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,363
You're about to make huge trouble.

229
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,452
Here.

230
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,835
The sun did rise
from the east this morning, right?

231
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,338
Hello, Nam-gil.

232
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,472
HISTORY PUB, MENU

233
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,600
He never came to the festival
for three years. What's gotten into him?

234
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,894
It's his last festival
since he's a senior.

235
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,437
Exactly. He's a senior.

236
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,564
Why is he here
while we're preparing for it?

237
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,784
My gosh, you're cutting off the good part.

238
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,621
Hey, goodness. Hold the back of the knife

239
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,957
and peel just the edges, kids.

240
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,375
-The back.
-Okay.

241
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,210
"Kids"?

242
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,462
Please.

243
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,009
Okay. One second, Mom.

244
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,888
So a bit of sugar, a lot of gochujang.

245
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,265
I got it.

246
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,436
A bit of sugar. A bit?

247
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,814
A bit.

248
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,401
A bit. A bit?

249
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,404
-A bit.
-Goodness.

250
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,032
My gosh, wait. Hey.

251
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,327
-What are you doing?
-That's a bit.

252
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,414
You won't taste it at all
if you put in that little.

253
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,499
Do you know how to make this?

254
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,169
Come on. Spicy stir-fried pork?
With my eyes closed.

255
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,595
HUMANITIES, STAFF

256
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,003
You didn't throw in things
randomly, right?

257
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,131
You're so suspicious.
Goodness, you and your suspicion.

258
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,133
Here.

259
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,725
It's good.

260
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,560
-Really?
-Hey, Jin-ju.

261
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,938
Here, Seol.

262
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,482
Me too.

263
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,399
-It's good.
-Right?

264
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,442
Here, open up.

265
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,241
Jin-ju, this is our signature dish, okay?

266
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:43,742
Sound good?

267
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,287
This was nothing.

268
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:51,041
You'll be greatly shocked
if I cook a few more dishes.

269
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:55,212
So how many servings do I need to make?

270
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:59,424
We won't have too many customers,
so a little should be fine.

271
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,009
About 100 servings.

272
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,262
-A hundred?
-Yes.

273
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,972
Delivery.

274
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,770
Hey.

275
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,359
Cheer up.
We won't ask you to do this alone.

276
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,487
It's about time they came.

277
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,153
Our soldiers keep our country safe,

278
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,781
and kitchen reinforcements
keep our pub safe every year.

279
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:11,997
Thanks.

280
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,335
We perform that difficult task.

281
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,759
-Hello.
-Hey.

282
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,219
Great work, everyone.

283
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,971
Enjoy the festival, girls.

284
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,181
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

285
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,141
Hey, Seo-yeong.

286
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,686
-Yes?
-You've been doing well lately.

287
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,980
Keep it up, okay? And watch your weight.

288
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,774
I will.

289
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,530
What's going on?

290
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,408
You haven't lost your smile for days.

291
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,995
And you're in great shape.
Are you seeing someone?

292
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:56,583
You shouldn't focus only on practice.
Find a way to relieve your stress.

293
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,252
Dating is one option.

294
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,145
Gosh, I'm glad it stopped raining.

295
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,731
What if you didn't run into me
this morning?

296
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,734
What? Right.

297
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,820
Exactly.

298
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,988
What a relief. I didn't have an umbrella.

299
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,120
Right. Will you be on the show
Campus Song Festival too?

300
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,373
What? That show? No way.

301
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,917
I'm not a kid who's dying to be on TV.

302
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,252
No way. I'm not doing it.

303
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,046
Why not? It looks fun. Go on the show.

304
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,298
It'll be so cool to see you on TV.

305
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,510
Really?

306
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:53,056
But no. You should never cross
a bridge of no return.

307
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,475
It's best to live your life quietly.

308
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,978
You always tell me to do what's fun

309
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,105
and whatever I want,

310
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,273
but you're cautious.

311
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,150
Am I?

312
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,653
Gosh, no.

313
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,281
One second.

314
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,743
Hey, Mom.

315
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,789
I said no.

316
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,251
Why would I compete
in a contest I can't even win?

317
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,004
No.

318
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:27,799
I'm hanging up.

319
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,971
Gosh, you're scary.

320
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:34,931
You get annoyed too?

321
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:38,560
No one is perfect. Everyone has flaws.

322
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:42,063
What? Who says you're perfect?

323
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,442
Hey.

324
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,993
-That's awesome.
-So cool.

325
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,920
You can scoop
rice and soup with this in the army.

326
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,172
When we must make this much food,

327
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,758
consider this shovel like a spoon.

328
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,677
That's so cool.

329
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,014
-Hey, Jin-ju.
-Yes?

330
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,184
If you wanted to help here,
why didn't you compete as the May Queen?

331
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,685
-The May Queen?
-Yeah.

332
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,438
Right.

333
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:28,026
I was one of the candidates
for the May Queen Pageant.

334
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:29,778
You were.

335
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,907
I thought our department
might finally have a May Queen contestant

336
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,868
while I was a humanities staff member,

337
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,413
but you absolutely refused to do it.

338
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,667
Yes, you're right.

339
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,211
I guess I really was pretty.

340
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,464
-My gosh.
-This is nice.

341
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,926
All right, we're all done.

342
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,469
Don't waste a drop of sauce.

343
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,393
Il-do! What is this?

344
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,688
Look at this.
I don't have any change of clothes.

345
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,899
Gosh, I'm sorry.
You know, it doesn't look all that bad.

346
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,027
-What the heck?
-I knew it when you got too excited.

347
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,445
Come on.

348
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,580
Hey, are you okay?
I got the most on you. I'm sorry.

349
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,874
I can just wash them at home.

350
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,259
THE BEST, HISTORY

351
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,303
That's cold. Come on.

352
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,888
I'm sorry, Nam-gil. Gosh.

353
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,444
Stop it.

354
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,039
Hey, stop it.

355
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,917
Did someone spike his jajangmyeon?

356
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,131
Darn it. Oh no.

357
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,967
Hey, you're about to perform.

358
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,678
Here, wipe it.

359
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,266
No, wait. You can't use that.

360
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,226
What?

361
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,524
This is oil, so it'll spread
once you get water on it.

362
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:35,403
Drop soap on just the spot.

363
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,448
Then you rub it like this.

364
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,825
Then wash it out.

365
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,580
Ta-da.

366
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,375
Hey, you're right.

367
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,586
Goodness, Jae-u. How did you know this?

368
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,881
You're very thorough.

369
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,676
This is why I like you. Goodness.

370
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,767
-My gosh.
-I nearly died.

371
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,723
Darn it.

372
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,558
What's with them? Darn it.

373
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,019
-Hey.
-Hey, Go Dok.

374
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,152
Darn it.

375
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,905
Hey, don't you think this is too much?

376
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,532
What is?

377
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,576
"What is?"

378
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,453
Darn it.

379
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,663
Three beers, please.

380
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,472
-Hi.
-Hey.

381
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,394
You kiss in the morning,

382
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,938
you kiss at lunch,
then you kiss her goodnight.

383
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,608
I saw you two kiss

384
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,527
more than ten times
over the past two days.

385
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,239
What's with her? Is she a pervert?
Is she dating you for the kisses?

386
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,950
No one dates for kisses.

387
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,076
What do you think?

388
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,622
There are many reasons
why people go out with someone.

389
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,500
In my case, I want to date a sexy girl.

390
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,920
But when I see a cute girl,
I want to date her too.

391
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,589
I want to date
an older girl and a younger girl.

392
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,508
Whatever, idiot.

393
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:07,430
I'm saying there are many reasons
why people go out with someone.

394
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,516
Just as you like her,

395
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,227
she must have a reason for dating you.

396
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,229
A reason.

397
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,068
Your body.

398
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,779
-My body?
-Your body.

399
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,867
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

400
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,537
It's number two. Darn it.

401
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,456
Hey, we were talking. That's gross.
What about my body?

402
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,297
My gosh.

403
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,591
Hey, of course.

404
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,468
I can see why you would think so.

405
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,929
A lot of these jerks date girls
just to get them in bed.

406
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,306
I don't hate it,

407
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,852
but sometimes, I can't help but think

408
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,563
that's why he's going out with me.

409
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,356
That maybe I seem easy.

410
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,734
That maybe he's dating me to touch me
although he doesn't like me.

411
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,821
Darn it, that jerk. Is he a pervert?

412
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,699
Gosh.

413
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,118
Is she a pervert?

414
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,953
Is she dating you for the kisses?

415
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,624
-Come on in.
-Come in.

416
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,667
BALLOON DART GAME

417
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,130
It really is a college festival.

418
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,549
How long has it been
since I've been to one?

419
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,427
You've done well, Ban-do.

420
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,012
You've worked hard.

421
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,514
You really have a knack
for making people laugh.

422
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,974
Hey, let's go in here.

423
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,769
INVINCIBLE PHYS ED

424
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,738
GET READY AND SHOOT

425
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,159
Release at three. Release.

426
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,327
That's it.

427
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,754
Give me a freaking break.

428
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,716
-Thank you.
-Whatever.

429
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,682
Hey, I remember.

430
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,352
We always had this booth back in college.

431
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,147
-Do you want to do it?
-Yes, you should do it.

432
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,864
You're on a date? I'm jealous.

433
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,160
Everyone is working hard,
from freshmen to seniors,

434
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,288
drenching our youth away
to make money for our student body.

435
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,667
But this underclassman didn't show up
because he was on a date?

436
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,796
Where is your discipline? Darn it.

437
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,548
No, wait. That's not it.

438
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,801
Look who this is. Jin-ju.

439
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,428
So? Do you want to play a round?

440
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,346
Yes.

441
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,974
Okay. It's 500 won per round.

442
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,642
I'll give you 1,000 per round.

443
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,314
CIVIL ENGINEERING WATER BOMB

444
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,691
But I want him.

445
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,075
What are you doing over there?

446
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,120
Hey, wait. Wait a second.

447
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,539
-Hey, wait.
-Thank you.

448
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,832
I don't mean… Wait.

449
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,385
All right.

450
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,600
You jerk. Make it quick.

451
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,652
Bull's eye!

452
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,655
Jin-ju, you're really good.

453
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,490
This is nothing.

454
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,118
Let me change your diaper, okay?
You're so cute.

455
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,369
All done.

456
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,092
-What was that?
-She's good.

457
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,811
-Hey.
-Yes?

458
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,313
Can you switch him out?

459
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,941
Why? Are you worried about Ban-do?

460
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,610
Yes, of course.

461
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,155
Hey, Ban-do. One second.

462
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:39,494
Don't you think we should switch him out?

463
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,496
I think he might die at this rate.

464
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,582
Don't you dare.
I only go after one target.

465
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,046
No, right?

466
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,597
How many do you get to throw
with 10,000 won anyway?

467
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,481
Jin-ju.

468
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,858
I'll kill you.

469
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,904
Man, she's tough.

470
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,908
She really did only go after one guy.

471
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,787
Hey, but there's something I found out.

472
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,916
This thing called love comes with concern.

473
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,253
Seo-yeong…

474
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,049
I think Seo-yeong… I think…

475
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,385
I think she likes you.

476
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,470
You punk.

477
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,556
I'm sure of it. Take my word for it.

478
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,142
-Man, you're so slow.
-What?

479
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,184
That was quick.

480
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,770
Goodness, great work on figuring that out.

481
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,605
Great work.

482
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,066
What? You already knew?

483
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,860
How did you know?

484
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:57,488
How did a slow and ignorant guy like you
figure out something this subtle?

485
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,325
Why are you sighing?

486
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,913
-Let's go.
-What's with you?

487
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,125
You were running amok
like a horse high on drugs.

488
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,459
Did she dump you already?

489
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,004
You didn't let her kiss you.

490
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,423
Don't pick a fight with me.
I'm not in the mood.

491
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,509
Okay, sir.

492
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,805
Ban-do. Get changed
into our department uniform.

493
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,599
You used to wear it all the time.

494
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,935
I'm telling you.
You really shouldn't do this.

495
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,646
You'll embarrass yourself on TV

496
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,857
and become the Two Bruce Lees nationwide.

497
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,443
No, I'm out. I can't do this.

498
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:40,364
Hey, Ban-do. Are you sure
you won't regret not joining us on TV?

499
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,365
I won't.

500
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,451
If you're so sure,

501
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,495
then come and take our pictures.

502
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,915
Let's go.

503
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,584
-Let's go.
-Do you have to go down this path?

504
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:56,756
Hey! Then at least
lose the water jug! Okay?

505
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,257
Hey, Kang Ho-dong is here!

506
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,842
-Kang Ho-dong?
-Gosh.

507
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,186
Hey, Kang Ho-dong is here!

508
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,438
-Kang Ho-dong?
-Really? Kang Ho-dong?

509
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,814
What? Who?

510
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,737
-Let's go.
-It's Kang Ho-dong.

511
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,865
It's fine. Why should I see Kang Ho-dong?

512
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:26,077
It's not about him.
Jae-u and the boys will be there.

513
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,703
They'll do something stupid again.

514
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,830
You really won't go?
We'll go by ourselves.

515
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,958
Okay, see you later.

516
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,168
-Let's go.
-I'll come back after I see Ho-dong.

517
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,754
-Okay.
-Let's hurry.

518
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,866
Here you go. Thank you.

519
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,619
Is this for me?

520
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,413
Why?

521
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:54,999
Gosh.

522
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,598
It's new.

523
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,393
Did you get it for me? Why?

524
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,021
Gosh.

525
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,331
HISTORY PUB

526
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,544
Just laugh out loud. It's more degrading
when you stifle your laughter.

527
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,673
That's why I told you
to at least lose the jug.

528
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:48,594
I tried to change your destiny,
but you won't listen.

529
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,012
Once this gets out on TV,

530
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,973
it'll be a disgrace
that will follow you for life.

531
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,393
Why? He was cute.

532
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,937
Great job today.

533
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,523
Gosh, you and your cute mouth.

534
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,986
Isn't that Seo-yeong?

535
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,572
Why is she lurking around?

536
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,784
Hey, Seo-yeong! Hey!

537
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,703
Ban-do. Ban-do is over here.

538
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,749
A mosquito.

539
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,002
Good luck.

540
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,348
Nam-gil, where have you been?

541
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,275
1999 MAY QUEEN PAGEANT

542
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,570
Humanities is a no-show?

543
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,113
-Yes.
-Yes.

544
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,198
Darn it.

545
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,284
Hey, what's the matter?

546
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,619
Well, one of the contestants
didn't show up.

547
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,247
What? The Zhang Ziyi
of the Chinese department?

548
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,333
Yes, that's the problem with pretty girls.

549
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,262
I shouldn't drink too much.

550
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,642
-It'll stop soon, right?
-Probably.

551
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:32,907
What?

552
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,076
Did you see us?

553
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,874
Darn it. See? How can we go to school now?

554
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,417
No, it was funny.

555
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,294
Funny, my foot.

556
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,134
A relationship with a minor.

557
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,790
How does a young kid
have such passion in his eyes?

558
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,960
Gosh, you playboy.

559
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,049
What? What do you want?

560
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,927
Give me some. I haven't had any.

561
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,223
Are you hungry? Here.

562
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,734
Hey! Jin-ju.

563
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:05,916
Hey, why did you get
something on your shirt, like an old lady?

564
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,084
"An old lady"?

565
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,005
Mind your own business.
Stop meddling with mine.

566
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,845
SHOWERS

567
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,233
I hear older men
dating minors is a problem.

568
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,904
There are disgusting pedos everywhere.

569
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,699
"Pedo"? What's that?

570
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,660
These perverts who like young girls.

571
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:47,041
Well, I hear older women are
the bigger problem nowadays.

572
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,918
What do you call that? Male escort bars?

573
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,962
Young men are all over them at those bars,

574
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,007
so they go crazy
thinking they're still that young.

575
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:56,634
Be careful.

576
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,553
There's more than meets the eye.

577
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,973
-Hey.
-What?

578
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,436
What kind of a conversation is this?

579
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,647
What's with the perverts and escorts?

580
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,649
Were they always close?

581
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,694
Tell me about it.
They suddenly became very close.

582
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,655
We're not close.

583
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:23,494
Forget it.
Give us some spicy stir-fried pork.

584
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,120
I hear your pub is amazing.

585
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,414
Yes, we had a hidden prodigy chef.

586
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,792
Hey, Jin-ju!

587
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:33,671
Come on, Jin-ju. The humanities
can't be the only ones not competing.

588
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:37,257
The student council said you can come
since you were in the preliminaries.

589
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,967
Please do it.

590
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,012
What? She was in the preliminaries?

591
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,807
She won, but she refused to do it.

592
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,519
Jin-ju, do it. You're the prettiest
in the College of Humanities.

593
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,020
Just do it.

594
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,523
Me, the May Queen?

595
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:56,235
And I'm not the type who likes
being at the center of attention.

596
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,113
Not everyone can be the May Queen.

597
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,866
Don't humiliate yourself out there.
Don't bother.

598
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,451
That jerk.

599
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,787
What's his problem?

600
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,039
Humiliate myself?

601
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,333
You're afraid I'll win if I compete.

602
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,669
-What?
-That's it. Win.

603
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,796
Let's do that. You're doing it.

604
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:16,714
Sorry?

605
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:21,343
I mean, look. My clothes are a mess.

606
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,387
Next time, maybe.

607
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:30,894
What's this?

608
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,230
Hey, what's this dress?

609
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,315
I had it in my car.

610
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,527
You had it in your car? A dress?

611
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,742
My sister. It's my younger sister's.

612
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,411
Okay, sure.

613
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,416
Gosh, this isn't right.

614
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,294
I'm no May Queen.

615
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,212
You're no May Queen.

616
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,089
Pray you don't come in last.

617
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,509
What will you do if I win?

618
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,678
What? Win?

619
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,893
-Goodness.
-Let's go.

620
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,896
-Let's do it.
-Really?

621
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:18,567
Then I'll tell them to get
some accessories too. Let's go.

622
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,735
Come on, hurry.

623
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,029
MAY QUEEN PAGEANT MAKEUP AND WAITING ROOM

624
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,616
Here, she's the humanities contestant.

625
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:26,700
-Okay.
-Okay.

626
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:32,289
I said I'd do it
because Ban-do made me angry,

627
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,459
but the May Queen?
Come on. I can't do this.

628
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,629
Hey, I…

629
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,965
Please do a great job.
You're the queen of our department.

630
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:46,303
-Hey--
-Even better if you win.

631
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:47,805
Wait.

632
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,933
Hey, wait. One second. Goodness.

633
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:52,893
Are you from humanities?

634
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,896
-Ma Jin-ju, freshman history major.
-Yes.

635
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,107
-Get changed and get ready.
-Okay.

636
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,403
Gosh.

637
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,915
Why is this so short?

638
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,293
It's about to begin.

639
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,464
MAY QUEEN KO EUN-SEON, KIM YO-EUN, GO!

640
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,091
It's nice to see you, everyone.

641
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,469
It's the long-awaited moment.

642
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,513
The highlight of the festival.

643
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:33,016
Let us begin
the Hanguk University May Queen Pageant.

644
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,184
Give it up!

645
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:38,021
We don't even have to watch.
I know Jin-ju is going to win.

646
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,608
Yes, we don't have to.
I know she'll come in last.

647
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,739
My gosh. Don't look at me like that.

648
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,950
You're really scary
when you glare like that.

649
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,286
How am I scary? Am I scary?

650
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,122
What?

651
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,040
Hanguk University's Queen of May.

652
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,835
-Before we meet the contestants…
-What? Are you thinking?

653
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:02,963
But don't just cheer
for your college or department…

654
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,214
I was just joking.

655
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,675
-Chicken.
-You should clap for everyone.

656
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,343
-Okay?
-Okay!

657
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:11,597
Sounds great.
Then please welcome the first contestant.

658
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:16,226
From the College of Education,
it's Kim Yeong-ju! Come on out!

659
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,352
Applause!

660
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,565
She's so pretty. Very pretty.

661
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,901
Please say hi to everyone. Looking great.

662
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:27,779
Next, College of Engineering, Ko Eun-seon!

663
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,200
-My gosh.
-Gosh.

664
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,953
Look at her. Come on out.

665
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,330
Say hello to everyone.

666
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,498
That's the spirit. Great job.

667
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,667
Should I just drop out?

668
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,128
Should I? Should I leave?

669
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,881
But I said I'll do it.

670
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:50,093
And now,
it's already our final contestant.

671
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:53,597
College of Humanities, Ma Jin-ju!

672
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,432
-Applause!
-It's Jin-ju.

673
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,608
Give her a big hand!

674
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,282
She's very beautiful. Isn't she?

675
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,617
-Yes!
-All right!

676
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,202
Okay.

677
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,750
-She looks great.
-She's so pretty.

678
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:33,303
Hey, do all girls look pretty
when they're dressed up like her?

679
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:34,805
No.

680
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,641
Now, introduce yourself.

681
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,559
Sorry?

682
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:41,770
Introduce yourself.

683
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,313
Right.

684
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,068
Hello, I'm…

685
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:51,655
I'm Ma Jin-ju, a freshman
in the College of Humanities.

686
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,950
You seem very nervous.

687
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,745
These beautiful ladies are

688
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,456
about to show off their talents.

689
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,584
Ms. Ma Jin-ju,
what are you going to show us?

690
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,421
No one said anything about that.

691
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,799
-Isn't she the girl you're working on?
-Really?

692
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,510
-Yes, she's the one.
-We told everyone.

693
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,846
Make it quick. You may lose your chance.

694
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,682
In that case, since it's a talent show,

695
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,977
you should just do
something that you're good at.

696
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:26,690
Well, I may have a talent
for eating and digesting,

697
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,485
but I don't have any other talent.

698
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,863
-I'm forfeiting.
-Wait.

699
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,824
You can't leave
after you introduced yourself.

700
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,117
You can't go.

701
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,911
Then just do whatever you're good at.

702
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:44,291
For example, dancing,
singing, or impersonations. Okay?

703
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:49,337
I don't think I'm good at anything.

704
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:52,966
Something I'm good at?

705
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,893
My gosh, you're one amazing singer.

706
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:06,521
That's why our daughters
are such good singers too.

707
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,692
Jin-ju is an amazing singer.

708
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,028
She was born with it.

709
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,781
Maybe she should become a singer.

710
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:16,907
-A singer?
-Yes.

711
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,414
KIM YO-EUN, SON JU-HUI

712
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:25,415
PARK HUI-YEONG

713
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,945
I have a question.

714
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,157
-Sure.
-What do you like?

715
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:00,700
What do I like?

716
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,995
I like ballet, hip hop, and dancing.

717
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,581
You know everything that I like.

718
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:10,001
But I don't seem to know much about you.

719
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,254
You're right.

720
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,340
What do I like?

721
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,883
Something I like?

722
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,720
Maybe it's because I don't like anything.

723
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,599
How could you not like anything?
Think harder.

724
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,562
What do I like? Something I like?

725
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,063
-Drink up.
-Great.

726
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:32,566
Drinking.

727
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,653
That's what you came up with? Drinking?

728
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,865
I really don't know.

729
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:43,034
Goodness. Well, that's so you.

730
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,164
What a shame.

731
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,250
Tell me about it.
Jin-ju was the prettiest.

732
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,752
I know she's your friend,
but that's wrong.

733
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,629
She wasn't the prettiest.

734
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:55,922
She was.

735
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,759
-Are you challenging me?
-What? I never challenged you.

736
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,971
Let's just say the judges were blind.

737
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:08,143
How many times
does Jae-u have to go to the restroom?

738
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,813
Anyway, Mr. Bo-reum.

739
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:16,902
I have a question.
May I carefully proceed to ask you?

740
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,821
You're free to ask me anything,
but it's up to me to answer.

741
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,324
You never let anything go. Forget it.

742
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,242
What is it?

743
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:29,456
Are you dating Jae-u just to kiss…

744
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,918
She'll beat me if I ask her like that.

745
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,503
Yes, right.

746
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,340
Why are you dating Jae-u?

747
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,175
What?

748
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,969
I mean,
you must have all kinds of reasons.

749
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,387
So why are you dating him?

750
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,389
Why do you want to know?

751
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,726
Come on, it's not like
it'll cost you anything.

752
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,270
Because he's easy.

753
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,523
Jae-u is easy.

754
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,904
Easy. He's easy?

755
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:02,906
Then…

756
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,369
This is awesome

757
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,704
CLOSED FOR REPAIRS
GO TO THE COLLEGE OF ARTS

758
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,626
Come on. The College of Arts is too far.

759
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,225
-Hey, I'm serious.
-Wasn't the winner really pretty?

760
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,519
Tell me about it. This year was amazing.

761
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:40,151
I liked the girl
from the College of Arts. She was pretty.

762
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,696
-Anyway, all the girls were pretty.
-Oh no.

763
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,741
Not her. The history major
from humanities. She was cute.

764
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,286
-She was just my type.
-Me too.

765
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:53,415
Goodness, those kids.
They have great taste in women.

766
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,918
Hey, Hyeon-seok already
called dibs on her from the club.

767
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,838
Yes, I called dibs, so hands off.

768
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,507
Right, Director Park.

769
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,968
These kids.

770
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:07,595
You can have her
once I get bored of her, so wait.

771
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,057
What? What kind of…

772
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,393
I'll kill all of them.

773
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,187
-You're amazing.
-Hyeon-seok, you're something.

774
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,315
I'll kill those jerks.

775
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,366
Man, did I drink too much?

776
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,286
Goodness, what are you doing?

777
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,211
What are you doing?

778
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,131
And what are you doing?

779
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,300
What?

780
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,853
-Please welcome him.
-Thank you.

781
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,272
Campus Song Festival!
I'm at Hanguk University.

782
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,525
That's Jin-ju's school. Come on out.

783
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,693
-Really?
-All right, look at this energy.

784
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,153
I heard they came recently.

785
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,239
Hey, Jin-ju! Come on out!

786
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,491
Why won't she come out?

787
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,536
Maybe she doesn't want to watch.
Let her be.

788
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,704
Please welcome the students.

789
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,916
-Look at him.
-"Nice to meet you."

790
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,751
The three guys.

791
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,003
Nice to meet you.
Please introduce yourselves.

792
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,713
-There they are.
-Hello!

793
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,508
We're freshmen from civil engineering!

794
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,467
I'm Choi Ban-do!

795
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,428
I'm An Jae-u!

796
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,388
I'm Go Dok-jae!

797
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,515
-Two, three.
-That's us!

798
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,017
-They're cute.
-What are you here to show us?

799
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,603
Will you show us super strength?
Okay, show us.

800
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,939
Hi-yah!

801
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,233
ENJOY SUNDAY

802
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:29,112
-Hi-yah.
-Go.

803
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,447
He's like me.

804
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,323
-Hi-yah.
-Hi-yah.

805
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,827
-Hi-yah.
-Hi-yah.

806
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,036
They're hilarious.

807
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,330
They're just like me.

808
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,124
-Hi-yah.
-Wait, stop.

809
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,793
Why are they so funny?

810
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,713
Which school are you dumbheads from?

811
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,755
Are you dating?

812
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,048
She's a history major!

813
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,634
Ma Jin-ju.

814
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:59,309
-That's my boyfriend.
-I love you!

815
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:04,856
Bring him here.

816
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,233
Bring him here now!

817
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,651
Me too!

818
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,412
I'm going to kill him!

819
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,107
How dare you open the door?

820
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,527
If you're a med student,

821
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,946
isn't there a Med Students' Night?

822
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,948
Do you want to go with me?

823
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,450
I'll never know for sure
unless I ask her myself.

824
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:01,621
-I told you Bo-reum looked like a player.
-That bitch.

825
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,499
-Who are you taking?
-I'll see.

826
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:07,168
What? She's crazy.

827
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,169
I bought it for you.

828
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:12,006
You must be thrilled to live a new life
with a tall and handsome guy.

829
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,217
Why won't he pick up?

830
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:21,015
