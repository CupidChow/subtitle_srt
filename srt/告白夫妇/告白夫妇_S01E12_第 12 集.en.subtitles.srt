1
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,047
Hello?

2
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,674
Where are you right now?

3
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,593
What?

4
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,345
I'm crying right now.

5
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,766
Must I cry alone again?

6
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,521
Don't cry. I'll be there.

7
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,815
I'll go. Stay there.

8
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,229
Jin-tae!

9
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,188
Jin-ju!

10
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,731
No.

11
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,192
Ban-do.

12
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,198
No, Ban-do!

13
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,325
Honey!

14
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,748
No.

15
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,833
No.

16
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,380
No. Get up. Please.

17
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,548
No.

18
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,263
No.

19
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,599
Get up.

20
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,020
Honey!

21
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,106
Honey!

22
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,693
Get up.

23
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,446
Get up!

24
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,309
OPERATING ROOM

25
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:49,938
No.

26
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,818
Ban-do.

27
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,080
Ban-do. Wake up.

28
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,665
Please wake up.

29
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,714
What are you up to?

30
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,760
It came back to life.

31
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,845
It did.

32
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:27,100
But it doesn't look so great.
Did I overwater it?

33
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,434
You need to be consistent.

34
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,688
It's too much for it to handle
if you give it a lot at once.

35
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,108
Leave it there and come out.
I'll massage your hands and feet.

36
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,734
-After I clean up.
-Okay.

37
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,159
You need to call his family.
He needs surgery now.

38
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,120
I'm his family.

39
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,621
I'll sign it. Just do it.

40
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,248
We can't have a friend sign it.

41
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,834
We need to know his blood type
and if he's taking drugs.

42
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,210
I know everything.

43
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,297
His blood type is A. He has asthma,

44
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,257
and he's allergic to peaches.

45
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,843
I really am his family.

46
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,471
Operate on him quickly.
What if something happens to him?

47
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,848
Where?

48
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,268
Where is he? Where's Ban-do?

49
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,269
Is this it?

50
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,565
Mother.

51
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,119
Hey.

52
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,330
You didn't shave properly.

53
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,459
Goodness, you are so impatient.

54
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,047
Mr. Choi can't have any visitors.

55
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,216
But his surgery went well

56
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,761
and he's recovering right now.
Why can't I see him?

57
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,389
You're right,
but visitation is limited to family only.

58
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,849
What?

59
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,770
-Even today?
-That's correct.

60
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,147
Are you sure he's all right?

61
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,565
He's recovering.

62
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,817
You keep saying that.

63
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,862
If he can't have visitors,
it means he's not doing well.

64
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,491
Wait, I…

65
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,293
Mother.

66
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,967
-Are you his girlfriend?
-Sorry?

67
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,762
Yes.

68
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,307
My name is Ma Jin-ju.

69
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,893
You have such a pretty name too.

70
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,646
Things were so hectic then,
we didn't get to talk.

71
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,731
You must like Ban-do a lot.

72
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,692
You cried much more than I did,

73
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,820
so I was very surprised.

74
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,616
Ban-do woke up and he's better now.

75
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,619
The hospital won't let you see him yet,

76
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,163
but please don't worry. Go home.

77
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,791
I'll give you a call when you can see him.

78
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,209
Goodbye, then.

79
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,337
Mother.

80
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,841
Is he really okay?

81
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,472
Ban-do's surgery must've gone well
and he must be recovering quickly

82
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,309
thanks to your sweet love, my dear Jin-ju.

83
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,480
Don't worry about him.

84
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,988
Okay. Yes, Mother. Goodbye.

85
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,072
All right.

86
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:31,951
What's up?

87
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,039
She says not to come too early
on Lunar New Year's

88
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,292
because Father will only nag us

89
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,710
to have kids soon.

90
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,670
Gosh, that's so my dad.

91
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,799
Don't mind him.

92
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,218
I don't anymore.

93
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,055
But I love it
when Mother calls me "my dear Jin-ju."

94
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,474
"My dear Jin-ju"?

95
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,977
She doesn't just call "daughter-in-law"
like other families.

96
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,770
She always says, "My dear Jin-ju."

97
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,900
I think she does it in case
I feel left out when I'm with your family.

98
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,902
Anyway, I like it.

99
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,462
You too, Mother.
Please don't worry about him either.

100
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,219
Thank you.

101
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,184
HANGUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

102
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,780
She left.

103
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,666
She comes because she's worried.

104
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,252
Why do you keep sending her away?

105
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,546
You risked your life to save hers.

106
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:13,219
Anyway, she's very nice and pretty.

107
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,600
She's pretty all right.

108
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,148
-Mom.
-Yes?

109
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,526
Even if you don't remember, please do.

110
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,320
She was really good to you.

111
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,076
Why do you keep saying weird stuff?

112
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,956
Get some more rest.

113
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,801
Ban-do.

114
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,013
Jin-ju.

115
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,349
Did you see him?

116
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,311
No, he's not allowed to have visitors,
so I couldn't.

117
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,022
What? Why can't he have visitors?

118
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,940
I came because he asked me to.

119
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:17,908
I want a divorce.

120
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,952
We're unhappy.

121
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,788
I'm too unhappy.

122
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,916
I love your hugs the most.

123
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,634
Hey, you're here.

124
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,843
Ban-do.

125
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,694
Why?

126
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,739
Why'd you do it?

127
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:59,909
I thought

128
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,745
you were going to die that day.

129
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,039
My mind went blank

130
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,625
and I couldn't breathe.

131
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,835
That short moment was

132
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,380
so terrifying

133
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,091
and scary.

134
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,511
I felt every single cell
in my body become petrified

135
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,013
like when Mom died.

136
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,521
But I couldn't do anything

137
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,649
because we weren't family.

138
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,567
They said I was nothing to you,

139
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,653
so I couldn't get you surgery.

140
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,533
My husband of 18 years was dying,

141
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,538
but I couldn't…

142
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,712
Why did you do that?

143
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,632
Why are you avoiding me?

144
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,011
Sorry.

145
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,848
I'm sorry.

146
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,477
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

147
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:16,736
When my life flashed before my eyes,

148
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,612
I could see

149
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:23,826
what I had done to you
because of my greed.

150
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,621
You told

151
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,291
Director Park's wife

152
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:34,003
that she has many more days to come
than the days she has lived.

153
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,509
We have no idea how we can go back.

154
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,929
Jin-ju.

155
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,349
Forget everything

156
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,771
and live with your mom here.

157
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,106
What?

158
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,361
I thought it would work
if I were sincere, but I was wrong.

159
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,032
There's no way I won't make you cry.

160
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,872
What about Seo-jin?

161
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,875
What about our Seo-jin?

162
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,381
Did you…

163
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,135
decide to forget about him too?

164
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,514
Did you?

165
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,309
My head may be

166
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,563
filled with thoughts of our son,

167
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,943
but you're more precious to me.

168
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,006
We found these at the scene.
Are they yours?

169
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,520
Yes.

170
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,790
Seo-jin.

171
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,211
I love your hugs the most.

172
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,840
Goodness. You've been too cute lately.

173
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,467
Let's go.

174
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,681
Daddy is sorry.

175
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,367
Daddy is sorry.

176
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,747
Daddy is sorry.

177
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,091
Gosh. Jin-ju is stuck to you like gum.

178
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,651
Jin-ju, why are you crying?

179
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,990
Mom…

180
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,092
Jin-ju.

181
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,843
Jin-ju, get up.

182
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,641
Someone's here to see you.

183
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,518
Who?

184
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:19,853
A guy.

185
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,626
What is it? You didn't even call.

186
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,211
What?

187
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,882
If I called you to hang out,
you would've said no.

188
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,512
Well, I'm not feeling well today, so--

189
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,722
It's my birthday today.

190
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,853
So just for today.

191
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,444
It's him. The chairman's son.

192
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,071
You can smell money on him, can't you?

193
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,458
I'm done.

194
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,500
I'm done!

195
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,844
Bo-reum, wait up!

196
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,598
Take your time. You might trip.

197
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,516
I won't trip.

198
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,809
Do you have practice again?

199
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,936
-The competition is soon, right?
-Yes.

200
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,813
Are you in the center again?

201
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,191
Who knows?
I'll have to do the preliminaries first.

202
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,360
Don't be so modest.
Who else would stand in the center?

203
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,323
Too bad Jae-u isn't good enough
to be your partner.

204
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,535
It's not something
you can pick up overnight.

205
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,661
It's okay.

206
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,164
Let's go.

207
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,373
CHEER CONTEST PRELIMINARIES

208
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,544
ASURA CHEERLEADING SQUAD

209
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,138
Okay, that's good.

210
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,724
Great job. You did very well.

211
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,018
But I don't think you'll be the center.
Ensemble.

212
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,395
Yes, I see. Okay.

213
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,647
Great job.

214
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,734
I knew it.
You're the only talent around here.

215
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,075
Next.

216
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,576
Yes.

217
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,996
What? You want to compete too?

218
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,750
Well, can't I at least try out
for the preliminaries?

219
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,253
Sure. Give it a try.

220
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,933
Hey, why aren't you mentioning Jae-u?

221
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,977
Hey, what if he makes it?

222
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,771
Don't judge people so rashly.

223
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,450
Goodness.

224
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,661
That hurts.

225
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,234
That's enough.

226
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,154
Hey, Jae-u. You've improved a lot.

227
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,197
Thank you.

228
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,787
Great work.

229
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,040
But it's still not enough to be
at the center. Ensemble.

230
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,336
Ensemble? No, I have to be at the center.

231
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,130
What?

232
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,840
Nothing.

233
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,434
Where are we going?

234
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,812
And what's that?

235
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,358
-A picnic.
-A picnic?

236
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,988
Yes, the birthday boy
gets to decide what he wants to do.

237
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:26,159
Well, that's true, but…

238
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,414
This is the competition squad.

239
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,623
ENSEMBLE: BO-REUM, JAE-U

240
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,085
PRELIMINARIES RESULT

241
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,296
Bo-reum, why did you do that?

242
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,924
You did poorly on purpose.
Why are you in the ensemble?

243
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,266
Hey, Jae-u!

244
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,019
What's wrong?

245
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,982
You made a mistake on purpose.

246
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,192
I'm the one who was bad.
Why did you do that?

247
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,277
You made me look bad.

248
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,740
What's so wrong about wanting
to be partners with my boyfriend?

249
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,242
But still, cheer is cheer.

250
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,244
I'm holding you back.

251
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,832
This isn't a matter of life and death.
Who cares?

252
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:17,669
-This was my way of getting closer to you.
-What?

253
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,881
I want to be your partner more
than I want to be at the center.

254
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,134
I know you tried hard to get closer to me.

255
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,636
It's about the process, not the result.

256
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,931
If you can't reach me, I can go to you.
What's the problem?

257
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,809
What's important is that you tried.

258
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,940
You fool.
I always have to lay it out for you.

259
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,284
Seriously.

260
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,372
Ta-da.

261
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,000
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

262
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,961
Did you make this yourself?

263
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,466
Of course. I woke up early
and prepared everything.

264
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:08,845
You don't look like the type,
but you must be a good cook.

265
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,808
My goodness.

266
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,519
You rolled it up so nicely.

267
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,646
You're talented.

268
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,899
Let's see.

269
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,986
Tteokbokki?

270
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,368
You prepared sundae yourself?

271
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,163
I was buying it until gimbap,

272
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,790
but tteokbokki and sundae?

273
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,750
You bought them.

274
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:43,046
Yes, I said I prepared them myself,
not that I made them myself.

275
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,507
All right, fine.

276
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,552
But I put them in the containers myself.

277
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,604
You can pop a couple of them so they look

278
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,690
homemade.

279
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,525
Goodness, all right.

280
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,069
I'm doing a sloppy job on purpose

281
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,159
You could've just brought them as is.
Why did you put them in here?

282
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,660
You ended up confessing anyway.

283
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,163
I didn't put them in containers
to lie about making them.

284
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,332
I just wanted it
to feel more like a picnic.

285
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,334
As if my mom made it.

286
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,713
I haven't been to a picnic like this

287
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,590
since I was very young.

288
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,266
It's good.

289
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,102
Try some.

290
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,444
It's good.

291
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,245
Who is it?

292
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,333
-Ta-da.
-Ta-da!

293
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,920
Gosh, guys. You all came?

294
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,381
We didn't want to go to class anyway,
so I brought everyone.

295
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,218
Goodness.

296
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,888
Are you all right?
The semester's almost over,

297
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,806
and you get hit by a car?

298
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,476
I'm not all right. I'm in so much pain.

299
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,478
I heard you got surgery.

300
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,480
You can read these when you get bored.

301
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,193
What's this though?

302
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,863
This? It isn't for you.

303
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,784
-It's for us.
-What is it?

304
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,956
Goodness.

305
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,750
You all are something.

306
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,127
How did you think of bringing these here?

307
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,881
I know you're all young,
but where is your common sense?

308
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:54,594
Are you drinking our alcohol
because you have common sense?

309
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:58,390
It's disrespecting the alcohol
if you don't drink it when it's there.

310
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,100
It's your fault for bringing it.

311
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,893
In light of that, cheers!

312
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,853
-Cheers!
-Okay.

313
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,276
We had to get some because of him.

314
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,450
Stop crying, idiot. You're so annoying.

315
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,078
A man should be able
to risk his life for his country.

316
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,247
-You're so annoying.
-What about you?

317
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,000
What? Why?

318
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,044
I'm the only son for three generations.

319
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,963
This country did nothing for me.

320
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,507
Bo-reum!

321
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,509
No, never mind.

322
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,013
It's okay. Two years will go by quickly.

323
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,057
Yes, we'll hang out with you
even when we're juniors.

324
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,392
Let him be.

325
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,228
Your words mean nothing to him right now.

326
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,857
He needs time to deal with this.

327
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,151
He's the so-called "sensitivist."

328
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,069
-Not "army reservist"?
-What's that?

329
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:57,198
It's the time between getting
their draft notice and starting to serve.

330
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,328
Stage one, denial.

331
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,412
"Denial"?

332
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,790
No, this is wrong.

333
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,585
I know I have an early birthday,
but I can't be drafted already.

334
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,254
Something definitely went wrong.

335
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,425
Stage two, anger.

336
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,802
Why me?

337
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,514
Why me?
He didn't get it yet. Neither did he!

338
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,766
So why am I the first?

339
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,896
Stage three, compromise.

340
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,648
Stage four, depression.

341
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,237
Ban-do.

342
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,616
Pay your bill with this.

343
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,077
-A soldier doesn't need a gold necklace.
-Thanks.

344
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,120
Seol, this isn't beef jerky.

345
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,624
Bo-reum, tie your hair with this.
It's a limited edition.

346
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,584
You and I will talk later.

347
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,587
The final stage,

348
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,923
acceptance and compliance.

349
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,386
Hey, what's that? What is he doing?

350
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,971
He's memorizing your phone numbers.

351
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,350
What? Hey, don't you dare call me.

352
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,477
I'll block that number right away.

353
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,237
Don't pity me.

354
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,411
I heard you were hurt while saving Jin-ju.

355
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:28,081
-It could've been bad, right?
-It wasn't a big deal.

356
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,709
It could've been bad.

357
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,753
That's the love of reckless Ban-do.

358
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,505
He risked his life for her.

359
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,507
What? The love of what?

360
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,177
You and Jin-ju.

361
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,972
You didn't know?

362
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,599
You and Jin-ju like each other.

363
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,685
You two didn't know?

364
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,186
We knew.

365
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,439
Only idiots wouldn't know.

366
00:28:58,945 --> 00:28:59,863
Let's go.

367
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:03,908
Hey.

368
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,246
Thank you for your help that day.

369
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:12,041
Thanks for calling the police
the day of his accident.

370
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,004
Why are you thanking me?
I didn't help him for you.

371
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,340
He should thank me.

372
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,554
I mean, he and I are closer.

373
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,099
Last time, I know I saved you,

374
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,602
but Ban-do

375
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,188
came and thanked me.

376
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:34,981
What?

377
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:38,359
When you should thank me,
he thanked me.

378
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,362
When he should thank me,

379
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,239
you thank me.

380
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,578
Why is there such sorrow between you two?

381
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,581
There's no room for me.

382
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,543
-Hey, I--
-Let's go.

383
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,004
I want to go somewhere else.

384
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,561
Excuse me, ma'am.

385
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,440
Why are you at a market
instead of a department store?

386
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,777
I hear food here is fresh,
so I decided to stop by.

387
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,070
I see.

388
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,615
I'll take these tiny anchovies.

389
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,785
You bought a lot last time.
Did you finish them already?

390
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,912
My kids won't eat breakfast,

391
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,456
so I stir-fried these and made rice balls,

392
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,582
and they loved them.

393
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,043
Really? I should do that for my kids.

394
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,546
They refuse to eat breakfast.

395
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,965
Exactly. Give me some more.

396
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,092
Goodness. Okay.

397
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,308
It seems really tiny now.

398
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:53,935
The playground.

399
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,313
It's not a big deal.

400
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,233
Of course not. It's just a playground.

401
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,861
Did you think you'd see a ghost?

402
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,072
I was afraid of this place the most.

403
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,284
-The playground?
-Yes.

404
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,495
I'd play here when I was a kid,

405
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,666
but then my friends would leave
one by one when their moms came.

406
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,627
I was always left alone
in an empty playground.

407
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,422
It was scary

408
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,966
knowing my friends would all leave
and I'd be all alone.

409
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,219
And knowing there is someone
that will never come even if I wait.

410
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,764
That's why I never came here.

411
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,934
It's not like I asked for much.

412
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,813
I just wanted her to be ordinary.

413
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,399
A mom.

414
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,445
That's all I asked of her.

415
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,072
But she wouldn't do it for me.

416
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,956
Just because everyone does it
and it seems ordinary

417
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,542
doesn't mean that it's easy.

418
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,045
Living as a mom…

419
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,883
seems very ordinary
because everyone does it.

420
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,928
But it's actually very difficult.

421
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,599
It's like your past, present, and future

422
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,352
all disappear.

423
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,896
It feels like

424
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:25,151
your existence itself is useless

425
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,570
and petty.

426
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,123
Goodness, it's hot. It's very hot.

427
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:56,599
The fear and burden that demands me to be

428
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,893
the toughest person in this world.

429
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,354
It's not easy to deal with.

430
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,773
It's an incredibly big job.

431
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,904
I doubt that she refused to do it,

432
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,614
but she couldn't.

433
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,742
She's human too, after all.

434
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,208
You really are a mysterious one.

435
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,295
But whenever I'm with you, I feel at ease.

436
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,842
I feel like I've become a warm person too.

437
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,679
Now that I really like you,

438
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:40,101
I finally realize
whom your eyes were following.

439
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,443
Ban-do. No.

440
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,029
Honey!

441
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,115
Honey!

442
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,577
Get up.

443
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,788
Get up!

444
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,084
It's so unfair,

445
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,962
I need to say it now.

446
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,177
I…

447
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,305
like you a lot.

448
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,186
Just so you know.

449
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,857
You don't know how pretty you are.

450
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,837
Thank you for liking me.

451
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,967
Thank you for letting me know

452
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,386
that I'm still a woman.

453
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,182
But you really don't know yourself.

454
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,393
You have no idea how warm you are.

455
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,231
-What?
-You just don't know how.

456
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:12,235
But you're someone who looks after
kittens that cry and lonely people.

457
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,073
And sees when other people are hurt.

458
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,700
You're not pessimistic

459
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,745
or cynical.

460
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,207
You've grown up so well.

461
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,480
-It's not your birthday, is it?
-What?

462
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,441
I saw your ID earlier
when you dropped your wallet.

463
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:56,821
Then am I really your first love?

464
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,033
-Do you like that?
-A little.

465
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,079
It's nice to be someone's first love.

466
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,957
It feels like I have someone

467
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,836
who's rooting for me without my knowledge.

468
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,254
It's nice.

469
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,674
You were like that for me before

470
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,593
and you're like that now.

471
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,305
I'm sorry and grateful.

472
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,604
-I'll take you home.
-No, thanks.

473
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,733
It's perfect if we part ways here.

474
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,821
But I don't want to leave you here alone,

475
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,948
so you go first.

476
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,412
Okay.

477
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,415
Bye.

478
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,898
-Jin-ju.
-Hey, Mom.

479
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,859
Where have you been?
Did you go somewhere nice?

480
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,738
I just went to the Han River and stuff.

481
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,909
-Jin-ju.
-Yes?

482
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,537
How about a drink with your mom?

483
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,247
What?

484
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,085
This is nice.

485
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:19,213
Mom, you actually drink?
I've never seen you drink before.

486
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,965
Of course.

487
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,383
When I was young,

488
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,678
I was a better drinker
than most guys in my town.

489
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,888
That's fascinating.

490
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,683
I just found out
that you're a good dancer,

491
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,560
a good singer,

492
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,478
and a good drinker too.

493
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,273
I was born a party monster.

494
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,823
You're so pretty.

495
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,910
Mom, you're so pretty.

496
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,038
What? Me?

497
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:53,831
Yes.

498
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,709
I've always wanted to tell you this.

499
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,300
My daughter, you too.

500
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,094
You're so pretty.

501
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,056
Of course. I'm your daughter, after all.

502
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,193
Jin-ju.

503
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,403
Yes?

504
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,740
My pretty daughter.

505
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,533
Yes.

506
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,995
My pretty mom's daughter.

507
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,501
It's time to go…

508
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,671
back to your child now.

509
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,935
Mom.

510
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,192
Leave it there and come out.
I'll massage your hands and feet.

511
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,694
-After I clean up.
-Okay.

512
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:17,873
TO MY DEAR MOM

513
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:20,793
She's acting weird.

514
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,213
It's your birthday soon,
so it's probably for that.

515
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,634
MOM'S VOICE
TO MY DEAR MOM

516
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,682
TO MY DEAR MOM

517
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,149
MOM'S VOICE

518
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,592
Mom?

519
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,678
You never showed up in my dreams.

520
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,221
What a lucky dream.

521
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,769
It was nice to see you again, Mom.

522
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,617
Goodness.

523
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,119
You're so cute.

524
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,454
You would

525
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,957
adore my son a lot.

526
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,715
Seo-jin.

527
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,219
Seo-jin.

528
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,054
Seo-jin.

529
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,102
It must've been hard.

530
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,940
It must've been hard giving birth to me.

531
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,374
Go clubbing.

532
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,793
Go to the bathhouse with Mom.

533
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,170
Go to a karaoke with Mom.

534
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,798
Drink with Mom.

535
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,386
Say goodbye to Mom.

536
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,183
So who is this Seo-jin?

537
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,352
How much did you like him?

538
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,064
-Hey, Mom.
-Yes? Tell me.

539
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,649
Let's go to a bathhouse.

540
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,317
I'll scrub your back.

541
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,444
What?

542
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,823
My heart flows like the waves

543
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:56,907
Mom.

544
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,243
Want to go to a karaoke?

545
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,340
I have no idea what's going on.

546
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,635
I don't know what's happening.

547
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,306
But I do know this.

548
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,434
You can live without your parents,

549
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,520
but you can't live without your kid.

550
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,154
You don't have to cry.

551
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:40,534
All sadness becomes dull over time.

552
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,661
You'll become stronger.

553
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,414
It's bound to happen.

554
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,792
You don't get stronger.

555
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,962
It never gets dull.

556
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,299
It's still sad.

557
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,677
I keep missing you.

558
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,431
How can it get dull?

559
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,810
Mom.

560
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,192
As you raise your kid,

561
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,110
it'll happen.

562
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,781
It'll all happen.

563
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,164
Mom.

564
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,063
Mom…

565
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,041
Are you going somewhere?

566
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,170
I'm going to take a walk outside
to get some air.

567
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,802
Don't go too far.

568
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,435
Are we going home now?

569
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,229
Yes, we're going home now.

570
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,719

PROPOSAL PASSED

574
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,541
APARTMENT COMPLEX COMING SOON

575
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,002
Honey.

576
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,466
Let's go.

577
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,555
Let's go home.

578
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,668
Leaving for school?

579
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:24,758
-Yes.
-Your dad turned in his resignation.

580
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,928
He won't hurt your feelings anymore.

581
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,680
I see. Okay.

582
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,975
Are you sure you don't need breakfast?

583
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,268
I'm fine.

584
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,688
Then take these.

585
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,069
Eat them on the way.

YOU'RE OUR HOPE!

588
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,271
Don't be scared. You have me.

589
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,780
And next, the cheer squad
from Hanguk University.

590
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,157
Please welcome Asura.

591
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:39,833
BEAT, RHYTHM, VICTORY

592
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,844
Bo-reum! There she is.

593
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,513
Let's do it, Jae-u! You can do this!

594
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,155
-All right!
-Jae-u!

595
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,785
Hey, Jae-u!

596
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:15,869
Hey!

597
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,540
Bo-reum! Yun Bo-reum!

598
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,487
JUDGES

599
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,245
They don't look like they match,

600
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,080
but they're oddly cute together.

601
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:04,084
Bo-reum can definitely do better,
but I hope they don't break up.

602
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,836
Me too. Right?

603
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,839
Stay together forever
until the day you die.

604
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,095
-An Jae-u!
-Yun Bo-reum!

605
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,139
You're so cool!

00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,327
It's okay, Dok-jae.

608
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,375
Wait, sir.

609
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:50,130
Please make it pretty.
As pretty as you can, sir.

610
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,799
I'm going to shave it off.
How can I make it pretty?

611
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:00,932
That hurts.

612
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,979
I was born a man into this world

613
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:10,442
And I have many things to do

614
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,235
Hey, be quiet.

Gosh, it's freezing. My head.

617
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,629
My neck. My hair.

618
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:53,819
Here.

619
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:57,781
Thank you.

620
00:51:58,573 --> 00:51:59,699
You too, Jin-ju.

621
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,912
Honey, what about me?

622
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,915
Eat whatever's left.
I'll make it for you again.

623
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,544
Eat up.

624
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,421
Yes. Thank you.

625
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,091
Let's eat. Geez.

626
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,443
Jin-ju.

627
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,070
Yes?

628
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,572
If I'm not there

629
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:42,409
where you go back to…

630
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,412
Yes?

631
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,290
If that's the case,

632
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,918
then could you look after your dad?

633
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,046
What?

634
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,259
How can he go on without me around?

635
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,371
Visit him from time to time,

636
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,082
drink with him,

637
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,753
and let him see Seo-jin often.

638
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,589
Will you do that?

639
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,759
Father.

640
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,596
I got your favorite, fermented skate.

641
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:52,520
Why did you say that?
You have no desire to get remarried.

642
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:57,567
Eun-suk made me promise her
that I don't live a lonely life.

643
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,070
So I threw it out there.

644
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,744
Please look after your dad.

645
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:39,943
Hey.

646
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:44,281
I have a question. Do you mind if I ask?

647
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,451
Go ahead. What is it?

648
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:52,038
Why did Bo-reum and Jae-u break up?

649
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,540
What?

650
00:54:56,376 --> 00:55:00,088
Hey, that's what you want to ask
as we're about to go back?

651
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:03,091
What a mood killer. Goodness.

652
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,094
I mean, after seeing them like that again,

653
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,804
I'm more curious.

654
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:09,889
What was it?

655
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,226
Bo-reum is infertile.

656
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:14,936
She can't have kids.

657
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,526
I see.

658
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,530
Well, why didn't she tell him?

659
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,866
Why did she dump him so cruelly?

660
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,952
How? Jae-u is an only son
for three generations.

661
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,706
She just let him go

662
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,292
for him to meet someone better.

663
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,171
That's why you comforted her so much.

664
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,797
Because I know how she feels.

665
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,344
It was really hard for us
having our son too.

666
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:50,930
You're right.

667
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,518
Shall we go on our way

668
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,604
to see Seo-jin?

669
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,595
How about a kiss?

670
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:51,699
I love you.

671
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:54,994
Me too.

672
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,362
Seo-jin.

673
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,656
Seo-jin.

674
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,618
My son, Mommy is here.

675
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,248
Mommy is here, Seo-jin.

676
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,501
Mommy is here.

677
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,511
Honey.

678
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,389
Seo-jin.

679
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,267
Seo-jin.

680
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,231
Mommy.

681
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,278
Come here.

682
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,490
Ban-do said

683
00:58:56,366 --> 00:59:00,995
that we might have been on a short trip.

684
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,416
That the reason
we go on trips is to return

685
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,295
and cherish what we have even more.

686
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,883
What's your salary?

687
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,719
That must be important to you.

688
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:19,138
Of course.
We're looking to get married, not date.

689
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,640
You must make a lot.

690
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,891
Well,

691
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,852
I dream of becoming a devoted housewife.

692
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:25,937
I see.

693
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,648
A devoted housewife.

694
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,568
In the end,
looks are everything for an attorney.

695
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,529
That's why I use a face mask every day.

696
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:37,198
Do you not care about your appearance?

697
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,158
Your neck is very wrinkly.

698
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,619
What an idiot.

699
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:44,664
Hey.

700
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,334
Is that a challenge?

701
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,629
You look like gum someone spat out.
But what? A wrinkly neck?

702
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,507
My gosh. I can't believe you.

703
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,759
Man. I'm so pissed off.

704
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:58,261
Who…

705
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:11,816
You're so cute, Seo-jin. Let's go in.

706
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:14,027
-After you, Father.
-All right.

707
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:18,281
Goodness, my grandson. You're so cute.

708
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,158
My cutie.

709
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,035
-You're so cute.
-Mommy.

710
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:25,788
-Goodness, do you want Mommy?
-This.

711
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,749
This? Do you like that?

712
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:30,209
Dad, put him down. You'll get tired.

713
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,128
Yes, give him to us. You'll get tired.

714
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,380
It's okay. I can keep holding him.

715
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,091
I had to wait a whole week to see him.

716
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,635
Right, Seo-jin?

717
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:40,386
Gosh.

718
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,140
Shouldn't they be here soon?

719
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:45,808
You're right.

720
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,228
Really? They're dating again?

721
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,897
They're getting married.

722
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,732
Bo-reum and Jae-u.

723
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,984
That's huge.

724
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,820
So they were bound to get back together.

725
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,781
What about kids?

726
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,616
They won't have kids,

727
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,785
so they'll travel and live freely.

728
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:06,663
My gosh, I knew they'd be cool.

729
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,916
Anyway, we did all that
to go there and come back,

730
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,292
but everything is the same.

731
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,877
Nothing has changed.

732
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,878
Exactly.

733
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,092
Didn't Mother and Father say
they were close?

734
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,259
They'll be here soon.

735
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,889
-Hey, nice car.
-That's expensive.

736
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,146
Good.

737
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,856
-Hey. What?
-What?

738
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,859
-Mr. Kim, you can wait here.
-Yes, sir.

739
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,236
Wait, Mom.

740
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:40,446
Hey.

741
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,536
Why are you staring at us?

742
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:51,374
Wait, what's with your clothes?
And what's with this car?

743
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:54,836
Why? What's weird about our clothes?
What about them?

744
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,672
I mean, aren't they expensive?

745
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:58,881
You think you're rich?

746
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,216
Hey, kiddo.

747
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:03,302
Yes, that's right. We're rich.

748
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,514
Are you trying to tell us
we became rich thanks to you again?

749
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:09,267
What?

750
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,395
Wait, Pangyo?

751
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:16,649
What's with you?
You told us to invest there.

752
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,072
We did it. It happened.

753
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,324
Dad, then are we rich?

754
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:29,328
Wait, but why do we live
in that tiny apartment?

755
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,997
You rascal.

756
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,417
Hey. I'm rich, not you.

757
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,626
Punk.

758
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,420
Where are we sitting? Let's go.

759
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,256
Goodness.

760
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:44,177
I forgot to bring the kimchi for the kids.

761
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:48,514
Why have I been so forgetful lately?
Am I getting dementia?

762
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,224
What, dementia?

763
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:54,020
We're not even 70 yet. We're still young.

764
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:59,066
But still, if I get dementia,
just send me to a nursing home.

765
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,985
A nursing home?

766
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:02,820
Forget it.

767
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,032
You have me.

768
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,618
I can just carry you on my back.

769
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,621
My gosh. Let's go.

770
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,664
Wait for me, honey.

771
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:25,551
Goodness.

772
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:26,552
Goodness.

773
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:27,929
My cutie.

774
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,726
Did you just smile
because you like Grandpa?

775
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,102
Gosh.

776
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,565
No, he didn't. He smiled at me. Right?

777
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,192
My cutie.

778
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:45,655
No, he just looked into my eyes

779
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,616
and smiled like this.

780
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,910
No, he smiled at me.

781
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,789
Remember the mountain spring?

782
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,500
Right, Seo-jin?

783
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,920
You always smiled at me, didn't you?

784
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,089
-Look at him.
-Honey.

785
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:06,509
Let's move too.
Let's move right next door to them.

786
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,762
What are you saying?

787
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,974
-Goodness.
-Mountain spring?

788
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:14,225
My cutie.

789
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,270
Hey, honey. I'm sorry

790
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:21,649
I have another seminar today,
so I can't go home.

791
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:26,112
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm going on a date with my wife today.

792
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:29,991
Do you still like your wife that much
after being married for so long?

793
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,534
Of course, I do.

794
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:34,829
Everything is beautiful to me,
from her face to her kind heart.

795
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:39,584
Yes.

796
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,463
Hey, babe.

797
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,428
Honey.

798
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:52,346
Hey, my wife is here. Bye.

799
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,310
-Goodness.
-Did I keep you waiting?

800
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,478
No, it's fine. Did you eat?

801
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,397
No, not yet.

802
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,566
-Aren't you cold?
-No, I'm fine.

803
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:05,902
-What should we eat?
-Well…

804
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:11,073
-Anything.
-Anything? How about meat?

805
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,783
-Sounds great.
-Sounds great.

806
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,243
-Honey.
-Babe, what's wrong?

807
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,912
-What are we missing?
-A kiss?

808
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:16,829
A kiss?

809
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,749
-Do you know them?
-What?

810
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,918
No, I don't.

811
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:32,595
TRAVEL OUT OF THIS WORLD BY CHEON SEOL

812
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,312
Hey.

813
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,940
Seol, is that you? Where are you?

814
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:46,734
I'm in Madagascar. Did you get my book?

815
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,152
Yes.

816
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,196
You're so amazing, Seol.

817
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:53,407
Okay, then.
I'll call you when I return to Korea.

818
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:54,492
All right.

819
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,792
Who was that? Seol?

820
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:08,089
Yes, she's in Mada… Something.

821
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,800
Anyway, something Car. She's there.

822
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:12,093
She's amazing.

823
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:14,887
That softie became such a bold woman.

824
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,099
Exactly. Aren't you proud of her?

825
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,440
-Hello?
-Yes?

826
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:27,608
This is the court.

827
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,068
You have to submit

828
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:32,154
the divorce decree in three months,
or it'll become void.

829
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,992
-All right.
-Okay.

830
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:48,379
Hae-gang.

831
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,591
-Wait for Daddy.
-I want that.

832
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:53,676
Okay.

833
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:57,972
It's dangerous going alone.

834
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,604
Look at this. Ta-da.

835
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,815
Let's go.

836
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,191
Let's walk a little more.

837
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:25,041
When we must fight
against this tough enemy called the world,

838
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:27,710
we will get up without hesitating

839
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:31,630
and stand by each other firmly forever.

840
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:34,467
We fight against this harsh world

841
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,969
as two loving comrades.

842
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:44,185
THE HEAVENLY REALM, 50 YEARS AGO

843
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:54,487
Strangers spending a lifetime together,

844
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,030
things can't always be good.

845
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,784
It's not like we're gods,
who are above everything.

846
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:03,788
What did you say, woman?

847
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,166
I called you a cheapskate, Cheapskate.

848
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:12,213
How dare you?
How dare you speak like that to me?

849
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,883
I'm a god. What's wrong with you?

850
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:17,843
Because you're my husband.

851
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,138
I'm a god too. You're not the only one.

852
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:23,891
You begged me to marry you, so I did,

853
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:25,434
and you forget our anniversary?

854
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:28,521
You forgot it on purpose, didn't you?
Because you're cheap, cheapskate.

855
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,524
Stop calling me a cheapskate, woman.

856
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:34,276
My life was ruined because I met you.

857
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:42,076
My life was also ruined because I met you.

858
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:44,245
-It's over!
-It's over!

859
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:11,147
Hey, these are pretty.

860
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,440
May we see these?

861
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:17,153
Pretty, right? These are rings of the gods
that make your wishes come true.

862
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,070
Really?

863
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:20,990
-May I try it on?
-Sure.

864
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,285
-Right here.
-Me too.

865
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,163
Thank you.

866
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,041
Let's go with these.

867
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:33,085
We'll take these.

868
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:39,633
Let us stay together forever.

869
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,948
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
COUPLE ON THE BACKTRACK
