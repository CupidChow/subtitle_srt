YEAR 2017

00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:52,177
YERIM PEDIATRICS, DIRECTOR PARK HYEON-SEOK

3
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,724
Madam. What brings you here?

4
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,434
Why isn't Ms. Kim here?

5
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,902
Honey, this is a surprise.
What brings you here?

6
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,320
Hello, Ms. Kim.

7
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,613
You may leave.

8
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,783
Bring my wife her favorite hydrangea tea.

9
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:15,992
Yes, doctor.

10
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,205
I'm so glad you're here.

11
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,333
I had such a tough day.

12
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,336
We must have telepathy.

13
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,089
What? I see. Really?

14
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:33,718
Yes, I was just thinking
I'd feel better if I saw you.

15
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,471
-How did you know?
-Right.

16
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,056
I'm glad I came.

17
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,600
Gosh, I missed you, honey.

18
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,026
You should stay longer.

19
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,905
-No, you should get back to work.
-Okay, bye.

20
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,866
When you try to fool somebody,

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,494
if you are 100% sure
that person is fooled,

22
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:04,707
there's a high chance
that somebody is in love with you.

23
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,891
Bring my wife her favorite hydrangea tea.

24
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,976
Yes, doctor.

25
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,646
Gosh, I missed you, honey.

26
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,693
That person wasn't fooled
because they couldn't see your lies.

27
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,653
They simply chose not to

28
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,239
because they love you.

29
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:53,381
YEAR 1999, SEOUL

30
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,680
What's at the end of this world?

31
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,391
I'll fly up even higher

32
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:10,398
No one else will live my life in my place

33
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,785
So who are you taking
to Med Students' Night?

34
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,037
We'll see.

35
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,171
Why do I run into him so often?

36
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,298
He'll grow on me at this rate.

37
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,133
He makes my blood boil.

38
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,059
What are you looking at, asshole?

39
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,645
What are you doing?

40
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,399
And what are you doing?

41
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,693
What?

42
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,570
Why did you open the door?

43
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,908
Who are you?

44
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:47,745
Me?

45
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,292
I'm herâ€¦

46
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,140
friend. Fine. I'm her friend.

47
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,518
Who are you?

48
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,563
Friend, my foot.

49
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,565
Get lost.

50
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,900
-I have to get changed.
-What?

51
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,446
Get changed? Right here? With him?

52
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,785
You freak. What the heck are you thinking?

53
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,373
Nam-gil, you get out of here too.

54
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,334
What's wrong with both of you?

55
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,801
She's crazy. She's completely crazy.

56
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,679
Does she think
she's really 20 or something?

57
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,597
Yo.

58
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,812
"Yo"?

59
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,358
Were you talking to me?

60
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,944
Hey, Jin-ju. Did you hear that?

61
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,615
This kid who's barely out of diapers

62
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,326
went "Yo" to me. "Yo."

63
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,581
Ban-do, you've become
such a nice guy over the years.

64
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,503
Aren't you a freshman?
Were you left back five years?

65
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,338
That's not the case.

66
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:25,134
But I've pooped at least
ten million times more than you did.

67
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,012
You're disgusting.

68
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,725
Anyway, forget him. Take this.

69
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,646
Put it back in your car
so your sister doesn't find out.

70
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,481
The price tag was still on it.

71
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,566
Sister, my foot.

72
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,946
Hey, there's no older brother
who keeps his sister's dress in his car.

73
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,324
He obviously bought it for a girl.

74
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,326
You're right.

75
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,540
I bought it for you.

76
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,458
What?

77
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,710
Me?

78
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,046
Yes.

79
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,384
Hey.

80
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,770
I hope you like it. Bye.

81
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,499
What was that look?
Did he just smirk at me?

82
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,377
That tiny little kid.

83
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,671
Hey.

84
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,049
-What?
-You're much smaller.

85
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,384
Don't you have a mirror?

86
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:55,141
You must be thrilled to live a new life
with a tall and handsome guy.

87
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,237
Heyâ€¦

88
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:24,212
Hey, cat. Why do you keep crying
even as you eat this expensive food?

89
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,214
Hey.

90
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,716
I got you the most expensive one.

91
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,389
Don't cry now, okay?

92
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:46,275
Ban-do, that asshole. That big asshole.

93
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:57,787
Ban-do, you asshole.
You big asshole. I'll kill you.

94
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,956
She's an awful drunk.

95
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,291
Her thing is
talking behind people's backs.

96
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,670
Seol, stop drinking.

97
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,129
Bo-reum.

98
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:12,552
Listen.
I can't handle it if I don't drink.

99
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,847
And why is that?
Because of Jin-ju. That poor girl.

100
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,728
You're pretty stylish.

101
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,941
This?

102
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,026
So you know.

103
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,903
It's Italian cowhide.

104
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,574
There aren't many of these in Korea.

105
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,868
But most women don't recognize this.

106
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,747
I'm not most women. I probably know
more about men's stuff than you do.

107
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,001
I knew it, Mr. Bo-reum.
You have lots of men in your life.

108
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,253
Your family must be rich.

109
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:50,965
Does it show?

110
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,718
I try my best to hide it. Can you tell?

111
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,178
Goodness, this is why
I don't want to compliment you.

112
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,517
What? Where did it go?

113
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,437
Where's my food? Where did my food go?

114
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,564
Your food is in your tummy.

115
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,400
I ate everything?

116
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,987
-Did I really?
-My gosh.

117
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,824
Anyway, did Jae-u run off?
Why isn't he coming?

118
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,503
Why are you dating Jae-u?

119
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,504
Because he's easy.

120
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,883
Jae-u is easy.

121
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,390
Are you crying because of love?

122
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,186
We're here to provide a solution
for everyone who's crying over love.

123
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,854
This is He's Not That Into You.

124
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,148
We have someone here
with refreshing answers,

125
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,192
the current leader of BROS.

126
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,152
Please welcome Lee Sang-min. Hello.

127
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,737
Hello, I'm Lee Sang-min.

128
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,739
-It's the end of May.
-Yes.

129
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,449
But you're wearing fur.

130
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,910
Yes, I like the East Coast style.

131
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,578
-Where?
-The east.

132
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,746
-The east.
-Yes.

133
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,830
It looks hot.

134
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,667
Love is a problem
whether you're in it or not.

135
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,670
I wonder what our listener's story is.
Let's talk to him now.

136
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,047
-Hello?
-Hello.

137
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,591
I'm Tinker Bell from Seoul.

138
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,928
You're a fairy, Tinker Bell.

139
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,806
Now, tell us what your trouble is.

140
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,975
This person that I'm dating now

141
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,353
gets too physical with me.

142
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,189
Whenever we meet,

143
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,233
we kiss,

144
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,778
then I get felt up, then we kiss again.

145
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:40,449
I'm starting to think
that's the only reason we're together.

146
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,120
Well, you usually kiss
when you like each other.

147
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,499
But does that person touch
a particular area? This is important.

148
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,919
Well, it's usually my butt.

149
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,088
Your butt?

150
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,674
My gosh. This is serious.

151
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,300
That person touches your butt.

152
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,345
Why don't you two have a talk?

153
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,139
I doubt that's why they're with you.

154
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,975
I asked, and the reason
for going out with me is

155
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,185
that I'm easy.

156
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,025
How can they say that to your face?

157
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,863
Well, I didn't hear it myself, butâ€¦

158
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,074
Let's get this straight.
Tinker Bell, your sweetheart

159
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,452
keeps touching your butt every day,

160
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,496
and the reason why that person is
with you is because you're easy.

161
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,497
Yes.

162
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,000
This sounds very serious.

163
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,919
I say you should break up immediately.

164
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,339
No, wait. What? That's not right.

165
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,217
The world is a dangerous place,
and this is a bad guy.

166
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,678
And he says
you're easy in this day and age?

167
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,849
He might seem charming now,
but you'll be in huge trouble later.

168
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,808
Wellâ€¦

169
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,106
Does that person like to drink too?

170
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,026
How did you know?

171
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,152
That's how they are.

172
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,280
People like that like girlsâ€¦
People of the opposite sexâ€¦

173
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,699
They like everyone and do stuff like that.

174
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,577
Right. I'm sure they have
many friends of the opposite sex.

175
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,331
Tinker Bell,
you might just be one of them.

176
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,416
That can't be true.

177
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,503
I'm an expert in this area,
so trust me and break up.

178
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,379
Ms. Tinker Bell, don't lose heart.

179
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,759
Ms. Tinker Bell? It's Mr. Tinker Bell.

180
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,136
Hello? Hey.

181
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:32,937
How can he say something like this
to his girlfriend's face?

182
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,647
Hwi-jae. Worry about yourself.

183
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,024
You might end up growing old alone.

184
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,944
Get married soon. Have kids.
You're not Superman.

185
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,154
I assure you, I'll get married before you.

186
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,489
-You?
-Of course.

187
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,699
-Do you want to bet?
-Sure, I'm all for it.

188
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,118
It doesn't count if you get divorced.

189
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,247
-I think it should.
-Why?

190
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,666
You never know
what will happen in the future.

191
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,669
What's important is the beginning.
The result isn't important.

192
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,046
You sound like you've been divorced. Fine.

193
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:04,176
Anyway, Ms. Tinker Bell.
She shouldn't be with a guy like this.

194
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,766
MY MAN

195
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,060
Hey, you.

196
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,062
Next week?

197
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,356
Okay, let's meet up.

198
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,491
Hey, this is Park Hyeon-seok.
The med student from the club.

199
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,243
Are you free today?

200
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,874
PARK HYEON-SEOK

201
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,833
See you around.

202
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,668
You must be excited because you think

203
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,628
he gave you his number
because you're pretty.

204
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,506
But Director Park
toys with girls like you. Get it?

205
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,925
Yes, I called dibs, so hands off.

206
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,803
You can have her
once I get bored of her, so wait.

207
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,691
Most people compete in a contest
maybe once a year.

208
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,402
But it's my third one this year, Mom.

209
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,529
I can fall into a slump too.

210
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,740
How can I only think about ballet?

211
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,742
It's hard for me too!

212
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,999
Gosh.

213
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,378
Life is hard
whether you're a kid or an adult.

214
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,257
-Right?
-Did you hear that?

215
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,637
Run away from home.

216
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,307
Tell them, "I'm gone with the wind."

217
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,309
Then leave home. What do you think?

218
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,352
What?

219
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,938
I'm not a kid. How could I run away?

220
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,733
You're still a kid.
You still have a lot of growing up to do.

221
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,026
My gosh.

222
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,614
You're finally laughing.

223
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,241
I said it only to make you laugh.

224
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,036
All right. I get to laugh thanks to you.

225
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,580
One second.

226
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:58,832
Hello?

227
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,459
Where are you?

228
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,836
Jin-ju?

229
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,966
Where are you?

230
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,593
Who the heck is this jerk Park Hyeon-seok?

231
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,846
Did he do something to you?

232
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,516
Where are you?
Stay right there. I'll be there soon.

233
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,145
Something urgent came up, so I have to go.

234
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,064
What? Okay.

235
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,565
Where are you?

236
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,406
You really won't go?

237
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,200
-What?
-Med Students' Night.

238
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,578
It's also a time for people
to show off their girlfriends.

239
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,997
But you never go.

240
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,623
I should study.

241
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,042
I don't care that much
about showing you off.

242
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,796
All I want to do is graduate
and stand confidently before your parents.

243
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,592
How can I take you there?
Don't you have a mirror?

244
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,137
Don't worry about my parents.

245
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,471
How I feel is all that matters.

246
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,598
My dad doesn't need a doctor son-in-law.

247
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,268
No, I'm the one who needs your dad.

248
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,479
I should ask him for another car.

249
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,191
It must be a lot of work
for you to go back and forth to study.

250
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,276
Don't do that.

251
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,446
I already feel bad
that you're paying my rent.

252
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,948
If you keep doing this,
I can't keep seeing you.

253
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,909
It's not like I'm seeing you to get a car.

254
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,455
A car is nowhere enough.

255
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,125
You're way too nice.

256
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,634
That scumbag.

257
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,267
So he seduced and married a rich girl,
got a hospital from her,

258
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,604
then went out having sex
with everyone and cheated on her?

259
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,064
What? "Having sex"?

260
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,984
Hey, watch your words
while you're in this body.

261
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,152
Am I wrong?

262
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,155
Anyway,
his current girlfriend is that wife.

263
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,865
Why did he approach me?

264
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,118
You can have her
once I get bored of her, so wait.

265
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,286
Am I the other woman?

266
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,537
Isn't that obvious?

267
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,582
I'm sure he has trucks of girls
whom he hit on for flings.

268
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,834
That's why I told you not to get involved.

269
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,754
How do you know this in such detail?

270
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,672
You were a salesman and he was a doctor.

271
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,093
Well, just because.

272
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,346
Wait, were you his lackey?

273
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,265
"Lackey"?

274
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,559
That's really harsh. A lackey?

275
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,186
That's the thing about sales.

276
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,188
You help the client's personal matters,

277
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,273
including managing their mistressesâ€¦

278
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,781
I can't believe you.

279
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,909
Seriously.

280
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,046
Have you had dinner?

281
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,258
-No.
-You still haven't eaten?

282
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,759
I've been busy.

283
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,555
Yes, Director.

284
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,307
By tomorrow morning? Three boxes?

285
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,643
Yes, sir. Goodnight, sir.

286
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,733
-What?
-Goodness.

287
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,075
Man, how much did I drink last night?

288
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,247
Look at that idiot.

289
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,916
Hey, man. You idiot.

290
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,337
Hey, how can you leave
a delicate guy like me alone

291
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,424
with those two scary girls?

292
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,800
Get up.

293
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,553
Get up.

294
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,140
Turn around.

295
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,309
Oh my gosh!

296
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,145
Are you a zombie or a deep-sea fish?

297
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:00,657
What?

298
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,495
What?

299
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,499
I need more food.

300
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,679
I'll cut it up and eat it.

301
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,853
This place has awful beef jerky.

302
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,149
Seol!

303
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,865
What's this? A glove?

304
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,202
Oh no. Who did this?

305
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,205
Who? You don't remember?

306
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,916
Man, so you don't remember?

307
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,044
Then where am I supposed to vent?

308
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,171
Oh no. Yesterday.

309
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,135
Yes, you're right.
You got drunk and took thisâ€¦

310
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,849
Seol.

311
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,728
It's not like I'm going to do anything.
But when you get drunk--

312
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:16,108
So you have a drunken habit too.
It's okay. You can fix it.

313
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,193
Good luck.

314
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,988
Where are you going? Hey!

315
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,072
Hey!

316
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,908
You got drunk and did this!

317
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,829
She knows. She definitely knows.

318
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,331
She knows, but she's acting.

319
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,333
She got me. She got me again.

320
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,211
WOMEN'S DORMITORY

321
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,923
I must have gone crazy.

322
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,260
I'm sure it was expensive.

323
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,565
I'm sorry, Dok-jae.

324
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,026
I'll make it up to you later.

325
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,780
You're going to do what? Get revenge?

326
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,699
For me?

327
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,161
Forget it. I already got my revenge.

328
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:13,915
And right. I also got
a little bit of revenge for you too.

329
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,667
What?

330
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,255
I'm so sorry. You can have this.

331
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,350
Goodness. I thought you were my friend.

332
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,688
That's so you. What a loser.

333
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,273
You should do it right.

334
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,485
Don't be such a busybody.
Just stay away from him.

335
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,654
And it's a shame to waste a minute,
even a second of our youth.

336
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,365
We have no time for that jerk.

337
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,699
Don't you have any pride?

338
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,534
Aren't you angry
after all that he did to you?

339
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,577
What's with you?

340
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:55,374
Wait, are you heartbroken
because that guy had been bullying me?

341
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,542
Right? That's it.

342
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:01,004
-That's why you want revenge.
-Well, that's not the only reason.

343
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,925
He used a girl
as his bank and deceived her.

344
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,636
He had affairs and broke her heart.

345
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:11,723
And he thought I'd be his mistress.
I need to make him pay for all of that.

346
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,142
Okay. What's your plan?

347
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,646
You always thought I was a joke
because I love soap operas.

348
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,440
I'll show you a real-life soap opera.

349
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,827
Okay, see you this afternoon.

350
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,454
I need to go into the rat's turf

351
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,997
in order to catch it.

352
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,042
I need you to do something.

353
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,044
Let's just not get involved with him.

354
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,879
Okay?

355
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,094
What do I have to do?

356
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,805
I can't go empty-handed.

357
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,765
I need something the rat loves.

358
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,434
Something he loves?

359
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,352
He loves money.

360
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,858
What is it? You're so annoying.

361
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,568
-Hey, wait.
-What?

362
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,528
-Have you heard?
-Hear what?

363
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,073
Samsong Group's owner's granddaughter
goes to our school.

364
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,575
Samsong Group?

365
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,578
Stop lying. Why would a rich girl like her
go to our school?

366
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,580
I'm serious.

367
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,040
She's here in secret
because it may help her later

368
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,584
when she takes over the company.

369
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,170
Who is it? Do you know who she is?

370
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,257
I heard this from the student council,
so I know it's reliable.

371
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,468
-Okay.
-It's Ma Jin-ju from history.

372
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,513
The Jin-ju from history that I know?

373
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,725
It's a secret.

374
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,440
Great job. He took the bait.

375
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,817
I'm walking into the rat's turf.

376
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,072
I'm sorry, I'm late.

377
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,866
You should've ordered something.

378
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,160
No, I'm fine.

379
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,453
Would you like to order?

380
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,331
I'll have a cold lemonade.

381
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,167
I'll have an espresso.

382
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,097
Isn't it bitter?

383
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,019
I travel abroad often to get away,
so I drink this a lot.

384
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,855
I see. You go abroad often.

385
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,610
Once I graduate,
I'll go abroad often to get away.

386
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,988
You'll probably be out
with the broads, asshole.

387
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:37,202
I wanted to reach out sooner,
but medical college is a lot of work.

388
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,287
If you're a med student,

389
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,165
isn't there a Med Students' Night?

390
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,042
Yes, how did you know?

391
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,628
My friend's boyfriend is a med student,

392
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,214
and she has been bragging
how she'll be there.

393
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,298
I see.

394
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,471
Do you want to go with me?

395
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,764
Really?

396
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,351
Never mind.

397
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,689
You have a girlfriend.
How could I go there with you?

398
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:09,901
Oh, I heard from a friend's friend
that you're dating Kim Ye-rim.

399
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:14,614
-What?
-Who told her that? Darn it.

400
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,659
No, she's not my girlfriend.
We dated briefly a while back

401
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,036
and she won't leave me alone.

402
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,332
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

403
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,836
Anyway, if there's someone
who isn't over you,

404
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,546
it would be awkward for me to go.

405
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,590
No, I'll be done with her.

406
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,049
I mean, we're over already.

407
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,844
Don't worry.

408
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,390
Nice, Jin-ju.

409
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,476
You're going to make him
dump his rich wife himself?

410
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,186
He'll cut off his own tail.

411
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,356
What did you just say?

412
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,941
Thatâ€¦

413
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,987
I like you a lot.

414
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,073
This is your problem.

415
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,908
He must've worked so hard to get her.

416
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,869
That smart kid won't leave her.

417
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,747
When guys cheat on women,
they feel bad and treat them better.

418
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,540
He's probably buying her gifts.

419
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,126
We're going after his torso, not his tail.

420
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,712
Wait, so you'll go with him
to Med Students' Night?

421
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,840
What do you need to expose an affair?

422
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,426
I know this one. To catch them red-handed.

423
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,223
ASURA

424
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,229
-Hey.
-Yes?

425
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,065
Have you seen Jae-u?

426
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,816
He didn't show up today.

427
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,987
What's going on?
He won't answer his phone either.

428
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,094
Did you drop something? Money?

429
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,637
Should I look too?

430
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,430
No.

431
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,022
Let's go.

432
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,857
-Where?
-Let's drink.

433
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,652
No, I'm not in the mood to drink. Wait.

434
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,988
Should I just ask her?

435
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,367
Are you praying? Why is your head down?

436
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,328
Are you troubled?

437
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,164
Tell me. I'll lend an ear.

438
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,798
-Wellâ€¦
-One second.

439
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,592
I need to use the restroom. One second.

440
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:53,273
Okay. I'll just ask her directly.

441
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,401
I'll never know for sure
unless I ask her myself.

442
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,218
We're taking a trip next month.
You know that, right?

443
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,138
I'm sure they have
many friends of the opposite sex.

444
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,265
Tinker Bell,
you might just be one of them.

445
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,436
Speed dial one, "My Man."

446
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,855
Tinker Bell,
you might just be one of them.

447
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,566
MY MAN TWO

448
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,277
MY MAN THREE

449
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,696
MY MAN FOUR

450
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,865
You're just one of them, you moron.

451
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,789
Sorry.

452
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,875
Hey, what's wrong?

453
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,628
-Are you crying?
-Hey.

454
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,258
What number am I?

455
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,470
What are you talking about? What's wrong?

456
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:11,142
Am I like speed dial 200 or so?

457
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:12,977
What?

458
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,648
Hey, Jae-u!

459
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,984
And I'm not a math quiz. Why am I easy?

460
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,780
I am a very difficult guy!

461
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,711
Right, call me
if anything happens before the trip.

462
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:39,963
-My baby girl.
-Wait.

463
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,090
He didn'tâ€¦

464
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,926
Darn it, did he see this?

465
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,266
HOME EDUCATION DEPARTMENT
LECTURE HALL

466
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,397
I'll stick right next to him
and play his girlfriend,

467
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,190
so you need to bring her there.

468
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:03,152
An affair only comes to an end
when she sees him with her own eyes.

469
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,284
Are you Hyeon-seok's shield
for covering his affairs?

470
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,369
Why do you keep butting in?

471
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,580
Move aside. I said move aside. Move.

472
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,748
Ma'am. That really hurts. It hurts.

473
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,381
Excuse me, ma'am.

474
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,135
I mean, Ms. Kim Ye-rim?

475
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,429
Yes?

476
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,014
Hi.

477
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,182
Director Park asked meâ€¦

478
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,229
I mean, Park Hyeon-seok asked me
to bring you somewhere.

479
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,064
Really?

480
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,444
Wait. His phone broke.

481
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,572
He asked me to bring you
to Med Students' Night or something.

482
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,531
Really?

483
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,491
He wasn't going to go.

484
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,744
An upperclassman is making him go.

485
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,455
I see. Let's go.

486
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,707
Let's go.

487
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,959
THE 19TH HANGUK UNIVERSITY
MED STUDENTS' NIGHT

488
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,002
You're looking great.

489
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,423
It's a huge event.

490
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,594
All the professors
from the College of Medicine are here.

491
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,096
My goodness.

492
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,222
Having fun?

493
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,974
Of course.

494
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,769
Because you'll be buried here tonight.

495
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,230
THE 19TH HANGUK MED STUDENTS' NIGHT

496
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,359
Shall we?

497
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,236
Wait, one second.
I need to see you for a moment.

498
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,655
What?

499
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,119
One second.

500
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:39,248
You don't have a weak heart
or any other illness, right?

501
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,208
What?

502
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,211
Never mind. Let's go.

503
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,631
Should I have brought anxiety medicine?

504
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,761
Aren't we going to go in?

505
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,518
-Do you want to go inside?
-What?

506
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:02,188
Of course. That's where they'll be.

507
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,982
Who are you?

508
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,733
Why did you come at me?

509
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,404
I have no idea what you're saying.

510
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,073
You called me first.

511
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,616
At first, yes.

512
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:22,417
Do you know
Samsong Group owner's granddaughter?

513
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,419
They don't have a girl.

514
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,546
They only have boys. All grandsons.

515
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,673
We went to the same kindergarten.

516
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,259
Oh, I see.

517
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,012
But why? Do you know them?

518
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,432
What? No, I was just asking.

519
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,269
Someone must be trying
to pull a prank on me.

520
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,355
Who is? Who's trying
to pull a prank on you?

521
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:51,863
Samsong Group's owner doesn't have
a granddaughter. Are you a man?

522
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,824
Should I check?

523
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,992
Samsong Group?

524
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,536
Did someone say I'm their granddaughter?

525
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,620
Your friend.

526
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,624
I fell into a pool not long ago

527
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,834
because he pushed me.

528
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,336
And I thought about it,

529
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,796
and I hadâ€¦

530
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,717
talked about you.

531
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,929
-What's going on?
-Hey.

532
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,639
You got me wrong. That's not me.

533
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,641
My gosh!

534
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,644
My goodness! Hey.

535
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,729
What's with you two?

536
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,107
How did you know I was dating Ye-rim?

537
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,154
I may not look like it, but I beat women.

538
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,657
-What's with you two?
-Park Hyeon-seok!

539
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,661
Youâ€¦

540
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,415
-My gosh.
-Why are you all here?

541
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,088
You want me to gather all the girls
he's having flings with?

542
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,508
Yes, you said he has lots of girlfriends.

543
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:57,178
We can't give him a chance to escape
if we want to catch that rat.

544
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,179
Hey.

545
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,807
Really? Did you have fun?

546
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,607
-I don't want to go.
-Do you have to go?

547
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,526
-Yes.
-All right.

548
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,070
-Call me later.
-Okay.

549
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,613
Bye. I'll call you.

550
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,911
How many girls is he dating?

551
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:27,708
So this is where you were hiding.
We looked everywhere for you.

552
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,253
You little rat.

553
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,629
Let's talk.

554
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,383
-My gosh.
-What's going on?

555
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,385
-Hey.
-What's happening?

556
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,137
How dare you run away?

557
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,306
You didn't two-time me, but three-timed me
with that innocent face?

558
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,935
I guess med students have
lots of time to kill,

559
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,562
to date three girls at once.

560
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,815
He smiled innocently
like he was a good person,

561
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:54,402
but he went behind our backs
and dated everyone he could find.

562
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,028
No, it's a misunderstanding.

563
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,947
Oh, a misunderstanding?

564
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,241
You can't claim that
with three witnesses here.

565
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,411
-What is his problem?
-No, this isn't true. No.

566
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,662
It's not true.

567
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,622
-How pathetic.
-It's a misunderstanding.

568
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,624
-What a loser.
-My gosh.

569
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,334
It's really a misunderstanding!

570
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,087
-He's angry. It means it's true.
-Definitely.

571
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,297
Ye-rim.

572
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,133
-He did it.
-He totally did.

573
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,224
MOP-UP OPERATION
DIRTY RAT PARK HYEON-SEOK

574
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,518
BIGGEST VICTIM, KIM YE-RIM

575
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,145
VICTIM ONE, VICTIM TWO

576
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,813
RAT CATCHER, MA JIN-JU

577
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,361
When we have him in the trap,
we have to have her

578
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,529
witness the scene.

579
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,281
It's so detailed.

580
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,910
Wait, so you came up with this
purely from watching soap operas?

581
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,538
Of course, Korean dramas are
just as good as private detectives.

582
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,083
Agreed.

583
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,588
No, this is just a misunderstanding.

584
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,674
There was another girl?
You were four-timing?

585
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,927
They keep showing up,
like layers of an onion.

586
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,470
No, it's not true.

587
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,055
I mean it. It's not.

588
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:07,308
Don't listen to them.
I was just playing with them.

589
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,977
-My gosh.
-You're the only one for me. Okay?

590
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,647
You jerk.

591
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,148
Ye-rim.

592
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,987
Who are you?

593
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,322
Me?

594
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,622
Was it you two? Who are you?

595
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,167
Me? Ye-rim's boyfriend.

596
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,047
Babe, is he the guy you've been playing?

597
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,841
-What?
-He's kind of lame.

598
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,760
Yes, right.

599
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,430
Yes.

600
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,520
You.

601
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,481
Wait.

602
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,235
You must be confused.
Don't associate with guys like him.

603
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,862
They're only after your money, you fool.

604
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,616
It's because you're rich.
Why would they hang out with you?

605
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,077
You're talking about yourself.

606
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,705
Listen to him talk. He's so beneath us.

607
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,582
What did you say?

608
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,544
-You jerk.
-Let go of me.

609
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,795
How dare you touch him?

610
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,388
My gosh.

611
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,779
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

612
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,782
He's a good-for-nothing jerk.

613
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,075
Just let her cry.

614
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,121
Yes, just cry tonight
and forget about him forever.

615
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,081
If this didn't happen and you married him,

616
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,334
you would've spent
the rest of your life crying.

617
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,585
How do I know?

618
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,712
I've seen it all.

619
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,589
I've lived long enough

620
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,924
to know there are millions of men.

621
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,511
A girl must marry a good guy.

622
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,056
Not a successful one, but a good one.

623
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:12,933
Well,

624
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,187
there are guys like me who are neither.

625
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,948
Yes, you should cry now and let it all go.

626
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,327
It may seem unbearable,

627
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:35,122
but you have many more days to live
than the days you've lived.

628
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,125
What's with you two?

629
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,753
I'm older than you two.

630
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,591
Yes, you're right.

631
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:50,054
-Well, yes.
-Right.

632
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,392
You should go home
and get some rest, Ye-rim.

633
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,559
Stop crying.

634
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,105
Hey.

635
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,486
I already knew he was seeing other girls.

636
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,074
Well, I didn't know there were that many.

637
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,661
I was too afraid of breaking up with him,

638
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,497
so I always spent my days crying.

639
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,544
I feel much better now that this happened.

640
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,801
Thanks

641
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,178
for hitting him.

642
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,036
Are you coming home now?
I hear you're moving out.

643
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:57,913
Sorry?

644
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,416
No, I'm not.

645
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,919
No, that girl
who signed the lease just called

646
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,464
and said you were leaving,
so she wants the deposit.

647
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,548
You didn't know?

648
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,010
I'll do the paperwork this week,

649
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,387
so move out before then, okay?
I'm leaving.

650
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,265
Excuse me, ma'am.

651
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,893
Damn it!

652
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,906
How dare she play with me?

653
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,701
My gosh.

654
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,955
-Hey.
-This is hilarious.

655
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,417
That's attempted murder.

656
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,752
My gosh.

657
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,297
Who taught you to kick him there?

658
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,423
Bo-reum.

659
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,676
Wait, from her aerobics class?

660
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:56,514
Did you learn aerobics there
to beat me up?

661
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,266
Do you think I learned it to beat you up?

662
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,770
I mean, Bo-reum only teaches ladies
how to beat up their husbands.

663
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,814
She teaches kicks like these.
Like this one.

664
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,651
You ladies are scary.

665
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,947
Who knew I'd get to use it like this?

666
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,615
I should give Bo-reum an award.

667
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,493
I hope he didn't die.

668
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,038
I'm sure he didn't.

669
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,999
But the afterlife
probably flashed before him.

670
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,795
It really is attempted murder.
You're so reckless, old lady.

671
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,214
Stop calling me an old lady.

672
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,510
Hey, what happened?

673
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,515
I think I got scratched
when Director Park pushed me.

674
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,725
That little jerk.

675
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,936
I told you it was dangerous.

676
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,904
I told you he wouldn't be easy.

677
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,449
Why did you follow him there?
Look what happened.

678
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,160
This isn't a big deal. I'm not a kid.

679
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,079
Seriously.

680
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,248
Why are you annoyed?
I'm the one who's hurt.

681
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,459
I'm not annoyed.

682
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:11,505
Goodness, do you do this to Seo-yeong too?

683
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,798
It's just me, right?

684
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,259
Give me your arm.

685
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,448
Does it feel cathartic?

686
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,784
-What?
-Director Park.

687
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,831
You said he made you
manage his mistresses.

688
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,459
I'm sure he bullied you a lot.

689
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:49,918
Are you stupid?

690
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,964
He's not all that.
Why did you let him do that to you?

691
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,677
I put up with him to make a living.

692
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,430
And it's not just me.

693
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,643
You face all kinds of weird people
when you're working.

694
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,689
Hey.

695
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,069
But do you know what I like?

696
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,030
Someone asked me,

697
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,616
but I couldn't remember
when I suddenly had to answer.

698
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,411
-Maybe nothing.
-Spicy braised chicken.

699
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,999
Spicy braised chicken. Yes, you're right.

700
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,293
That's my favorite dish. Right.

701
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,922
Tangerines. UFC. Collecting DVDs.

702
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,049
DVDs, yes.

703
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,593
I used to be a cinephile.

704
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,766
You knew that, but you threw them out
after we got married?

705
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,268
What about you?

706
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,438
Did you sell all of my jewelry
thinking I hated them?

707
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:57,611
It was hard to make ends meet
with our paychecks.

708
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,196
We had a tough life.

709
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,368
What we like isn't that important.

710
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,913
It's tough enough to just survive.

711
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:10,958
You're right.

712
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:43,967
Let's go. It's late.

713
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,386
What? Okay.

714
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,773
What kind of a 20-year-old
goes on a trip with a guy?

715
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,441
She's such a slut.

716
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,652
That bitch.

717
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,278
What about you?

718
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,197
On top of that, she was seeing

719
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:10,244
one, two, three, fourâ€¦

720
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,789
Four guys? Four boyfriends including you?

721
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:17,125
No, five including me.

722
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,669
Five?

723
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,880
There might be more.

724
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,551
More? My gosh, she's got skills.

725
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:29,429
And if anything,
she's the easy one, not me.

726
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:34,017
You know that too.
It's my first time dating a girl.

727
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,563
So how am I easy? How?

728
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,565
Wait, easy?

729
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,652
Did you hear us talk?

730
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,946
Yes, I heard everything. I did.

731
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,490
She's dating me because I'm easy.

732
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,785
Hey, what she meant by that wasn't--

733
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,037
Stop talking about her!

734
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,957
Don't say that I'm easy.
No, don't say anything!

735
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,709
Why are you getting mad at me?

736
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,545
Whatever, I'm done.

737
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,714
You'll never know. Not even after you die.

738
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,387
If you like her, that's enough.

739
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:14,808
The other four guys?
Just make her drop them all.

740
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,352
Hey, tell them Bo-reum is yours.

741
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,897
Go tell them off and take her.

742
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,064
Just win her over.

743
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,193
What's going on over there?

744
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,906
Is he one of the four?

745
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,575
Darn it.

746
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,287
You could've just called.

747
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,331
Why did you come here?

748
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,917
Why are you avoiding me?

749
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,045
You promised to go on that trip.

750
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:47,215
Wait, are you seeing someone?

751
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,303
No. Unbelievable.

752
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,430
I'm not seeing anyone.

753
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,686
Hey, wait. Why? Are you leaving?

754
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,606
Don't you want to stay? This is fun.

755
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,110
-Stop it.
-What's wrong?

756
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,247
Take your dirty hand off her!

757
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,544
Hey, Jae-u.

758
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,589
You idiot. You should know better
when you pick a fight.

759
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,341
Don't you see how big he is?

760
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,885
What's going on here? Hey.

761
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:33,971
Who is he?

762
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:35,847
Who are you?

763
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,350
Don't do it.

764
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,353
Jae-u, just go. Go back inside. Hurry.

765
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,313
I'mâ€¦

766
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,233
Darn it.

767
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,944
You're what? Who are you?

768
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,696
I'mâ€¦

769
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,615
I'mâ€¦

770
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,580
I'm Bo-reum's boyfriend. So what?

771
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,333
What?

772
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:06,670
-Who is?
-You?

773
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,053
Wait.

774
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:20,392
It's late.

775
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,894
You're really going alone?

776
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:26,106
I have a lot on my mind,

777
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,566
so I wanted to walk and think.

778
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,569
No one will attack this old lady.

779
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,948
Well, you only look like a 20-year-old.

780
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,534
Once they get you,
they'll get scared and run.

781
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,327
Goodness.

782
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,289
Bye.

783
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,628
Wait, Jin-ju.

784
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,887
I enjoyed your performance

785
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,222
at the pageant.

786
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,812
Now that I think about it,
you loved to sing.

787
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,356
I had forgotten.

788
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,362
What's with this random remark?

789
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,408
Come on. Hey.

790
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,996
I was trying to be nice.
You should be nice too.

791
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,999
Speak for yourself.

792
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,846
I shouldn't have said that.

793
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,880
I wonder if she got home all right.

794
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,236
What?

795
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,865
Who is she talking to at this hour?

796
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,075
Why won't he pick up?

797
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,172
Hello?

798
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,595
Where are you?

799
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,350
You have no fear, do you?

800
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,397
No. I'm the one who has nothing to fear.

801
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,733
What do you think you're doing?

802
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,401
Go away before I scream.

803
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:20,155
Go ahead. Go ahead and scream. Do it.

804
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,033
Scream, damn it!

805
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,080
You ruined everything.

806
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,083
Do you know
how tough it was to stick around

807
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,461
next to an ugly girl like Ye-rim?

808
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:36,838
I don't know about that,

809
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,550
but I do know
that you're unbelievably pathetic.

810
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,386
Does your mom know you're like this?

811
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,726
Are you a teacher?

812
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,269
Are you crazy?

813
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,815
Didn't I tell you?

814
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,152
I beat women.

815
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,739
I'll beat up you and go to prison.

816
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,158
I'll go to prison!

817
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,504
It's shocking

818
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,675
that Ye-rim knew
about Director Park's affairs.

819
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,678
EPILOGUE

820
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:28,098
She must've liked him so much
to put up with that and marry him.

821
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,141
He lost a woman like that.

822
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,435
Goodness, what a pathetic guy.

823
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,813
Maybe we shouldn't have done that.

824
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,066
If your love hurts you too much,
it's not love.

825
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,196
An affair isn't love. It's assault.

826
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,158
It's the worst and the most painful type.

827
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,203
But still, she might get used to it

828
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,165
and become numb to it.

829
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,542
How does that make any sense?

830
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,503
If a guy has affairs with 100 women,

831
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:02,048
the woman remembers
every single one of them by name.

832
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,510
That is not something
you can get used to and numb to.

833
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:10,598
The faith and affection I had
as well as my self-worth

834
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,226
hit rock bottom.

835
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,231
Goodness, that jerk.

836
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,360
Hey.

837
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,947
-What?
-Did you say that for me to hear?

838
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,200
Back then,

839
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:31,953
I wasn't cheating on you.

840
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,888
"Motel. Hotel."

841
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,141
MIN-JEONG

842
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,068
I can't go home looking like this.

843
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,448
I can't come home today.

844
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:14,120
Hey.

845
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,915
How could you do this to me?

846
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,000
How could you?

847
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,252
I want a divorce.

848
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,423
-What?
-We're unhappy.

849
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,093
I'm too unhappy.

850
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:31,888
Fine.

851
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,140
Let's get divorced!

852
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:42,357
Perhaps it wasn't that our love ran out.

853
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,735
We just couldn't spare a moment

854
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,322
to look into our feelings
caught between the truth and lies.

855
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,219
Seol is gone.

856
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,179
Should we call the police?

857
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,349
She has been quite odd lately.

858
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,185
-Where are you going?
-To get money.

859
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:23,898
If you kept it for 18 years, it means
you were that concerned about Seol.

860
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,692
This time, make sure you find her.

861
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,277
You seem like a grown-up.

862
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,362
You've changed so much
in just a few weeks.

863
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,116
I don't like a guy
who makes my daughter cry.

864
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:35,952
-What do you mean?
-Tell me the truth.

865
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,287
Who's Seo-jin?

866
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,916
