(This drama is a work of fiction)

(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,949
(in this drama are fictitious.)

(Children and animals were filmed under guidelines.)

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,050
Driver Kim Do Gi.

9
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,190
- How's the new used car? - I think I might've paid too much.

10
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,950
Driver Kim Do Gi.

11
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,620
I think I paid more for this car than I expected.

12
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,930
Driver Kim, is something wrong?

13
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,550
(Safety First)

14
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,620
Hey, there's a crash!

15
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,560
- Call someone! - Quick, call 911.

16
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,689
How do I...

17
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,590
- Someone call 911, quick! - Are you okay?

18
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,400
Driver Kim Do Gi, can you hear me?

19
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,300
Go Eun.

20
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,310
I think I'm going to need a tow.

21
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,810
- The airbag didn't go off? - There's someone inside.

22
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,180
(Taxi Driver 3)

23
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,350
All right. Just keep coming straight back.

24
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,420
(Episode 4)

25
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,260
- Yes, just pull straight in. - Let's get to work.

26
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,060
Right. Come straight in.

27
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,770
All right.

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,440
Next one.

29
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,510
Move back, I'm spraying it down.

30
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,610
Further back.

31
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,420
Driver Kim Do Gi.

32
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,390
This car's been flooded.

33
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,059
- A flooded car? - Level three flooded car...

34
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,560
with its engine submerged.

35
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,160
With a level three, it can stall suddenly on a highway...

36
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,560
or fail and cause a major accident, just like this one.

37
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,700
This car should never have been put on the market.

38
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,900
It's basically a ticking time bomb on wheels.

39
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,310
Not just the kids. Countless people on the street could've been hurt.

40
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,310
So how can you tell if a car has been flooded?

41
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,180
There are a few ways to check if a car's been flooded.

42
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,820
When you pull the seatbelt all the way out,

43
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,990
if there are traces of muddy water, that's a red flag.

44
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,630
- It's clean. - Replace all four belts.

45
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,860
- With used ones. - Got it.

46
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,330
Hey, Choi.

47
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
But what if they replaced the belts?

48
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,530
You can check for that too.

49
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,170
Just check inside the cover. They usually don't clean in there.

50
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,880
- Clean the crevices with a swab. - Park, get the swabs.

51
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,210
- Yes, sir. - What if they cleaned that too?

52
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,220
There's still a way to tell.

53
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,450
You can check for mud inside the rubber weather stripping.

54
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,760
- No mud here. - Replace all the weatherstripping.

55
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,360
And what if they replaced those with new ones?

56
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,000
You can check the model sticker or the condition of the fuses.

57
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,099
- Did you change this? - I haven't touched it.

58
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,800
Replace these two cars' fuse boxes over here.

59
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,810
Get started.

60
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,340
All right, be thorough. Check that too, okay?

61
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,380
Got it.

62
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:35,410
Found it.

63
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,120
It's got to be here.

64
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,220
There's a mud stain here.

65
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,460
Gosh, we missed that.

66
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,490
If they'll go to these lengths to hide that a car was flooded,

67
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,800
then they're the real problem, not the car.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,700
I still don't get it. All this trouble for a flooded car?

69
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,340
Because if they can trick someone into buying just one,

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,100
they stand to make a huge profit.

71
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,170
Money's important, but come on. People could die in an accident.

72
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,210
Anyone selling these flooded cars should be rounded up and drowned.

73
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,680
Legally, a car this flood-damaged should've been scrapped.

74
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,780
But for it to be sitting brazenly on a lot...

75
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,990
means an illicit pipeline must exist for acquiring these cars.

76
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,589
I'll start by checking the transported vehicles...

77
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,930
that went to and from Noblesse.

78
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,890
Here, get rid of this.

79
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,700
- It's from a flooded car. - You're right.

80
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,170
Goodness.

81
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Thanks.

82
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,850
I heard you haven't been home in days.

83
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,450
I sent a text.

84
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
I told them I needed to get some air for a few days.

85
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,650
Your wife and Ji Eun are really worried.

86
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,290
It's just that I...

87
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,790
don't have the confidence to face my family yet.

88
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,430
There you go again, saying the opposite of how you feel.

89
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,640
You mean you can't wait to see them, right?

90
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,410
You're right.

91
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,240
My wife and Ji Eun...

92
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,880
I miss them so much.

93
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,450
Just hang in there a little longer. We'll take care of everything.

94
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,820
I never imagined you'd do this kind of work, Mr. Jang.

95
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,060
And to think we've worked together for over ten years.

96
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,130
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

97
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,500
I'm sure you had your reasons. You don't have to apologize.

98
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,400
I'm the one who should be sorry...

99
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,940
and grateful.

100
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,870
Oh, right.

101
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,770
Here.

102
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,880
That imported car registered in your name, Driver Oh.

103
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,110
I've transferred the ownership to my name.

104
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,850
What are you talking about?

105
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,120
Why would you do that?

106
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,520
Hey, is there some rule that says I can't drive a fancy car?

107
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,460
I've got it all handled, so please don't worry about it.

108
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,639
Remember when some guy threw a fit...

109
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,739
about his license getting revoked?

110
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,280
How much did the boss pay for it?

111
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,710
The boss probably bought it for 1,000 dollars.

112
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,110
It was 1,000 dollars?

113
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,179
But we sold it for 100,000 dollars.

114
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,250
That's right.

115
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,690
He made 100 times his money.

116
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,990
Our boss is seriously the best.

117
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,430
Hey, work hard. Then maybe one day you can be like the boss.

118
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,000
Driver Kim Do Gi, did you hear that?

119
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,230
They made 100 times their money off of Driver Oh.

120
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,270
Then we'll take it back from them, 100-fold.

121
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,510
I've called everywhere,

122
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,880
and it looks like there's nothing worth getting...

123
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,150
for individual taxi licenses today.

124
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,680
- What about the online forums? - I haven't checked them yet.

125
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,190
You should set up keyword alerts so you see them right away.

126
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,819
- Okay. - But you should go on...

127
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,190
a business trip first.

128
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,590
A business trip? Where to?

129
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,529
The torrential downpour last weekend has left four dead...

130
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,760
and displaced 8,000 residents.

131
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,829
Police are continuing to search...

132
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,930
for the two people who are still missing...

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,940
To the place that was flooded, where people died?

134
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,870
Is that all your darn eyes can see?

135
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,440
You'll never make any real money.

136
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,080
What do you mean, sir?

137
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,080
- I saw seven cars just at a glance. - Seven cars?

138
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,950
- Gosh. - Call for a car carrier.

139
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,620
- Yes, sir. - That's seven, all right.

140
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,990
Let's go get those cars washed.

141
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,530
Keep it coming.

142
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,530
This batch is really nice.

143
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,940
We've got German cars, American cars,

144
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,770
and even a British car.

145
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,710
This is a pretty good haul. What more could you ask for?

146
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,710
- Go check them out. - Thank you.

147
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,450
We only see each other when there's a flood.

148
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,290
Then again, meeting up for work is what we enjoy.

149
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,160
- How many did you bring in total? - Gosh, so impatient.

150
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,730
After your call, Mr. Cha, I found some without full coverage.

151
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,530
I've secured seven of them in total. Here, take a look.

152
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,870
You've rounded up a nice little collection.

153
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,040
So that's how they've been getting these flooded cars.

154
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,050
By buying back the cars that come into the scrapyard?

155
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,750
Flooded cars are usually written off by insurance and then scrapped.

156
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,820
But they're after flooded cars without comprehensive coverage.

157
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,190
That's why the flood history check came up clean.

158
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,830
With no insurance, there's no reason to report the flood damage.

159
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,760
Then the people who buy the cars from the dealership...

160
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,170
would have absolutely no idea what they're buying, right?

161
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,530
They'll only find out...

162
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,640
after the car dies on them.

163
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,910
Now, you need to pay me.

164
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,350
If we're done here, let's go.

165
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,259
(Scrapped vehicles must be deregistered.)

166
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,829
(File with your city or county office.)

167
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,460
(We can handle the deregistration for you.)

168
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
(Scrapyard Office)

169
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:35,670
Come on, TG. What's wrong with you?

170
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,130
Who's there?

171
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,670
Hey, I want some of that jerky too.

172
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,410
Come on out. Stop hiding.

173
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,290
Hey.

174
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,120
Who are you?

175
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,020
You used the car scrapping papers to transfer the ownership.

176
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,230
I said, who are you?

177
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,060
What are you talking about?

178
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,830
Let's wash them up and send them off to a good home.

179
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,160
They just have to run smoothly for one month, that's all.

180
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,630
Yes, sir.

181
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,770
That car on the far left is a popular family model.

182
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,610
So pay extra attention. The passenger-side airbag deployed.

183
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,970
Tuck it back inside...

184
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,680
- and stitch it up, Manager Yoo. - The airbag?

185
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,380
Make it a nice, clean stitch.

186
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,120
But if I do that, the airbag won't deploy in a crash.

187
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,680
Are you going to be driving it?

188
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,590
- No. - Then why do you care?

189
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,160
Then I'll stitch it up nicely.

190
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,130
- Hey. - Yes?

191
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,060
Wipe that smile off your face.

192
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,170
Sir.

193
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,430
Sir.

194
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,670
It's about these documents...

195
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,810
I couldn't process the titles, so I decided to look into it.

196
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,940
It turns out all the cars we bought from the scrapyard yesterday...

197
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,450
have already been deregistered.

198
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,910
Are you sure you checked properly?

199
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,420
I checked every single VIN myself.

200
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,760
(Cheongju Scumbag)

201
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,400
That jerk.

202
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,170
You live in the gutter, you become gutter trash.

203
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,670
(8pm, Legal consultation for the goons)

204
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,980
(8pm, Legal consultation for the goons)

205
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,190
Finish prepping the cars and just leave them be.

206
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,620
We're turning them all into ghost cars.

207
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,260
Yes, sir.

208
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,670
Okay. Just say you don't remember. Period.

209
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,769
Byeong Jin, thanks a lot.

210
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,180
Remember that girl I told you about?

211
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,310
She's pressing rape charges.

212
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,710
You need to be more careful, you idiot.

213
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,479
Byeong Jin, my buddy was out for a joyride...

214
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,450
with his girlfriend,

215
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,720
and he ended up hitting someone.

216
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,920
- Was he playing Grand Theft Auto? - What did you say? You jerk.

217
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,130
Yes.

218
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,100
How's the victim?

219
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,570
The victim?

220
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,640
Dead or alive?

221
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,170
They're alive.

222
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,410
Okay, so they're alive.

223
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,080
Alcohol?

224
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,680
- Alcohol? - Were you drunk?

225
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,350
A little. Two bottles of whisky.

226
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,920
Two bottles of whisky?

227
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,990
Hey, two bottles aren't "a little."

228
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,090
Don't get out of the car. Go to the nearest convenience store.

229
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,789
Go buy a bottle of soju...

230
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,590
and drink it where you can be seen clearly on security cameras.

231
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,630
- That'll get you out of the DUI. - You're telling him to drink more?

232
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,860
Five minutes later, report the accident to insurance.

233
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,870
If they sue, just write a very sincere apology.

234
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,940
Got it. Thank you, sir.

235
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,740
How on earth do you know all this stuff?

236
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,710
Hey! That stupid jerk.

237
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,280
Byeong Jin is a lawyer.

238
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,680
Former lawyer.

239
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,490
All right!

240
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,390
Let's settle this month's rent!

241
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,760
- You got it! - Right away!

242
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,690
It's 50,000 dollars.

243
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,660
- Gosh, hurry up. - Hurry.

244
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,470
That place looks super expensive.

245
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,010
I bet they're eating expensive food in there. Those jerks.

246
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,280
I know, right?

247
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,280
Why do bad guys always pick places with no security cameras?

248
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,720
(Deluxe Taxi)

249
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,360
I'm going in.

250
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,820
- So that's what you meant. - See you later.

251
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,230
I need to cover my face.

252
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,470
- You do have a plan, right? - No, not really.

253
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,010
- Then why'd you come in? - I had a hunch there was something.

254
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,310
- A hunch about what? - I don't know. You got any ideas?

255
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,780
- No! I was following you. - Hey, you little...

256
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,180
You should've said we shouldn't go, you brat!

257
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,350
Hey, what did I do?

258
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,650
Show some respect! Aren't you going to let go?

259
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,350
- No! You let go first! - I'm going to count to three. One.

260
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,260
Two. Two and a half, two and three quarters!

261
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,060
Three! Hey! I said three, so why didn't you let go?

262
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,930
What's wrong with you? I said three, you punk!

263
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,030
This isn't my first rodeo. I knew you'd try something.

264
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,470
- What? Why, you little... - Who are you guys?

265
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,710
Sorry. We seem to have picked the wrong room to fight in.

266
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,780
We'll just go fight somewhere else. Please enjoy your evening.

267
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,550
Get out! You little brat!

268
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,680
Those idiots.

269
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,490
Hey, drink up!

270
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,460
- Drink up! - Drink up!

271
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,530
We did good, right?

272
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,170
Go Eun, are you getting a clear view?

273
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,870
Well, I can just barely see.

274
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,170
Anybody need a ghost car these days?

275
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,440
I do. I need about three.

276
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Three?

277
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,950
I can get you those three.

278
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,180
Byeong Jin, we need some too!

279
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,050
Just let me know if you need any.

280
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,220
I can set you all up.

281
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,190
Hey, we're all in a good mood, so let's get a group picture.

282
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,430
Take it!

283
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,730
He's really putting cars on the road that have no business being there.

284
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,330
That guy only cares about money. He has no regard for human life.

285
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,400
Look at what he did to Driver Oh.

286
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,310
He didn't just fake his license. He also sold him a luxury car...

287
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,610
just to bleed him dry.

288
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,180
I guess it's time to act like we've got money to burn.

289
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,780
We have a wide selection of cars. We've got this one, and that one...

290
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,090
- Manager Yoo, show him around. - Right this way, sir.

291
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,560
Hey, fashionista!

292
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,930
Hello.

293
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,070
Looks like you're here to exchange the car you bought last time.

294
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,240
You must not have read the contract very carefully, my friend.

295
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,110
I'm not here to exchange the car.

296
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,650
Then what?

297
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,450
- You want a refund? - No.

298
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,050
I'm here to buy a car.

299
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,690
You see, I...

300
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,590
just got a new girlfriend,

301
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,760
and as a surprise,

302
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,260
I want to get her a used car as a gift.

303
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,570
Gosh, would you look at that.

304
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,270
You're a real romantic, aren't you?

305
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,350
- Without love, I - Can't go on

306
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,950
Man, there's no better surprise than a car, am I right?

307
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,720
You know it. Okay, recommend a good one for me.

308
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,920
Just for you,

309
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,530
I'll recommend a real killer.

310
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,300
All right, this one here. The red one.

311
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,030
It's sharp.

312
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,270
- It's a sweet ride. - Oh, a killer car! I love it.

313
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,370
Wait, you shouldn't...

314
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,540
- What a pushover. - Gosh, those are expensive.

315
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,150
This one's a goner too.

316
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,750
It's gone.

317
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,850
Another level-three flooded car.

318
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,760
He said he'd sell me a "killer" car,

319
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,560
and I guess he wasn't lying.

320
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,060
What do you think they're thinking about me?

321
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,999
You're buying what they're selling.

322
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,170
They must think you're a pushover.

323
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,000
Guess I'll have to buy another one, then.

324
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,240
They'll be happy to see you again, Driver Kim Do Gi.

325
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
No.

326
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,810
I'm going to buy one somewhere else.

327
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,510
What?

328
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,790
Honey, this car has really low mileage.

329
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,530
And the price is pretty good. Should we get this one?

330
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,130
That's because it's been in a ton of accidents.

331
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,000
If you look closely here,

332
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,730
the bumper is a slightly different color.

333
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,600
They just have a lot of cars. Honestly, most of them are no good.

334
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,870
How about I recommend a great car from our dealership?

335
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,940
Excuse me.

336
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,240
What do you think you're doing in front of our lot?

337
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,450
They just had some questions.

338
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,480
Darn, I almost poached one.

339
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,520
This one just came in yesterday, fresh on the lot.

340
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,020
- Look at the curves on this thing. - Isn't that the pushover?

341
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,360
Love that soars so high

342
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,470
All right then. I really like this one.

343
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,840
Just recommend a good one for me.

344
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,710
What is with that guy?

345
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,510
He bought another used car?

346
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,420
Come on. Are you sure you saw that right?

347
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,290
I'm sure it was that pushover. It was a gift for his girlfriend.

348
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,360
But he just bought a car from us not too long ago.

349
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,720
Doesn't that seem a little strange?

350
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,060
Now that you mention it.

351
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,360
That guy's buying cars too often, don't you think?

352
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,960
Something is definitely off.

353
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,700
He's a repeat buyer. Good for us. What's so strange?

354
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,940
It's not like he's in a car carrier buying them up.

355
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,670
Don't make a big deal out of nothing.

356
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,140
Go Eun.

357
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,040
Get a car carrier ready for me.

358
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,150
Yes, sir. Of course. Thank you.

359
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Let's do this.

360
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,780
A car carrier?

361
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,450
Boss!

362
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,020
That pushover is driving a car carrier buying up used cars.

363
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,380
He loaded them onto a car carrier?

364
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,620
Yes. The other used cars he bought from other lots were on there too.

365
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,160
The more I think about that pushover,

366
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,490
the more things don't add up.

367
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,160
He never even bothered to check the cars' condition.

368
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,500
And he never tried to haggle.

369
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,870
That pushover's here.

370
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,310
To buy a car.

371
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,980
Why?

372
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
Again?

373
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,890
What's wrong?

374
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,490
My girlfriend and I broke up.

375
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,860
You broke up with your girlfriend,

376
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,400
so you came to buy a used car?

377
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,170
I feel like a drive in a new car...

378
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,170
will cheer me up.

379
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,650
Got any recommendations?

380
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,420
This one... Gosh.

381
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,620
My gosh. I'm so sorry.

382
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,620
Could you help me pick this up?

383
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,630
(This certifies the transfer of ownership.)

384
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,740
(Kim Do Gi)

385
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,170
We're all set, right?

386
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,040
Hold on a sec.

387
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,010
Right, thanks. Go ahead, count it.

388
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,490
We're pretty much done, but...

389
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,730
You haven't paid the residual value of 7,000 dollars.

390
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,170
- Residual value? - That needs to be paid in cash.

391
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,400
If not, we can just cancel the whole deal.

392
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,750
That's right. Right, the residual value.

393
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,180
That's right. It totally slipped my mind.

394
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,520
Okay, then. Is a check okay?

395
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,820
Count it.

396
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,590
And don't worry, the serial numbers are all unique.

397
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,000
Thank you. Have a good one.

398
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,600
Take care.

399
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,240
Right. One more thing.

400
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
The car key.

401
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,310
This is mine now. Have a good one.

402
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,139
It's my car!

403
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,910
But that pushover...

404
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,450
I bet he doesn't even know what residual value is.

405
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,390
Look at him. He doesn't give a darn about price.

406
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,590
- What on earth is that? - Thank you!

407
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,590
Get the car key.

408
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,820
Where on earth is he going?

409
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,450
All right.

410
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,410
Let's get a little closer.

411
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,880
Okay.

412
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,990
Perfect.

413
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,670
All mine!

414
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,540
There he is.

415
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,810
What is that thing?

416
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,219
Please enter the four-digit code.

417
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,620
Five, two, eight, three. There we go.

418
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,160
- Thank you. Thank you very much. - What is that?

419
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,640
- Isn't that money? - This is it.

420
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,610
Bye. I'll be back for more.

421
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,580
Hide.

422
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,980
(Exit)

423
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,750
Time to score another one.

424
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,760
He's got skills.

425
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,920
He goes to used car lots and buys cars.

426
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,590
It looks like he's hoarding them all here.

427
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,290
The cars he bought from us are over there too.

428
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,260
- Where? - Right there.

429
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,690
Oh, I see.

430
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,700
Okay, let's see.

431
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,430
Used cars, a car carrier, and...

432
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,870
love?

433
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:59,040
Gosh, I can't figure out what this jerk is up to.

434
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,110
Maybe he's collecting used cars to export them?

435
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,250
Come on. What moron buys cars at a dealer to export for a loss?

436
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,580
What if...

437
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,620
he's buying all these cars to smuggle drugs?

438
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,590
The curiosity is killing me.

439
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,130
What is this pushover's deal, anyway?

440
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,060
What? People?

441
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,900
Well, well. Look at those curious eyes.

442
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,270
The fact they followed me here so quickly...

443
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,580
means they must be dying to know why.

444
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,649
- It's not just them. I'm curious. - Me too.

445
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,110
You can at least tell us, can't you?

446
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,250
I may've built it, but I don't know. What does that thing even do?

447
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,090
- You curious? - Yes.

448
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,160
Desperately.

449
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
To sell the cars.

450
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,090
- What? - What?

451
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,230
Did you get what Driver Kim Do Gi just said?

452
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,369
- No. Should I smack him and ask? - What?

453
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,830
Who's smacking who?

454
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,740
Driver Kim Do Gi. He's going to hit me.

455
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,570
Then maybe he'll feel sorry for me and talk, right?

456
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,010
That could work. Go take one for the team.

457
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,680
Goodness.

458
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,980
Please enter your four-digit code.

459
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,690
Please try again.

460
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,230
Please try again.

461
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,100
If you don't know the code, move on.

462
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,540
Stop hitting it and move on.

463
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,970
The next time that pushover comes to buy a car,

464
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,470
we need to have a little chat with him.

465
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,040
Yes, sir.

466
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,740
Darn it.

467
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,580
(Pedestrian Entrance)

468
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,710
Hello.

469
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,590
He's in a real hurry. He really missed you, Driver Kim.

470
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,060
Yes, maybe he missed me so much that he got angry.

471
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,160
I feel like they're not just going to sell me a car today.

472
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,970
Doesn't that make things a little dangerous?

473
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,500
I just have to buy from them one last time.

474
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
It'll be fine.

475
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,780
Good news, everyone!

476
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,510
What do you know? I've gotten myself a new girlfriend!

477
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,290
Recommend me one with a really smooth ride.

478
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,520
You want a smooth ride? I'll find you the perfect one.

479
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:16,810
How about that? A killer ride, right?

480
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,720
- Let me take a look. - No, you can't.

481
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,450
You're a cheeky one.

482
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,250
There must be a misunderstanding.

483
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,290
A misunderstanding?

484
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:35,390
Yes. I haven't done anything wrong.

485
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,760
- You think you've done no wrong? - What? What did I do?

486
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,400
Your problem is...

487
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,970
that you're just so unfriendly, you punk.

488
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,600
- I am? - Yes.

489
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,640
What? That can't be right.

490
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,780
This feels ominous.

491
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,360
Wait, are you going to hit me?

492
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,960
You don't have to hit me. I'll tell you everything.

493
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,600
Just ask me anything!

494
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,820
Why are you buying up all these used cars?

495
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,590
I'll only ask you one more time.

496
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,260
Oh, no. You don't have to ask again.

497
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,560
I...

498
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,370
I managed to land a real pushover.

499
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:55,710
- A pushover? - Yes. If I buy a used car,

500
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,370
he adds ten percent on top of the purchase price...

501
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,410
and gives it to me as a finder's fee.

502
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,210
Ten percent?

503
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:03,810
Yes.

504
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,550
So that's why you didn't care about the prices and kept buying.

505
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,820
Since I get reimbursed for all of it.

506
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,660
What's he planning on doing with all those cars?

507
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,730
That part, I'm not sure about.

508
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,060
Is he exporting them or something?

509
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,500
Maybe that's it?

510
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,170
I have no idea.

511
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,140
I really don't know!

512
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,870
He probably found his own pushover to sell to.

513
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,510
Sir, you should take a look at this contract.

514
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,780
That's...

515
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,150
He signed a contract for 100 cars.

516
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:40,520
Darn. I've only managed to get 30 so far.

517
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,290
I need to get to 100 fast.

518
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:47,890
If you need that many, why buy them one by one instead of all at once?

519
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,460
Because that would look suspicious, wouldn't it?

520
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,230
Driving around in a car carrier to buy them 1 by 1 isn't suspicious?

521
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,570
I hadn't thought of that.

522
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,000
So you're still 70 cars short.

523
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,780
You want to go home, don't you?

524
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
Excuse me?

525
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,110
Yes.

526
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,880
Then you're going to do a little job with me.

527
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,590
Okay.

528
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,260
All right.

529
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,030
Could you loosen these? They're too tight.

530
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,330
It hurts.

531
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,100
But if we get involved with that guy,

532
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,070
are you sure we won't get into trouble?

533
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,670
All we have to do is sell the cars.

534
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,110
Even if something goes wrong, that pushover's on the contract,

535
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,210
so we have nothing to worry about.

536
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,320
We have a total of 36 cars available to take immediately.

537
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,450
Thirty-six?

538
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,120
Should I get the contracts ready for all of them?

539
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,030
Thirty-six cars. Plus the thirty that pushover took.

540
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,330
That means we still have room for 34 more.

541
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,540
Are you going to buy them from other dealerships?

542
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,150
That's harsh.

543
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,990
I know. After you cooperated so nicely,

544
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:26,220
they won't even untie you. They're real jerks.

545
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,460
How many cars did you say they have in stock?

546
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,960
Thirty-six.

547
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:35,160
Then it's about time we get ready to sell too.

548
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:38,030
Okay. I'm all set with the contracts too.

549
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,140
I'm done too.

550
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,010
Post it now.

551
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,850
The taxi company near my house.

552
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,520
I'm spilling the tea on their massive flood.

553
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,450
Hey!

554
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,750
Hey!

555
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,370
Whoosh!

556
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,010
(Post)

557
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,350
(New post with keyword detected)

558
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,080
(Keywords: Flood, submerged)

559
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,050
A pipe burst at the taxi company across from my house. It's a flood.

560
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,420
It's total pandemonium. And it was my day to sleep in,

561
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,119
but I kept hearing noise,

562
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,820
so I looked out my window and was shocked.

563
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,789
All the cars are underwater.

564
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,890
The taxi company is gone. It's submerged.

565
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,430
So now we just have to wait around until that guy takes the bait?

566
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,500
I'm not a big fan of waiting.

567
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:20,069
- Brings back some bad memories. - It does.

568
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,100
(Can you tell me the location of the taxi company?)

569
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,870
Looks like we won't have to wait at all.

570
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,410
(I'd like to help out personally.)

571
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,680
Driver Kim, they're asking for our location. What should I tell them?

572
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,880
Could you pass on a message to Mr. Jang for me?

573
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,890
Tell him it's a good day for a drink.

574
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,850
My gosh.

575
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,230
(Business suspended)

576
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:27,470
Gosh, look at all this.

577
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,170
Money, money

578
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,930
This is perfect. A level-three flood car.

579
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,470
Who's there?

580
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:05,310
We're not even open. Why are you here?

581
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,180
Are you a burglar?

582
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,480
Just when I was feeling lonely and desolate,

583
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,050
I'm even happy to see a burglar.

584
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,850
Come on in.

585
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:21,720
- Are you the owner? - The owner?

586
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,500
The owner of a ruined company? I'm hardly that.

587
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:31,930
How about a drink with me?

588
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,070
Wait.

589
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,010
Are you saying that you want to buy...

590
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,880
all of our flooded taxis?

591
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,520
After all,

592
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,420
if you scrap those cars, you'll only get 900 dollars per car,

593
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,520
for a total of just 27,000 dollars, right?

594
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,260
But from there,

595
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,930
once you factor in towing, paperwork, and deregistration fees,

596
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,330
the money you'll actually pocket will be next to nothing.

597
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,300
You're not wrong, but...

598
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:14,440
How about this? I'll even cover all incidental fees,

599
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:17,510
and I'll pay you 1,200 dollars for each car.

600
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,090
What do you say?

601
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,620
In that case...

602
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,529
Let's draw up a contract first.

603
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,760
The contract... Wait a second.

604
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,560
- The contract form... - I'll pay you on the spot.

605
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,100
I need the cars as soon as possible.

606
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,650
Thank you.

607
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:54,550
All right, keep coming. Yes, you're good.

608
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,350
Okay, stop!

609
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,290
All right, you're good.

610
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,830
The contract's signed, so get them moving now.

611
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:08,000
Got it. We'll be busting our butts back and forth all night.

612
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,700
Hold on!

613
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
What?

614
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,400
Hold on a second.

615
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,770
When will you pay the other 500,000 dollars...

616
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,210
for the residual value?

617
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,510
I prefer cash, by the way.

618
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,550
What's this nonsense? That's not in the contract.

619
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,590
It's not in your copy of the contract?

620
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,460
Because it's right here in mine.

621
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:40,500
If you slip this special provision right in here,

622
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,070
your seal is stamped plain as day right here.

623
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,140
If you were going to argue against it,

624
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,970
you should've used an inter-page seal.

625
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,280
I guess going bankrupt made you lose your mind.

626
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,280
Choi!

627
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:06,720
You have a Choi. We have a Kim.

628
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,560
Kim.

629
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,570
Isn't that the pushover?

630
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,300
Why is that pushover coming out of there?

631
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,270
What's going on?

632
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,140
I think we're done for.

633
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,020
Is everyone okay?

634
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,760
You want to go home, don't you?

635
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,790
Then you're going to do a little job with me.

636
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,030
Okay.

637
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,830
So, were you planning to scam me from the start?

638
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,500
Gosh, that's a bit harsh.

639
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,000
Especially after I sold so many used cars for you.

640
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,410
For old times' sake, I can't cancel the contract,

641
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,510
but I can offer you an exchange.

642
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,080
An exchange?

643
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,460
They're new, so they're a bit pricier.

644
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:22,800
My goodness!

645
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,640
(Rainbow Taxi)

646
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,940
Come on.

647
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,460
This is incredible.

648
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:51,790
Choi!

649
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,770
What are you staring at? Get the contract!

650
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,420
What are you?

651
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,450
- Go Eun. - Darn it.

652
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,020
I learned to box too, you jerk!

653
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,530
Weave, weave, one, two.

654
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:27,000
Oh, gosh!

655
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,570
Don't tell me it's over already.

656
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,770
What are you talking about? We just got here to have some fun!

657
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,780
Please help me!

658
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,050
What are you talking about?

659
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,750
I'm just a car salesman.

660
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,530
So, are you buying or not?

661
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,719
Byeong Jin. Funny you should mention it.

662
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,530
I know guys dying to drive supercars.

663
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,590
- I was just about to call you. - Round up all your guys.

664
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,130
I'm sorry? I don't think I heard you right.

665
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,630
I'll let you guys drive supercars for a whole year, free of charge.

666
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,900
So get everyone together and tell them to gather right now.

667
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,440
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

668
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,210
You picked a fight with the wrong people.

669
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,650
Darn it.

670
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:02,720
Byeong Jin!

671
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,959
I told them they could drive free, and they came running like strays.

672
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,159
Byeong Jin, where's the guy we're burying?

673
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,600
Who is it?

674
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,640
(Deluxe Taxi)

675
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,740
What's all this?

676
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,010
Get that jerk. Get him!

677
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,990
These idiots can't even catch one taxi.

678
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,120
Gosh. That thing's really fast.

679
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:42,460
What on earth? Darn it!

680
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:45,560
Driver Kim Do Gi, how close are you?

681
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:47,000
I'm almost there.

682
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,820
I got you.

683
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,530
- Hey, block the exits first! - Yes, sir!

684
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,930
- Where is he? - Move it!

685
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,600
Spread out!

686
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,869
Guys, don't you want to ride supercars?

687
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:31,870
- Search every corner! - Come out.

688
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,440
- Yes, sir! - Every corner!

689
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,990
Stop him!

690
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,740
Thanks for going to all the trouble of bringing these here.

691
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,440
You saved me a lot on delivery fees.

692
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,480
Delivery fees?

693
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,080
That was the easiest delivery ever.

694
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,050
You could've parked a little neater, though.

695
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:14,920
I guess you're all just messed up in the head.

696
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:18,390
Thanks to your cooperation, this whole job went a lot smoother.

697
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,620
Moving them all by myself would've been hard.

698
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:27,800
The contract said you'd be trading the new cars for these supercars.

699
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:30,830
New cars?

700
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,810
You must not have read the contract very carefully.

701
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,320
What are you all standing around for?

702
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,350
Kill that jerk!

703
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,690
You scum!

704
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:55,920
You jerk.

705
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,710
- You walked in here voluntarily. - But you won't be walking out.

706
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:16,310
You little punks.

707
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,230
My goodness.

708
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,190
Where are we?

709
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,090
Hey, what's that over there?

710
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,360
I'll give you one last chance.

711
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,440
If you admit what you've done wrong, even now,

712
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,770
and promise to compensate your victims,

713
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,610
then I might just reconsider.

714
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:38,290
- Just run him over. Go! Step on it! - Just run him over!

715
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,190
How about you all think it over?

716
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,390
Just die, you jerk!

717
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,830
Turn around! It's a dead end!

718
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:05,750
That car you're in. Doesn't it look a little familiar?

719
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,619
- Boss! - What is it?

720
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,080
This is one of the cars from our lot.

721
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,190
- It's a flood-damaged car of ours. - What? Are you sure?

722
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,620
I'm the one who stitched the airbag in this car!

723
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,790
Stop the car now!

724
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:22,560
- Stop the car, you jerk! - The brakes aren't working!

725
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,000
You never thought you'd drive it, did you?

726
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,970
- Turn the car! Hit the brakes! - The brakes!

727
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,910
I said, stop the car!

728
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,010
Hey, you jerk!

729
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,550
- The pedal's not working! - Just slam on it!

730
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:51,560
Now you get to experience it for yourselves...

731
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:56,900
what it's like to be driving a ticking time bomb.

732
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,440
(Deluxe Taxi)

733
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:08,880
No!

734
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:19,390
(Deluxe Taxi)

735
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,820
Make sure you eat all of your lunch.

736
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,230
Okay, I will. I'm heading out.

737
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:28,960
- Drive safe. Ji Eun, be careful. - Okay.

738
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,870
Dad.

739
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:32,630
Ta-da!

740
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:34,270
Here, have this while you're working.

741
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,540
Your knees must hurt from sitting all day.

742
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:38,910
Our daughter is so thoughtful.

743
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,310
Since my sweet daughter is looking out for me,

744
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,410
I feel reenergized already.

745
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,279
I'm the best, right?

746
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,120
Drive safe, and I'll see you later!

747
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,280
Ji Eun.

748
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:50,550
Yes?

749
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:52,090
ASD.

750
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,790
- ASD. - "ASD?" What does that mean?

751
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,260
What's the inside joke?

752
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,600
Another safe day.

753
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,800
See you later.

754
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,240
(Another Safe Day)

755
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:18,780
All right.

756
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,850
Vehicle 5283, ending service.

757
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,650
Great work.

758
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:55,350
You all did a great job.

759
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,050
- Oh, right. - Yes?

760
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,590
If we're going to resume business as usual tomorrow,

761
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,960
we have to clean all the taxis we deliberately messed up.

762
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:05,590
So the real work is just getting started for us, right?

763
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,130
- I'll help out. - Me too.

764
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,970
We should all pitch in.

765
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:16,440
- I guess we're back to the grind. - Yes, sir.

766
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,410
Look at the marbling on this meat.

767
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,650
How long has it been since we had Korean beef?

768
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,420
Pass me your plate.

769
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,660
Here's a little to start. I'll bring more over.

770
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:43,030
Driver Kim Do Gi, get over here before Chief Choi eats it all.

771
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:47,340
That's hurtful. I've only had three pieces so far.

772
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,410
- Already? I've only had one piece. - Better step it up.

773
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,610
Come on, Do Gi, hurry up and sit down.

774
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:53,940
All right.

775
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,810
- Hurry up! - There he is.

776
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:03,690
- Go on, have some. - Okay. Should we make a toast?

777
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:04,790
Yes!

778
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:09,590
- To a job well done! - Cheers!

779
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,590
- Cheers! - Cheers!

780
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:29,940
(Watch Repair)

781
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,680
(Don't die. Get revenge.)

782
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,920
I'm going to kill them all.

783
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,350
(We'd like to thank Yoon Si Yoon for his special appearance.)

784
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,910
(Taxi Driver 3)

785
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,380
Are you kidding me? Five months for murder?

786
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,780
Fifteen years ago.

787
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:15,820
I started the Deluxe Taxi service because of Dong Su.

788
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,020
Min Ho.

789
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:20,320
Dong Su, it's me. Don't you recognize me?

790
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,960
Then we'll have to move faster. Before his memories fade completely.

791
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:28,160
Let's see how Im Dong Hyeon reacts to Park Min Ho showing up.

792
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,159
Who is messing with me?

793
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,800
Park Min Ho... Is he really dead?

794
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,370
You're sure he was buried for good, right?
