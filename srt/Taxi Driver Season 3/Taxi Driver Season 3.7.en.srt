We're meeting Im Dong Hyeon today, remember?

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,020
Dong Su?

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,420
Mind if I ask what this is about?

11
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,890
The reason I started Deluxe Taxi was all because of Dong Su.

12
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,730
What kind of justice is this?

13
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,360
We still haven't even found his body!

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,130
Don't die. Let's get our revenge together.

15
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,600
Since no one believed Mr. Park Dong Su 15 years ago,

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,610
let's do the reverse. What if we trust him completely?

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,069
Im Dong Hyeon who was released 15 years ago.

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,780
Can you find out where he is now?

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,610
Sir, you had a phone call earlier. The name was Park Min Ho.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Park Min Ho. You buried him for good, right?

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,950
You want me to bury you too?

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,049
I think I've found the person...

23
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,020
Im Dong Hyeon was with on that day 15 years ago.

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,790
He's Jo Seong Uk.

25
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,090
He had a poor record, but he became a college coach, which is tough.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,600
And he held that position for a long time.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,030
But doesn't something seem off with Im Dong Hyeon and Jo Seong Uk?

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,199
It's a big match.

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,640
Nothing's more important than that for us, right?

30
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,070
This "something more important" has to be kept secret.

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,050
So Im Dong Hyeon was here five hours doing online sports betting?

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,810
No. Im Dong Hyeon wasn't gambling.

33
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,550
He was fixing matches.

34
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,790

Nice!

39
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,670
- That was a tough one. So close. - My bad.

40
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,500
- Focus! Stay in sync with the team. - Yeon Tae.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,870
- Focus. - Right.

42
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,710

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,580
Hey!

46
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,520
- You could've called for it. - My bad.

47
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,820
It's okay, guys. Take it slow. Let's catch up point by point.

48
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,160
- Yeon Tae. The receive. - Got it.

Hey! Focus, will you?

52
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,940
And what was that sign the coach just gave you?

53
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,450
I've never seen that sign before.

54
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,650
What are you talking about? What sign?

55
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,390
Hey! Stop getting distracted and focus on your own game.

56
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,050

We'll talk later in private.

61
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,270
Hey, Yeon Tae. Come in, have a seat.

62
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,940
What are the other guys up to?

63
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,650
They finished stretching and are doing their own drills.

64
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,420
By the way, did you hear Ji Hoon got another scouting offer?

65
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,720
His asking price went up again.

66
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,990
Yes, I heard something about it from the other guys.

67
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,220
This business is so ruthless.

68
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,930
Others get a "salary" or "pay." But they call ours "market value."

69
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,260
You know?

70
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,070
Yeon Tae.

71
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,970
I think this world is incredibly unfair.

72
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,510
Nothing else matters. Perform well, and you're set.

73
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,140
Though we all work just as hard, you know?

74
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,710
Isn't that right?

75
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,910
The next game is critical.

76
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,590
You work hard and trust my calls, no matter what they are.

77
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,020
You're the ace of our team.

78
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,890
This is your market value, kid.

79
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,730
Kid, you're worth more than Ji Hoon.

80
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,440
But, Coach.

81
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,870
Ji Hoon is suspicious of me right now.

82
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,980
He asked if we were exchanging our own secret signals.

83
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,020
All right. I'll have a talk with Ji Hoon.

84
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,090
You just focus on the next game.

85
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,220
It's the last game of the season.

86
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,720
- Yes, sir. - Okay, go on.

87
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,130
- Thank you. - Sure.

88
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,230
- Yeon Tae. - Yes?

89
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,130
I'm counting on you.

90
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,500
- I'll do my best. - Okay.

91
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,860
My goodness.

92
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,830
Just stay down.

93
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,530
I'm fine.

94
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,630
Have you seen...

95
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,330
his face?

96
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,100
No.

97
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,210
Right.

98
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,810
Ji Hoon.

99
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,810
There's more to being an athlete than just playing well.

100
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,480
How could you be so careless during the season?

101
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,890
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,600
- No, Coach. I'm really fine. - What do you mean you're fine, kid?

103
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,060
You think I don't know what you're up against?

104
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,840
Consider it a bonus from your coach. Take it.

105
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,170
It's fine. Everything will be fine.

106
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,840
So get the treatment you need...

107
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,940
and take your time coming back.

108
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,379
- Got it? - Yes.

109
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,550
All right, I'm heading out.

110
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,360
Hey, that jerk Ji Hoon is still alive.

111
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,260
All right, that's 20,000 dollars after the hospital bills.

112
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,570
Go on, count it.

113
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,710
- Yes, what is it? - Hey, Seong Uk.

114
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,740
There's a problem at the gym.

115
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,750
Let's meet up and talk.

116
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,820
(Closed for renovations)

117
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,490
The network line came from the empty unit on the first basement level.

118
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,020
That's why nothing showed up on the gym's network.

119
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
Why?

120
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,690
To spoof the IP and hide their location.

121
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,730
So, the main server is overseas,

122
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,430
but the encryption is blockchain-based.

123
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,000
Which means it can only be accessed from this computer.

124
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,070
The site itself is a rental.

125
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,770
I heard blockchain encryption is hard to crack.

126
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,770
So how did you break it, Go Eun?

127
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,840
It is hard.

128
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,450
That's why they just wrote it here at the bottom.

129
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,220
So that's why he offered 20,000 dollars just to rent it for a day.

130
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,560
Look at all these betting categories.

131
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,960
This looks complicated.

132
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,530
Wouldn't it be easier to rig with fewer options?

133
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,900
The system is simple.

134
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,770
The payout is divided proportionally among those who guess correctly.

135
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,400
If a lot of people win, the individual payout is small.

136
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,840
But if only a few people win, the payout is huge.

137
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,140
That's all there is to it.

138
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,980
Second set, three consecutive receiving errors.

139
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,380
Third set, three consecutive service aces.

140
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,720
Almost no one would bet on outcomes like these.

141
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,650
I wouldn't bet on that either. How could that even happen...

142
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,820
unless it was rigged?

143
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,430
Oh, so it's rigged.

144
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,290
Im Dong Hyeon...

145
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,760
bet on this and won 500,000 dollars.

146
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,970
In just three hours.

147
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,140
So Im Dong Hyeon tells Jo Seong Uk which bets have the longest odds,

148
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,270
and Jo Seong Uk makes them happen during the game.

149
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,340
That's how they've been fixing the matches.

150
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,980
It's 500,000 dollars for 1 fix.

151
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,950
They'll be back to rent the gym soon.

152
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,180
I'll take down the site for now.

153
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,180
No, leave it up.

154
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,020
Leave it up? And let them keep fixing matches?

155
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Yes.

156
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,190
We need to find Park Min Ho...

157
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,030
using that site.

158
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,759
You're saying we can find Park Min Ho who died 15 years ago...

159
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,260
with this site?

160
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,730
Yes.

161
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
As long as...

162
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,470
we have someone on the inside.

163
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,180
Seong Uk, look, I never intended to put the gym up as collateral.

164
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,359
Wait. Just hear me out, buddy.

165
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,030
"Buddy?" Don't call me that, you scum.

166
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,800
Don't you know what that gym means to us?

167
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,870
- Why did you do this, you jerk? - I messed up.

168
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,440
You get that gym back by tomorrow.

169
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,210
Got it?

170
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,840
And to think I called you a friend.

171
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,780
You darn gambling addict.

172

(Deluxe Taxi)

173
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,170
I don't care how angry he is. Who beats up their friend like that?

174
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,540
Looks like he could use a consolation prize.

175
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,309
Why did he throw the money? Darn it.

176
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,350
(Rainbow Taxi)

177
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,450
He used to be so nice back in school.

178
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,750
It's scary how money changes people. Seriously.

179
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,160
This is nowhere near enough. What am I supposed to do?

180
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,530
(Funeral Hall)

181
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,160
Thank you. We'll put it to good use.

182
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,370
Mr. Im. You look pretty wasted.

183
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Hey.

184
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,010
Spot me some more.

185
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,550
The sun's about to come up. You should go home.

186
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,050
Just give it to me!

187
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,280
How about you pay back what you already owe first?

188
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,420
- I'm a VIP here. - Sir.

189
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,820
My guys got hurt last time, and we paid for hefty medical bills.

190
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,860
Can't you see we only tolerate you because you're a VIP?

191
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,600
Was I the one who hit them?

192
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,070
- Was I? - What did you just say?

193
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,770
If it's the bills, deal with me. Why take it out on him?

194
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,040
It's him.

195
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,309
It's him.

196
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,310
Instead of trying to pay me back, you're in here gambling again.

197
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,410
And whose fault do you think that is?

198
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,650
Let's play one round.

199
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,020
(Collateral Agreement)

200
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,960
What's wrong? Don't you want to win your gym back?

201
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,940
There you go.

202
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,140
You can't win if you don't look at your hand.

203
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,680
Darn it.

204
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,780
A bust.

205
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Take it.

206
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,530
What the? This isn't a bust. It's a winning hand.

207
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,870
Hey, hold on a second.

208
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,080
You fought hard to win this from me. Why just give it back?

209
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,710
What, you have a problem with me giving it to you?

210
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,480
You must have a reason for doing this.

211
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,120
My motto in life is to keep things interesting.

212
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,390
And being a gym owner was just not interesting.

213
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't think I ever got your name.

214
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,330
Nice to meet you.

215
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,930
I'm Park Min Ho.

216
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,380
Who?

217
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,250
Park Min Ho.

218
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,380
You can just call me Min Ho.

219
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,290
So we're clear. You just gave this to me for free.

220
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,760
Don't try to take it back later.

221
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,259
Hey, you got it for free.

222
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,030
You owe me a drink, don't you?

223
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,430
Talking about drinking this early in the morning?

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,369
Come on, let's go for Round Two.

225
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,070
- He's not dead! - That's enough.

226
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,210
Honey.

227
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,840
You can't go into the crematorium. It's too hot!

228
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,540
Crying like that won't bring him back.

229
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,780
- Stop crying. - No!

230
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,219
- Let's give him a proper send-off. - He's not dead!

231
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,419
- Let's go now. - What do you mean...

232
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,749
- he's not dead? - He's not dead!

233
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,949
Let him go.

234
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,820
- I said he's not dead! - Like he's coming back.

235
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,160
Park Min Ho. Why a dead guy's name? What a jinx.

236
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,530
- What's that? - What is that?

237
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,600
It's a ghost!

238
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,300
- Look! - A ghost.

239
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,940
- What? - It's a ghost.

240
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,300
Look at that.

241
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,939
My friend.

242
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,810
Hey, buddy. Time for Round Two, right?

243
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,410
- You can't fall asleep on me now. - I know, right?

244
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,980
Gosh, my head.

245
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,920
Where am I?

246
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,760
Darn it, what on earth happened?

247
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,470
You drank too much, that's what.

248
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,870
Hey.

249
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,340
How did you get in here?

250
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,310
Why the surprise? You brought me here, bragging.

251
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,450
I did?

252
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,650
I said the second round was on me. And you brought us here.

253
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,720
How else would I have gotten in here?

254
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,620
Round Two was on you?

255
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,360
That does sound kind of familiar.

256
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,790
So then I...

257
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,860
brought you here?

258
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,230
You even told me the passcode and asked me to punch it in for you.

259
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,900
Five, three, seven, nine.

260
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,770
Gosh, seriously.

261
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,750
Three consecutive receiving errors.

262
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,950
Great idea.

263
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,890
It's brilliant!

264
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,990
To be honest, I was really touched by your words.

265
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,430
What did I say?

266
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,930
You said you'd make me rich.

267
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,970
You said I was your emotional baggage, didn't you?

268
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,670
I did?

269
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,439
My friend, CEO Im!

270
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,670
I always knew you'd be a big shot.

271
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,210
Hey, what do you say we come up with our own secret handshake?

272
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,210
Could you just pretend you never saw any of this?

273
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,480
Come on.

274
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,680
I'm not blind.

275
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,550
I saw what I saw. How can I pretend I didn't?

276
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,190
I've got a killer nose for money.

277
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,400
The smell of us getting rich, CEO Im.

278
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,100
But what is that smell?

279
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You smell that?

280
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,140
That's the smell of us getting rich.

281
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,010
Hey, this is a huge jackpot!

282
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,950
This'll make us rich! You get it?

283
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,850
How we'll grow this and cash in. Let's...

284
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,590
meet up later and discuss it, okay?

285
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,459
Wait. We came up...

286
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,930
with this handshake, but how should we finish it?

287
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,530
Got any ideas? I know it's a bit old-school,

288
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,570
but let's just go with this. Boom!

289
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,270
We do this. Got it? Boom!

290
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,780
We drank too much yesterday. Right? Go get some hangover food.

291
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,680
Hey, great idea. This mirror.

292
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,320
Excellent. How clever.

293
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,150
Darn it. If Seong Uk finds out, he's going to kill me.

294
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,120
(14 missed calls from Jo Seong Uk)

295
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,260
Darn it!

296
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,629
You're ignoring my calls?

297
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,370
I got the gym back!

298
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,570
I wasn't avoiding your calls on purpose.

299
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,710
I kind of blacked out.

300
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,240
Hey, Seong Uk.

301
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,150
What do you think about moving our office somewhere else?

302
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,080
Why? Is something wrong?

303
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,150
No, it's just that the ventilation isn't great and...

304
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,120
Dong Hyeon.

305
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,560
Stop rambling...

306
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,290
and just focus on checking the list.

307
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,060
You know I'm counting on you, right?

308
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,200
You're good at this.

309
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,930
Gosh, I'm completely swamped here.

310
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,040
Thanks, Seong Uk. Drive safe.

311
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,580
Park Min Ho, that little pest.

312
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,950
Yes.

313
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,180
Prepare a funeral altar for me.

314
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,720
(Closed for renovations)

315
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,020
Eight, one, three, seven, star.

316
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,130
- The passcode has been changed. - Yes.

317
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,099
When this jerk arrives in five minutes,

318
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,200
make sure he's completely taken out so he can never come again.

319
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,240
I've turned off all the cameras, so you're clear. Got it?

320
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,339
The longer the hospital stay, the higher the price.

321
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,340
Keep that in mind.

322
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,710
Just make sure you do a thorough job.

323
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,180
You should probably take that off.

324
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,709
Hey, don't you worry. We've got a score to settle too.

325
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,749
Darn him.

326
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,750
(All in Gym)

327
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:04,979
We're on scene.

328
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,050
(Police)

329
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,950
- Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. - How can I help you, Officer?

330
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,930
We received a report of an illegal gambling den at this location.

331
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,190
A gambling den?

332
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,399
Well, thanks for the consultation.

333
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,730
I'll come back when I'm ready.

334
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,000
- All right, take care now. - We're going to take a look inside.

335
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,540
Of course.

336
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,540
Who in the world would file a false report like that?

337
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,190
What is it, Officer?

338
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,850
What's the matter?

339
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,560
It seems it was a false report, after all.

340
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,230
I mean, of course. It's a gym. There's no way you'd find that here.

341
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,930
- Thank you for your cooperation. - Of course.

342
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,640
- Have a good day. - Yes, thank you.

343
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,740
What?

344
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,790
He's one of your staff?

345
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,590
You should've said so.

346
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,830
Have a safe trip back.

347
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,060
Unbelievable.

348
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,069
(Bring a Friend to the Gym!)

349
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,170
Are they gone?

350
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,540
The cops. They're gone, right?

351
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,880
Don't tell me you're the one who called them.

352
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,310
No way. I was too busy dreaming about getting rich thanks to you.

353
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,110
I was getting all giddy.

354
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,880
I barely said a word to my college buddy about it.

355
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,560
Gosh, but for him to stab me in the back like this?

356
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,560
Just unbelievable.

357
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,060
You can't trust anyone in this world, right?

358
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,170
You haven't told anyone about this, have you?

359
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,370
Of course not.

360
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,770

361

Come on!

362

Don't go around telling anyone this, you hear me?

363
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,450
This is our little secret. All right?

364
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,780
All right.

365

Hey, we did this before, remember? This one.

366
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,260
You want to go on top, or should I? You go on top.

367

Boom! Rich guy!

369
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,730
Come on, do it with me. Rich guy!

370
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,740
We're the only ones getting rich, got it?

371
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,940
Feel free to work out here if you want, okay?

372
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,050
Let's give this place a complete makeover.

373
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,680
Why that little jerk...

374
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,400
Gosh, it's tough trying to watch all of these at once.

375
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,430
Go Eun, can't you just narrow it down for us?

376
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,500
No, sorry. You see the big picture when you see them all together.

377
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,300
Watch closely again.

378
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,140
See? The coach, Jo Seong Uk, subtly gives a sign.

379
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,180
And then they give up a point. Then another.

380
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,350
The player acting on the sign is the same one every time.

381
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,790
You're right. Number 17 was the one who gave up every point.

382
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,290
Good! And that's our guy, Jeong Yeon Tae.

383
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,860
He's a Jingwang University junior, playing libero.

384
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,530
Sometimes it's hard to tell if he messed up or did it on purpose.

385
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,170
- What a coincidence. - He wasn't going for the ball.

386
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,310
He was going for the player.

387
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:55,050
If he was going for the player, that means he tried to injure him.

388
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,320
Looks like there was money in it for him.

389
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,080

391
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,920
There's a betting category. In-game injuries.

392
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,430
Darn. These jerks will stop at nothing for money.

393
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,830
And their next game is the last one of the season.

394
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,700
They'll try for one last big score, since it's the finale.

395
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,940
That's actually perfect for us.

396
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,010
Let's get their guy on our side.

397
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,540

How about you go have a meal with our "corrupt young star?"

400
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,090
Sure, why not? I can have a meal with him.

401
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,220
- What should I get? - Give me a lot, please.

402
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,630

403

00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,550
Park Min Ho.

533
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,490
- Okay, I got it. Park Min Ho. - Yes.

534
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,220
Min Ho.

535
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,620
I'll set up a time for us to talk later.

536
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,730
You'd better set up that meeting. Got it?

537
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,130
We won't get rich by doing nothing. You know that, right?

538
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,940
Look, I'm going to...

539
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,109
set a few things up,

540
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,610
so you must keep the gears turning.

541
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:02,149
- We can't stop. You get me? - Yes.

542
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,650
All right? We're doing this.

543
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,650
Let's go for it. Let's go!

544
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,920
We're doing this.

545
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,960
I love you so much. Let's go!

546
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,230
Hello.

547
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
Hello.

548
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,740
My brother.

549
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,210
Please have a seat.

550
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,710
This is your itinerary for Korea.

551
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,520
He's the talent I've found.

552
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,630
Hello.

553
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,130
Magnificent.

554
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,880
I'm still in Korea.

555
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,290
I'm looking for a libero with potential.

556
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,560
It's time for your meeting with the volleyball president.

557
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,900
We need to get going, Lorenzo.

558
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,980
I'm still in Korea.

559
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,350

560

564
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,599
The second Driver Kim left,

565
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,700
he frantically searched the Euro league.

566
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,040
How is he falling for this so easily without any suspicion?

567
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,610
I guess it's because he's young?

568
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,740
Human psychology can be conveniently simple sometimes.

569
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,310
- How so? - People doubt info that's given,

570
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,720
but when it's information they've dug up themselves,

571
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,520
they almost always believe it without a second thought.

572
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,790
Jeong Yeon Tae figured out who I am through his own efforts,

573
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,360
and he even did the legwork himself to find out what I'm up to.

574
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,190
There's no way he'll doubt it.

575
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,000
After all, it's all information he discovered on his own.

576
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,530
- So he trusts it completely. - I see.

577
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,970
That's Lorenzo Kim for you.

578
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,570
You could call it the moment...

579
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,970
the fake turns into the real thing.

580
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,180
Message received.

581
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,310
Now that we have someone on our side,

582
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,980
shall we start placing some real bets?

583
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,800
Isn't it a little public to be doing this?

584
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,360
Cut the nonsense.

585
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,040
Just take it.

586
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,910
I'll get on the site and set it up by tomorrow.

587
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,110
It's the last match of the season, so I'm going big.

588
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,610
So stay sharp.

589
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,050
Got it.

590
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,650
Rich guy.

591
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:34,460
I was over there ordering. I swear the small of your money...

592
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,290
was stronger than the smell of fries.

593
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,130
I had a hunch, and sure enough. You're impressive, CEO IM.

594
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,540
Boom!

595
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,710
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

596
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,410
Nice catch!

597
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:59,620
CEO Im, you nearly gave up on that, right?

598
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,350
Or maybe not? Or was that my service ace?

599
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,930
Sit down.

600
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,829
I'm in an important meeting. I'll call you later.

601
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,900
An important meeting?

602
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,440
I guess you hold important meetings over burgers these days.

603
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,270
- I'll call you later, okay? - Yes.

604
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:25,880
You're with someone. Got it. Sorry for interrupting.

605
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,410
Hang on.

606
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,210
By any chance,

607
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,890
aren't you the coach of the Jingwang University volleyball team?

608
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,590
I'm right, aren't I?

609
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,289
You are him!

610
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,690
I thought you looked familiar. I knew it!

611
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,890
Goodness, what an honor.

612
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,100
I've just been so obsessed with volleyball lately.

613
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,870
Would you just leave already?

614
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:53,270
All right. But I'm a huge fan of the coach.

615
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,410
If you don't mind, I'd love to treat you to a meal.

616
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,280
My treat. I'll take you somewhere nice.

617
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,050
After all, we'll be seeing a lot of each other.

618
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,920
I'll let you get back to your important discussion.

619
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:13,260
CEO Im, give me a call.

620
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,220
Take care.

621
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,300
Hey, Dong Hyeon.

622
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,500
Be straight with me.

623
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,030
Did you mess up again?

624
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,840
Mess up? No.

625
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,340
- I didn't. - Just be honest with me.

626
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,180
The thing is,

627
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,280
I went to a gambling den.

628
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,190
That...

629
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,720
That guy...

630
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,260
He's the one who took my gym as collateral.

631
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,329
And he even found our secret room.

632
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,360
I'm sorry.

633
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,270
(Jingwang University versus Hogyeong University)

634
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,610
Goodness.

635
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,910
The site's stakes are way higher than we expected.

636
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,010
Gosh, how much is all this?

637
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:12,250
With that much money on the line, I must be a big thorn in their side.

638
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,120
It's Im Dong Hyeon.

639
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,290
Rich guy.

640
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,660
Clear your schedule.

641
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,360
- My schedule? - You wanted to see the coach.

642
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,270
Let's talk business over dinner.

643
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,540

I'll get the car ready.

647
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:42,580
Hold on. We should take a different car.

648
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,980
At the address Im Dong Hyeon gave me,

649
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,320
there are no restaurants.

650
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,420
I knew it. He wasn't just asking you to have dinner.

651
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,920
We still have those used cars from Cha Byeong Jin, right?

652
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,260
Get me one that wasn't flood-damaged.

653
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,920
Why are they driving like this?

654
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,690
Driver Kim, construction zone on your right.

655
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,140
So this is why they wanted to meet here.

656
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,450
Driver Kim, tow truck up ahead! Watch out!

657
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,120

- Yes. - What do you think?

661
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,840
We killed and burned the body all at once.

662
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,380
That's foolproof.

663
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,510
Make sure you wrap up well. No loose ends.

664
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,280
Okay, just wire me the money.

665

Let's wrap this up!

666
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,930
What did he say? Is it done? Is he dead?

667
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,590
You think he could've survived that?

668
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,330
He's definitely a goner.

669
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:00,080
By the way, do you know what that jerk's name is?

670
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,850
Park Min Ho.

671
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:17,660

00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,410
Because you stood out to me.

711
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:57,380
You have great court vision, Yeon Tae.

712
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,850
You were always right where I thought a defender should be.

713
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,520
That's not something you can learn from practice.

714
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,620
It's a natural gift.

715
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,330
You really think I have that kind of talent?

716
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:17,670
An Asian libero...

717
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,740
has never made it big in the major leagues.

718
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,440
Do you know why that is?

719
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,010
No.

720
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,080
Because he hasn't gone yet.

721
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,220
I mean you, Jeong Yeon Tae.

722
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:43,090
Just cut down on the mistakes.

723
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,700
You make way too many mistakes per game.

724
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,030
Consistently.

725
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,340
You can't afford that.

726
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:04,080
I'll make up for it this time.

727
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,050
Just you watch!

728
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,920
Your hand.

729
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,900
Go out there and show them what you're made of.

730
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,900
Let's make you the Son Heung Min,

731
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,170
the Ryu Hyun Jin of volleyball.

732
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,310
Right.

733
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,480
Yes!

734
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,540
Thank you.

735
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,220
Jeong Yeon Tae!

736
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,990
Get your head in the game! Come on, focus!

737
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,640
Let's go!

738
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,280
Cover!

739
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,210
Nice!

740
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,030
Darn, why is he suddenly playing so well?

741
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:27,960
Darn it. He's not doing what he's told.

742
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:30,770
- Hey, pass it back! - Come on.

743
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,940
Nice!

744
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,539
Hey, Jeong Yeon Tae!

745
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,610
Why aren't you playing as you're told?

746
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,410
Gosh, why are you so good?

747
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,920
Who is this?

748
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,920
(Unknown Caller)

749
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,190
- Who is this? - Hey, CEO Im.

750
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:53,690
It's me.

751
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,530
- What? - Can you see me on TV?

752
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:00,300
Why... Why aren't you dead?

753
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,360
Park Min Ho.

754
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,130
How are you alive?

755
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,640
The tow truck.

756
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,480
- The tow... - Let me share a secret, CEO Im.

757
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,980
That 50-50 split on the reward? It's off.

758
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,320
It's all mine now.

759
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,920
(2025 NUVF College Volleyball U-League, Finals)

760
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,960
No way. The car blew up, so how is he alive?

761
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,130
(2025 NUVF College Volleyball U-League, Finals)

762
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,900
Yeon Tae. Jeong Yeon Tae.

763
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,580
Jeong Yeon Tae, are you even trying to focus?

764
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,780
Coach, sorry, but can you please just let me play for real this once?

765
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:52,450
What kind of nonsense is that? You're a talentless hack.

766
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,650
- I do have skills. - Who says?

767
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,960
Not a single team drafted you. So who told you you're any good?

768
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,390
There might be a chance for me in the major leagues in Europe.

769
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,730
You've really lost it. Hey.

770
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:13,900
How many Korean liberos do you think have ever made it to Europe?

771
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:17,070
Not a single one. Not even one.

772
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:20,210
Then I could be the first, Coach.

773
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,310
Yeon Tae.

774
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:27,020
The next set is really important.

775
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,080
If you don't want to mess up your life,

776
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:32,550
just do as I say. Got it?

777
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:36,730
Good.

778
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,260
I'm counting on you. Now go.

779
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,670
Let's go!

780
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,300
Let's do this!

781
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,250
Yeon Tae.

782
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:00,120
You're doing great.

783
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,330
Play.

784
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,730
Nice one.

785
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,400
Nice!

786
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,110
(Invincible Jingwang's lucky charm, Jeong Yeon Tae)

787
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,080
- Yeon Tae... - Mine!

788
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,810
- Nice! - Yes, that's it!

789
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,250
- That's it. - Cover!

790
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,090
Go!

791
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:44,590
(Invincible Jingwang's lucky charm, Jeong Yeon Tae)

792
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:45,860
- Jeong Yeon Tae! - Jeong Yeon Tae!

793
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,329
(Jingwang University versus Hogyeong University)

794
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:49,760
(Payout: 167,000 dollars)

795
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,370
Jeong Yeon Tae! Let's go!

796
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,320
Darn it.

797
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:16,190
Now that they've made their move, it's our turn to strike.

798
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:19,190
All right. Tomorrow, we unleash everything.

799
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,400
For that one moment of wavering,

800
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,040
we have to focus everything.

801
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:30,610
(Park Min Ho)

802
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,610
Get the one in front! Cover!

803
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:44,890
How dare worthless trash like you defy me?

804
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:47,790
I'm holding a press conference immediately.

805
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,830
- What? - I recorded everything you said.

806
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,100
Everything. From the very beginning.

807
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,730
Jeong Yeon Tae, you...

808
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,700
What do you want from me?

809
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:00,170
What is it you want from me, jerk?

810
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,240
What do I want?

811
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,570
There's definitely something I want.

812
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,310
Apologize to Park Min Ho.

813
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,780
What?

814
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,530
What?

815
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,470
For that one moment of wavering,

816
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:41,810
we have to focus everything.

817
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:45,880
What?

818
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:47,950
What's going on? Park...

819
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:50,649
I thought you said Park Min Ho was dead!

820
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:51,720
Park Min Ho? What are you talking about?

821
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:55,690
The tow truck. You said it flipped and, you blew it up!

822
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,330
We saw the pictures together!

823
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,800
You think he could've survived that?

824
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,100
He's definitely a goner.

825
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:06,130
Get out of my way.

826
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:10,340
But how is Park Min Ho still alive?

827
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,050
Hey, Park Min Ho... He's right here.

828
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,120
Get out of my way!

829
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:43,340
Hey! Who on earth are you?

830
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,410
Who on earth are you, you crazy jerk?

831
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,690
(Park Min Ho)

832
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:00,460
(Park Min Ho)

833
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,190
No.

834
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:05,730
It can't be.

835
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:12,530
It can't be. Park Min Ho is dead!

836
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,470
Park Min Ho is dead! Darn it!

837
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,870
No way. This can't be happening.

838
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,510
And the autopsy report? Who did they ID the body as?

839
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,879
Park Min Ho, a volleyball player of Jingwang University.

840
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,090
- Park Min Ho? - Yes.

841
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,320
We're taking Coach Jo Seong Uk of Jingwang University into custody.

842
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,360
How did they manage it with the body?

843
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,660
The body!

844
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:45,670
How did they do it?

845
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,340
Where did they...

846
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:04,020
This can't be right. Only we knew about this. Right?

847
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:07,890
- Seong Uk, you need to calm down. - But I just got here.

848
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,790
I'll go check for myself.

(The grave of Baek Seon Ja)

850
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,870
It's here!

Park Min Ho is here!

853
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,380
You had me so worried! Darn it.

854
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:14,790
Hey, I found him. Min Ho was right here.

855
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,800
I've found him.

856
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,700
Park Min Ho.

857
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:26,430
So you dug him up yourself just to make sure.

858
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,180
No, that's not it.

859
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,050
Let's meet face-to-face soon.

860
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,430
It feels good to be outside after being cooped up...

861
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:30,730
in a hospital room, right?

862
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,470
Take a nice, deep breath.

863
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,440
The sky?

864
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:45,410
That's right.

865
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,850
Min Ho said he loved a sky just like this, didn't he?

866
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,790
Come to think of it,

867
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,030
just as Min Ho said,

868
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,300
the sky really does look like one giant volleyball court.

869
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,610
The sky is so beautiful.

870
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,780
Seong Cheol.

871
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:27,760
Yes?

01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:27,820
Someone else was involved in Park Min Ho's death?

875
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,050
From now on, I'll take care...

01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,720

Who are you?

879
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,260
Me? I'm Park Min Ho.

880
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:42,260
What are you talking about? Park Min Ho's body was stolen?

881
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:45,430
- Min Ho. Long time no see. - How about we meet and talk?

882
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,370
Be late, and you'll never find Min Ho's bones.

883
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,810
You're too slow.
