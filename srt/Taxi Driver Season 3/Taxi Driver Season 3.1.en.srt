(Children and animals were filmed under guidelines.)

(Fukuoka)

8
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,880
The show at the castle was good.

9
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,790
His acting is the best.

10
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,380
Not yet?

11
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,760
Testing, testing. Can everyone hear me?

12
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,960
Sorry about that. The ships were all backed up.

13
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,560
Thank you all so much for your patience.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,900
The main event will begin shortly. We have a wide variety of goods,

15
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,500
so I hope you'll pay close attention.

16
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,640
Hey!

17
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,210
- Get moving! - Hey, get out!

18
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,610
I said, get moving!

19
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,050
Alright, alright. Make way.

20
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,920
Good evening, everyone! Thank you!

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,590
Good evening. Can you all hear me? How are we all doing tonight?

22
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,730
Yes, it's a beautiful night, isn't it?

23
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,830
Not that we can see anything in the dark.

24
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,370
Shall we get right to it?

25
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,100
The format is the same as last time.

26
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,710
I'll show items. If you like one, please enter your bid.

27
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,540
Alright then, shall we begin?

28
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:01,290
And we're off! She's 168cm, size 2. This lovely lady is from Russia.

29
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,420
What shall we start the bidding at? Let's start at 5. It's 5.

30
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,130
If you'd like to bid, please turn on your laser pointers.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,330
What do you all think? If you're interested, don't be shy.

32
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,400
You can't pass this one up. Look at this smooth skin,

33
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,010
don't you want a taste? Is that all, everyone?

34
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,580
She's Russian, everyone. Russian. Take a good look.

35
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,980
We have 80.

36
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,750
We have 87.

37
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,180
Are you going to place a bid?

38
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,480
No.

39
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,320
She's not my type.

40
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,290
She's a beauty! Here, take a look. Anyone else?

41
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,330
She's young and fresh.

42
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,260
Come on, come on. Let's get those bids higher.

43
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,700
She's in her prime!

44
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,130
There we go! Do you see that?

45
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,300
Look at that. We have 100.

46
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,970
I have 100. Anyone else?

47
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,170
We got 120.

48
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,980
Any other bids? More than 120.

49
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,780
Sold! For 12,000 dollars. Thank you.

50
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,080
Alright, take her away.

51
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,320
Welcome, you jerks.

52
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,230
Don't come close.

53
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,950
Who the hell are you?

54
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,520
I'm a taxi...

55
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,020
A taxi driver.

56
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,430
A taxi driver?

57
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,130
What's with the smug look then?

58
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,150
(Taxi Driver 3)

59
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,360
Please, just let me out of here. Please?

60
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,070
- Come on! Let's go! - Yes, sir.

61
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,230
- Run for it! - Hey! Come on out!

62
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,700
(Don't suffer in silence. Call us and we'll take care of it)

63
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,790
Hello?

64
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,460
My name is Yun I Seo.

65
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,130
Please, you have to help me.

66
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,870
Okay, we're on our way to you.

67
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,940
Where are you right now?

68
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,670
There she is. Over there!

69
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,810
Hey!

70
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,650
Hello?

71
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,410
Yun I Seo?

72
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,620
Hello? Yun I Seo? Are you still there?

73
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,450
Can you hear me?

74
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,750
Yun I Seo!

75
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,460
(To save a single life is to save the entire world.)

76
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,160
Sir, watch out!

77
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,820
He looks familiar.

78
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,020
What are you talking about? You're just seeing things.

79
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,060
- Just my imagination? - Yeah.

80
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:27,000
This Hongdongbaekseo and Joyurisi... Where am I supposed to put this?

81
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,870
Just put it anywhere so we can get started.

82
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,500
We can't just rush through this. It has to be done with care.

83
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,000
What if we upset our ancestors?

84
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,770
Ancestors. Please.

85
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,240
Go Eun's right. About Joyurisi... It's not an ancient tradition.

86
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,750
Time's up. Hurry or I'm gone.

87
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,950
All set.

88
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,520
This car is gorgeous.

89
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,950
What about your old car?

90
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,260
I'm going to sell it. I'll get it all tuned up first.

91
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,320
Please watch over this car...

92
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,190
and grant us safe travels wherever we go.

93
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,500
Well, I have to admit, seeing the new car is pretty nice.

94
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,050
(Out on Assignment)

95
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,660
- Straight from the airport? - Yes.

96
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,530
You should've at least dropped off your luggage first.

97
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,230
I know. I was in such a rush, it completely slipped my mind.

98
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,340
- Sorry I'm late. - Hey, glad you're here.

99
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:16,910
- You should be a little quicker. - Oh, please. You have no idea.

100
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,210
How is he supposed to know where his fare is going to get off?

101
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,580
That's what I mean.

102
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,810
Driver Kim Do Gi wasn't even late, but I gave him a hard time anyway.

103
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,120
How was your trip to Japan?

104
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,040
(Student ID: Yun I Seo)

105
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,120
We should find out what happened to Yun I Seo.

106
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,290
I guess I should be the one to go to the school, right?

107
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,690
Now where did I put my school uniform?

108
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,390
Wait a minute...

109
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,260
It'll be easier to question students as a teacher.

110
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,870
A teacher?

111
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,010
Hey.

112
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,220
Break's over, but you're all still out and about.

113
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,350
Hello.

114
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,020
Alright.

115
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,920
(Class 3-3, Homeroom Teacher Hwang In Seong)

116
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,700
You're all such dedicated students, studying even during your break.

117
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,410
- Who's that? - I don't know.

118
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,250
Awkward.

119
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,409
- What was that? - Did he just say "Awkward?"

120
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,450
- What's that? - My goodness.

121
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,750
- Study hall? - Did the schedule change?

122
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,660
Who's the class president?

123
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,490
That's me?

124
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,130
Alright.

125
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,530
Alright, everyone, keep up the hard work.

126
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,930
I'm rooting for you all.

127
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,570
Class president, can I have a word with you?

128
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,370
Hang on a second.

129
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,710
You know Yun I Seo, right?

130
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,320
We're in the same class, so I know who she is,

131
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,150
but I don't know her well.

132
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,590
She hasn't been around school much lately, right?

133
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,890
She turned in a form saying she was going to some camp.

134
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,060
I'm sorry, who are you?

135
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,630
So she went to a camp.

136
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,230
Where?

137
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,000
- Japan? - That I wouldn't know.

138
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,470
(Class 3-3, Homeroom Teacher Hwang In Seong)

139
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,940
By any chance, are you our new assistant homeroom teacher?

140
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,710
This camp... Is it a real camp?

141
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,550
Doesn't the school usually sponsor things like that?

142
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,690
I Seo's family is not well-off, so she gets a special scholarship.

143
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,390
Maybe the scholarship foundation sent her?

144
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,860
But why do you keep asking such weird questions?

145
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,100
Why do you think?

146
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,770
I'm asking because I'm worried.

147
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,970
You're the Class President.

148
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,370
One of your classmates has gone missing,

149
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,650
and I guess you're not worried at all?

150
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,320
Your granddaughter looks just like you.

151
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,020
Really? Well, she didn't get her brains from me,

152
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,790
but she's an incredibly bright student.

153
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,330
She and a friend have been studying at a boarding academy, I think.

154
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,830
Who knew studying could be so much fun?

155
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
A boarding academy?

156
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,610
- Here you go. - Thank you.

157
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,980
- I gave you the whole row. - You shouldn't have.

158
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,780
My goodness.

159
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,050
- Enjoy! - Yes, thank you.

160
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,620
- Take care now. - You too.

161
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:28,590
(Lens Implant, Cost with insurance: 1,400 dollars)

162
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,570
- Yes, Mr. Jang. - Hey, Driver Kim.

163
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,480
I heard her family thinks she's at a boarding academy.

164
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,910
But she told the school she was going to a camp.

165
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,280
So she lied to her family and school and left the country ten days ago.

166
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,990
I'll have to ask Go Eun to check immigration records and CCTV.

167
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,760
Are you heading back now?

168
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,030
I'll head back after I meet one more person.

169
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,410
You have something to tell me, don't you?

170
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,510
No, I don't.

171
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,450
I think we have something in common.

172
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,160
We're both worried about I Seo.

173
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,450
(Student ID: Yun I Seo)

174
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,690
It's because of me.

175
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,790
It's my fault this happened to I Seo.

176
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,530
Can you tell me...

177
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,630
what happened?

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,770
Hey, I Seo.

180
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,980
This is so much fun.

181
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,450
- You gotta try this. - What is it?

182
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,250
I saw it on a webtoon site. You just pick 1 of the 2.

183
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,320
- I'm not really good at games. - This one's super easy.

184
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:41,160
I have to see a teacher. Play for me? I'll be right back.

185
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,430
(Odd)

186
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,770
(You've won 5 dollars!)

187
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,100
I won.

188
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,170
What a cute cat.

189
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,610
(You've won 5 dollars!)

190
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,610
(50 Dollars)

191
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,050
Hello?

192
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,020
Who is it?

193
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,360
Grandma, I told you about her. She's Ye Ji, the new transfer.

194
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,260
- What's this for? - You won it for us. Let's split it.

195
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,960
But I just won a game.

196
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,130
It feels a little weird getting real money for it.

197
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,940
- See? It's fun when you win, right? - Yes.

198
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,210
It is pretty amazing, though.

199
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,790
50 Dollars a day times 30. That's 1,050 dollars.

200
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,860
Hey, with this money, my grandma could get eye surgery!

201
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,690
- Now you can get surgery, Grandma. - Sweetie.

202
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,460
Don't you worry about me. Your grandma can see just fine.

203
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,900
- You know that's not true. - Yes! Hey, I won again!

204
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,000
- See? It really works. Wanna try? - Go on, you try it. Quick.

205
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,210
Okay, I'll do it.

206
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,770
Okay.

207
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,740
From the day...

208
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,810
she cashed out her points,

209
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,680
- Hey, I just... - she became desperate for points.

210
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,920
Between people, there is an island.

211
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,890
And I long to go to that island.

212
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,229
The island symbolizes the breakdown...

213
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,800
of social connection in today's world...

214
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,500
- and a sense of alienation. - When she won and received points,

215
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,110
she would feel so relieved.

216
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,870
(My Points)

217
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,480
But when she started losing, it would spiral out of control,

218
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,850
and she couldn't stand the anxiety.

219

(Recharge? Yes or No)

222
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,630
(Results in 3, 2...)

223
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,429
(Results in 1. Revealing results now)

224
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,370
(Even)

225
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,669
(5,000 lost)

226
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,000
Damn, I lost again.

227
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,670

230
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,610
Hey, Ye Ji. Do you know about this? The Advance Points Event?

231
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,450
Does it just give you points?

232
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,550
Actually, I already got the points from that event.

233
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,320
Really? I guess I'll get it too, then.

235
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,359

00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,500
All right. Okay, it's done.

239
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,110
Yun I Seo?

240
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,180
Who are you?

241
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,820
Well, aren't you a piece of work?

242
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,190
You were happy to take the money, but now you're playing dumb?

243
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,260
At least your friend paid up. What about you?

244
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,200
I'm sorry. I didn't know I had to pay it back.

245
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:14,370
You know now. Pay up.

246
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,680
I don't have any money right now.

247
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,540
- I'll pay you as fast as I can... - Hey.

248
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,550
What if I stab someone, then say, "Oops, my bad?" Would that work?

249
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,120
How about I stab you, then?

250
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,720
Knock it off. You're scaring her.

251
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,590
You got lucky my boss is here.

252
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,490
Whatever.

253
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,530
All right, kid.

254
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
I hear you're an orphan on a scholarship, right?

255
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,060
Huh?

256
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,300
Think you can keep that scholarship with a gambling debt?

257
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,140
I'll get a part-time job and pay you all back.

258
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,979
- She says she'll get a job. - A part-time job?

259
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,510
How can you pay it back with that?

260
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,850
- Sent. - Check your phone.

263
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,590
This is a referral code.

264
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,660
By next week, you're going to get five of your friends to sign up.

265
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,730
Five of them?

266
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,160
Open the game, hand them the phone.

267
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,630
Tell them you have to go to the faculty office.

268
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,300
That other girl. She was a natural at it.

269
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,240
(Odd: 5,000 Lost)

270
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,210
Gosh, I died again.

271
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,210
What game is that?

272
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,150
Can I see?

273
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,420
The cat's cute.

274
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,090
- Oh, a cat. - Can I try it?

275
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,600
Hey, I have to go to the bathroom. Take over for me while I'm gone.

276
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,670
Sure, go ahead.

277
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,050
What? Are you kidding me?

278
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,019
(Nyan-Nyan Jump Ladder)

279
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,460
Wow, look at all these games.

280
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,430
They look like simple little games but designed to make kids bet.

281
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,870
Kids are glued to their phones now. They're an easy target for crooks.

282
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,870
That "Advance Points Event" they got? It's actually a loan.

283
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,350
They split the 300 dollar loan into contracts under 100 dollars.

284
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,480
Why bother splitting it? Why not just one contract?

285
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:41,220
Because current law has no rate caps on loans of 75 dollars or less.

286
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,750
That's the exact loophole they're exploiting.

287
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,490
Am I seeing this right? It's 5,000 percent annual interest.

288
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,929
What? Wait. That's right. It says 5,000 percent.

289
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,030
How is that even possible?

290
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,730
A 300-dollar loan ballooned to 1,500 dollars...

291
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,430
in less than two weeks.

292
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,700
What is this?

293
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:02,210
Service fees, late fees, collection fees.

294
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,740
What kind of ridiculous charges did they tack on?

295
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,980
Do you think I Seo and Ye Jin know what kind of contract they signed?

296
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,750
Either way,

297
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,120
any loan contract with a minor is illegal anyway.

298
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,150
If it's illegal, isn't it void from the start?

299
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,220
You'd think they'd know that.

300
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,790
Until someone tells them,

301
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,030
it won't be easy for them to figure it out.

302
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,860
Why not?

303
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,930
Because the fact is, they did gamble.

304
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,869
- Hold it steady, will you? - Just stay still.

305
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,140
I'm gonna fall!

306
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,640
- Goodness. - Boss!

307
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,880
Hey, go give her a scare.

308
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,640
Let's see.

309
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,249
Number one. Y equals two to the minus x power...

310
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,319
is an exponential function.

311
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,890
Which is one-half to the x power, so it's an exponential function.

312
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,720
- So that's a true. - Answer the phone.

313
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,420
Why won't she answer the phone?

314
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,730
- Number 2. Y equals log base 5... - Why is it so noisy?

315
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,129
The exponent x moves forward, so it's x times log base 5 of 2.

316
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,730
Hey, is that noise headed this way?

317
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,700
Shouldn't we tell the teacher?

318
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,970
- So the answer is "false." - This is getting scary.

319
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,610
Grandma.

320
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,810
Grandma? Aren't you home?

321
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,810
Grandma, where are you?

322
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,950
- Is this the place? - There she is.

323
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,690
- What? What's going on? - It's raining. Let's hurry inside.

324
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,620
What is this?

325
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,200
It's a GPS. I had business here anyway, so this is perfect.

326
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,160
- Find the cash box. - The cash box? Okay, let's see.

327
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,270
- Found it. The cash box. - No, don't!

328
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,330
Let go.

329
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,139
- I told you to stop! - Out of my way. What's with her?

330
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,440
- This place is huge. - You really can't do this here.

331
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,640
- Let go. - I said no!

332
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,180
Let go of it.

333
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,880
- Please, just stop it! - Stop what?

334
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,050
After her, you're next.

335
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,690
Who do you think you are, not paying us back?

336
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,260
I'm calling the police.

337
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,830
The police? Go ahead. Call them!

338
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,500
- You were gambling, not us. - If you call the cops,

339
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,240
they'll arrest you, not us.

340
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,540
He's right.

341
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,510
Minors who gamble go to juvie, right?

342
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,980
What are you waiting for? Not calling? Why not?

343
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,820
- Don't you know the number? - I was wrong.

344
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,049
- We're sorry. We won't do it again. - I Seo.

345
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,659
Please, just let us go this once.

346
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,890
Forget the "please forgive us" crap. Just pay us the money.

347
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,330
Why can't you get it through your head?

348
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,700
Please don't call the police.

349
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,870
Please, don't.

350
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,030
We'll never do it again.

351
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,800
We promise it won't happen again.

352
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,740
Get up.

353
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,740
I said get up. Now.

354
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,480
What are you doing? You too, get up.

355
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,180
Okay.

356
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,250
Okay.

357
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,120
All right then.

358
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,890
Want me to tell you an easy way out?

359
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,460
Do you?

360
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
I'm...

361
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
I'm going to do what those guys said.

362
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,100
Hey, Yun I Seo.

363
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,130
You heard what those guys said.

364
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,200
If we go to Japan and work for just one month,

365
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,770
they said they'd wipe out our debt, interest, and all.

366
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,740
Do you have any idea what kind of job that is?

367
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,740
If it's dangerous, we can just come back.

368
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,320
Remember on our school trip? It only took three hours by boat.

369
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,620
Right?

370
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,060
This is all my fault.

371
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,200
I shouldn't have done it.

372
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,940
I never should've gotten into this in the first place.

373
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,910
What was I thinking?

374
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,080
I'm sorry.

375
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,180
It's all my fault.

376
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,690
I'm so sorry, I Seo.

377
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,200
Let's go together...

378
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,930
and pay it all off.

379
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,770
- I was leaving with I Seo then... - Ye Ji.

380
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,670
Dad.

381
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,939
My dad caught me and took away my phone,

382
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,850
so I had no way to get in touch with I Seo.

383
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,820
Come on.

384
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,650
How long are you gonna keep calling?

385
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,220
Stop trying to reach someone who's not coming.

386
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,630
So, what's it gonna be?

387
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,460
Let's just go already.

388
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
Take it.

389
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,240
There you go.

390
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,740
You have to clean up your own mess.

391
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,680
- Right? - Let's go.

392
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,850
It's all my fault.

393
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,020
This happened to I Seo because of me.

394
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,620
I was too scared to tell anyone.

395
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,990
Please, find my friend.

396
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,460
They just started playing a mobile game for fun.

397
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,330
They never imagined they'd fall into such a deep hole.

398
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,100
Of course not. How could they have predicted this?

399
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,770
I Seo didn't just fall into this.

400
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,580
She was dragged into it.

401
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,110
A mobile game that's easily accessible to anyone.

402
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,620
And when a classmate recommends it, you're less likely to suspect it.

403
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,120
They set a trap right inside that very game...

404
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,820
and just waited for someone to spring it.

405
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:05,190
And they're targeting minors who have no real-world experience.

406
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,360

All right.

Driver Kim, I'm sending you a video. Check it out.

423
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,350
It's footage of the guys who took I Seo at the port.

424
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,060
- If it's debt, why ship her abroad? - Exactly.

425
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,730
Debtors are usually harassed to pay. They don't get shipped off to Japan.

426
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,270
That's one of the things we need to figure out.

427
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,370
Sending them to Japan must be much more profitable for them.

428
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,080
The two guys who left the country with I Seo...

429
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,910
they came right back.

430
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,520
It's like they dropped I Seo off.

431
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,150
They could just be couriers.

432
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,690
If it's all right, can you let me handle it this time?

433
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,760

The two punks who took I Seo just came back alone.

452
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,930
Then shouldn't we grab those two and beat it out of them?

453
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,370
Go Eun already told us. If we make a rash move,

454
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,070
we could lose our only lead to find I Seo.

455
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,680
Seriously? How did I win again?

456
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,920

457
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,150

Turns out this company, Neko Money, is a franchise.

00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:20,160
All their funds, from the beginning, came from Japan.

00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,140
It was made in Japan.

00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,130
Yes.

531
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,140
Hey.

532
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,270
You made it.

533
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,180
- You weren't followed, right? - Of course not.

534
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,480
I'm the one who'd be doomed if I got caught.

535
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,580
We don't even know what the boss looks like.

536
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,280
Me neither.

537
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,290
By the way, today's girl is really cute.

538
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:26,920
Am I going by myself?

539
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,920
Hey, over here.

540
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,600
Driver's side is on the other side. This must feel weird. You okay?

541
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,670
Yeah, I'll be fine.

542
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,740
This feels weird.

543
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,180
All right, then.

544
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,810
Everyone, drive safe.

545
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,810
- Right turn. No, wipers. - All right.

546
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:15,400
I wonder why they're turning back right after they got here.

547
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,440
- Me too. - Because it's a cell network.

548
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,010
A cell network?

549
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,640
You mean the kind that's hard to trace?

550
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,280
After that car drops Go Eun off at her destination,

551
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,810
it'll disappear too.

552
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,550
So it's a kind of safety precaution.

553
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:33,120
But driving on the other side, it feels really strange.

554
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:36,530
I know. It feels like we're on the wrong side. Cars are coming for us.

555
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,830
We are driving on the wrong side!

556
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,799
- Hey, what are you doing? - I'm driving!

557
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,240
Come on, hurry up!

558
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,240
No, you have to change lanes again!

559
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,840
I'm not used to it, okay! I'm not used to it!

560
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,050
My body isn't doing what I want it to!

561
00:47:57,810 --> 00:47:59,050
- This is the right lane, right? - Yes.

562
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,720
That's right. Follow the arrows. You got it.

563
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,920
You want me to drive?

564
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,760
We need to move faster too.

565
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:03,610
(Life Reset)

566
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:19,190
Nice.

567
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,000
It's cute.

568
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:33,510
(Life Reset)

569
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:37,850
Please, come in.

570
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:41,450
Go.

571
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,660
Go Eun?

572
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,800
- Go Eun! - What? Why did it shut off?

573
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,630
Something in the building's probably blocking the signal.

574
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,700
Then what about Go Eun?

575
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,320
Hey, who the hell are you?

576
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,430
Hey!

577
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,760
We're not expecting a delivery today.

578
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,160
Driver Kim.

579
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,900
No, it's just...

580
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,170
They suddenly tried to take all my stuff.

581
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,270
What do I do?

582
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:09,840
It's okay. It's fine.

583
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:05,430
You know who this is, don't you? This girl.

584
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,100
Hey, wait!

585
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,740
You know who she is, don't you?

586
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,480
I just...

587
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,779
I just wipe the traces and identities...

588
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,480
of the people they send over!

589
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,520
I don't know what happens after that!

590
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:32,450
How do you pay them?

591
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,460
A car!

592
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,830
A car always comes to pick up the cash!

593
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,930
If you check out that car, you'll find what you need.

594
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,660
That's everything I know!

595
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,400
He must be talking about the car that dropped me off.

596
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:46,970
I got a picture of the license plate.

597
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:52,770
You know, Driver Kim is surprisingly good at Japanese.

598
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,910
And his accent is perfect.

599
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,310
I've confirmed the location. Sharing it now.

600
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:59,310
Hey! You can't just leave me tied up! Hey!

601
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,420
Thanks for your cooperation.

602
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,050
- Sir. - Sir.

603
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:39,390
- Sir. - Sir.

604
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:00,680
Please, help me.

605
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:03,450
Who did this to you?

606
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,650
Please let me go home. Please?

607
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,620
Who's in charge of this girl?

608
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,290
I am, sir.

609
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,220
It's not your fault.

610
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:49,790
The punishment...

611
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,630
is for the one who failed to do their job.

612
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,970
False hope...

613
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,900
is nothing but a noose around your neck.

614
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,570
The longer you hold on to it,

615
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:10,380
the tighter it will choke you.

616
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,090
The sooner you give up,

617
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,620
the more...

618
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,690
at peace you'll be.

619
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:40,439
Get her dressed.

620
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,440
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

621
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:13,710
What on earth are you guys doing here?

622
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:17,880
- What's with the crazy getup? - We're trying to lose weight.

623
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:21,850
This is a gym, right?

624
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,490
Find a butcher shop instead.

625
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,690
You fat fool.

626
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,800
Everything they do is so obnoxious.

627
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,740
You think they are yakuza?

628
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:46,040
He doesn't seem like your typical yakuza.

629
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,840
And how would you know that?

630
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,210
They don't have a single tattoo.

631
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:51,780
Plus, they look young.

632
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:56,620
- Still, this place is kinda creepy. - What is?

633
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,990
They've got all those huge talismans plastered on the entrance.

634
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,360
Is it haunted or something?

635
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,830
It says "No Unauthorized Entry."

636
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,730
Is there anything you don't know, Driver Kim?

637
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,500
I really thought they were talismans.

638
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,900
Go Eun?

639
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,370
Yes, Driver Kim.

640
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:15,100
If outsiders aren't allowed in, then who can get us inside?

641
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,770
Well...

642
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:18,440
An insider?

643
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,540
Bingo!

644
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,180
I got it.

645
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,450
But where are we going to find an insider?

646
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,020
Right there.

647
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,920
I don't know.

648
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,430
They don't exactly look like the welcoming type.

649
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,810
- Let's go. Boss will be here soon. - All right.

650
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,370
Wipe it off.

651
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,700
What?

652
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,240
These are my favourite shoes.

653
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:29,210
If you don't want to clean them, it's 500 dollars.

654
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:33,180
What? You're the one who stuck your foot out.

655
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,090
Cut the excuses!

656
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,220
What's all this commotion?

657
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,660
This guy just came out of nowhere.

658
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,270
You too. Cut the excuses!

659
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,400
Enough!

660
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,140
Don't cause a scene out here.

661
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:58,970
Bring that jerk upstairs.

662
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:01,880
If you're going to run, now's your chance.

663
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,580
Now that...

664
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,510
is a very original excuse.

665
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:09,550
- Drag that jerk upstairs, now! - Yes, sir!

666
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:16,090
I'll go myself.

667
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,030
Gosh, I wanna be like him.

668
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,400
He's amazing.

669
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,770
If I go on a diet... He took them out in five seconds.

670
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,410
More like three seconds.

671
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,410
We don't go easy on people who cause trouble in our territory.

672
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,550
And who exactly is it that won't go easy on me?

673
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:42,020
Because it sure doesn't look like it's you.

674
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:44,890
Where's your boss?

675
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:46,050
- What? - Goodness.

676
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,490
You think our boss would bother meeting a punk like you?

677
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,690
I guess you don't get to see him much either, right?

678
00:59:58,330 --> 00:59:59,330
Kageyama!

679
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,980
Today's his big debut,

680
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:10,380
and you're the perfect warm-up.

681
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:12,050
Five minutes.

682
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,250
Last five minutes,

683
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,550
you get a new pair of those precious shoes of yours.

684
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,820
If you don't,

685
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:23,260
you'll spend the rest of your life in a hospital bed.

686
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,940
Looks like you're raring to go. You're not scared?

687
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:54,460
Why so cold, guys?

688
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,740
Driver Kim will be all right, won't he?

689
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,480
What? Is it going to end this easily?

690
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,290
Stop it! Stop!

691
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,650
That idiot!

692
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,730
It got dirty.

693
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,780
But at the end of the day, what completes the look...

694
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:06,110
is the face.

695
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:24,570
Tell your boss.

696
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,170
To buy me new shoes,

697
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,770
and when he does,

698
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:35,740
have him call me here.

699
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:11,910
My deepest apologies.

700
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:14,420
Some psycho suddenly went on a rampage,

701
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,150
so we were unable to select the bodyguards.

702
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,250
He's the one who tore up the gym.

703
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:21,860
And why?

704
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,160
He claimed someone spat on his shoes.

705
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:41,840
Tell your boss.

706
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,880
To buy me new shoes,

707
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:47,980
and when he does,

708
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,120
have him call me here.
