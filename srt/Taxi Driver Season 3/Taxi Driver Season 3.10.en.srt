00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,890
(Lee Je Hoon)

2
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,930
(Jang Hyuk Jin, Bae Yoo Ram, Kim Eui Sung, Pyo Ye Jin)

3
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,980
(Taxi Driver 3)

4
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,179
(This drama is a work of fiction)

5
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,409
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

6
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,579
(in this drama are fictitious.)

7
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,780
(Children and animals were filmed under guidelines.)

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,450
(2002)

9
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,390
Next team, stand by.

10
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,630
Showtime in 20. Let's move it!

11
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,530
Okay. Hey, let's go!

12
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,930
Hey, get up there. Go.

13
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,060
Get up there. Just get on stage.

14
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,700
- Come on. - Manager.

15
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,600
- What? What's wrong? - My leg still really hurts.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,340
Don't start that before the show. Everyone here is in pain.

17
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,540
You're not the only one hurting. Let's go.

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,910
But it really hurts.

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,580
Stop with the excuses and let's just go.

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,910
No mistakes with the choreography today.

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,310
- We're moving. Please hurry. - Right.

22
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,450
I said, let's go!

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,120
Let's do this!

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,990
Don't be nervous. Go kill it out there.

25
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,490
That's it.

26
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,390
I'm so sorry. The stage isn't quite ready yet.

27
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,390
Just a moment. Hey! Kill the lights!

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,360
Close the curtain!

29
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,010
Hold on. Just a second. Do it again, hurry!

30
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,550
I'm really sorry. You're the Britel team, right?

31
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,420
Again, I'm so sorry. Just one moment.

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Hey! Who on earth was that?

33
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,860
Are you with us?

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,530
The surgery was a success.

35
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,200
About your leg...

36
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,070
Tissue necrosis had set in, so we had to perform an amputation.

37
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,510
If the pain gets too severe, just call a nurse.

38
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,550
- Did you check her VAS? - Yes, I did.

39
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,950
If she's in too much pain, give her a shot.

40
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,150
Doctor.

41
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,590
What am I going to do? Doctor.

42
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,430
What am I going to do?

43
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,460
What am I going to do?

44
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,390
I heard she fell off the stage during her debut performance.

45
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,220
That's just awful.

46
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Excuse me.

47
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,460
- Could you help me with this? - Sure.

48
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,340
What can I help you with?

49
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,870
Why are you looking at me like that?

50
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,280
I'm sorry?

51
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,550
Because you pity me?

52
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,420
No, that's not it.

53
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,290
Goodness.

54
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,020
Why on earth are you staring at me like that?

55
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,110
(Taxi Driver 3)

56
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,790
All right! I'm in the building's network.

57
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,620
Starting now.

58
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,060
Something tells me this is an adult entertainment club.

59
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,100
Which means the CCTV...

60
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,940
They've got CCTV, but they've kept it off the network.

61
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,810
Chief Park, open the electrical box in the hallway corner, please.

62
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,910
I'll patch you in right now.

63
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,540
You're connected. Take a look.

64
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,500
Connection established.

65
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,980
Kang Ju Ri is in one of the rooms,

66
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,850
and she's drinking with some guy?

67
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,420
What about the member who left the dorm?

68
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,190
Still nothing.

69
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,860
Then shouldn't you postpone their debut?

70
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,460
- Their debut is too soon to delay. - Isn't that a waste?

71
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,390
We should just focus on the girls we still have.

72
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,630
Rushing things and losing Ro Mi was a big enough mistake.

73
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,800
CEO Kang, you're really passionate about creating idols.

74
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,540
I must've debuted over 100 groups back in my broadcasting days,

75
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,580
but you never see them around anymore.

76
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,350
So is this about some unfulfilled dream of yours?

77
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,390
What was the group's name again?

78
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,560
Elements. Look out for them, will you?

79
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,300
And if I do,

80
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
what's in it for me, CEO Kang?

81
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,400
I'm sure I'll make it worth your while.

82
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm sure you know...

83
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,210
I'm an asset, not a liability, to you, Producer Lee.

84
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,840
Gosh. A gold card.

85
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,710
You've got a point there.

86
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,590
Is someone else here?

87
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,960
Come on.

88
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,860
Hurry. Get out!

89
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,330
No, the manager said they were closed today.

90
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,270
Hang on, I'll go check.

91
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,370
I think they're onto us. You need to hide now!

92
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,780
Someone must be here.

93
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,890
Who's there?

94
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,810
Driver Kim Do Gi! Gosh! What do we do?

95
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,720
Hey, the lights are coming on over here too.

96
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,790
What?

97
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,460
What?

98
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,660
Darn it. Wait.

99
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,900
Darn it.

100
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,370
Must be a faulty sensor. This is why I hate electronics.

101
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,610
Whatever, let's just go back and finish our drinks.

102
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,760
Man, my heart hasn't pounded like that in a while.

103
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,390
I think this is the place where Ro Mi was photographed.

104
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,530
- Yeon Min, you must start strong. - Okay.

105
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,100
Ji An, you're too slow.

106
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,150
Ji An, what's with that look on your face?

107
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,080
I'm sorry. I lost control of my breathing.

108
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,350
Wrong.

109
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,460
You should already be smiling before anyone has to ask.

110
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,430
Your smile doesn't have to be real. Otherwise,

111
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,560
the camera will pick up on how you're really feeling each time.

112
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,430
Yes, I'm sorry.

113
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,770
- I won't let it show next time. - That's more like it.

114
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
Huddle up, everyone.

115
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,769
Yeon Min, be decisive in the center.

116
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,410
- Cut that out. - Okay.

117
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:04,220
A Ra, when you belt, just go for it. And Soo Jung, you must smile more.

118
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,950
- It's your secret weapon. Got it? - Yes.

119
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,520
If you perform like that tomorrow, you'll be fine.

120
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
Now go out there and blow them all away.

121
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,430
- Okay. - Okay.

122
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,930
But, CEO Kang, aren't you coming with us?

123
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,070
My job was to get you to your debut.

124
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,500
Now, the rest is up to you.

125
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,469
From tomorrow, you can pay me back for a change, okay?

126
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,809
- Okay. - Now go get some rest, hurry.

127
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,140
- Okay. - Thank you.

128
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,210
- That's enough. Get inside, quick. - Thank you.

129
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,280
- No messing around. Go to bed. - Okay.

130
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,590
What are you doing?

131
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,620
Good work today, ma'am.

132
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,710
(If you're weak-willed enough to sneak out your phone, )

133
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,220
(then give up on being an idol right now.)

134
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,720
The person you called is unavailable You'll be sent to voicemail...

135
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,200
Ro Mi. We're debuting tomorrow.

136
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,670
I'm so sorry we're debuting without you.

137
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,940
It would've been so much better if you were with us.

138
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,050
The CEO said she's keeping your spot open.

139
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,050
Please come back to us, whenever you're ready.

140
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,220
I miss you, Ro Mi.

141
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,890
You're not going to write back this time either?

142
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,460
No, I'm not.

143
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,930
The members are probably hurt that you've never replied.

144
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,900
The four of them need to be seen as a complete group.

145
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,840
If I remind them there used to be five of us,

146
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,410
they'll just be constantly reminded of the empty spot.

147
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,410
And they'll already be so nervous on their debut day.

148
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,350
I see your point.

149
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,250
I hadn't even thought of that.

150
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,430
I really hope our Elements have a great debut tomorrow.

151
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,930
And that they really get to shine.

152
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,140
You'll be wishing for them too, right?

153
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,420
Remember? Kang Ju Ri was where we tailed the general director to.

154
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,820
And that's where Ro Mi's video was filmed.

155
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,720
So the director and Kang Ju Ri are working together?

156
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,990
But seeing her work so hard with the producer for their debut,

157
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,860
doesn't it seem like Kang Ju Ri is out of the loop?

158
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,870
So is this all the general director's doing?

159
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,800
So we're sure about the director, but not if Kang Ju Ri is with him.

160
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,040
Right. We just can't be sure.

161
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,580
I think we need to dig a little deeper..

162
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,010
What their real goal is.

163
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,750
Then you'll have to stick close to Kang Ju Ri tomorrow too.

164
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,250
That might be a problem tomorrow.

165
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,720
- It's the day of Elements' debut. - Right!

166
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,660
- You sound like their manager. - I am their manager.

167
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,190
The element that makes the world a happier place,

168
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,230
the manager of Elements.

169
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,830
What's this new side of you?

170
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,440
Ro Mi was also desperately hoping for the group's successful debut.

171
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,940
I know.

172
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,810
I'll have to work harder tomorrow.

173
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,610
As their manager.

174
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,350
Did you see him?

175
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,710
- He's so hot, right? - Yes!

176
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,950
Did you see him?

177
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,930
- How may I help you? - Oh, my gosh!

178
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,230
(Manager of Elements)

179
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,730
We're here for Elements' debut today!

180
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,480
Great. You chose the same return day as all the A-listers.

181
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,110
Thanks to you, everyone here knows you're here for your debut.

182
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,980
What was the name? Elephant, was it?

183
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,490
That's the animal!

184
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,720
We'll give our official greeting. Two, three.

185
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,859
- Hello. - Hello.

186
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,889
- We're the element that makes... - We're the element that makes...

187
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,930
- the world a happier place, - the world a happier place,

188
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,560
- Elements! - Elements!

189
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,259
- Elements? As in, the elements? - Yes.

190
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,630
- Okay, I'm looking forward to it. - We'll do our best!

191
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,340
Gosh. Shall we head inside?

192
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,770
- Where are you now? - I'll be there in ten.

193
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,710
- Hello, sir. - Hey.

194
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,250
- One, two, three. Hello! - Hello!

195
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Soo Jung.

196
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Yeon Min.

197
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,390
A Ra.

198
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
Ji An.

199
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,600
- Are you okay? - I have a bit of a headache.

200
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,640
We must map all the camera blocking during rehearsal,

201
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,400
so do it all exactly as prepared, right down to the ending pose.

202
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,070
If anything changes for the take, we can't shoot it.

203
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,610
We're starting right away, so please get ready now.

204
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,710
- Okay. - Okay.

205
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,710
I just need to use the restroom real quick.

206
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,279
- Ji An! - Ji An!

207
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,979
- Ji An! Are you okay? - Ji An.

208
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,620
- Ji An. - She's fine.

209
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,390
She can hear you.

210
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,590
Move. Get out of the way.

211
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,500
Gosh. What's wrong with her, right before the taping?

212
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,730
- Hey, give me a hand. - Yes.

213
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,670
Unbelievable.

214
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,140
Gosh, darn it.

215
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,640
I'm taking Ji An to the hospital. You, go postpone the rehearsal.

216
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
Ji An!

217
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,320
- Darn it. - Ji An will be okay, right?

218
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,080
Shouldn't we all go with her to the hospital?

219
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,220
- Get the next act ready. - I'll get Elements on standby.

220
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,060
Goodness.

221
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,790
- Elements, you're next. Let's go. - Oh, no, what do we do?

222
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,090
What do you mean? Is there a problem?

223
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Well...

224
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,160
One of the members just had to go to the hospital.

225
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,770
What? I told you, you can't be short a single member.

226
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,300
She'll be back right away. Please, push our spot back a little.

227
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,470
Don't be ridiculous!

228
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,410
What's taking so long to set up the next team?

229
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,280
One of the members is running a little late.

230
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,880
What? If someone's missing, how can we get the blocking right?

231
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,780
Is this show a joke? Just cut them and move on.

232
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,920
What are we going to do? They're going to cut us.

233
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,590
What are we going to do?

234
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,890
- But the girls practiced so hard. - I know.

235
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,090
- Oh, no, this can't be happening. - You heard him.

236
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,060
No, please. We have to perform today.

237
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,400
Please, I'm begging you.

238
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,830
I'm sorry, but Elements will not be performing due to a missing member.

239
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,240
Oh, no.

240
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,670
It's over. Everything's ruined.

241
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,480
We're completely done for.

242
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,410
Wait!

243
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,580
Elements that make the world a happier place.

244
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,050
- They're debuting today. - What? I thought we were one short.

245
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,590
We're all here.

246
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,560
You're sure you have everyone?

247
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,090
If not, you're in big trouble. Seriously.

248
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,930
We do!

249
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,430
- There's someone else? - Who?

250
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,029
- Could it be you, Go Eun? - What?

251
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,240
Hey, hurry and get ready.

252
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,500
But I'm not ready for this.

253
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,010
- What was it again? Seriously. - Just go out there. You'll be fine.

254
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,070
Go on, give it a shot.

255
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,140
Okay, let's start the rehearsal. Elements, 30 seconds to stage.

256
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,050
The members are on standby, right?

257
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,150
- Yes, they are... - Oh, gosh, my heart is pounding.

258
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,220
- I'm so nervous. - Oh, no.

259
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,590
They say they're ready, so we're heading in now.

260
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,990
- They're all on standby now. - Okay.

261
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,290
Let's roll.

262
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,600
- Lights! Okay, let's go. Go on. - Do we go on now?

263
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
Going in.

264
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,870
(Elements' Ji An)

265
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,580
(Elements' Ji An)

266
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,930
Wait, is that right?

267
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,530
Okay, ready. And three, two...

268
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,270
Action.

269
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,310
Camera 3, a tight shot on each member. Camera 3.

270
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,680
Okay.

271
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,120
Who is that?

272
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,719
A member went to the hospital,

273
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,160
so the manager is covering for her for the rehearsal.

274
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,860
What? But that guy...

275
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,930
He's good.

276
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:18,700
Square! Come forward. Spread out. And then the finger thing.

277
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,070
Again from the top. Okay! Get down.

278
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,009
Okay. Shush. Now, back.

279
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,740
Driver Kim, you're killing it.

280
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,880
Forward. Hold your spot. Ji An's spot, hold still.

281
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,080
- To the back. Yes. - Go Eun would be even better.

282
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,950
Back. You're making it hard for me to concentrate.

283
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,360
Ji An's blocking. Okay.

284
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,490
Who's that? A Ra, Soo Jung... A Ra?

285
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,600
Wait, how does he know the choreography so well?

286
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,930
Even if he was watching them from the sidelines the whole time,

287
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,670
actually doing it himself is a whole other story.

288
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,470
You have to hand it to Driver Kim. I'd believe he was one of them.

289
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
He's really good.

290
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,110
Guess he doesn't need my help after all.

291
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,310
Is this a co-ed group or what?

292
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,990
- Thank you. - Soo Jung.

293
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,060
- Thank you. - A Ra.

294
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,929
- Thank you. - Yeon Min.

295
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,770
- Thank you. - Manager Kim. Wait, about this...

296
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,520
This is the ending, right? Pull out from Ji An to a full shot.

297
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Ending shot!

298
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,270
Gosh. What's with the wink and the heart?

299
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Goodness.

300
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,940
I'm exhausted just watching him.

301
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,940
It does look exhausting.

302
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:08,580
That's a wrap on their rehearsal. See you at the taping. Great job.

303
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,950
(One Selected)

304
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,580
Chief Choi, what are you doing?

305
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,360
I'm saving it to watch whenever I'm feeling down.

306
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,090
- Watch what? Give it here. - Hey, send me a copy of that too.

307
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,260
- Yes, sure. - What? A copy? Come on. Stop it.

308
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:29,000
- Come on, let's watch it together. - No way! I own the copyright!

309
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,030
Come on.

310
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:32,400
- Go, Elements! - Go, Elements!

311
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,840
I swear I was about to starve to death.

312
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,580
What is all this?

313
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,720
Gosh, your accent...

314
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,050
What did I just say?

315
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,960
I guess I was so hungry, I wasn't thinking straight.

316
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,860
I was so worried about what we'd do if you couldn't make it.

317
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,370
Before you got here, I must've said "What do we do?" 300 times.

318
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,140
That's right. Our manager...

319
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,010
was a lifesaver. He covered for you perfectly during rehearsal.

320
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,940
I'm really sorry for making you all worry.

321
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,950
Thank you, Manager Kim.

322
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,250
From what I saw today,

323
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,420
Ji An, even though you were sick, you were tougher than anyone.

324
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,860
A Ra, you did a great job fighting off your hunger.

325
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,330
Yeon Min, you did an amazing job overcoming your anxiety,

326
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,230
and our Soo Jung,

327
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,560
your smile was the brightest of them all.

328
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,130
It was a truly perfect debut performance.

329
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,100
- We did it. - We did it.

330
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,010
And you, Manager Kim, were a picture-perfect...

331
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,910
ending fairy.

332
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,250
- Wasn't it this? No, this one. - Right. This one.

333
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,710
- This. - This one, right here.

334
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,479
- That's it. - Come on, let's eat.

335
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,780
- Let's eat. - Thank you for the food.

336
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,050
What do you think about Manager Kim as a replacement for Manager Song?

337
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,490
I'm not so sure.

338
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,160
He seems to be getting too close with the members.

339
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,600
When Manager Song gets back, shouldn't we just get rid of him?

340
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,600
He's a handful, Ju Ri. It's like talking to a brick wall.

341
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,140
Go get Assistant Manager Kim.

342
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,510
Okay.

343
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,410
All right.

344
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,180
Our very own Elements. Look at my little treasures.

345
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,980
Goodness.

346
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:30,290
Hey, you all worked hard today. Hey, Ji An. You were so light.

347
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,220
Don't go collapsing again. Eat up. Don't worry about it.

348
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,160
Just keep it under 500 calories.

349
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,700
You need to replenish your energy, so let's all eat up.

350
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,260
- Hey! - Okay!

351
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,230
Hey! Zip it, okay?

352
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,700
Hurry up and get out. She's looking for you.

353
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,040
You were looking for me, ma'am?

354
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,410
Thanks to you, their debut went perfectly.

355
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,050
- Good work. - Congratulations, ma'am!

356
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,480
Congratulations for what?

357
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,220
Elements just had their debut. And you're not happy about it?

358
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
So they've debuted.

359
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,900
So what changes now?

360
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,430
Do they suddenly become stars?

361
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Do we make a ton of money?

362
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,510
What do you think, Assistant Manager Kim?

363
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:27,510
Looks like she's testing Driver Kim Do Gi, doesn't it?

364
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,780
Gosh.

365
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,280
No matter what,

366
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,620
you just can't get emotionally invested.

367
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,830
- Just like you said. - Then,

368
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,530
are you saying I'm being sincere with those girls?

369
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,470
Do you know why I hired you?

370
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,050
I'm not sure.

371
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,320
I like your raw spirit. And you've got drive.

372
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,620
Most of all, you're so by-the-book.

373
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,920
You do whatever you're told, no questions asked.

374
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,960
I've learned that in life,

375
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,160
you have to get on the boss's good side

376
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,690
for everything to go well.

377
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,600
- Your money, your career. - Really?

378
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,670
If I told you to, could you even hit a woman?

379
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,370
Chief Park, it's go time! Go!

380
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,480
- Hurry! Go! - Me?

381
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,320
If you tell me to, I'll do anything.

382
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,220
Ji An will do.

383
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,990
Go on. Hit her.

384
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,230
This is no joke. The line...

385
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,340
Her poor self-control almost ruined the debut for the others.

386
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,110
What's wrong?

387
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,280
Did you get attached already? You can't bring yourself to do it?

388
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,490
I've already made myself clear.

389
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,130
If you give the order,

390
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
I will do it.

391
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,880
You're the punk who hit me last time.

392
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,820
Payback time!

393
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,100
- Sir, what are you doing? - Why did you get in my way?

394
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,770
Sir?

395
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,270
- What a complete psycho. - You can't do this in here, sir.

396
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,940
The boss is watching.

397
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,210
That's enough, everyone. Let's go.

398
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,040
Gyeong Su. Take care of this.

399
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,550
- Yes, of course. - But I haven't done what you asked.

400
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
Forget it.

401
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,880
Surprise!

402
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,150
Thanks for the cameo.

403
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
You should get that checked out.

404
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,230
- I'll bring the car around. - Okay, but wait a second.

405
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,130
The pen.

406
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,210
I guess you won't be needing this anymore.

407
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,810
Yes, ma'am.

408
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,090
Driver Kim, you're officially on the inside now.

409
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,700
You're back.

410
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,700
I've been thinking.

411
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,670
- Something's weird. - Come on. What is?

412
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,510
Why is it only me getting beaten up by Driver Kim?

413
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
Jin Eon.

414
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,550
This is when you need to reframe your thinking.

415
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,920
Reframe my thinking?

416
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,790
Don't think, "Why is it always me?"

417
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,950
Think, "Why am I the one he trusts?"

418
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,690
What?

419
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,060
I think he's onto something too.

420
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:40,430
Think about it. Whenever Driver Kim is in a tough spot,

421
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,270
the first person he seeks out...

422
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,840
is you, Chief Park.

423
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,940
- So that's it. - Yes.

424
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,909
So that's a good thing, then.

425
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,110
- Of course it is. - It's a great thing.

426
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,180
Here. Eat up. I got you a hamburger.

427
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,050
You did really great.

428
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,490
Gyeong Gu. This hamburger has no flavor.

429
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,460
- You take the wrapper off first. - Gosh.

430
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,980
I found this on the passenger seat.

431
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,910
- Sorry to trouble you. - It's no trouble, ma'am!

432
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,190
Spare me the details.

433
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,000
Box up the entire second row for me.

434
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,170
Let me see the purple one from the top row.

435
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,740
I'll have the rest boxed up for you.

436
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,310
Thank you.

437
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,280
I should get them a gift to celebrate their debut.

438
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,850
I'm sure the members will love their gifts.

439
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,220
No.

440
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,560
They're not for them. They're a gift to myself.

441
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,530
One pair for each of them.

442
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,940
When I was little, everyone used to tell me...

443
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,470
that I was destined to be a star.

444
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,940
But after my accident,

445
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,180
they all started looking at me with such pity.

446
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,350
Like I was the only person it had ever happened to.

447
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,060
Everyone has a downfall.

448
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,590
Anyone can fall from grace.

449
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,940
What's so darn entertaining that they have to keep staring?

450
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,370
It's irritating.

451
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,410
How pretty.

452
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:19,390
That was a great performance. Next up is a new girl group's debut.

453
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,920
Elements, with "Fly With Me."

454
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,389
- Let's check it out! - It's on!

455
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,430
- It's us. - It's finally us!

456
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,230
- Oh, my gosh. - My goodness.

457
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
I'm so nervous.

458
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,830
(Music Stage, Elements)

459
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:40,740
I should've eaten something. Don't I look like I'm starving?

460
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,450
You always look like that.

461
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,980
It'd have been better with Ro Mi.

462
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,350
Right?

463
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,820
- I know. - Tell me about it.

464
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,020
Hey, Soo Jung, you're on screen!

465
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,130
Time to settle up.

466
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,030
We'll start with Soo Jung.

467
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,930
Okay.

468
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Do Gi.

469
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,540
Start the car.

470
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,970
You're such a good dancer! We're total idols!

471
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,510
- I know. - We're not bad, right?

472
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,580
Guys, we're so good.

473
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,580
- We're so pretty. - Look, the camera loves us.

474
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,950
- Goodness! - We're actually good.

475
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,250
- We're good. - We're singers now.

476
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,050
(Music Stage, Elements)

477
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,760
- We're so pretty. - Just gorgeous.

478
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:41,440
Pay attention. The real training starts now.

479
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,870
Watch and learn.

480
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,050
Oh, okay.

481
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,220
Oh, my, Manager Kang!

482
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,020
- Oh, my. - You're laying it on a bit thick.

483
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,390
Our Kang Star is here! I had to run out to greet you.

484
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,130
All our VIPs only ask for Kang Star. What am I supposed to do?

485
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,730
Come on. That's a given. Of course.

486
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,270
It's not every day you get to meet a celebrity who just debuted.

487
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,270
The other managers keep asking me for my secret.

488
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,570
They say they can't get anyone, no matter how good the offer is.

489
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,010
And even if I told them my secret, could they pull it off?

490
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,380
They must start as trainees.

491
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,280
Give my place special treatment.

492
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,650
They've been waiting. Hurry up and come in.

493
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,920
Do Gi, stand by. You wait right here.

494
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,530
Hello.

495
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,730
Hello!

496
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,940
Sir, good to see you. It's been a while.

497
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,610
Geez, I'm pretty sure I'm younger, but he always calls me "sir."

498
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,270
Hey, pass me the chopsticks.

499
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,580
Yes, sir.

500
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:58,480
I've got to know my place. You'll always be "sir" to me.

501
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,620
Shut it.

502
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,820
I was told you wanted to see me?

503
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,490
I'm not very exciting company, you know.

504
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,460
Come on. The madam told me everything.

505
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:18,170
She said to meet that new idol, you're the one I need to impress.

506
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,640
You can't force romance, you know.

507
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,540
Impressive.

508
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,140
Ju Ri, I already put in a good word for you.

509
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,310
What was the name of that group that just debuted again?

510
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,880
It's Elements.

511
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,950
Elements. Here, take a look.

512
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,690
The brand-new, hot-off-the-presses girl group, Elements.

513
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,260
It really is her.

514
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,040
What is this?

515
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,790
This was the plan all along.

516
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,820
From the very beginning...

517
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,860
There she is!

518
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,259
Hey, she's gorgeous, right?

519
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,530
After you showed me that photo,

520
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,570
I told you I had to meet her! You remember, right?

521
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,470
Look, I'm not normally this pushy,

522
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,940
but I'm kind of in a hurry today.

523
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,580
Is there any way I could meet her today?

524
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
No.

525
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,550
Okay, then. How about tomorrow?

526
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:41,580
If you're that desperate, you can just call an escort.

527
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,060
That's why our Kang Star here is giving you this sneak peek.

528
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,260
Crushing a dream that hasn't yet tasted despair...

529
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,100
takes more effort than you'd think.

530
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,840
I don't know what she means.

531
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,180
So when can I meet her?

532
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,850
I'll arrange a meeting no later than the end of the week.

533
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,220
She needs time to open up on her own terms.

534
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,190
That's a new one. How do you open up your heart?

535
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,230
- How do you do that? - Very carefully.

536
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:27,930
You idiot.

537
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:34,440
To ruin a dream they worked so hard for...

538
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,570
is the last thing those girls want.

539
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,640
Hey, CEO Kang, I just came in.

540
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,350
Look who it is.

541
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,250
Oh, right!

542
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,050
You're the "heart" guy.

543
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,090
Hey, you're a pretty good dancer.

544
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:52,960
Your form is like ballet.

545
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,130
CEO Kang.

546
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,230
Assistant Manager Kim.

547
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,730
- That's Assistant Manager Kim? - Yes.

548
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,940
He's a good dancer.

549
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,910
- The footage looked good. - Time to pay up.

550
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,250
It's their debut and final stage all in one. It has to look good.

551
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,120
The girls did great. They're good singers and dancers.

552
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,059
They'll just wash out soon after their debut anyway.

553
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,190
I guess so.

554
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,660
How many idol groups debut monthly? A ton, right?

555
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,469
Rather than walk away with nothing,

556
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:40,200
isn't getting tips at least better?

557
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,700
CEO Kang.

558
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:46,540
You should cut me in on the action later on, okay?

559
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,010
To give the girls who get sold off the second they debut...

560
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,010
one live performance, I have to grease a lot of palms.

561
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,020
This is nothing. This is just my pocket money.

562
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,160
Kang Ju Ri never intended to give them a proper debut.

563
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,500
Not from the moment she recruited the trainees.

564
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,540
So their training wasn't to prepare for a debut as idols,

565
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,470
but to make them "entertain" clients? Can you believe that?

566
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:21,080
By sabotaging the "debuted" idols, Kang Ju Ri...

567
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,450
was making up for her own failures.

568
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,280
By cruelly destroying others' dreams like this?

569
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,320
She used their desperation to save the dream they'd worked so hard for,

570
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,930
and set a perfect trap, leaving them with no other choice.

571
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,560
All by creating a fake agency called Yellowstar.

572
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,360
Go teach them a lesson right now.

573
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:45,900
That's right. We can't let those jerks escape.

574
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,470
Okay. Now that the truth is out, it's time for the next step, right?

575
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:54,110
Do Gi, I want you to go meet Ro Mi.

576
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,750
Because it's the client's choice, not ours.

577
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,490
The girls did great. They're good singers and dancers.

578
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,490

Ro Mi, no matter what happens, let's make sure we debut together.

597
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,630
Yes. We definitely will.

- we must repay them a hundredfold. - A hundredfold! I love it!

700
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:36,180
- I'm your host for today, MC Hyuk. - And I'm Yoon.

701
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,590
- That's right, everyone. - The madam told me everything.

702
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,820
She said to meet that new idol,

703
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,220
- you're the one I need to impress. - Gosh.

704
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:44,830
- If you're that desperate, - What?

705
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,860
- you can just call an escort. - What is this?

706
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,060
Turn it off, quick!

707
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,300
Crushing a dream that hasn't yet tasted despair...

708
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,170
takes more effort than you'd think.

709
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,270
Time to pay up.

710
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,470
The footage looked good.

711
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:01,940
Hey! Are you trying to ruin the live show? I said, turn it off!

712
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,050
It's their debut and final stage all in one. It has to look good.

713
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:07,880
The girls did great. They're good singers and dancers.

714
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:10,190
Hey, why won't the audio cut out? Why won't it cut out?

715
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,619
- They'll just wash out soon... - Who is it?

716
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,120
- after their debut anyway. - Who played that?

717
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:17,260
How many idol groups debut monthly? A ton, right?

718
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:19,329
- Who on earth is it? Turn it off! - Rather than walk away...

719
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,330
with nothing, isn't getting tips at least better?

720
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,170
- And action! - This can't be happening. No!

721
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,330
You should cut me in...

722
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,070
- on the action later on, okay? - Do you know...

723
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,870
- what it took me to get here? - To give the girls who get...

724
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,339
- Do you know what it took me? - sold off the second they debut...

725
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,740
one live performance, I have to grease a lot of palms.

726
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,409
- Where's that sound coming from? - This is nothing.

727
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:39,850
- This is just my pocket money. - Why won't it turn off?

728
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,360
They'll just wash out soon after their debut anyway.

729
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:56,670
Rather than walk away with nothing, isn't getting tips at least better?

730
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:58,900
Hey!

731
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,450

- Let go of me! - Ms. Kang!

741
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,390
Everybody, stop filming! Don't follow her!

742
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,020
Get her!

743
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,860
- Ms. Kang Ju Ri! - There she is! Ms. Kang Ju Ri!

744

00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,899

00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,240
- Stop the car! - Get out of the way!

747
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:10,270
CEO Kang, give us your comment!

748
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,980
Don't you have anything to say?

749
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,180
Ms. Kang Ju Ri!

750
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:25,519
It's confirmed that CEO Kang Ju Ri of Yellowstar...

751
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,890
illegally filmed her agency's idols...

752
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,360
and used the videos to blackmail them for sexual favors.

753
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:35,600
The scandal with illegal contracts and unpaid wages for idols...

754
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,000
was also masterminded by CEO Kang...

755
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:18,709
- There she is! - She's out!

756
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:22,510
Ms. Kang Ju Ri! Are the rumors true?

757
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,850
Ms. Kang Ju Ri! Did you blackmail them yourself?

758
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:27,750
Ms. Kang, is it true you filmed your idols...

759
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,880
and blackmailed them?

760
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:41,330
The person you called is unavailable You'll be sent to voicemail...

761
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,700
This is driving me crazy.

762
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,649
Ms. Kang Ju Ri, wait!

763
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:05,220
Ms. Kang, using sponsors as bait,

764
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:06,749
did you extort money from the wealthy?

765
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,720
- Hey! - Ms. Kang Ju Ri!

766
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,729
Did you profit by forcing your idols...

767
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:11,860
- to work in adult entertainment? - Ms. Kang.

768
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:15,030
- Give us one comment, Ms. Kang! - Open the door!

769
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,760
- Come on. - Ms. Kang!

770
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:17,830
The way down!

771
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,700
(Stairwell)

772
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:21,570
Ms. Kang Ju Ri, give us your comment!

773
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:23,500
- Darn it! - Ms. Kang!

774
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,820
Assistant Manager Kim.

775
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,750
Come and get me. I can't get down from here,

776
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:40,860
and I have nowhere to go.

777
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:45,690
I'm on the rooftop. Come get me.

778
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,460
But I'm already at the top.

779
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:06,450
So, how does it feel to have your big debut?

780
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,790
Assistant Manager Kim?

781
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,220
To make you a star,

782
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,590
I've decided to become your new manager.

783
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,100
What?

784
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:26,270
You did all of this?

785
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,240
But why would you do this?

786
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,940
Why?

787
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:32,670
Don't tell me...

788
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,410
you're frowning.

789
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:37,650
You're supposed to be smiling.

790
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,950
As if how you really feel matters at all.

791
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,390
Or am I wrong?

792
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,520
Or does it not matter, since you'll be forgotten anyway?

793
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,460
You scum.

794
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:51,630
Hey!

795
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,000
Hey!

796
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,040
Everyone starts out with pure passion.

797
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:05,010
And anyone can fail.

798
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,080
But that doesn't mean it's a downfall.

799
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,280
Even if you stumble today,

800
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,550
you can get back on your feet tomorrow.

801
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:16,950
Don't make me laugh.

802
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,520
You're the one...

803
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:23,220
who's been spiraling after just one failure.

804
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,800
Those girls...

805
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,030
Do you really think they'll ever make it?

806
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,470
Who's even going to remember them?

807
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,740
At least I'm helping them make some money.

808
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,610
So what's the problem?

809
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,110
What's your problem?

810
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:43,810
Hey.

811
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,480
How long do you think their shelf life is?

812
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,260
What are you doing?

813
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,430
Are you filming me right now?

814
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,340
Hey!

815
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:10,670
Hey. Stay back.

816
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,880
Stop filming.

817
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:15,980
Stay away.

818
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:19,780
No!

819
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:24,750
Stay away.

820
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:28,260
I can't move. No!

821
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,890
Stop filming! No.

822
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:38,000
Hold on tight.

823
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:25,380
Don't you ever...

824
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,680
give up.

825
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:46,800
No.

(Deluxe Taxi)

827
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:40,090
I can't thank you enough.

828
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:42,760
It's not over yet.

829
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,230
How to push forward with the members waiting for their leader...

830
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,330
That's where it starts now.

831
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,140
Right.

832
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,940
They must be waiting for you. You should go.

833
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,340
Okay.

834
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,080

- Are you sure? - I don't know.

837
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:17,990
What are we going to do now?

838
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,990
We have to stick together. We just debuted.

839
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,290
- What else? - Seriously...

840
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:24,930
We have to keep going.

841
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:27,730
What are we going to do?

842
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:29,130
Ro Mi.

843
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:37,539
- Ro Mi, where have you been? - Ro Mi!

844
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:40,810

845
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:44,610
- I'm so sorry. - We were so...

846
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:47,820
- I'm so glad you're back. - It's okay.

847
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,080
- We're glad you're back. - We missed you.

848
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:51,090
Thank goodness.

849
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,090
You made the right choice.

850
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,120
- It's so good to see you. - We missed you so much.

851
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,790
Now we're all back together.

852

(Ibiga Jjamppong Restaurant)

853
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,300
This looks delicious.

854
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:15,240
What? How can we not drink with all this great food before us?

855
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,210
Go Eun, you're not drinking?

856
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:19,680
- No, I'm not. - Why not?

857
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:21,680
She doesn't have a glass.

858
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,320
Were you going to drink all by yourself?

859
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:28,060
Of course. You have to have a drink with a good meal.

860
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,120
I'll have one too, then.

861
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,659
- Looks like all the food is here. - Yes, sir.

862
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,400
- Mr. Jang, would you like a drink? - Of course. I've got to have one.

863
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:42,370

Enjoy, everyone.

867
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:57,180
The foundation of Chinese cuisine is jjamppong. It has to be good.

868
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,920
Gosh, it's so chewy and addictive. This is a must-order.

869
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:03,760
- How is it, Driver Kim? - It's really good.

870
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,330
It's got a nice kick.

871
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,170
The more I drink this broth, the more I want.

872

877
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,790
By popular demand. You're talking about them, right?

878

I never get tired of this song.

883
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:36,050
- I already joined their fan club. - I already did too.

884
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,790
- What? - So did I.

885
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:40,890
Seriously?

Hello, Mr. Hero.

897
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:09,370
Can you just tell me exactly where and who you bought it from?

898
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:13,769
- Looking to buy a bicycle. - ID, Fishing King.

899
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,040
All of the posts posted by that jerk's ID...

900
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:17,949
I went through and reported them all.

901
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:19,810
Then he contacted me.

902
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:21,449
Apologies for the late introduction.

- Eat your noodles. - Give me my money, you wench.

905
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,690
As for my instruction, I'll replace it with what will happen from now.

906
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,120
He's using a burner phone and a ghost account.

907
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:32,390
- It's all fake. - But one thing is real.

908
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:34,630
The police? They can't catch me.

909
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:36,430
His voice.

910
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,030
Where is he right now?
