- Ignoring my calls now, are we? - Why did you suddenly call me?

18
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,459
I called you several times, but you kept looking at your phone.

19
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,030
What else was I supposed to do? I had to call you.

20
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,300
- What is it? - I'm making coffee. Want some?

26
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,030

Great, you made it. I don't need to check it, right?

34
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,490
Right. Since I came myself, the price is firm.

56

I listened to it a lot when I was in the army.

57

It was the first song I learned all the choreography for.

58

was to become an idol star.

64
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,440
it's as if it's telling me...

65

that it's okay to have that dream.

67
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,520
cheers them on,

68

106

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,390
You're relentless.

183
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,319
(Submission Complete, Thank you for using our service.)

184
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,390
What?

185
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Hello?

186
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,830
Who is this? What?

187
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:34,930
Yes.

188
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,070
Okay.

189
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,840
What is it?

190
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,380
Ji An. What do we do?

191
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,810
What? Just tell me!

192
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,280
They saw the video we submitted last week.

193
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,820
They want us to audition in person!

194
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,190
- Oh, my gosh. - This is crazy!

195
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,630
Look at this.

196
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,400
- Gosh, I'm so nervous. Oh, my gosh. - Gosh. Hey.

197
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,940
What if we become like them someday? That's insane.

198
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,740
- I can't believe it. - Seriously.

199
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,540
Hey, hold on! You remember the routine, right?

200
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,380
- Let's run through it real quick. - And go!

201
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,250
- It'll never happen - It'll never happen

202
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,220
- But my heart fluttered a little - But my heart fluttered a little

203
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,380
You've practiced a lot.

204
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,650
- Thank you. - Thank you.

205
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,580
Look at how stiff they are.

206
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,920
They were so fluid when they were dancing.

207
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,520
You can relax. You did so well that I'm tempted to pick you.

208
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,290
Come closer.

209
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,260
But you're both high school seniors. Shouldn't you be studying?

210
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,100
Just you know, if you sign with us, you have to drop out.

211
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,570
You can't do both school and work.

212
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,570
It's the same at other agencies, but training alone takes all day.

213
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,180
Take a few days and let me know your decision.

214
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,380
This is your life we're discussing, so think it over carefully.

215
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,880
I'll drop out.

216
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,620
I want this so much, I'm willing to give it my all.

217
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,360
- I'll drop out too. - Goodness.

218
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,630
Go home and talk with your parents.

219
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,100
And if you still feel the same way,

220
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,970
pack your bags and come back next week.

221
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,570
Oh, my gosh!

222
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,540
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

223
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,710
Lucky you. You must be thrilled.

224
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,310
- This is amazing. - My gosh.

225
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,810
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

226
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
We did it!

227
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,450
Mom, you have to listen to me!

228
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Quiet! I'm busy, don't make a scene. Sir, I'm here.

229
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,360
There you go. Enjoy your meal.

230
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,100
Hey! You think anyone can become an idol?

231
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,300
- Hey, there! Number one, Sapphire. - Yes.

232
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,899
- Sapphire! - I told you.

233
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,330
You can sing your heart out here.

234
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,269
Why do you talk to me like that?

235
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,610
I'm risking my entire life for this!

236
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,580
Oh, please. "Your life"? What do you even know about life?

237
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,539
Gosh, I'm busy, so just go. Okay?

238
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,350
Go eat, then hit the books. Got it?

239
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,550
Hello? Yes. How many are in your party?

240
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,330
Lee Ro Mi!

241
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,770
How did it go with your mom?

242
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,110
You know her. She's always busy.

243
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,269
What about you? How did the talk with your parents go?

244
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,080
How do you think it went?

245
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,080
Hey, you know what I told my mom when I stormed out with my suitcase?

246
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,120
- What did you say? - That when I'm on TV,

247
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,150
I screamed I'd let her put my face on her pig's feet restaurant sign!

248
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,990
Gosh.

249
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,730
You should do it too. Promise her your face for her karaoke sign.

250
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,030
- Go on, scream it! - Be quiet.

251
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,370
What's the big deal?

252
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,930
- Are you nuts? Why? - What?

253
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,800
(Trainee Contract, Lee Ro Mi)

254
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,950
(Training and activity costs)

255
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,290
(Costs are based on 2023 rates and can change.)

256
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,750
(1. Dance lessons: 500 dollars per hour)

257
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,830
- Excuse me. - What is it?

258
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,160
Do we have to...

259
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,060
pay these fees ourselves?

260
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,300
I'm sorry,

261
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,700
but we don't have any money.

262
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,040
Of course you don't.

263
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,540
You're students. Where would you get money?

264
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,380
We'll cover everything listed there for now.

265
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,750
We're investing in your dreams, though your future is uncertain.

266
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,750
But of course, it's not free.

267
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,220
You'll have to pay it back later.

268
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,020
After you successfully debut and become stars.

269
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,160
You understand what I'm saying, right?

270
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,400
- Yes. - Yes.

271
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,030
If you understand, then sign them.

272
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,310
(Name: Lee Ro Mi)

273
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,520
Well, well. If it isn't our passionate GED candidates.

274
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,280
- Hey. - Hello.

275
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,860
Starting today, the five of you will be training together.

276
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,520
You'll be sharing a dorm too.

277
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,390
Really?

278
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,930
So the whole team is finally together.

279
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,100
Now we just have to nail our debut prep.

280
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,440
Ro Mi will be the leader for now since she's the oldest.

281
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,270
Manager Song will explain the rules. Listen carefully so you know them.

282
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,640
- Okay. - Let's do this!

283
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,610
- Shall we head to the dorm? - Yes.

284
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,980
All right, this way.

285
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,020
Let's go.

286
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,200
- Girls, grab your bags quickly. - Okay.

287
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,140
- Should we help her with that? - What is it?

288
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,910
- My suitcase... - I see.

289
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,980
Here.

290
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,790
Great.

291
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,730
All right, let's get a focus clap!

292
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,300
Focus! Come on, let's focus.

293
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
Let's get a focus clap!

294
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,930
- Focus! - There we go.

295
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,040
All right. You need permission every time you leave.

296
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,440
Your phones and any internet devices must be turned in after 8pm.

297
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,539
No personal activities allowed except for work schedules.

298
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
Also...

299
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,450
Doesn't it feel like we've already debuted?

300
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,120
- It doesn't feel real at all. - This is insane.

301
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,180
Hey.

302
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,050
- Let's zip our lips. Zip! - Zip!

303
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,960
You'll weigh in every morning and report to me.

304
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,330
Personal diaries or notes may be checked during room checks.

305
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,630
Also, any complaints, grievances, or any stress you have...

306
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,370
must never be shared outside. What about your parents?

307
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Absolutely not.

308
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,270
- Understood. - Understood.

309
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,410
Manager Song.

310
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,210
- Are you a Thinker Type? - Yes, when I work.

311
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,880
Why are you being so cold to them?

312
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,680
You're killing the vibe for our angels here.

313
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,420
Listen up, girls.

314
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:12,560
Worst rumors are usually started by close friends or even parents.

315
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,290
What if you're careless and tell all just because you're close?

316
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,560
It'll come back to stab you in the back.

317
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,230
- Gosh. - That would hurt, wouldn't it?

318
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,700
From this moment on,

319
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,810
you're BLACKPINK and aespa to me.

320
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,610
If you really want to be idols,

321
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,910
you need to start living like idols right now.

322
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,220
- Understood? - Yes, sir!

323
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,960
Was I a little too icy?

324
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,830
- Did you start the car? - Oh, right.

325
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,460
Everything felt so new and wondrous.

326
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,570
It all felt like a dream.

327
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,600
Five, six, seven, go.

328
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:04,210
One, two, three, four, five, six, hit it and two.

329
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,310
Every day was grueling,

330
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,780
but my team and I,

331
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,180
worked harder than anyone else.

332
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,320
Push harder!

333
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,920
And so, one month passed.

334
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,120
- Three! - Go on!

335
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,390
Two months.

336
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
Five months.

337
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,000
You're in a girl group, and you weigh over 40kg?

338
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,770
What, you want the fans to call you pigs?

339
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,510
- We're sorry. - Excuse us.

340
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,780
Excuse me for a moment.

341
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,520
Hey, you! Answer me. Why don't you answer me?

342
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,950
I said, do you want to be called pigs?

343
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,220
- We're sorry. - We're sorry.

344
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,690
Until you all get down to 38kg,

345
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,230
you're all on a strict diet. Understand?

346
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,060
- Yes. - I can't hear you!

347
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,160
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

348
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,070
A Ra.

349
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,410
Oh, Ro Mi.

350
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,650
What am I going to do?

351
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,950
Ro Mi.

352
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,950
I'm so hungry.

353
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,190
Please, you have to help me.

354
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,620
It's okay.

355
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,560
Just eat something. We can work out extra later.

356
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,770
I...

357
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:45,780
will not eat the banana.

358
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,480
For over a year,

359
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,050
we trained like our lives depended on it.

360
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,760
(Dance Studio)

361
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,670
Hey, everyone, focus!

362
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,430
Soo Jung, kill the music.

363
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,870
Girls.

364
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,740
The CEO wants to see you.

365
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,350
Everyone, follow me.

366
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,950
- Okay. - Okay.

367
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,780
- Elements! - Elements!

368
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,420
So? Do you like it?

369
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,190
- Yes, I love it. - Me too.

370
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:12,200
We'll increase vocal practice soon, so get into peak physical shape now.

371
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,830
- Okay. - No. Don't cry.

372
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,870
I'm putting everything on the line and going all-in on you.

373
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,010
It's not just me, but the future of our company...

374
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,210
is riding on you, Elements.

375
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,080
So instead of you crying like this,

376
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,550
show me you're growing every day. Okay?

377
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,350
- Yes. - Yes.

378
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,420
I don't want to see you crying. Get out. Go and practice.

379
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,760
- Okay. - Okay.

380
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,530
Hey, girls. The CEO is pretty cold, right?

381
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,330
Don't worry about it.

382
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,770
She just talks like that. Deep down, she was moved too.

383
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,840
- You're still here? - Hey, she's asking why you're here.

384
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,410
I'm sorry.

385
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,610
- Come on, let's go practice! - Okay.

386
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,280
- Thank you. - Sure.

387
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,980
- Thank you. - You got this!

388
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,160
An unstoppable game, no matter what anyone says

389
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,320
Let's get it on

390
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,290
Unbreakable passion, fly with me

391
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,310
It felt like the debut I dreamed of was right around the corner.

392
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,690
Hey, everyone. Great work at practice today.

393
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,290
- Thanks! - Wait!

394
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,060
- What's this? - What is this?

395
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,090
- I can't believe it! - It's my snack box.

396
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,930
- Where did you get these? - They look delicious.

397
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,800
Everyone, just take a little bit...

398
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,030
Hide it...

399
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,040
And then...

400
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,870
Good work, everyone. Ro Mi.

401
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,370
You should get changed and come out.

402
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,110
- Okay. - That was the day it happened.

403
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,750
Yes, everything's all set. We'll be leaving shortly.

404
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,390
- Yes, just a moment. - Manager Song.

405
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,960
Ro Mi, we're late. Let's hurry.

406
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,390
Where are we going?

407
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,890
The recording studio. CEO Kang says you're recording a solo.

408
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,430
- All of a sudden? Just me? - Yes.

409
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,700
CEO Kang is waiting for you there, so ask her yourself.

410
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,130
Okay.

411
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,570
Get in.

412
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,079
You're recording when we arrive, so warm up your voice on the way.

413
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,150
Oh, okay.

414
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,430
So you're saying you woke up in a strange place?

415
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,630
You don't even remember how you got there?

416
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,470
Yes.

417
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,810
So where was it?

418
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,610
I really don't know.

419
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,480
Don't you have anything to say?

420
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,650
On the way to the studio,

421
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,790
Ro Mi felt sick and asked to pull over.

422
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,460
So I let her out and waited.

423
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,860
But you never came back, so...

424
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,330
- So I asked to pull over? - You did! Darn it.

425
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,700
Ro Mi.

426
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:55,440
You're not on a crash diet, are you? Using some weird method?

427
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,910
No, that's not it, CEO Kang.

428
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,210
But still, how can you not remember anything?

429
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,180
I also...

430
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,820
don't know.

431
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,520
Has anything like this ever happened before?

432
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,330
Have you ever just passed out like that?

433
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,530
No.

434
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,930
How do you even take care of yourself?

435
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,540
Ro Mi.

436
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,370
Ro Mi!

437
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,710
Do you think you're debuting all by yourself?

438
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,250
CEO Kang, take it easy on her.

439
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,650
We should just be glad she's back in one piece.

440
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,550
Get out of my sight.

441
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,050
- Get out. - Hey.

442
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,320
Ro Mi, get up.

443
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,330
Ro Mi, try not to worry too much.

444
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,730
I'm sorry.

445
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,670
And then,

446
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,570
one day, she called me in again.

447
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,409
Hold it tighter. Ro Mi, you were late. Let's go again.

448
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,850
Get it together! Let's start from there again.

449
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,150
Let's go again. Soo Jung, move up a little more.

450
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,890
Ro Mi, hit the center with more confidence. Ready. Five, six.

451
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,190
I can fly high. Hit the pose, don't be late.

452
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,989
Ro Mi, focus here. Where are you looking? Again.

453
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,260
Excuse me. Have them keep practicing the lead-in to the chorus.

454
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,300
Ro Mi, come with me for a second.

455
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,400
Ro Mi.

456
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,640
Yes.

(Girl Group's Shocking Antics)

460
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,260
(What is she doing at a bar before her debut?)

461
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,500
They kept it private and sent it only to the General Manager.

462
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,200
They're threatening to go public once Elements debuts.

463
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,870
- CEO Kang, I... - I'll be frank with you.

464
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,310
I can't stop this.

465
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:16,950
I honestly don't know anything about this.

466
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,050
How are we supposed to fix this if you keep saying you don't know?

467
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,490
Then...

468
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,650
what am I supposed to do?

469
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,220
Why are you asking me?

470
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:36,930
But...

473
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,900
General Manager.

474
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,740
Honestly,

475
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,200
I don't know what to do with this either.

476
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,839
I considered calling the police,

477
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,840
but all the blood, sweat, and tears you put in...

478
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,049
will be wasted.

479
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,210
Not just for you, but for the other members too.

480
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,120
And the company will take a huge hit.

481
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,920
What should I do? Is there really nothing I can do?

482
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,390
It's not like...

483
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,260
there's no solution at all.

484
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,500
What kind of solution is it?

485
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,230
Those jerks...

486
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,200
made an offer.

487
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,170
An offer?

488
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,870
They'll keep the video from the media. But in exchange...

489
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,240
Darn it! Those childish scums.

490
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,120
If you agree to "date" him for a year...

491
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
"Date" him?

492
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,660
Ro Mi, look at me.

493
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,830
I'm not speaking as Jeong Gyeong Su, but as your general manager.

494
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,000
You're the leader of Elements.

495
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,370
You need to be level-headed about this.

496
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,570
If you can't debut now, the team is finished.

497
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,310
As per company policy, you'll owe a cancellation fee.

498
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,170
Do you want that for everyone, not just you?

499
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,410
No.

500
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,579
Right? I don't want that either.

501
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,450
Let's be real. You, drinking?

502
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,580
At that hostess bar?

503
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,050
Gosh.

504
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,060
There's no need to overthink this.

505
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,100
Just think about how badly you wanted this.

506
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,470
Your debut is just around the corner.

507
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
You never know.

508
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,770
That scum...

509
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,980
might just become your sponsor for life.

510
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,590
Think about it.

511
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,460
Think it over and let me know.

512
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,000
There was...

513
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,810
nothing...

514
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,180
I could do.

515
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,360
I couldn't even tell the others the truth.

516
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,860
Just because of me,

517
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,560
I couldn't ruin everything for them.

518
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,030
Ro Mi.

519
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,140
Gosh.

520
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,570
This must be so hard for you.

521
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
All right.

522
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,550
You don't have to go.

523
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,950
As a general manager... No.

524
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:18,790
Look, I'm going to talk to you like you're my little sister.

525
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,820
Just do whatever you want.

526
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,730
Whether you ask that guy for help...

527
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,830
or go and tell the other members the truth.

528
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,170
You'd have to say something like this, I guess.

529
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,770
"I'm sorry for ruining all your dreams."

530
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,240
"Our debut is off, and we'll pay the cancellation fee."

531
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,150
But you'd have to tell them that, right, Ro Mi?

532
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,790
Yes, I guess it's the right thing. What can you do?

533
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,020
We're all done for.

534
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,160
But you can get back on your feet.

535
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,230
And...

536
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
As for me,

537
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,170
I'm on your side.

538
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,070
Think it over carefully.

539
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,480
I'll be going.

540
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,990
- That's it! - I don't know!

541
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,620
This is a total paradise

542
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:30,830
This way.

543
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,630
- It's frustrating. - This isn't my spot.

544
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,420
Maybe if I just disappeared,

545
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,390
everything would work out for the best.

546
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,000
I still don't really understand...

547
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,330
why I did what I did.

548
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,940
I just worked as hard as I could.

549
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,070
That's all I ever did.

550
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,080
I honestly have no idea...

551
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,450
what I did wrong.

552
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,260
The incident from that day that Ro Mi says she can't remember.

553
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,370
Uncovering the truth about it will be the key.

554
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:54,540
- Along with who sent the video. - Right. And who blackmailed her.

555
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,870
- Exactly. And who filmed it. - You're all saying the same thing.

556
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,380
Let's just go and grab it all.

557
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,980
Grab what?

558
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,450
I think we can just take a box, go there, and pack it all up.

559
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:09,720
Packing boxes is my specialty. Leave it to me!

560
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,790
(Prosecution)

561
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:20,730
How may I help you?

562
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,130
Please take me to the CEO's office.

563
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,310
What business do you have here?

564
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,710
Now, don't interfere with an official investigation. Stay put.

565
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,820
All right, let's pack up everything, down to the last speck of dust!

566
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,450
(Prosecution)

567
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,560
This is the short-form video we found on the CEO's computer.

568
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,060
It's been a while, but it's time for a pop quiz.

569
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,290
What kind of question could you get from this video?

570
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,370
How many people in total are in this video?

571
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,500
Anyone can see it's just Ro Mi in the video,

572
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,900
but if you're asking, there must be someone else.

573
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:05,370
- Four. - Don't just guess wildly.

574
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,810
- There's one more person. - What?

575
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,910
Wait, where's another person?

576
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,680
The ice bucket, on the right side of the table.

577
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,150
Driver Kim Do Gi, you got it!

578
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,659
(Girl Group's Shocking Antics)

579
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,660
(What is she doing at a bar before her debut?)

580
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:26,660
The truth about an idol trainee set to debut.

581
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:28,430
Gosh.

582
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:31,670
I'm sorry.

583
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,840
But I have to make a living too.

584
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,810
- That's the general director. - You're right.

585
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:40,610
If her own agency is the one blackmailing her,

586
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,380
is the CEO in on it too?

587
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,880
She could be.

588
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,320
But why? After all that training and with her debut so close?

589
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,090
Then again, maybe not.

590
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,020
We can't tell what they're thinking.

591
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,730
Looks like we're going to need someone on the inside.

592
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:00,430
Someone on the inside?

593
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,770
Let's replace her manager.

594
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:08,369
That hit-and-run jerk! Wait until I get my hands on him.

595
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,910
I'll ram him with my car. See how he likes it!

596
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:13,940
That jerk won't get away with it. This is so frustrating.

597
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,110
They suddenly barged in and took everything.

598
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,380
Then they brought it all back, saying they had the wrong address.

599
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,590
What? How can the Prosecution be so incompetent?

600
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,090
That's the Prosecution for you.

601
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,960
Should we file a complaint?

602
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,790
Let it go. It'll make things worse for ourselves if we complain.

603
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,230
- Have you hired a new manager? - No. I mean, there are applicants,

604
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,630
but no one I can trust.

605
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:42,540
Manager Song's post has been open for ages. Hurry up and fill it.

606
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,210
Sir.

607
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:50,710
Let's say I'm driving the kids, and someone blocks our van.

608
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,720
And you, sir, tell me to go over to the guy who blocked us...

609
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,450
and punch him.

610
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:00,590
I'll do it, no questions asked. You know why?

611
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,430
Because you're my boss.

612
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,330
Let's see. A taxi, a tow truck...

613
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:11,700
You even worked at a used car dealership.

614
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:15,970
Your driving experience is diverse, which is why I called you in.

615
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,040
But I don't think you're a good fit for us.

616
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,780
Sir! Right here, right now,

617
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,950
point to anyone and tell me to go punch them.

618
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:29,050
I swear, I'll do it without hesitation.

619
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,620
Why?

620
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,820
Because you'd be my boss.

621
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:38,790
Why would you suddenly punch people while driving a daycare bus?

622
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:41,300
You can't go around punching people. We'd get in huge trouble.

623
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,370
We'll go out of business. Understand?

624
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,170
Sorry.

625
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:46,970
Sir, wait!

626
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:48,570
Sir!

627
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,480
Excuse me.

628
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,690
Could I take a look at that resume?

629
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:07,320
I happen to be looking for someone to hire myself.

630
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,860
What?

631
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:21,700
Yellowstar, CEO Kang Ju Ri.

632
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,540
You're the CEO?

633
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,810
If you were to hire me right now,

634
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:35,080
and you pointed to anyone and told me to go punch them...

635
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,820
Of course, someone as lovely as you would never do that.

636
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:43,590
But even so, I'd do it. Why?

637
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,530
Because you'd be my boss.

638
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,360
Okay, then. Go punch someone.

639
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,440
I'm just curious if you'd actually do it.

640
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,790
I'm going to go to the restroom.

641
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,920
I'm going to nail it this time.

642
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,030
Why do you look like that?

643
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,930
Is he nuts?

644
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,440
I'm sorry about how I look. I'm sorry.

645
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,740
Gosh.

646
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,040
Goodness.

647
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,580
How could you punch someone for real?

648
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,050
It was your order, boss.

649
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,290
I'll do my very best!

650
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,030
So, can I start today?

651
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:58,430
Well...

652
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,910
CEO Kang Ju Ri. Where can I find her?

653
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,650
And what is your name, sir?

654
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,450
I'm the new manager.

655
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:18,590
My name is Kim Do Gi.

656
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,720
Mr. Kim Do Gi?

657
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,790
Hey.

658
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:30,570
I'm Jeong Gyeong Su. The general director.

659
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,370
Let's drop the formalities.

660
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:35,500
Looking sharp.

661
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,740
I hear you're new to the industry.

662
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:43,310
This has the members' schedules and a summary of your basic duties.

663
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,350
Get up to speed on it as soon as possible.

664
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,720
I hate being hassled,

665
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,820
so don't ask questions. Just use your head to figure it out.

666
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:54,060
Use your common sense. Got it?

667
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,160
In that case, we have a huge problem.

668
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,100
- Why? What do you mean? - I...

669
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,430
have no common sense.

670
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,640
Goodness. That CEO...

671
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,070
I'm busy enough as it is. Darn it.

672
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,650
You must address her as CEO Kang.

673
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,450
Whether she's here or not, when you talk about the CEO,

674
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,420
you must always address her with her proper title.

675
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,990
CEO Kang and I have known each other since we were kids.

676
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,520
We grew up together. She was like a sister...

677
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:33,060
- We're especially close. - Even so,

678
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,570
you must use her proper title. That's because...

679
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,240
she's the boss.

680
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,970
Man, that CEO...

681
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,510
Where did she dig this guy up?

682
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,980
- It's "CEO Kang". - Hey!

683
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,550
Don't you open your mouth in front of me.

684
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,920
But answer me when I talk to you!

685
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,490
Why don't you look at the camera? Are you shy or something?

686
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,560
What did I say a star was?

687
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:42,360
Someone you can't look away from.

688
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,930
Exactly. You know that. So why hide?

689
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,940
You need to smile and look at the camera.

690
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,680
Soo Jung, come here.

691
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:06,960
What are you going to do?

692
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,030
The camera is on you right now.

693
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,530
Everyone, take a look at Soo Jung's face.

694
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,840
You think any of you were different?

695
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,370
You've all been making this face the entire time.

696
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:28,010
Dozens of cameras will capture every single expression.

697
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,280
And dozens of mics will even pick up the sound of your breath.

698
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,089
With countless flashes, they'll try to expose the feelings you hide.

699
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,420
Do you really think you can escape any of that?

700
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,090
Don't try to show your true feelings.

701
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:44,230
Who says anyone wants to know how you really feel?

702
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:47,360
Practice your expressions all the way back to the dorm.

703
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,700
Seeing the looks on your faces today makes me lose my appetite.

704
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:52,430
Got it?

705
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:53,940
- Yes. - Yes.

706
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,340
Yes.

707
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,080
For now, Assistant Manager Kim will take over for Manager Song.

708
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,120
He'll be managing all of you on the road.

709
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,850
My name is Kim Do Gi.

710
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,520
And I...

711
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,830
am going to manage you all the right way.

712
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:18,930
So I'm counting on your cooperation.

713
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,100
- Thank you in advance. - Thank you in advance.

714
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,570
Pack up the camera and bring it to my office.

715
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,940
Yes, ma'am.

716
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,740
CEO Kang?

717
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,010
I was just wondering...

718
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,510
if you heard from Ro Mi yet?

719
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:38,750
No, nothing.

720
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:43,080
I just can't believe Ro Mi would just take off like that.

721
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,950
Don't you think something might've happened to her?

722
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,690
You shouldn't be asking other people about that, Ji An.

723
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,630
Ask her yourself when she gets back.

724
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,060
Okay.

725
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,399
You guys are still a team.

726
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,800
Practice together to cover her spot. Your debut is coming up.

727
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:03,070
Yes, ma'am.

728
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,580
It needs an accent piece, and then we'll focus on the top.

729
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:19,490
Assistant Manager Kim.

730
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,290
Charge this for me at my desk.

731
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,190
Yes, ma'am.

732
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:28,260
Thanks. On second thought, no thanks.

733
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,630
What's his deal?

734
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,270
All right, everyone, let's get back to work.

735
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,330
Okay, I'm in.

736
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,260
This file is huge. It's going to take a while.

737
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,240
That's fine. Take your time.

738
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,310
Who's this for?

739
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,210
It's for Soo Jung, the youngest member.

740
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,440
I'm going for a bold look, just like you suggested, ma'am.

741
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,580
For her makeup, emphasize the eyes, and make sure her lips are nude.

742
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,080
Hey!

743
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,920
Hey.

744
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:31,860
It's time for the girls to leave. Go start the car.

745
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:36,560
No. I'm not done yet. I still need more time.

746
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:38,200
Just a little more.

747
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:42,740
Not this again. Why just stand there staring into space?

748
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:48,540
CEO Kang! This guy is completely ignoring me.

749
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:50,910
Assistant Manager Kim.

750
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:54,350
Didn't you hear the director tell you to start the car?

751
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,560
Almost there.

752
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,170
All done!

753
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,930
What?

754
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,140
What was that?

755
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,880
Why are you bringing this back? It hasn't even finished charging.

756
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,550
Because I have to go start the car.

757
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,090
Right.

758
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,360
This guy...

759
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,930
Hey.

760
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,830
Why that little...

761
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,330
Don't you think he's got a screw loose?

762
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:46,840
That guy is a real piece of work.

763
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,340
Okay, I'm going through the files on the laptop now.

764
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,310
It's just girl group music videos, performance recordings,

765
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:56,910
and concept materials. That's it.

766
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:01,220
Why would she bother carrying all this heavy stuff around?

767
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,190
What else is on there?

768
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:07,420
There are some other documents. I'll check them all too.

769
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:16,730
Yes, ma'am.

770
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,770
Earlier, you seemed like the type to get friendly with the girls.

771
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:24,940
Yes. Once I decide to take care of someone,

772
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,840
- I see it through to the end. - Well, don't.

773
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,380
Open the glove compartment.

774
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:32,080
There should be a pen in there.

775
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,630
Don't tell me that's a bug.

776
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,930
Yes. It's a bug.

777
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,500
Keep it on you at all times so I can listen in.

778
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:56,200
Remember this. You're management.

779
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:02,080
The moment you become their friend, they'll stop respecting you.

780
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,810
Don't make small talk and don't ever smile at them.

781
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,990
If you break any of these rules, you're fired. Understood?

782
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,620
Crystal clear.

783
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:20,030
If you tell me to do something, I do it. No questions asked.

784
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:35,139
"Don't talk, don't smile"?

785
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:37,350
She's telling you to be a jerk.

786
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,550
Driver Kim, those girls are really going to hate you.

787
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,560
Wait. Driver Kim, you can't talk to me anymore, can you?

788
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:55,100
We're done with practice.

789
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:57,770
Thank you.

790
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,810
I'm starving.

791
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,449
Do my eyes look smaller to you?

792
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:12,650
What do I do? Look again.

793
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,720
You think I can get by without surgery?

794
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:18,150
- Seriously, stop worrying. - Manager, can you turn on the AC?

795
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,650
The general manager will get mad.

796
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:26,830
Where do I sit?

797
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,430
Are you out of your mind?

798
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:33,900
Gosh.

799
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,310
My gosh! It's so hot!

800
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:41,710
You were supposed to have the AC on!

801
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:43,480
Starting the engine.

802
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,380
I can't believe they're making me train him.

803
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,350
Today, I'm just showing you the ropes, so pay close attention.

804
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:51,650
Turning on the AC.

805
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,560
Departing now.

806
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:15,740
Okay.

807
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,010
What am I going to do? I feel like I'll never get this dance down.

808
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:23,820
Hey, stop worrying already. You're making me even hungrier.

809
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:26,790
- Wait, you can't get this part? - You all did great today.

810
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,820
I'll have some food sent down, so you can all get some rest.

811
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:31,789
- Thank you! - Thank you!

812
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:32,790
Thank you!

813
01:01:32,791 --> 01:01:34,760
Thanks for the ride! I call the first shower!

814
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:35,830
No way!

815
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,870
Assistant Manager Kim, you're with me.

816
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,470
Excuse me.

817
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:44,670
Give us the most nutritious and delicious thing you have.

818
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:48,440
Ma'am! Just one roll of the basic kimbap.

819
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:51,010
You got it. I'll have that right out for you.

820
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,249
There are 4 of them, so they need 4 rolls, at least.

821
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,250
Hey.

822
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,850
Shut it. Sit down.

823
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:07,360
I told you I'm only going over this with you once.

824
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:08,700
Listen up.

825
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:14,440
Hey, wait. How come you never answer my questions?

826
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:15,970
Because I'm listening.

827
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:24,050
Tomorrow morning, get them one roll of basic kimbap.

828
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:26,010
Also,

829
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:30,450
keep nagging them to watch their weight.

830
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:33,390
Got it?

831
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:37,090
"Yes." Darn it. And the most important part is this.

832
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:39,890
This wench right here.

833
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,730
If she shows up, report it to me immediately.

834
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:45,100
And don't let her get anywhere near the other members.

835
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,700
Why is that?

836
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:52,570
Just do as you're told!

837
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:58,650
Got it?

838
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:03,019
"Yes!"

839
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:05,820
This jerk. He won't answer any of my questions.

840
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,390
I'm leaving. Grab the darn food and go!

841
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:09,790
(Snack Food Feast)

842
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,670
All set. You can talk now.

843
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:27,040
On Kang Ju Ri's personal laptop, I found some documents,

844
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,940
including the exclusive contracts for Element.

845
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:32,780
Each of them is racking up 40,000 dollars in debt every month.

846
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,950
- Repayment starts after they debut. - Debt?

847
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,290
Most of it is supposedly for their current training expenses.

848
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:43,360
It includes a "mental coaching" fee from CEO Kang Ju Ri...

849
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:45,830
for 3,000 dollars per session.

850
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:47,700
Mental coaching?

851
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,030
You all saw what that was.

852
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:51,470
Her screaming at them and hitting them.

853
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:54,300
Wait, she gets paid 3,000 dollars for doing that?

854
01:03:55,100 --> 01:04:00,040
She's definitely hard on them, but I thought she really cared.

855
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,279
What?

856
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,910
But there's something else that's odd.

857
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,680
What's that?

858
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,650
They're not looking for Ro Mi.

859
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,520
In fact, they're actively keeping her away.

860
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,750
And the most important part is this.

861
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,720
If she shows up, report it to me immediately.

862
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,960
And don't let her get anywhere near the other members.

863
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:20,560
Did you find the location where Ro Mi was in that photo?

864
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,660
Of course. It was very hard.

865
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:24,830
It was easy, though.

866
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,800
We just tailed the general director, and he led us right to it.

867
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,100
It was easy.

868
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:39,580
Let's head there right away.

869
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,180
Is someone else here?

870
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,850
No, the manager said they were closed today.

871
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:13,680
Hang on, I'll go check.

872
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,420
I think they're onto us. You need to hide now!

873
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,690
Someone must be here.

874
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:39,370
Who's there?

875
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,380
(Special thanks to our guest star, Jang Na Ra)
