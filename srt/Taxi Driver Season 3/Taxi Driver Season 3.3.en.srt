How come it doesn't feel like we're cleaning this together?

12

That's because you're so selfish.

you're not just buying a car, you're buying our memories.

141
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,900

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,850
Stay back.

176
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,950
You were the one who told us to sell it quickly, so we did!

177
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,620
So, are you saying this is my fault?

178
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,360
Hey, what's with all the noise? What's going on here?

179
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,830
They sold it to some con artist, and now they want me to find it.

180
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,030
A con artist?

181
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,260
We waited for him all night and only left because of the rain.

182
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,370
This guy, a "used car dealer," said he'd test drive it...

183
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,470
Hang on a second.

184
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,210
Yes, Driver Oh. I've been waiting for your call.

185
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,509
- I won't need to borrow that money. - What?

186
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,410
Sorry to have worried you for nothing.

187
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,380
- You're busy, so I'll let you go. - Wait, Driver Oh.

188
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,220
Go Eun, you know Driver Oh, right?

189
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,490
Look up Driver Oh's home address and text it to me right away.

190
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,760
- Yes, sir. - But...

191
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,270
- Go Eun... - Gosh, just go dry yourselves off.

192
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,570
But...

193
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,570
Hey, looks like Mr. Jang is leaving. What do we do?

194
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,840
Should we wait?

195
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,440
- He said to hang on, so let's wait. - Okay.

196
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,290
- Ji Eun, you're home. - Hello, sir.

197
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Is your mom home?

198
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,460
My mom's not feeling well. She took medicine and is sleeping.

199
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,900
- Please, come in. - Thanks.

200
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,970
So your dad had an accident working as a designated driver?

201
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,680
He broke his wrist,

202
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,450
so he had surgery and is in the hospital now.

203
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,980
But I thought he was doing well with his private taxi.

204
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,750
I didn't know Dad was a designated driver until the accident.

205
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,220
Oh, dear.

206
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,090
And...

207
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,060
I found this in his drawer.

208
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,870
Hey, these are divorce papers.

209
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,540
I have no idea what's going through his head.

210
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,040
He won't answer me when I ask.

211
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,840
Which hospital is your dad in right now?

212
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,820

I don't know what's going on, but please, just talk to me.

219
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,910
There's no other way.

220
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,840
I have to die right here.

221
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,810
- It'll all be over. - What do you mean, be over?

222
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,520
What about the people you'll leave behind?

223
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,490
The pain you're going through right now!

224
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,720
The people left behind will carry that pain, only magnified.

225
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,700
They'll have to carry that weight for the rest of their lives.

226
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,130
Are you okay with that?

227
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,870
Just come here.

228
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,570
I'll help you.

229
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,570
Okay?

230
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,840
There's nothing more I can do.

231
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,680
That's not true!

232
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,510
There are always other options.

233
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,550
There is so much you can still do. All right?

234
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,190
I...

235
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,820

and there's no way out.

Please just take my hand.

00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,900
It's all right. You're okay.

241

You're okay.

242

Whatever happened,

243
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,980
you can tell me everything.

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,010

Looks like all your paperwork is in order.

247
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,660
But...

248
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,260
What is it? Are you not happy with the price?

249
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,400
No, it's just much lower than I expected.

250
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,980
So a low price is a problem now?

251
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,250
I'm sorry if it came off that way.

252
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,350
Right now, the going rate for a Seoul taxi number...

253
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,960
is trading at about 120,000 dollars, give or take 5,000.

254
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,160
This particular license is for sale due to the owner's poor health.

255
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,100
So it came to us as a distress sale.

256
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,270
So we listed it at a 25-percent discount off the market rate,

257
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,270
and you were the very first person to call.

258
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,040
I was scrolling through listings, and yours suddenly popped up.

259
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,010
So I knew I had to jump on it right away.

260
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,540
Look, I have another appointment to get to,

261
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,880
so I'll just assume you're withdrawing your offer,

262
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,810
and I'll contact the next person on the waiting list right away.

263
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,550
Goodness, withdraw?

264
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,220
Of course not.

265
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,020
The owner wants to have cash in hand by the end of the day.

266
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,260
If we waste time, we both lose, don't we?

267
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,960
Right. I understand.

268
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,190
I'll take the deal.

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,269
- Manager Yang. - Yes, sir.

270

271
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,700
- so process with the contract. - Yes, sir.

- Assistant Manager Yoo, you there? - Yes, sir.

273
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,810

- Make a separate cashback contract. - Right.

Yes, that's our boss.

287
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,150

288
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,420
Absolutely. Our boss,

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,390
is indeed a lawyer who passed the Bar Exam.

290
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,390
- Is that right? - He's so passionate about cars...

291
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,600
that he decided to run this dealership himself.

292
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,070
A total gearhead.

293
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,970
Hearing that he's a lawyer...

294
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,070
- inspires trust. - All right, have a seat.

295
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,680
All right, let me explain the cashback contract.

296
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,340
Cashback?

297
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,150
If we report the sale at a price that's well below the market rate,

298
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,020
others in our industry would see it as disrupting the market.

299
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,420
We report the sale at market rate, and then every month,

300
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,030
- we send cashback to your account. - I see.

301

- please send them our way. - Of course.

307
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,910
- Great, thank you. - No, we're grateful.

308

(Bar Exam Certificate of Qualification, Cha Byeong Jin)

311
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,790
- But he is a lawyer. - Then why is a lawyer selling cars?

312
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,260
He was disbarred.

313
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,470
He killed someone in a drunk driving hit-and-run.

314
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,400
And he only served six years in prison.

315
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,040
That he still brazenly displays it even after being disbarred...

316
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,140
shows how proud he must still be.

317
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,980
Wait, I have a question.

318
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,050
Doesn't Driver Oh qualify for his own private taxi license?

319
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,450
Why would he spend so much money buying one from someone else?

320
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,420
It's because of the Taxi Cap System. Private taxi licenses are limited.

321
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,630
So, only when someone turns in their license...

322
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,730
can a new license be issued.

323
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Instead of waiting forever for a turn that might never come,

324
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,170
it's become standard practice to buy a license from a private seller.

325
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,980
After investing so much money in it, he barely got to use it...

326
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,209
before it was revoked overnight.

327
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,780

Honey, wait. You forgot your lunch.

329
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,090

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,330
Under the Passenger Transport Act, your taxi license has been revoked.

351
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,700
What? What do you mean, revoked?

352
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,800
It says here you have a conviction for a drunk driving accident.

353
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Me?

354
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,210
There must be some kind of misunderstanding.

355
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,080
I don't drink at all.

356
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,640
And what's this about a car accident?

357
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,310
We're just following orders, sir. We don't know the specifics.

358
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,150
We will now proceed to confiscate the license plate.

359
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,120
Please, don't. I'm telling you I've never done anything like that!

360
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,490
Don't take it up with us.

361
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,320
Go take it up with the people who sold you the license.

362
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,860
(Notice of Administrative Disposition)

363
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,200
And just like that, overnight,

364
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,770
(Another Safe Day)

365
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,370
my private taxi license was taken away.

366
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,050
Sir, should I take this ride?

367
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,860
Hey, you. You remember me, right?

368
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,790
You guys knew all along, and you tricked me, didn't you?

369
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,000
Tricked you?

370
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,830
About what? Sir, can we talk over here?

371
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,770
- What seems to be the problem? - The old owner had a DUI,

372
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,180
- so they took my license plate. - Really? Is that what happened?

373
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,080
He just asked us to sell the license quickly,

374
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,220
so we simply brokered the deal for a low price.

375
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,020
- You know how it is. - Stop lying.

376
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,290
You knew all along.

377
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,090
What, you think we're psychics or something?

378
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,030
I'm going to report you all to the police.

379
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,900
Just wait and see. I'll report you to the police!

380
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,300
Please.

381
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,270
Go ahead.

382
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,740
Report us to the police.

383
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,810
Okay?

384
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,080
Now stop disrupting our business.

385
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,920
Hi, there.

386
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,420
He comes in sometimes, spouting all sorts of nonsense.

387
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,800
(Civil Service Center)

388
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:33,340
I understand your situation, but our hands are tied.

389
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,970
What do you mean, your hands are tied?

390
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,280
Though your license was transferred, the law requires its revocation.

391
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,379
But the previous owner was the one who drank.

392
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,220
All I did was buy the license,

393
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,720
so why is my license being revoked? What kind of insane law is that?

394
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,860
Yes, I understand you feel this is unfair,

395
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,360
but that's just the way the law is written.

396
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,030
I'm sorry about this.

397
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,700
If all you can say is sorry, what am I supposed to do?

398
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,570
Who else am I supposed to talk to about this?

399
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,670
You could try inquiring at the relevant government office.

400
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,640
But if you drive without a license plate even if you're in a rush,

401
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,580
you can be fined.

402
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,250
(Vehicle Registration)

403
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:29,430
Hi. I was told my taxi license was suddenly revoked.

404
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,260
Our department doesn't handle that. Please try the seventh floor.

405
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,600
- What? The seventh floor? - Next.

406
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,000
Okay, thank you.

407
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,310
There's nothing we can do either. We're just following the law.

408
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,180
If everyone just keeps telling me no,

409
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,720
then who am I supposed to turn to for help?

410
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,920
I'm afraid you'll have to go to the police station.

411
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,020
I just told you. I just came from the police station!

412
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,460
If you truly feel this is unjust, you can file an administrative case.

413
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
Sir.

414
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,460
Please don't just tell me it can't be done.

415
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,100
Please just help me this one time. Please?

416
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,840
Have you spoken with the previous owner?

417
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,310
The previous owner?

418
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,380
The previous owner was arrested for the DUI...

419
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,480
and was in prison.

420
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,580
He said he was broke,

421
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,020
so I couldn't even bring up the money.

422
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,560
- Hello? - Hey, honey.

423
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,230
Did you get a lot of fares today?

424
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,200
Yes, today...

425
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,100
By the way, how was the bone broth? You finished it all, right?

426
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,700
Yes, it was delicious.

427
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,840
Of course it was. Who do you think made it?

428
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:53,040
- Drive safe. I'll see you at home. - Yes, okay. Talk to you later.

429
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,770
What am I going to do?

430
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,840
How could they all do this to me?

431
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,710
How...

432
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,940
But wait, isn't this a completely unfair situation?

433
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,370
Why should Driver Oh have to pay for the previous owner's mistake?

434
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,380
Under current law, if a private taxi license holder gets a DUI,

435
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,380
their license can be revoked.

436
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,450
Looking at the circumstances,

437
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,850
it seems the broker bought a license about to be revoked on the cheap...

438
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,820
and then pawned it off on Driver Oh.

439
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,590
That's fraud.

440
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,460
- He can claim he didn't know. - What?

441
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,760
The taxi's previous owner, the broker,

442
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,170
the public official, the police.

443
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,870
Driver Oh was caught in a blind spot between all of them.

444
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,740
They knew about the loophole in the law...

445
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,380
and exploited that blind spot.

446
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,850
Still, Driver Oh fought desperately not to give up.

447
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,450
Then why did he go all the way up to the rooftop?

448
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,550
Because that wasn't the end of it.

449
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,720
We're here, sir.

450
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,070
Yes, this is your designated driver.

451
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:41,310
Yes, I'm nearby. It'll take me about ten minutes.

452
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,180
Okay, I'll be right there. Thank you.

453
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,280
Excuse me, sir. The key...

454
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,860
Thank you.

455
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,830
- Yes, designated driver speaking. - Yes, this is Noblesse Motors.

456
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,330
What is this regarding?

457
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,200
I'm calling with the repair estimate for your luxury car.

458
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,410
What are you talking about, calling me suddenly like this?

459
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,580
The accident was minor, but it's a luxury car,

460
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,850
so the estimate came out to 40,000 dollars.

461
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,620
A luxury car? What on earth are you talking about?

462
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,420
I've informed you. That is all.

463
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,190
What on earth do you think you're doing?

464
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,070
What is all this?

465
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,270
Cut it out!

466
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,540
You think I'm going to fall for this nonsense again?

467
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,410
That's exactly why we use contracts. Because of people like you.

468
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,710
I know, right?

469
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,250
The way he's just flat-out denying it.

470
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,450
If we hadn't been sending him that monthly fee,

471
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,390
we would've been totally fooled.

Don't you remember?

474
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,890
You took the 800 dollars we sent you every month.

475
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,060
- But you said that was cashback... - Sir!

476
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,700
That luxury car, with the title you signed over,

477
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,370
got into a fender bender.

478
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,240
Luckily, we got it fixed at a shop we know,

479
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,950
so we managed to keep the cost down to 40,000 dollars.

481
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,030
And this seal impression is from your official seal, correct?

482
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,260
When did you ever show me this?

483
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,530
When did you ever show me this?

484
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,010
You only showed me the very last page!

485
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,410
If you claim you just saw the end,

486
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,080
then next time, you should initial every page of the contract.

487
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,950
Then maybe someone will actually believe you.

All right.

What are you going to do about the 40,000 dollars for repairs?

491
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,930
Will you be paying in cash? Or card?

492
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,510
You even hung up a fake license.

494
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Fake?

Hey, that's crossing the line.

00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,520
Everything...

498
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,960
was all a part of your scheme!

499
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:24,300
- Everything! - Gosh, after we explained it all,

500
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,370
this is just too much!

501
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,100
So unreasonable.

00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,290
Enough. Take him.

503
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,310
Have you been to any government offices?

504
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,840
What did they say at the police station?

505
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,580
Did anyone, anywhere, take your side?

506
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,130
Let's say I orchestrated all this, like you claim.

507
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,070
Then...

508
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,810
what else can you possibly do?

509
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,750
Everything was done by the book.

510
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,330
The fact that no one took your side...

511
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,600
means you're the one who's in the wrong.

512
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
And one more thing.

513
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,610
That license is real.

514
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,160
No matter how hard I think about it,

515
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,600
I just don't know where it all went wrong.

516
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,570
I have no idea what I did wrong.

517
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,410
I just have no idea.

518
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,810
Driver Oh...

519
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,420
walked into a trap they set from the very beginning.

520
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,690
No matter how hard he tried to get out,

521
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,490
he couldn't see a way.

522
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,660
He must've been going through nightmare all by himself.

523
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,530
What do we do about those jerks?

524
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,830
They did everything by the book,

525
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,770
so we'll do the same.

529
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,280
Hello.

530
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,510
First, thank you for choosing Rainbow Deluxe Taxi.

531
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:02,520
For your safety and convenience, I'll go over a few disclaimers.

532
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:07,120
The meter will be running for the duration of the service.

533
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:11,290
The fare will be calculated and paid after the service is complete,

534
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,200
and additional surcharges may apply depending on the circumstances.

535
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,370
After using the taxi,

536
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:21,640
you must not mention anything about Rainbow Taxi to anyone else.

537
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,910
We must insist.

538
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,710
Now, if you wish to hire the Deluxe Taxi,

539
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,080
press the blue button on the left side of the screen.

540
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:34,350
If not, please press the red button on the right.

541
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,190
Now, please make your choice.

542
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,660
Under the Passenger Transport Act, your taxi license has been revoked.

543
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,340
I'm off!

544
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,810
But if you drive without a license plate even if you're in a rush,

545
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,640
you can be fined.

546
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,580
Please just help me this one time. Please?

547
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,280
The fact that no one took your side...

548
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,420
means you're the one who's in the wrong.

00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,930
You look way better in the photo.

552
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:53,830
- What? I look way better in person. - What are you doing? Let's go.

553
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,100
- Are we leaving? Let's go! - Let's go.

(The Champion of the Used Car Market, Why? It's "Noblesse"!)

557
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,860
They handle all auto brokering. Used car sales are their main thing.

558
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,490
What's their capital structure like?

559
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:27,130
The dealership building is fully mortgaged,

560
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:30,400
and their cars are tied up in financing from a capital firm.

561
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,900
So they're running a huge dealership with none of their own money.

562
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,210
If things go south, they don't stand to lose a thing.

563
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,040
Smart guy.

564
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,710
Too bad he doesn't use that brain for something good.

565
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,280
You're heading to the dealership first, right?

566
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:44,810
That's the plan.

567
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,850
Then I'll look for the foreign car registered in Driver Oh's name.

568
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,220
Okay.

Noblesse.

572
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,430
What?

573
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,740
Nothing. Let's just go, for now.

00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:32,390
You know, that "Noblesse" sign looks really familiar.

577
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,260
Now that you mention it,

578
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,200
it does feel strangely familiar to me too.

579
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,800
It's almost nostalgic, isn't it?

580
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,110
Yes, same here.

581
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,110

00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,580
What?

584
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,360
I'll be right back after one last test drive.

585
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,590
- Wait! - What's wrong?

586
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,160
Come on. What is it?

587
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,299
I got you now, you jerk.

588
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,130
Hey, where are you off to all of a sudden?

589
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,800
I was wondering the same thing.

590
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Chief Choi!

591
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,880
What? What is it? What's going on?

592
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,480
It's the car thief! The one who stole our car!

593
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,780
- Wait! - Oh, no. What now, Driver Kim?

594
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,450
I'm not sure.

595
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,720
What should we do?

596
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,420
Hey, you!

597
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,030
Here to look at a car?

598
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,630
You don't recognize me?

599
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,400
I'm not sure. Who are you?

600
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,670
Then what about this car?

601
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,370
(72S 5493)

602
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,600
Still don't recognize me?

603
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,520
You're the one who sold your "memories."

604
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,850
You said you were just taking it for a test spin,

605
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,850
and then you just took off.

606
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,420
Pay me the rest.

607
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,860
Either that, or give me the car!

608
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:14,660
- What money? - Listen to this guy.

609
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,270
So you're going to play dumb?

610
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,670
I acquired the car per the contract. Why would I play dumb?

611
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,670
What? According to the contract?

612
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:26,640
It broke down during the test drive. Turns out the engine was shot.

613
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,079
The repair estimate was 10,000 dollars,

614
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,110
so I deducted that per the contract.

615
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,680
- That's a lie! - Do you have any proof?

616
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,380
I'm the proof, you jerk. I inspected it myself!

617
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:38,350
What is your problem? Seriously, give it a rest.

618
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,790
What's all this commotion?

619
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,490
He just showed up out of nowhere and is making a scene over money.

620
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,430
Look who's talking! You've got some nerve blaming me.

621
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,060
Choi! Get this guy out of here.

622
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,600
What do you mean, Choi... Hey...

623
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:53,900
What? Gosh.

624
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,640
Hey! Let go!

625
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:59,840
Hey, you! Is your last name Choi? Which Choi clan are you from?

626
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,480
- I'm a Choi too! - What's going on?

627
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,980
Gosh! Oh, dear.

628
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,960
You went in there ready to tear the place down.

629
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,770
I almost got into some real trouble. Gosh, my back.

630
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,100
Gosh, I've never met a Choi who was that violent.

631
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,100
He's like one of the Choi clan of the Silla Dynasty.

632
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,590
I found where the luxury car registered to Driver Oh is.

633
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,260
- Where is it? - It's not far from here.

634
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,960
Should we head there first?

635
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,830
Wait, this car hit someone.

636
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,780
Goodness.

637
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,080
Do you know how much it costs to rent a luxury car for a month?

638
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:15,680
- Three grand. - It's a luxury car. Four grand.

639
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,750
It's 15,000 dollars.

640
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:22,620
- How much? It's 15,000 dollars? - If that's for a legitimate rental,

641
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,530
then they must be charging much more for that luxury car.

642
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,330
- Why? - If it's in Driver Oh's name,

643
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:33,340
then it's pretty obvious what kind of clients they have.

644
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:34,670
And what kind is that?

645
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,310
People who can't rent a car under their own name.

646
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,840
Either they're already criminals, or they're about to become one.

647
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,610
It's one or the other.

648
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,620
Shouldn't we get Driver Oh out of that contract before it's late?

649
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,580
Let's go, gorgeous.

650
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,090
First things first. We need to get that car back.

651
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,360
(Car-Free Street: 10am to 6pm)

652
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,430
So many cars!

653
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:08,570
- Where to? Straight ahead? - Yes! Let's roll!

654
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:13,840
Ring, ring. Coming through.

655
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:16,980
Hey, don't chicken out. We didn't hit them. Floor it!

656
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,050
Get out of the way!

657
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:22,920
Ring, ring. Got some nerve?

658
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,720
- Watch out for that guy up ahead. - What on earth?

659
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:28,790
Ring!

660
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,190
What was that?

661
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:33,599
- That jerk. Why isn't he moving? - What?

662
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,660
Let's go!

663
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,370
Are you okay? Should we get out of the way?

664
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,870
They'll go around us. Those jerks.

665
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,540
- Oh, no. - Are you okay?

666
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:52,210
How could you hit him for real? Just chill. I'll handle this.

667
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,350
Hey, you crazy jerk!

668
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,420
My neck. It's completely shattered.

669
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:58,150
Gosh, what are we going to do about this?

670
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,920
You scratched my car.

671
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,360
You rich, kid?

672
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,760
This paint job alone costs 10,000 dollars.

673
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,170
- Let's just go. - I asked if you're rich, you punk!

674
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,200
I'm sorry.

675
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,010
What are you looking at, jerks?

676
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:19,370
- Goodness. - Go away!

677
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,240
All right!

678
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:23,510
They're insane!

679
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,760
That's right. We've got to obey the light.

680
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:39,030
Gosh, darn. This place is a madhouse.

681
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:43,100
Hey, old lady! What, are you deaf?

682
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,570
I said move to the side!

683
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:50,140
- Dude, she can't hear you. - Hey, lady! Pick up the pace!

684
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,440
Here's a gift!

685
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:53,440
Are you kidding me right now?

686
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,540
Drive safe.

687
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:01,220
- Darn it! - Hey! What was that?

688
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,690
Hold on. Hey, you!

689
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,550
Hold up. Just a moment. You, there. Hold it.

690
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,690
- What are you doing? - Hey, cabbie, move your car.

691
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:10,890
Move your car, cabbie.

692
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,800
You think you can just park here?

693
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,830
You must be a real busy guy.

694
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:18,470
Right?

695
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,270
Hey, you dropped this. Is it yours? Now, you jerk.

696
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,680
This is fun! Yes, real fun.

697
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:30,680
All right. Time for Gear Second.

698
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,550
Let's see you block this, you jerk.

- they won't let us cancel early. - What if we can't cancel?

- Get out of the way! - Oh, no, what are we going to do?

876
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:46,040
You idiot, move! I said, get out of the way!

877
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,040
You're the buyer, right?

878
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:51,980
What have I done?

879
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,280
It looks like I've completely ruined your deal.

880
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:58,790
The deal is officially void.

881
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,520
Void.

882
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:05,830
You're right.

883
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,260
I'm not signing the contract.

884
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,300
Thank you.

885
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,000
- Thank you. - No, wait!

886
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:17,210
Move.

887
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:21,010
- Get out of the way! - I'm not an irresponsible person.

888
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,910
- I get it, now just move, darn it! - No, I'll take full responsibility.

889
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,810
- That's enough. - What?

890
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,720
Yes, sir.

891
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,820
Thanks to you, a perfectly good deal is ruined.

892
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:39,530
- Yes. - And our display model's scratched.

893
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,560
So how are you going to make this right?

894
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,970
In that case,

895
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,670
I'll buy it.

896
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:54,310
I'll also pay for the repairs on that other car.

897
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:01,180
It's only right.

898
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,760
Perfect.

899
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:14,930
Somebody show our customer inside.

900
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,400
Yes, sir.

901
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:23,340
I'm Go Deok Su, your dealer. It's a pleasure.

902
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,870
Yes, I'm looking forward to it.

903
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,780
That's some outfit.

904
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,440
It's quite something.

905
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:32,380
It's from the new collection.

906
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,880
By the way, how much is that car?

907
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:41,020
Driver Kim Do Gi, how's the used car you just bought?

908
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,760
I think I might've overpaid.

909
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,620
Driver Kim Do Gi.

910
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:18,360
I think I paid for this car more than I was expecting to.

911
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,610
Driver Kim, is something wrong?

912
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,230
(Safety first)

913
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:12,180
Driver Kim Do Gi. Can you hear me?

914
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:14,220
Driver Kim?

915
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,940
(Special thanks to Yoon Si Yoon for his guest appearance.)

916
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:56,160
(Taxi Driver 3)

917
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:00,460
You want to go home, don't you? Then do a job for me.

918
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:03,930
I'm here to buy cars. I need 100 on my carrier, fast.

919
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,200
That jerk is driving a Car Carrier, buying up used cars.

920
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,100
So what's their take on me?

921
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:11,610
I can't figure out what this guy is up to.

922
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:15,140
Was this his plan all along? To scam me?

923
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,680
Hey! Get everyone together. Now.

924
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:20,350
You messed with the wrong guy.

925
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:23,750
- Choi. - We're Team Kim.

926
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:24,920
Hey, Kim.
