00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,110
Will you just let him?

182
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,860
- Give me.
- N-N-No.

183
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,330
Hey, hey.

184
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,380
So what if you're the captain?

185
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,550
Get lost, you bastard!

186
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,330
H-He's acting weird.

187
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,550
- Dong Hyeon, leave after five minutes.
- Okay.

188
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,340
Seong Wuk, follow me.

189
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,000
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo.

190
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,020
Yes. I found Min Ho.

191
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,090
Hey.

192
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,810
Min Ho.

193
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,000
I-Is he dead?

194
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,370
H-He's dead, right?

195
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,560
What are you saying?

196
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,940
He left the locker room earlier after a fight.

197
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,440
Right?

198
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,140
B-But still, Min Ho is-

199
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,910
What? Will you call the police?

200
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,820
You hit him.

201
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,190
Dong Hyeon, Dong Hyeon, listen up.

202
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,640
Min Ho left after having a fight with us. Okay?

203
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,970
If anything goes wrong,

204
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,250
say you parted ways after
fighting in the locker room.

205
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,870
Answer me, you bastard.

206
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,710
Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine.

207
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,670
I'll take care of your lives from now on.

208
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,920
Dong Hyeon, don't worry so much.

209
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,620
I'll take care of everything.

210
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,670
- Good work. Go home and rest.
- Okay.

211
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,140
Don't worry.

212
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,750
You stay.

213
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,520
That's enough. Come out.

214
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,180
Lift the legs.

215
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,990
Bastard. Why are his eyes open?

216
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,540
Lift him. One, two, three.

217
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,410
Okay. One, two, three.

218
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,550
My grandma died 10 years ago.

219
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,350
She's finally giving me a great gift.

220
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,080
I'm grateful.

221
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,970
Hyung, we'll be okay, right?

222
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,130
You bury dead people here.

223
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,970
Right. Yes.

224
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,620
Grandma, you must be happy to have a friend.

225
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,780
Let's bury him.

226
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,540
What are you doing?

227
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,500
Min Ho's uniform.

228
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,540
Shit. Will you keep the shorts?

229
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,040
Let's finish quickly and eat.

230
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,140
<i>Here's the sentence.</i>

231
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,870
The defendant Im Dong Hyeon will
be sentenced to five months in prison

232
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,430
and 80 hours of community service.

233
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,510
H-How...

234
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,090
H-How is this fair?

235
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,600
He gets five months in jail after killing someone?

236
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,870
How could this be?

237
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,730
My son's body hasn't even been found yet.

238
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,970
Hey, hey, hey!

239
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,090
Tell me where my son is.

240
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,410
We should at least have a funeral.

241
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,720
I didn't kill him.

242
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,020
Hey, tell me!

243
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,070
Tell me, I said!

244
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,660
I won't forgive you people.

245
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,180
I'll kill you!

246
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,540
You!

247
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,420
H-How are you humans?

248
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,730
This is what you're worth.

249
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,710
You need to make more.

250
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,780
Who knows how much we'll spend tomorrow?

251
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,970
You need to make a lot, right?

252
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,870
Hyung, by the way...

253
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,550
Min Ho's father visited Dong Hyeon in prison

254
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,100
and he seemed to know about everything.

255
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,140
About what?

256
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,690
About Min Ho.

257
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,940
He said he knows Dong Hyeon didn't act alone.

258
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,340
Bring me a truck later.

259
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,850
Strike!

260
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,510
Get off and check.

261
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,600
Get it together.

262
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,800
I said there are no CCTVs here.

263
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,250
What are you doing?

264
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,110
He's... I think he's dead.

265
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,920
He's dead.

266
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,330
Let's go and clean up his room.

267
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,210
[Baek Seon Ja]

268
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,010
Grandma must be bothered by the noises.

269
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,820
Hey, it's me.

270
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,070
I'm in Korea.

271
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,600
We should get together.

272
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,680
Mr. Park's memory came back briefly?

273
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,080
Yes.

274
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,950
He asked me a favor.

275
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,570
<i>If you...</i>

276
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,180
end up finding Min Ho,

277
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,800
I want you to hold his funeral for me.

278
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,530
Next time I come to my senses,

279
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,810
if I get to hear that...

280
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,730
Min Ho is resting somewhere sunny and

281
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,170
has a great view of sunset like this,

282
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,190
I want...

283
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,530
nothing more.

284
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,890
Please make sure that happens.

285
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,510
I'm sure Min Ho will finally tell us

286
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,430
what happened 15 years ago.

287
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,720
- But there's one thing that bothers me.
- Huh?

288
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,900
Jo Seong Wuk talked to someone
on the phone on the way here.

289
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,600
<i>He didn't hang up until he exhumed the body.</i>

290
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,460
As if he were asking for permission.

291
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,390
Another person connected
to Park Min Ho's death?

292
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,870
Yes.

293
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,850
He hasn't yet shown himself to us.

294
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,830
Another perpetrator.

295
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,720
Gwang Jin.

296
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,370
Gosh. The successful Coach Jo Seong Wuk.

297
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,490
Hyung, long time no see.

298
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,190
H-Have you been well?

299
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,380
You haven't aged at all.

300
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,930
Sit.

301
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,480
Okay. It's biting.

302
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,120
All right.

303
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,980
What?

304
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,120
You didn't catch fish.

305
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,870
Dong Hyeon, you're playing this wrong.

306
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:14,330
I told you to shake the bobber
after catching the fish.

307
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,830
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

308
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,150
Please forgive me just once. Please...

309
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,750
Just once?

310
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,350
Okay.

311
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,790
Let's do better this time.

312
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,690
Fighting.

313
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,790
Please! Spare me!

314
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,440
Seong Wuk, come here.

315
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,740
What's all this?

316
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,900
That the rules of the game you
set suddenly changed.

317
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,590
You got a text from Min Ho.

318
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,710
And someone who knew all about this showed up.

319
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,440
Dong Hyeon has always been
bad at explaining things.

320
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,020
I have no idea what this all means.

321
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:10,560
G-Gwang Jin, the bobber moved. The bobber.

322
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,410
Don't worry.

323
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,170
No, no. The bobber moved.

324
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:20,160
That bastard is lying.

325
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,670
Should I tell you a secret?

326
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:31,140
There's no fish in here.

327
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,700
Instead of Dong Hyeon, who's bad at explaining,

328
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,020
you should explain, so I can
understand, Seong Wuk.

329
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,340
Why did you dig up Min Ho?

330
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,800
<i>According to the DNA test,</i>

331
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,650
it was Park Min Ho you mentioned,
who went missing 15 years ago.

332
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,720
What's the cause of death?

333
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,060
We suspect it was a skull fracture,

334
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,870
but I think the direct cause was a car accident.

335
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,370
Car accident?

336
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:30,030
He had compound fractures throughout the body.

337
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,810
The body will be moved to the
designated hospital morgue today.

338
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,800
I'll contact them to arrange the transfer.

339
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,470
Okay. Thank you.

340
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,550
Car accident?

341
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,260
This is it.

342
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,380
All right...

343
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,660
Long time no see, Min Ho.
[Body Bag: Park Min Ho]

Excuse me.

347
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,090
There was an accident, apparently.

348

Accident?

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,670
What are you talking about?

350
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,100
Park Min Ho's body was taken?

351
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,580
<i>We were waiting for it to arrive.</i>

352
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,680
They caused a collision and took the body.

00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,560
Excuse me.

355
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,470
What's wrong, Go Eun?

356
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,150
- It's the gym Im Dong Hyeon owns.
<i>- There's been a fire at a gym in Seoul.</i>

363
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:47,230
<i>for fixing games was found drowned to death.</i>

364
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,900
<i>The police stated Coach Jo...</i>

365
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,710
Im Dong Hyeon and Jo Seong Wuk
were definitely murdered.

366
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,090
They couldn't have died
at the same time otherwise.

367
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:59,300
Park Min Ho's body was stolen, too.

368
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,550
All of these were done by the same person.

369
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,510
A perpetrator who's never shown himself.

370
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,410
Why would he...

371
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,060
Mr. Park is in danger.

372
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,460
You didn't croak yet, old man.

373
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,770
Who are you?

374
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,220
Me?

375
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,340
Park Min Ho.

376
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,510
You aren't.

377
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,000
Park Min Ho.

378
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,380
Jingwang University's volleyball player No. 10.

379
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,020
Right side hitter.

380
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,140
You totally lost it, old man.

381
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,850
He likes vegetable bibimbap.

382
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:54,730
There's no way he found Min Ho in this state.

383
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,970
There must be someone helping you.

384
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,550
Right? Who is it?

385
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,760
He likes Girls' Generation.

386
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,910
G-Girls' Generation?

387
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:17,920
He likes to take photographs.

388
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,060
You must be excited to go out, old man.

389
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,330
Dong Su!

390
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,880
Who are you people? Move!

391
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,020
Mr. Jang.

392
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,590
So, it's you.

393
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,560
The Girls' Generation member
who's been helping this old man.

394
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,810
Are you the one who took Park Min Ho's body?

395
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,120
Hyungnim!

396
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,620
Mr. Park, are you okay?

397
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,650
Wow. You're quick.

398
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,320
Answer the phone.

399
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,240
<i>That bastard was pretty strong.</i>

400
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,250
<i>Yes. He must've been in the Special Forces.</i>

401
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:03,770
Yes. Let's set up the equipment.

402
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,960
Make it special.

403
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,850
I smell a strong scent of cash.

404
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,070
Cheon Gwang Jin.

405
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:40,410
He's the grandson of Jingwang
Foundation's founding executive director.

406
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,330
The money from the sports game
betting websites Im Dong Hyeon

407
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:47,140
and Jo Seong Wuk used ultimately
went to Cheon Gwang Jin as well.

408
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,500
Hold on.

409
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,990
Founding executive director?

410
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,510
The grave where Park Min Ho was buried.

411
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,990
That was the foundation director's grave.

412
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,730
Hold on.

413
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,050
He hid someone else's body in his grandma's grave?

414
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:03,140
- Geez.
- He's a total psycho.

415
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:08,150
That's why Jo Seong Wuk was
Jingwang University's coach for a long time.

416
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,930
The worst part right now is that

417
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,430
they currently have Park Min Ho's body.

418
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,630
But why did they steal his body?

419
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,480
I just don't understand it.

420
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,670
Because it's the only thing that's left.

421
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,200
The ones who know the secret from 15 years ago.

422
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,100
Im Dong Hyeon and Jo Seong Wuk are dead.

423
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,190
And there's no evidence left anymore.

424
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,100
Getting rid of Park Min Ho's body will

425
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,940
forever remove the truth of that day.

426
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,800
If so,

427
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,600
we won't be able to help Mr. Park, either.

428
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,520
That's why...

429
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,920
we need to go immediately.

430
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,490
I was a little worried that you
might want to go alone.

431
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,150
Cheon Gwang Jin. He's feisty and dangerous.

432
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,590
I might not be able to handle him alone.

433
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,070
We have to go together.

434
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:29,000
Of course. You can't handle that
crazy bastard on your own.

435
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,240
Yes. We'll fight like crazy by your side.

436
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,630
We don't have to go crazy, too, Hyungnim.

437
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,110
Is that so?

438
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,900
Hey, Girls' Generation.

439
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,880
I never said that was my name.

440
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,020
How much did the senile old man pay you?

441
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,690
I can pay you a lot more.

442
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,830
I prefer not to discuss money over the phone.

443
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,530
- Should we talk in person?
- Gosh.

444
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,860
We're on the same page.

445
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,410
I'm glad we are.

446
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,850
I'll send an address. Meet me in an hour.

447
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,070
You won't find Min Ho's bones if you're late.

448
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:14,450
Aigoo, aigoo. He's already fired up.

449
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,790
[The Grandmother and Her Grandson]

450
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:33,000
The map is already giving me bad feelings.

451
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,110
Why? What's this place?

452
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,880
It's a forgotten place.

453
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,840
A forgotten place?

454
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,560
What's he doing?

455
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,440
He won't come or tell you to come in.

456
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,210
I think he's checking if I'm alone.

457
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,410
No car is following him.

458
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,290
Why is there a school in a place like this?

459
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,290
What do you think? Do you like this place?

460
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:40,300
<i>You invited me. Shouldn't you
greet me in person?</i>

461
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,100
Look to the right.

462
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,430
<i>You see the door with Xs on it, right?</i>

463
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,080
<i>Come in through there.</i>

464
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,230
<i>What do you think?</i>

465
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,710
Isn't it a cool school?

466
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,720
When I was in elementary school,
I was playing with a friend

467
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,680
and killed him by accident.

468
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,020
<i>My family thought I made a mistake and</i>

469
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,280
<i>covered it up for me.</i>

470
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,570
<i>But my grandma figured out what happened.</i>

471
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,500
That it wasn't a mistake.

472
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,940
Geez. Isn't it so crazy when you think about it?

473
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,350
How did Grandma figure it out?

474
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,800
<i>So, she built this school urgently.</i>

475
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,850
To trap me here after I graduated
from elementary school.

476
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,820
Sounds like the school resembles you.

477
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,380
It's filled with nothing but trash.

478
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,690
My grandma was trash, not me.

479
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,690
She shouldn't have done that
to her grandson as a grown-up.

480
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,880
But do you know what's crazier?

481
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,630
I found out about her plan.

482
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,960
You should've left the bygones be bygones.

483
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,070
Why are you digging things up now? Huh?

484
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,600
Where's Park Min Ho's body right now?

485
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,730
Oh, right. That's why you came.

486

Let's play a game using that.

Wow. Look at him using the structure.

Gosh. The stake is skyrocketing.

This is why you need a strong fighting dog.

Shit. Can't you control properly, you bastard?

546
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,650
I didn't do that.

547
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:00,380

548
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,450
- What?
- The direction keys are not working.

549
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:05,080

You know what?

598
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,710
Falling from the third floor is

599
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:51,960
similar to getting hit by a car
driving 60 km per hour.

600
