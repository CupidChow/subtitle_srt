(Children and animals were filmed under guidelines.)

8
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,580
Can you tell me...

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,150
what has happened to you?

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,360
(Thank you. You've been phished.)

11
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,989
What is this?

12
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,930
If the police weren't going to do anything,

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,330
I decided I'd have to fight that jerk my own way.

14
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,400
From that moment on,

15
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,270
he started tormenting me in these bizarre ways.

16
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,800
The retaliation against Ms. Yoo from the beginning...

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
seems to be a mix of two different M.O.s.

18
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,180
One is meticulous and timid,

19
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,110
like a diligent, low-level con artist.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,450
The other is bold, cruel,

21
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,580
and enjoys playing sadistic games.

22
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,660
So like you said, it's not one guy, but a whole group?

23
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,260
That voice is our general manager.

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,930
Where is he right now?

25
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,610
It felt like they were freelancers on a platform that jerk provided.

26
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,580
That's what I thought was strange too.

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,640
It's not like it's some startup,

28
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,010
but believe me, they treated crime like it was some high-paying gig.

29
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,180
They were even bragging about their experience.

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,990
And since that jerk provided manuals and all the needed supplies,

31
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,120
it's no wonder it didn't feel like a real crime to them.

32
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,490
Given this structure, instead of catching these grunts,

33
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,700
we have to catch the mastermind, that jerk, who's holed up.

34
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,530
Right.

35
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,000
By the way, what about Chief Choi? Where did he go?

36
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,540
He wanted to wrap this up himself.

37
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,880
You don't remember my voice, do you?

38
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,950
No.

39
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,420
Of course you don't. You've scammed too many to remember.

40
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,090
But I...

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,560
I remember your voice as clear as day.

(General Manager)

43
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,740
That's how personal this is for me.

44
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,740
What?

46
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,010
What? What's going on?

47
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,220
Are you...

48
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,050
in some kind of trouble?

50
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,260
I'm leaving the country.

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,060
I got a better-paying offer.

52
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,030
Gosh, you scared me. Darn it.

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,470
Come on, you have to warn me. This really puts me in a bind.

54
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,340
Sorry.

55
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,640
This was a sudden decision.

56
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,010
This was just a really sudden decision.

57
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,910
Then you know you forfeit your bonus, right?

58
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,910
Yes. I'm sorry.

59
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,190
Gosh, why are kids these days so flaky?

60
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,760
He'll be posting a new job listing soon.

61
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,530
Good job.

62
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,510
Darn it.

(Help wanted: High-paying part-time gig)

64
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,780
Chief Choi wrapped things up nicely. The job ad is up.

65
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,690
He said if someone has to infiltrate the jerks' den,

66
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,020
he wants to be the one to go in. He wants to finish the job for good.

67
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,860
Chief Choi?

68
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,430
I told him no. It's too dangerous as they've already heard his voice.

69
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,730
And I can't go either. I'm too scared.

70
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,930
I'll go.

71
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,300
So? Do I look like a convincing con artist?

72
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,270
- You bet. - Yes. A total natural.

73
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,380
- Shall we begin? - Yes.

74
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,610

79
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,650
Why do they suddenly need a selfie? This is ridiculous.

80
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,890
Go Eun. Not on your left cheek.

81
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,160
You need to make a peace sign on your right cheek.

82

Oh, on my right cheek.

83
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,430
Isn't this ridiculous?

84
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,360
For a job interview, they just told me...

85
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,660
to send a selfie out of the blue with no explanation.

86
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,800

00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,740

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,740

It's an interview, but it's not in person?

94
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,800
There's no need to see each other's faces.

95

As long as we do our jobs well, that's all that matters.

I suppose that's true.

97

I hear that a lot. They say I'll get great results.

101
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,290
Have you ever done this type of work?

102
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,260
I've done telemarketing. Recruiting members over the phone.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not planning to do this long.

Right, of course.

just answer me.

- You got the box, right? - Yes.

122

The manual explains how you'll be working.

123
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,720
Most of the documents and programs you need are already on the laptop.

124
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,500
Don't upload text for descriptions. Take a screenshot and upload that.

125
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Because sometimes you get weirdos who copy the text to search for it.

126
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,740
Got it.

127
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,470
And don't make the description too detailed.

128
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,870
Just say, "It's a new, unopened birthday gift."

129
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,780
- That way, you get fewer questions. - Okay.

130
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,450
You'll figure this out as you go,

131
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,079
but when you get a call,

132
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,180
first confirm which item they're calling about.

133
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,490
- Okay. - As for the rest, read the manual,

134
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,090
and if you have any questions, ask the person next to you.

135
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,630
Okay.

Wait, what's this ticket for?

150
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,080
An issue right before the meetup has delayed the deal.

151
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,790
He got into a car accident on the way or something, right?

152
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,290
Yes, I think that was it.

153
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,390
So much for that deal.

154
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,890
What? What a waste.

155
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,330
You do mind if I try calling them back?

who was supposed to buy concert tickets from my brother?

161
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,190
- Yes. - My brother was coming to meet you.

162
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,690
You heard he was in a car accident, right?

163
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,590
Yes.

164
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,830
He died.

165
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,070
Why did she go from zero to a hundred like that?

166
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,070

Well, if you say so, Go Eun, I'll do it.

Thank you. Just a moment then.

171
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,590
I just sent you the account number. Once you transfer the money,

172
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,360
I'll go to the post office and mail you the tickets right away.

173
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,930

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,200
Go Eun has some serious skills.

181
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,140
Turns out I'm a natural.

182
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,840
And we almost didn't sell it. What a waste that would've been.

183
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,520
Hey, General Manager, see that?

184
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,620
Did you see me pull that off?

185
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,890
Go Eun. I'm impressed.

186
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,520
I mean, how did you get so good, so fast?

187
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,560
What can I say?

188
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,190
Just one thing, though.

189
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,600
You gave them the wrong account number.

190
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,200
What? There's no way.

191
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,770
It seems you accidentally gave them your own account number.

192
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,340
No, I didn't. I gave them the correct one.

193
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,540
Maybe they just haven't sent the money yet.

194
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
Go Eun.

195
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,610
I got your account number so I could pay you your commission. Remember?

196
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,680
Well, yes.

199
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,860
I also set up text alerts for any deposits made to it.

200
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:45,730
- Remember? - You set up text alerts for it?

201
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,470
So, don't even think about lying...

202
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,170
and transfer the money to the designated account.

203
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Right now.

204
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,540
So you mean...

205
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,410
you get those alerts too?

206
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,780
So I'm totally busted, right?

207
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,320
Okay! You caught me, so I quit. Bye.

208
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,760
Hello?

209
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,120
Well, that was fun.

210
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,590
Hello?

211
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,300
Goodbye, everyone! I'm out of here!

212
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,740
- Hey! What's up with the computer? - What's going on?

213
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,110
This is ransomware.

214
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,450
Why is this happening all of a sudden?

215
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,110
Ransomware?

216
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,150
What security are you running that you get hit with ransomware?

217
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,260
I'm sending you the kit again.

218

220

What do you think you're doing?

221
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,870
I specifically told you to send all of it.

222
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,570
What? Why?

223
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,610
It's my fee for teaching you the ropes.

224
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,040
Besides, I got the money on that call,

225
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,010
so it's all my money. Why would any of it be yours?

226
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,110
No, Go Eun. You're wrong.

227
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,610
Hey, I'm talking here.

228
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,649
We did all the work. You just came in at the very end...

229
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,390
and made one phone call. Am I wrong?

230
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,960
I guess my voice is more convincing. Hey, even you said so.

231
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,790
This is your last chance.

232
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,560
While I'm still being nice,

233
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,530
send me the money.

234
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,570
Listen to that change in tone. Did I strike a nerve?

235
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,270
Did our dear General Manager get triggered?

236
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,170
Are you triggered?

237
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,330
This stupid woman...

238
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,270
has no idea who she's messing with.

239
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,500
What do you think, Mango Seven?

240
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,210
I said, what do you think?

241
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,480
That darn idiot. How dare she...

242
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,380
mess with me?

243
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,560
Fine.

244
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,720
Let's see which one of us goes down.

245
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,030
But do you really think that jerk will take the bait?

246
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,900
We'll be in a tough spot if he doesn't.

247
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,470
I've already told everyone.

248
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,540
Are they really coming? We're all starving over here.

249
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,110
- Are they really on their way? - Just wait a little longer, please.

250
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:48,810
What?

251
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,420
- They're here! Thank goodness. - Over here!

252
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,320
- This way. - Come on, this way. All the way in.

253
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,690
- This way. All right, over here. - Come on in.

254
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,390
This way.

255
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,060
Okay, this way. All right, this way.

256
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,460

257
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,700
Right this way.

258
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,270

259

262
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,219
How did you know?

263
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,060
I do mukbang videos. Do you want to subscribe?

264
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,930
Yes, just put them over there. Thank you.

265
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,570
Thanks. Gosh, what a spread!

266
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,900
Hey, what gives?

267
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,240
Hey, you should've ordered some makguksu too.

268
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,380
Seriously? You got jokbal but no makguksu? You have no taste.

269
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
Why?

270
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,390
Why are you so darn cheerful?

271
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,690
Messing with that jerk is fun,

272
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,960
- but it'll be okay, right? - No. You have to push him harder.

273
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Thank you.

274
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,000
Enough to make him contact Chief Choi.

275
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,600

00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,810
Hey, why are you taking that?

359
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,580
This stuff is all going back to its rightful owners.

360
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,810
Bangwool too. Bangwool, let's go.

361
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,620
- Seriously, who are you people? - Gosh, there, there.

362
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,820
Why are you doing this to me?

363
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,590
You buy the stuff you want to use and use it all you want.

364
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,830
Then you take pictures to use for yet another scam.

365
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,030
I'm sure you thought it was a brilliant business model.

366
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,530
Hey, just wait!

367
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,970
If it's about the money,

368
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,310
I can pay you.

369
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,710
The kids you hired for your scheme all took off.

370
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,080
And what are you going to pay me with?

371
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,540
You think you have anything left that's worth any money?

372
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,050
Look.

373
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,550
Sir.

374
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,760
Haven't you ever wanted to get into this line of work?

375
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,230
I'm telling you, the money is really good.

376
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,930
With a bit of seed money...

377
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,929
All you need is a little seed money,

378
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,200
and you can get it all set up in no time.

379
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,370
I can introduce you to all the pros. For real!

380
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,709
Does it not occur to you that you should apologize...

381
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,850
to the victims who suffered damage from you?

382
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,250
No, wait, that's not...

383
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,150
That just goes to show you what a sweet deal this is.

384
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,890
Listen. They say...

385
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,660
everyone gets three big breaks in life.

386
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,630
This is one of yours right now.

387
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:21,110
A package just arrived. I requested an AS.

388
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,150
Once you see what's in there, you'll understand what I mean.

389
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,980
AS?

390
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,650
Hey, come on.

391
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,290
I'll go get it and show you myself.

392
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,590
Don't get me wrong.

393
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,330
I'm not trying to run away. Trust me.

394
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,500
(After Service)

395
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,410
See? What did I tell you?

396
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,540
Look.

397
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,080
The pros take care of everything. I'm telling you.

398
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,980
Isn't this a gold mine?

399
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,320
(After Service)

400
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,160
After service.

401
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,480
Wait a minute.

402
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,550
I don't think you should open that.

403
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,580
It's fine, I'm telling you.

404
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,880
This is how our system works.

405
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,230
- It's a power bank. - Don't pick it up!

406
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,610
Hey! Stay with me.

407
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,320
I'm glad you're not seriously hurt.

408
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,150
I know.

409
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,090
Driver Kim, that was way too close.

410
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,990
I'm fine. I just got lucky.

411
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,060
The news just reported it as a death from an exploding power bank.

412
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,860
- So, is this case closed then? - No.

413
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,630
There's still more we need to find out.

414
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,300
Haven't you ever wanted to get into this line of work?

415
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,370
All you need is a little seed money,

416
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,070
and you can get it all set up in no time.

417
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,080
I can introduce you to all the pros. For real!

418
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,380
I thought that was strange too.

419
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,880
I was wondering how a 23-year-old, fresh out of the military,

420
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,850
could set up such a sophisticated criminal enterprise.

421
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,220
I know. When we met him,

422
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,960
he didn't seem like he could set up a burner phone properly.

423
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,930
I think he paid the seed money and had all the supplies delivered.

424
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,400
A package just arrived. I requested an AS.

425
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,370
Once you see what's in there, you'll understand what I mean.

426
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,640
In the end, that AS turned out to be...

427
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,610
a way to eliminate him.

428
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,050
A suspicious AS request,

429
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,980
a strange package,

430
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,460
and the seafood truck that delivered it.

431
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,730
There are people out there running a business...

432
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,330
that caters to aspiring criminals.

433
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,410
I'll go through the data again and see if I can find any leads.

434
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,750
(Welcome to Samheung Island.)

435
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,490
(Police)

436
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,700
You're back early.

437
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,060
(Police)

438
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,600
Was the auction a bust?

439
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,040
Gosh.

440
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:51,270
When I ask you something, answer me. Even a short one.

441
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:55,650
Just staring at me in silence makes you look suspicious.

442
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,920
Gosh. Am I talking to myself here?

443
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,950
Go on.

444
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
(Police)

445
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,160
He's so uptight.

446
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,630
Hey!

447
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,170
Nice day.

448
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,010
The waves

449
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,720
And the water

450
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,720
The sea of women

451
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,470
I reviewed all the data we've gathered,

452
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,010
and there was nothing unusual.

453
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,310
Really?

454
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,150
Judging by your tone, it feels like there's more to it.

455
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,750
But I did find something suspicious.

456
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,890
What's the difference between "unusual" and "suspicious"?

457
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,090
First,

458
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,690
I tracked the fish truck by the plate that Driver Kim gave us.

459
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,130
(Vehicle Registration)

460
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,300
It's registered to a seafood restaurant on Samheung Island.

461
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:58,300
That's the island at the north tip, right?

462
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,240
Samheung Island. I've never even heard of it.

463
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,670
You could probably see North Korea from there.

464
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,680
And there's one more thing. It was in that jerk's things.

465
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,050
A Lotus Lantern Number Tag he got for hanging a lantern at a temple.

466
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,510
A Lotus Lantern Number Tag?

467
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,020
It's not unusual to hang a lantern to make a wish.

468
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,190
But...

469
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,420
the temple where he paid good money for a lantern just happens to be...

470
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,190
Samheung Temple.

471
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,430
You're right.

472
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,770
It's not unusual, but it's definitely suspicious.

473
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,140
There's no bridge to the island, so you have to take a boat.

474
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,740
- Mr. Jang. - Yes?

475
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,210
How about we go fishing? It's been a while.

476
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
Fishing? Sounds great.

477
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,230
We came all this way to fish and even rented a Deluxe Taxi.

478
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,070
We'd better catch a big one.

479
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,340
Here we are.

480
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:13,980
- Let's go. - Okay.

481
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:19,050
(Deluxe Taxi)

482
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
(Police)

483
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,810
What do you know? I didn't expect to see a taxi out here.

484
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,510
(Samheung Beach)

485
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,640
It's locked.

486
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,180
(Welcome to Samheung Inn)

487
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,930
(Samheung Inn)

488
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,960
(Front Desk)

489
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,050
(Samheung Inn)

490
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,390
(Front Desk)

491
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,560
Excuse us. The door was locked.

492
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,190
Here to fish?

493
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,960
Yes. We thought we'd stay a few days and find some good spots.

494
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,770
Know any good spots around here?

495
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,000
You came in a taxi?

496
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,910
We knew there wasn't much out here, so we just hired one for the trip.

497
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,480
You're the first guests I've had come here in a taxi to go fishing.

498
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,710
Here you go.

499
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,720
So, about the payment...

500
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,289
You can pay when you check out.

501
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,090
Just leave the key at the counter when you go out.

502
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,220
Your room's that way.

503
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,560
Okay.

504
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,130
Thank you.

505
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,230
(Samheung Inn: Fully Equipped)

506
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,600
(Welcome)

507
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,470
She's not exactly the welcoming type.

508
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,870
Let's just drop off our stuff and head right to Samheung Temple.

509
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,180
Okay.

510
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,690
(Deluxe Taxi)

511
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,230
Goodness.

512
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,930
This is quite a climb.

513
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,300
Even for the most devout Buddhist,

514
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:33,440
isn't it strange to come so far just to hang one lantern?

515
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,610
Let's go up and see.

516
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
Okay.

517
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,420
(Samheung Temple)

518
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,910
Hello?

519
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,250
Is anyone here?

520
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,830
They're supposed to be wish lanterns,

521
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,130
but they look just like a giant accounting ledger.

522
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
An accounting ledger?

523
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:10,740
They're all in the same format. Name, date,

524
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,240
- and the numbers at the bottom... - What do you think you're doing?

525
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,590
We received a trespassing complaint.

526
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,460
A complaint?

527
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:31,790
That's right.

528
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,570
They said some rats were scurrying around as if they owned the place.

529
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:45,240
I guess this is private property. We had no idea.

530
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
But...

531
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,580
fishermen don't usually come this far up.

532
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,650
You know,

533
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,890
fishing's so popular these days, it's packed everywhere.

534
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,320
We were looking for a quieter spot,

535
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,890
and we ended up all the way out here.

536
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,800
But how did you know we were here to go fishing?

537
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,770
You're dressed for it.

538
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,510
So,

539
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,450
why come here instead of going fishing?

540
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,920
It's not high tide, so we had time to kill and decided to look around.

541
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:34,420
A young guy like you knows about the West Sea's tides?

542
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,360
Anyway,

543
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,360
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

544
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,970
Before this gets any more out of hand,

545
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,400
let's get out of here.

546
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,670
Yes, Mr. Jang.

547
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,650
(Samheung Temple)

548
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,620
No matter how I think about it, something's fishy about that temple.

549
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,860
And that cop who kicked us out was shady too.

550
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,130
I think that's the most suspicious part.

551
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:30,550
They can't be delivering fish to a Buddhist temple.

552
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,520
Or maybe this isn't a temple at all.

553
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,590
Excuse me? Driver?

554
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,890
Oh, hello

555
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,420
You weren't here, so I let myself in.

556
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,530
I was hoping you'd give me a lift on your way down.

557
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:48,960
I've got a lot of stuff with me.

558
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,070
Besides, this is the only road down from here,

559
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,970
so it's not like you're going out of your way.

560
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,140
I'll pay for half the fare.

561
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,040
What do you say?

562
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,550
I'd really appreciate it. It's a long walk down otherwise.

563
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:10,220
I don't mind. Let's give him a ride, driver.

564
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,220
Yes, sir.

565
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,260
The driver...

566
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,190
is pretty young. Thank you.

567
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,580
So, I've been staying here for about two weeks now,

568
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,480
and you're the first outsiders I've seen.

569
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:41,880
(Deluxe Taxi)

570
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,190
So, driver, you came here with him?

571
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,290
Yes.

572
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,390
I see you're into photography.

573
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,800
Well, it's more than just a hobby.

574
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,670
I'm a professional photographer.

575
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,470
Oh, you're a photographer.

576
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,670
But is there anything worth shooting here?

577
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,640
The sunset glows...

578
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,450
are really something else on this island.

579
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,150
It's way more intense than anywhere else,

580
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,280
and the afterglow lingers for a really long time.

581
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:20,160
So I've been all over the island taking photos.

582
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,120
I see.

583
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,630
Gosh, we got here so fast by car.

584
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,560
Thanks for the nice, comfortable ride.

585
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,330
You can just let me out right up ahead.

586
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Sure.

587
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,020
But don't you think it's a little strange?

588
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,450
Sorry? What do you mean?

589
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:52,250
The people here on the island.

590
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,190
Don't you find them a little odd?

591
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:57,730
How can I put this?

592
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,760
It's they lack the human touch.

593
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,440
But hey, that's actually better for my art.

594
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,640
Anyway, thanks again.

595
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,680
And good luck with the fishing!

596
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,430
Seems like everyone we meet knows we're here to go fishing.

597
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,060
And he didn't even pay the fare.

598
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:46,540
(Samheung Beach)

599
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,480
(Samheung Inn)

600
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,090
I'm going to go get the key.

601
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,690
- I'll get our stuff. - Got it.

602
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,200
(Samheung Inn)

603
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,470
(Front desk)

604
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,360
It was locked again?

605
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,859
I just grabbed one. She wouldn't say anything, would she?

606
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:37,890
No, it'll be fine.

607
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,060
- Let me get that. - Thanks.

608
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,770
You know, I was thinking.

609
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,840
I think your point is valid.

610
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,940
You said they could be using the Great Hall as their ledger.

611
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,550
We should probably go back tomorrow and take another look.

612
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,550
We should probably meet with the head monk again too.

613
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,190
Hold on a second.

614
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,590
What is this?

615
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,970
So you're back from fishing.

616
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:31,940
But you didn't catch a thing.

617
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,620
I was hoping to buy some fish off you.

618
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,480
(Samheung Inn)

619
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,650
I don't see what the big deal is. He was just trying to buy some fish.

620
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,550
Excuse me? What are you talking about?

621
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:21,589
It's your fault you caught no fish. How is that the buyer's fault?

622
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:22,860
Hey, excuse me, ma'am.

623
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:25,530
Maybe you'll catch some tomorrow.

624
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,130
Since you're here to fish and all.

625
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,369
Hey, wait a minute.

626
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,730
(Welcome)

627
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Ma'am!

628
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,000
I can't believe what you're saying.

629
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:39,610
Sir, let's just go.

630
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:53,120
She should at least apologize for letting him in without asking.

631
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:56,530
Isn't that the least she could do? It's just common sense.

632
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,390
I know. They somehow make it seem like we're the ones in the wrong.

633
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:04,430
We'd better lock the door tight. How am I meant to sleep like this?

634
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:07,540
They won't come back, will they? We didn't even catch any fish.

635
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,310
- Or not? Are we the fish? - Unbelievable.

636
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:18,980
What is it? Did you see something?

637
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,260
It's nothing, sir.

638
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,490
Let's get going.

639
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:30,890
Okay.

640
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,790
You'd better catch a lot of fish today.

641
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,250
That's the plan.

642
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,320
Any luck with what I asked you to look up?

643
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:04,390
His real name is Kim Woo Jong. He's 23.

644
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:06,799
Records show he went to Cambodia at 19...

645
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,530
and returned one and a half years later.

646
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:10,770
But I did find something strange.

647
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:12,830
Something strange?

648
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,799
While checking his criminal record,

649
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,310
I found he visited a prison once.

650
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:21,910
And guess who it was?

651
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:27,420
Lee Gi Hyeon, ringleader of the Cambodian Mango Plantation scam.

652
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,019
He was caught two and a half years ago...

653
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,290
and is currently serving time.

654
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:33,520
So Lee Gi Hyeon is the ringleader of the Mango Plantation scam,

655
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,490
and that Kim Woo Jong guy has a record of entering Cambodia.

656
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,060
And he went to visit him in prison.

657
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,460
That's how a kid barely in his 20s was able to set up...

658
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:44,300
a professional criminal operation.

659
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,540
How are things on your end, Driver Kim?

660
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:48,070
Over here?

661
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:51,410
The people here are a bit unfriendly.

662
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,110
Unfriendly?

663
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,780
Wait a second.

664
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:05,890
The fish truck and the photographer are heading for the mainland.

665
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,560
Go Eun.

666
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:11,030
Got it. We'll tail them once they get to the mainland.

667
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,460
All right.

668
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:19,030
What? A police car too.

669
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,640
This means the coast is clear.

670
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:30,150
Do Gi, shouldn't you go now to check for that ledger you mentioned?

671
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:34,020
I guess that means you'll have to go fishing by yourself, Mr. Jang.

672
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,220
All right, everyone, let's get moving.

673
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,590
- Yes! - Yes!

674
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:05,180
(Deluxe Taxi)

675
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:23,670
(Service in session, no entry, Head Monk of Samheung Temple)

676
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:36,870
So they were watching everything from here.

677
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,880
(Employee Manual)

678
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:31,590
(Alumni Association of Auditors, Judicial Research and Training Inst)

679
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,710
Mister!

680
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,240
Da Som!

681
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:52,280
- How have you been? - Good. How about you?

682
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,250
I've been good too.

683
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,620
I came to ask you something.

684
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,320
What is it?

685
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,489
The gift you wanted to get your dad...

686
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:04,690
Gloves.

687
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,830
That's right. Gloves.

688
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,400
- Leather gloves. - Right, leather gloves.

689
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:11,700
Were they black?

690
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,370
Yes, that's right. Black leather gloves.

691
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,970
By any chance,

692
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:20,140
do they look like these?

693
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:25,150
That's them! These are the ones!

694
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:29,380
Thank you. Thank you so much, my hero!

695
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,190
- Dad! - Da Som.

696
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,030
I knew you'd help us.

697
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,300
You're so amazing.

698
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:48,870
Thanks.

699
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,070
A present for you, Dad.

700
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:56,240
The doctor said you have to keep your hands warm, so I bought them.

701
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,080
Where did you get these?

702
00:57:58,410 --> 00:57:59,510
From my hero.

703
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,220
Your hero?

704
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,060
You don't like the candy?

705
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,730
No, it's sweet.

706
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,960
Then why are you crying?

707
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,270
You'll understand when you're older, Maria.

708
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:24,640
You just will.
