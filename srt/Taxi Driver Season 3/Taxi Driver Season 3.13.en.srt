31
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,350

How would I know a Lee Gi Hyeon, punk?

52
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,960
- Why'd you hit me? - Because you know him, I have to?

No, I mean...

He actually came for a visit last week.

62
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,200
He said he wants to get into this line of work for real...

63
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,600
and asked for an introduction.

64
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,300

108

But...

182
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,070
I have the idea, but I wasn't sure how to write it in a compelling way.

183
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,940
I just couldn't get a feel for it at all.

184
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,270
But after hearing your real-life stories,

185
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,650
I feel like, "This is how to write. This is how to make it compelling."

186
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,820
It's like my writer's block has been completely cleared.

187

Hey.

298
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,240

300

Hey, just because I'm wearing this uniform in a place like this,

305
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,360
- do I look that friendly to you? - Aren't police officers supposed...

306
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,700
to be a helping hand for the citizens?

307
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,240

308
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,350
Yes.

309
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,340
I'm sorry.

310
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,240
I was wrong.

311
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:22,450
I'm really bad at this. I don't want to do it.

312
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,180

313
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,150
Go Eun?

00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,390
Can you hear me?

315
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,490
If you're trying to call your friends,

316
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,630
they won't pick up.

Driver.

318
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,740
If you haven't eaten yet, join me for gukbap.

319
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,310
Go on, eat.

320
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,840
Meat at a temple? That's new.

321
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,080
What did you mean when you said I couldn't reach my friends?

322
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,020
I was just telling it like it is.

323
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,890
Oh, right.

324
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,220
And they might not be reachable from now on either.

325
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,630
After you finish this gukbap we'll bring your friends here,

326
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,530
or we'll take you to them.

327
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,300
So eat up.

328
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,180
But I already finished my military service, so why...

329
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,150
I don't want to.

330
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,080
I won't go.

331
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,390
Gosh, I hate this.

332
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,560
I was wrong.

333
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,200
I'll be better from now on.

334
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,630
Goodness.

335
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,910
There's something I'm curious about.

336
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,740
I'd like our driver... Or rather, Kim Do Gi, to answer it.

337
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,650
The CEO of a taxi company said he came to this island for fishing,

338
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,490
and two of his employees tailed me to the mainland.

339
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,860
While the company's accountant was tailing our Choi.

340
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,030
Don't you have some explaining to do?

341
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,700
Explain? What's to explain?

342
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,600
I'm the one who ordered it.

343
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,140
Gosh, you gotta be in sync to get anything done.

344
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,070
The fools went and got caught.

345
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,050
I hear you told the monk you wanted to hang a lantern?

346
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,250
Do you even know what that means?

347
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,750
Making a wish come true,

348
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,550
I don't mean that.

349
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,190
Woo Jong told me about it.

350
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,860
He said with some seed money, it's a sure way to make a killing.

351
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,660
Woo Jong.

352
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,300
- You mean that Kim Woo Jong? - Yes, but the jerk...

353
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,440
only gave me half the story before he disappeared on me.

354
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,310
So I had no way of knowing who the "professional" was.

355
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,750
What did you do for a living before this?

356
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,780
You mean, before I was a taxi driver?

357
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,020
Yes.

358
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,090
It's a real tearjerker.

359
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,390
Right. I'll do my best to hold it together.

360
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,590
Man, where do I even begin?

361
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,300
At first,

362
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,200
I really did try to live an honest life.

363
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,270
Really?

364
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,010
I used to teach high school math.

365
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,910
It's nice to meet you all.

366
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:53,150
I swore I'd devote my life to those kids, but...

367
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,650
No, his entire group was captured!

368
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,519
Seung Tae, we got busted for pot!

369
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,160
Those darn kids and their pot!

370
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,530
Oh, right.

371
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,460
The students were out of control, so I quit.

372
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,130
A school teacher? I wouldn't have guessed.

373
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,000
I figured a desk job was better, so I joined a web storage company.

374
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,710
But then the CEO suddenly exploded.

375
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,720
- I didn't last long there either. - Oh, no.

376
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,790
That's when I started to think,

377
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,020
"Maybe I'm just not cut out for a regular 9-to-5."

378
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,290
So, I...

379
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,790
switched to a totally different line of work.

380
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,330
What kind of work?

381
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,630
Importing burner phones from overseas...

382
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,670
and supplying them to people in Korea.

383
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,300
So you were a burner phone broker?

384
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,169
The money was good,

385
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,110
but then I ran into a prosecutor.

386
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,240
So that venture didn't last long either.

387
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,510
Long time no see.

388
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,449
Remember the one in Gunsan?

389
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,680
The one who did phishing from a Chinese restaurant?

390
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,520
You mean Rim Bok Ja.

391
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,560
You don't have to trust me. Just have some of this snow crab.

392
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,190
Okay, thanks.

393
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,730
Anyway, after that,

394
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,170
I thought my bad luck must be from some kind of curse,

395
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,340
so I actually became a shaman.

396
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,680
Did that help at all?

397
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,850
Turns out my spiritual mojo ran out, so that was a bust.

398
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,810
Besides all that,

399
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,880
I also worked as a bouncer at a club for a bit...

400
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,420
Since we're being honest...

401
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,990
I even did a short stint in jail.

402
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,830
Gosh, so embarrassing.

403
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,560
Let me get this straight.

404
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,669
You were a teacher, but you quit...

405
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,440
because your students shook you down.

406
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,300
You sold fermented seafood, and then you got a job at a company,

407
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,870
but you quit because the boss made you kill a chicken.

408
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,940
He blew up! The boss blew up!

409
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:03,910
You started dealing burner phones, but ran when a DA was after you.

410
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,680
You became a shaman, but you quit because you had no powers.

411
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,250
Hey, I almost cut my foot off dancing on those blades.

412
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,990
You worked as a bouncer at a club, but then the cops raided the place.

413
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,860
Yes, apparently it was a drug den or something.

414
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,030
And so now,

415
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,100
you've learned to drive,

416
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,970
and you're a taxi driver.

417
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Is this...

418
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,510
really one person's life? It's like a con artist's resume.

419
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,680
I told you it was a tearjerker, didn't I?

420
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,750
(Temp. Teacher: Confirmed, U-Data: Confirmed)

421
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,920
(Gunsan Burner Phones: Confirmed, Prison Incarceration: Confirmed)

422
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,990
How interesting.

423
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,800
Thinking back,

424
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,030
my life really has been a roller coaster.

425
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,100
Mr. Kim Do Gi,

426
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,540
there's just one thing that you're missing.

427
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
Something I'm missing?

428
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,050
Your single biggest shortcoming...

429
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,880
is your lack of an owner's mindset. A sense of ownership, you get it?

430
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,690
You never tried to take charge yourself.

431
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,120
You were always trying to work under someone else.

432
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,730
That's been your biggest downfall.

433
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,890
What a shame.

434
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,330
If only you hadn't done that, by now,

435
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,770
your life could've been different. What a shame.

436
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,680
So that I can finally take charge,

437
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,750
I'll accept your help.

438
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,460
Sure, let's do that.

439
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,160
Let's put our heads together...

440
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,570
and really think this through.

441
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,200
And as for the people you came with,

442
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,410
I'll have them escorted to the place where you're staying, Kim Do Gi,

443
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,710
so they can be comfortable while they're here.

444
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,390
Is everyone okay?

445
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,260
Driver Kim.

446
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,430
- Is anyone hurt? - Yes, we're fine.

447
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,660
Other than nearly dying.

448
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:37,530
I woke up, my hands and feet tied, and stuffed inside a bag.

449
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,870
Then I felt a prick in my thigh and passed out again.

450
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,670
- They were dumping us at sea. - Really?

451
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,880
Next thing I knew, I was here.

452
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,350
If they'd dumped us in the sea back then,

453
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,650
the current would have probably carried us north.

454
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,280
So our bodies would be in North Korea. But why?

455
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,920
To prevent an investigation.

456
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,960
Right. If our bodies were up North, the authorities couldn't reach them.

457
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,190
Gosh, Jin Eon, you've gotten so much smarter.

458
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,330
I didn't say anything, though.

459
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,530
What? You just made that sharp point...

460
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,500
- about blocking the investigation. - I did?

461
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,910
If it wasn't you, then who was it? It's not like there's a crowd here.

462
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,510
That was me.

463
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,420
Come on.

464
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,300
Sorry for startling you.

465
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,470
You can just call me Reporter Bong.

466
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,580
Okay. In here... Goodness.

467
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,150
You can relax. There's no CCTV here.

468
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,880
Everywhere else, they can see and hear everything.

469
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,650
Wait, how long have you been here?

470
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,790
Let's see. About six months, I think?

471
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,460
That's insane.

472
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,060
Excuse me, can I take a look at the camcorder?

473
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
Sure.

474
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,340
Anyone who comes here ends up one of two ways.

475
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,840
They either become one of their affiliates...

476
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,180
or they end up on one of those wooden boats.

477
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,050
You're the second ones to have survived this.

478
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,550
And the first?

479
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,290
Me.

480
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,720
Thanks to this that my senior gave me,

481
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,490
I'm the only one who barely made it out alive.

482
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,070
Here.

483
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,540
My senior used to say...

484
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,300
compared to other types of crimes,

485
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,180
it's odd how the recidivism rate for online crimes is so high.

486
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,380
So for a long time, we investigated cybercriminals...

487
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,980
who were being released from prison.

488
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,680
They all came to this island...

489
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,290
and quickly left for other countries and started up again.

490
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,820
After some digging,

491
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,660
we also discovered there was someone on this island helping them.

492
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,500
So my senior and I...

493
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,500
So you posed as buyers to get in.

494
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,300
Yes.

495
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
These guys...

496
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,210
control a global network of criminal affiliates.

497
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,140
But they've never once been targeted in an investigation.

498
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,780
Because they understand the ins and outs...

499
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,650
of a criminal investigation better than anyone.

500
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:43,990
I found this at the temple.

501
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,320
(Alumni Association of Auditors, Judicial Research and Training Inst)

502
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,660
Wait, you mean one of them...

503
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,560
is a former prosecutor?

504
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,770
They know the limits of the law, so they designed this enterprise...

505
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,730
to operate just outside of them.

506
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,070
A former prosecutor...

507
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,510
Now it all makes sense.

508
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,810
As soon as we started our investigation,

509
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,880
we were raided and audited, and my boss was arrested.

510
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,890
That's why my senior...

511
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,220
told me to turn back right before he came here.

512
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,830
- Goodness. - Goodness.

513
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,360
I'm all right.

514
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,030
Please help me.

515
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,700
I don't know exactly what you do,

516
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,170
but you're all here for your reasons, aren't you?

517
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,840
For the sake of my senior,

518
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,280
Shin Kyung Soo, who was unjustly killed,

519
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,110
I want to do something. Anything.

520
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,680
Please, I'm begging you. Help me.

521
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,170
Cheol Yong, you have...

522
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,640
been through a lot.

523
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,210
Not at all, Monk.

524
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,210
He served his time as a model prisoner,

525
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:16,980
and he finally got paroled.

526
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,750
Who? Yong Ho?

527
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,080
(Jo Yong Ho)

528
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,250
Yes, Jo Yong Ho.

529
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,560
Right.

530
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,560
- Sorry I'm late. - Find your enlightenment.

531
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,730
Writer Go, you made it.

532
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,430
Writer Go.

533
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,800
It looks like a lot of our veterans will be getting out next year,

534
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,400
so I think we could add about two more franchises.

535
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,210
So you're telling me to work harder?

536
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,610
We'll have to raise the commission for our contacts in Public Security.

537
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:51,150
Okay, got it. I'll get right on it.

538
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,950
And what about those people from the taxi company?

539
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,420
Are we taking them on or not?

540
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,890
No, I've got a bad feeling about them.

541
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,390
Why don't we just...

542
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,530
get rid of all of them?

543
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,560
- All of them? - Especially that driver.

544
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,500
He seems like the type who'd smile...

545
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,070
while dragging someone out...

546
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,340
and burying them alive.

547
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,810
And the older guy.

548
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,410
He acts all nice, but I can tell one day,

549
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,810
he'll betray us. It's written all over his face.

550
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,580
Their background checks came back clean.

551
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,620
I'm telling you, my gut says something's off.

552
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,350
I really wish we'd just get rid of them.

553
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,020
Writer Go, what's your take?

554
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,520
Well...

555
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,460
I wish our dear Monk...

556
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:43,030
- would be more considerate. - Me?

557
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:48,600
I always listen to you, Writer Go. What are you talking about?

558
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,770
She just told you.

559
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,140
We need to add...

560
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,710
two more franchises.

561
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,250
Sorry.

562
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,920
Here. On my way over,

563
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,190
I heard this was new, so I picked some up.

564
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,190
You're always so thoughtful, Writer Go.

565
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,130
No, this is for you to share with that taxi driver...

566
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,760
when you meet him tomorrow. Okay?

567
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,700
Be sure to bring up the money first. Got it?

568
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,710
Okay.

569
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:24,570
Okay.

570
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,610
When you're feeling tired,

571
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,920
there's nothing quite like it.

572
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,350
My apologies for my lack of enlightenment.

573
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,520
If you had just told me the truth,

574
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,320
I wouldn't have been so rude.

575
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,390
You know what they say, adversity strengthens the bond.

576
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,330
Through all the back-and-forth suspicion,

577
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,330
isn't that how friendships are forged?

578
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,330
That's right.

579
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,140
After all, being suspicious of someone...

580
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,200
just means you're interested in them.

581
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,320
- This is quite good. - Is it?

582
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,290
Anyway,

583
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:19,430
to get this business off the ground, we'll need some capital.

584
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,870
Do you happen to have any money set aside?

585
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:26,170
- Two million dollars. - Two and a half million?

586
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,800
No, two million dollars.

587
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,040
I guess I heard what I wanted to hear.

588
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:35,910
Two million is a lot of money. How did you manage to get it,

589
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,350
- if you don't mind me asking? - I didn't save it myself.

590
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:42,650
- I managed to hook an investor. - An investor?

591
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,920
The president of the taxi company I came with.

592
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:47,989
He took out a two-million-dollar loan...

593
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:49,390
using the taxi company as collateral.

594
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,860
I told him rather than letting the company keep losing money,

595
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,870
we'd get a loan for a big score. He jumped at the chance.

596
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,270
You're a master at reeling them in.

597
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,810
So what about the others?

598
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,340
You know them.

599
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:08,310
The accountant and mechanics from the company.

600
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,310
We're going to need a few people for this to work anyway,

601
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,520
- so I persuaded a few to join. - Excellent.

602
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:17,820
In that case,

603
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,190
show me the money.

604
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,030
If we're going to talk business,

605
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,030
I don't need to hear it.

606
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,330
I need to see the money for myself.

607
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:37,410
What? Are you kidding me?

608
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,110
Hey, Monk.

609
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,350
When buying a house, do you show the money before you even see it?

610
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,180
Come on, that's just how it works.

611
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:53,260
You see the goods, hear the pitch, and then you pay.

612
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,130
But asking me to cough up the money before we even start,

613
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,390
I just don't think that's right, Monk.

614
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:01,730
Am I wrong?

615
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,370
My goodness. This is...

616
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,940
If you want to get into this line of work,

617
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:14,180
listen to me very carefully.

618
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,350
You must put the money down first. Otherwise,

619
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,450
we can't even begin to talk.

620
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:31,090
You must take me for a pushover.

621
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,130
But you've got the wrong guy.

622
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,310
I'm just going to go take a call.

623
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,920
You can either do things my way, or...

624
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,450
We'll just forget the whole thing. Let's just call it off.

625
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,260
This tea is leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.

626
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,330
It's always the thirsty one...

627
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,970
who seeks out the well.

628
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:19,940
Honey!

629
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,680
Everything okay in there?

630
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,809
- What? - We're still talking.

631
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,120
I just stepped out for some air.

632
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:34,720
- Did you bring our seed money? - No, not yet.

633
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,630
Why not, honey? Should I go get it?

634
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:40,260
So these jerks didn't even bring the money.

635
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:44,700
Of course not. We show them money, and they could just grab it and run.

636
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,800
How can I trust these guys enough to show them the money?

637
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,470
Absolutely not.

638
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,710
You're right.

639
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:55,810
All right, I'll be waiting then. Just let me know when you need it.

640
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,580
Okay. I'll call you back then.

641
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:02,050
- You get some rest, okay? - Okay.

642
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:04,150
I love you, babe.

643
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,320
I love you more.

644
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,860
Hey, you. Come with me for a second.

645
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,730
Some important guests are arriving at the pier.

646
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,700
Are you asking me to give them a ride?

647
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,870
Why?

648
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,700
You're a good driver.

649
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:56,410
We'll talk on the way.

650
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:58,770
All right.

651
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,780
There it is! Over there!

652
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,980
See? What'd I tell you? I said this was the right way.

653
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,550
Go Eun, the CCTV!

654
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,160
Why? Are you going that way?

655
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,540
My laptop.

656
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,410
Chief Park. Didn't you grab my main computer?

657
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,270
Me?

658
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,180
- Sorry. - No!

659
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:42,020
I should've put it on the bike myself.

660
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:46,990
The tow yard texted about an error. It says I'm due for a refund.

661
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:50,430
- Sweet! I'm applying right now. - Don't!

662
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,660
Why'd you hit me?

663
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,800
Why would you just click on it without knowing what it is?

664
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,200
Let me see.

665
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,170
(Automatic virus scan in progress)

666
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,609
- It's a phishing scheme. - What?

667
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:09,810
Click that, and they would've stolen all your info and passwords.

668
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,850
You fell for this before. How could you be so careless again?

669
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,220
I got a text from a drug rehab center too.

670
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,060
- I almost fell for it too. - Writer Go, what is that jerk?

671
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:25,330
This island.

672
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:28,060
I've liked it ever since I first came here.

673
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:31,830
The island's the perfect size.

674
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,310
Anything you don't want people to see...

675
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,380
It's a good place to just set it adrift in the ocean.

676
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:47,020
We have some clients coming to the island today.

677
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:50,220
Some have been renewing with me for years.

678
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,390
And some new ones are joining.

679
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,520
Like you, Kim Do Gi.

680
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,670
(Deluxe Taxi)

681
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:16,710
So, you want me at the business presentation with those people?

682
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,880
I just thought you could all meet and break the ice.

683
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,590
The security here seems a little lax.

684
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,620
How so?

685
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:33,600
What about it seems sloppy?

686
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,600
If you do things that way,

687
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:40,770
the second someone in the know here opens their mouth,

688
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,470
won't this entire operation be at risk?

689
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:43,910
Not at all.

690
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,480
Reporting to the police or tipping them off...

691
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:53,050
Ultimately, people only act out of self-interest.

692
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,150
Sure, ordinary people have things like altruism or a sense of justice.

693
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,990
They might have things like that,

694
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,590
but as you know, our clients...

695
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,930
are not that kind of breed.

696
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,670
This Samheung Island...

697
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:16,670
is their only hope. They know better than anyone.

698
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,210
Hope?

699
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,980
For clients who rejoin us after being released from prison,

700
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,020
we offer a 50-percent discount on their startup costs.

701
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,250
If we wholeheartedly help them get back on their feet,

702
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,690
they're bound to come back here.

703
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,900
The clients we've had so far...

704
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,070
refer other clients to us, if anything.

705
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,100
But not one has ever reported us.

706
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,640
They know what they stand to lose.

707
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,110
So even if they're caught by the police,

708
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,680
in order to make a comeback later,

709
00:52:58,110 --> 00:52:59,850
you'd have to protect them at all costs.

710
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,350
And they'll scrape together seed money any way they can.

711
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:06,920
It's much more effective than killing people...

712
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,290
to ensure their silence.

713
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,700
Does that clear everything up for you?

714
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:21,370
Yes.

715
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:25,240
Thanks to you, everything is crystal clear now.

716
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,210
Good. That's great.

717
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,310
All right, then,

718
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,580
how about you clear some things up for me?

719
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,490
We did a little digging into the places...

720
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,890
you said you worked.

721
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,730
And we found...

722
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,830
a very interesting common denominator.

723
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,030
Why is it that wherever you've been, Kim Do Gi,

724
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,270
everyone has either died or disappeared?

725
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,310
How come you're the only one who made it out alive?

726
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,120
Care to answer that question for me?

727
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:13,960
Or...

728
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,560
is it a question you can't answer?

729
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,610
What's that supposed to mean?

730
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,250
The way you're talking,

731
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,480
it sounds like you're disappointed I didn't die too.

732
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,990
So how do you think that makes me feel?

733
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,260
When you get down to it, the people here are survivors,

734
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,700
and that's why you give them a fresh start, isn't it?

735
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,540
I didn't die either.

736
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,740
I held on and barely made it out alive.

737
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:07,580
I came here hoping to turn my life around,

738
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,880
and this is the kind of nonsense I get?

739
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,160
Gosh, I guess...

740
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,760
I guess...

741
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,530
that's how it could've come across.

742
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,670
No, I mean, if that's how it came across...

743
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,980
My apologies.

744
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,520
Look.

745
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,860
I decided to take a chance on you. Kim Do Gi.

746
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,140
I've decided to trust you.

747
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,680
When I counsel the others later,

748
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,880
why don't you sit in and listen?

749
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,920
Now we're talking.

750
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,110
Gosh, long time no see, Writer Go.

751
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:50,040
Look at you, coming all this way to greet me.

752
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,520
- Congrats on getting out. - "Congrats"? Give me a break.

753
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,190
I took the fall because I didn't listen to you.

754
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:03,460
I mentioned them on the phone, yes? These are my buddies from inside.

755
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:06,930
Man, this weather is amazing.

756
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,960
Forget the weather and show some respect. Got it?

757
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,170
Welcome.

758
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,470
They look a lot younger in person.

759
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,810
Everyone's running their scams online these days.

760
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:21,880
It's a great time for young guys to make a quick buck.

761
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,780
They're Paju funeral home scammers. They're pretty good.

762
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,050
I see.

763
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,790
By the way, who's that?

764
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,630
He's a new recruit, joining us as well.

765
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,060
Do you know him, by any chance?

766
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,100
His name is Kim Do Gi.

767
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:46,940
Kim Woo Jong, who used to work for you, sent him.

768
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:48,570
Woo Jong?

769
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,680
Woo Jong didn't really have any friends.

770
00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:00,010
He's not good with people, either.

771
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:07,520
Woo Jong never mentioned anyone like you to me.

772
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,070
Funny, he mentioned you to me.

773
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:20,100
I went to visit him the other day.

774
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,570
He said you're still a total pain.

775
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:25,670
Darn.

776
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,140
All right, that's enough.

777
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,510
Let's talk business inside. This way.

778
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,510
Yes, let's. Hey, let's go!

779
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,240
Writer Go! What?

780
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:58,310
What?

781
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,180
Writer Go!

782
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,990
Writer Go!

783
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:18,290
Writer Go!

784
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,730
(We would like to thank Kim Sung Kyu and Lee Kyoung Young.)

785
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:10,280
(Taxi Driver 3)

786
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:13,880
Doesn't this sound like some kind of business briefing?

787
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:16,780
Time to decide what kind of business you're all going to start.

788
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:19,150
How long have we been on this island?

789
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,960
Pack light for the move.

790
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:25,930
There's no other way. All we can do is stall for time from our posts.

791
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,660
I'd like to get this sorted out before that business gets started.

792
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:32,130
The taxi driver who came with me. I need you to take care of him.

793
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:36,500
- Can't you just kill them all? - You can't leave Samheung Island.

794
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,110
Push forward!
