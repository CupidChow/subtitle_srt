(Children and animals were filmed under guidelines.)

8
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,870
How long have you been with the unit?

9
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,640
Eight months, sir.

10
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,310
The mission was a failure,

11
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,710
and you died in action just eight months in?

12
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,520
And you, instructor? How long have you served?

13
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,720
- Six years. - And you died after six years too.

14
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,900
Attacking me after you're dead doesn't count.

15
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,100
I wasn't dead yet.

16
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,300
I stabbed you as I was dying.

17
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,640
Consider it my dying message.

18
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,270
But, sir...

19
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,440
What if I were to say I saw her stab you before she died?

20
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Am I going to get in trouble?

21
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,850
What's your name?

22
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,490
Sergeant Yoo Sun A, Counter-Terrorism Team one, sir.

23
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,160
- Everyone, fall in! - Yes, sir! All right, fall in!

24
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,100
Hey, on your feet.

25
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,270
Did anything about this operation strike you as odd?

26
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,440
Sergeant Park Jae Won, sir.

27
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,840
Sir, I believe the hostage's safety wasn't the priority in the plan.

28
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,380
We could've been the ones who killed the hostage.

29
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,620
That's precisely what blinded you.

30
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,090
One simple feint, and half of your unit was wiped out.

31
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,490
Any idea why?

32
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,390
Because you all assumed the hostage you took...

33
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,190
was your get-out-of-jail-free card.

34
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,100
You figured if things went south, you'd use them as a human shield.

35
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,730
But if the hostage dies, the mission's a failure, right, sir?

36
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,770
If I really intended to rescue them,

37
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,840
I'd have secured them first, not entered from the opposite side.

38
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,310
I came through the main gate, blocked your escape and engaged.

39
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,980
My objective for this operation...

40
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,020
wasn't to rescue the hostage.

41
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,120
It was to annihilate all of you,

42
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,460
the hostage included.

43
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,400
So, if this were a real combat situation

44
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,000
and you realized the enemy wasn't protecting the hostage,

45
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,970
but was instead cutting off your escape routes,

46
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,970
the very first thing you should do...

47
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,810
was quickly get out of there.

48
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,550
If you can't run, then with your last dying breath,

49
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,550
take down at least one more of them...

50
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,950
with everything you've got.

51
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,120
Your final stand will instill fear in the enemy.

52
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,490
And that fear will spread like wildfire,

53
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,300
becoming a coat of armor for the rest of your team.

54
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,370
- Understood? - Yes, sir!

55
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,670
On that note,

56
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,170
I want you all to learn from Sergeant Yoo's final action.

57
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,240
Check your personnel and gear, then return to base.

58
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,250
We'll cover the rest in the AAR.

59
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,350

60
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,450

61
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,820

I was honorably discharged from the military over a decade ago.

70

All right, let me just check that for you.

00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,160
I'm telling you, when I saw this,

72
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,900
I was so shocked, my heart jumped.

73
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,730
- I'm checking. Please have a seat. - Right, sure.

74
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,970
Mr. Park Jin Eon?

75
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,370
Yes.

80
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,910
Your completed service record. It's not here.

81
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,020
And what happens if there's no record?

82
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,420

83
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,750
- Go where? - The military.

84
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,820
No way!

85
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,460
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

86
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,100
- I'm telling you, I already served! - Sir, please calm down.

87
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,970
How am I supposed to stay calm? How?

88
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,470
You're saying I have to enlist again just because there's no record?

89
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,710
To someone who's already served ages ago?

90
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,770
Wait, your enlistment date was yesterday?

91
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,110
That makes you AWOL. We'll help you enlist immediately.

92

97
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,230

107

What kind of dream makes you scream like that?

108

Hey, look. You're breaking out in a cold sweat.

109
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,200
It was a dream! It was all just a dream!

110
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,500
Gosh, that was intense.

111
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,300
Goodness. Such a drama queen.

112
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,200
- Did you dream you got drafted? - Yes.

113
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,670
For real?

114
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,710
I kept saying it was a mistake, but they dragged me off to the army.

115
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,080
- That must've been terrifying. - Totally.

116
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,880
- Want to hear an even scarier one? - Scarier than a draft notice?

117
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,380
Way scarier.

118
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,620
Because this one actually happened to me.

119
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,390
I love scary stories.

120
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,400
Hey, where are you going? Come on.

121
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,310
Do you really have to set the mood like this?

122
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,040
Spooky.

123
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,580
My senior and I...

124
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,020
were on guard duty at the gatehouse...

125
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,520
when over in the washroom at the HQ barracks,

126
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,830
- a soldier was dancing like crazy. - Dancing?

127
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,890
So my senior...

128
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,800
asked me what I was looking at.

129
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,460
What?

130
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,070
I said, "See that guy over there, dancing his heart out?"

131
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,440
He said he couldn't see anyone. But I could see him clear as day.

132
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,270
We went back and forth all shift, and when we were relieved,

133
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,780
we went to the command post to report in.

134
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,750
Right after we reported in, I told them what happened.

135
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,380
And that's when...

136
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,920
the sergeant major...

137
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,590
told me that ten years ago, in that exact spot,

138
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,630
a new recruit had hanged himself.

139
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,890
- What? - What?

140
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,360
The way the body was swaying, it must have looked like dancing.

141
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,470
Ever since then,

142
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,370
they say anyone who saw the soldier has either died or gone insane.

143
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,310
But you saw him.

144
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,879
I guess it doesn't count if you can't see him clearly.

145
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,750
Actually, it was quite far, so I couldn't see clearly.

146
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,310
- I don't think so. - What's that supposed to mean?

147
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,420
- That explains it. - Explains what?

148
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,320
It probably followed you here.

149
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,290
Driver Kim Do Gi! How long have you been here?

150
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,660
I've been here the whole time. I had no chance to slip away.

151
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,730
- Gosh. - You scared the life out of me.

152
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
You were?

153
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,870
Why lie about being followed? That's creepy.

154
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,369
But it is true.

155
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,940
It's probably following us now.

156
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,310
- Are you serious? - Okay, never mind. It isn't scary.

157
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,220
Gosh, that's not funny. It's not funny at all.

158
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
Gosh.

159
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,220
- What? - What's this?

160
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,790
Do ghosts really exist?

161
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,630
Captain Kim Do Gi.

162
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,010
It's been a while. Have you been well, sir?

163
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,580
Park Jae Won.

164
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,450
- Have you been well? - Yes, sir.

165
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,360
- Have you been well, sir? - Yes.

166
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,830
I've never seen you take the afternoon off, Driver Kim.

167
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,000
Mr. Jang is out, so I couldn't tell him.

168
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,970
I'll let him know for you.

169
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,440
All right, enjoy your time off. See you tomorrow.

170
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,770
See you tomorrow.

171
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,810
Jae Won.

172
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,510
I told you to wait in the car. Why did you get out?

173
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,910
I'm perfectly fine, sir.

174
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,249
- You haven't eaten yet, have you? - No, sir.

175
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,250
I know a few great restaurants, so let's pick one on the way.

176
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,420
I'm good with anything, sir.

177
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,530
Has Driver Kim Do Gi ever had a visitor here before?

178
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,190
No, never.

179
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,760
His rank is Master Sergeant. Gosh, that's so cool.

180
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,030
- Driver Kim Do Gi looks so happy. - Yes.

181
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,710
He must've been really happy to see him.

182
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,080
Master Sergeant Park, what are you in the mood for?

183
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,750
You still like ginseng chicken soup?

184
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,050
- You even remember that, sir? - Of course.

185
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,460
You and Master Sergeant Yoo insisted we go for ginseng chicken soup.

186
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,990
What about Master Sergeant Yoo?

187
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,630
How's she doing?

188
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,370
You should've brought her with you. I haven't seen her in ages.

189
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,170
I assumed you hadn't heard the news, sir.

190
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,710
Master Sergeant Yoo Sun A...

191
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,310
is dead, sir.

192
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,430
The thing is...

193
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,470
That's why I came to see you. I need your signature on a petition.

194
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,210
(Petition)

195
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,210
Master Sergeant Yoo Sun A...

196
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,010
Where is she now?

197
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,920
(The Late Yoo Sun A)

198
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,840
(The Late Yoo Sun A)

199
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,350
Mom!

200
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,160
Will you be returning, sir?

201
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
No.

202
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,340
Please come back when this is over, sir.

203
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,880
Even if I did come back,

204
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,080
there's nothing left for me to teach you.

205
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,650
Even if you have no more to teach,

206
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,380
I still have much to learn from you, sir.

207
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,300
I'll be waiting for your return, sir.

208
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,480
I will...

209
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,980
also be waiting, sir.

210
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,200
- Salute. Unity! - Unity!

211
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,430
Requesting to return to duty.

212
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,960
Oh, this place has great coffee.

213
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,030
- I thought our coffee was the best. - It's in a class of its own!

214
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,930
Gosh, look at the shine on this car.

215
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,140
Driver Kim is going to love this.

216
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,270
- The number you dialed is off... - Why is his phone off again?

217
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:35,390
(2 weeks later)

218
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,750
Is this it?

219
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,920
Yes, this is the taxi Driver Kim was driving.

220
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,050
For him to just abandon his taxi, something serious must've happened.

221
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,790
Exactly. And his phone's been off this whole time.

222
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,090
For now, could you two take the taxi back?

223
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,230
I'll grab the nearby CCTV footage and then head back.

224
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,960
It looks like he's paying his respect, doesn't it?

225
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,400
Sergeant Yoo Sun A. She served with Driver Kim Do Gi.

226
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,470
Sergeant?

227
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,340
But she's a Master Sergeant in that photo.

228
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,640
The records say she went AWOL from a training site...

229
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,950
and died in an explosion while fleeing.

230
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,150
She was posthumously disciplined and discharged as a private.

231
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,820
Wait, that's a little strange.

232
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,520
No matter how severe the disciplinary action,

233
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,790
to demote someone that many ranks is highly unusual, isn't it?

234
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,190
Seriously, what could she have possibly done?

235
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,430
Either way, it seems Do Gi disappeared because of this,

236
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,000
but I'm just wondering if looking for him now...

237
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,170
is the right thing to do.

238
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,740
That's been weighing on my mind too.

239
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,910
From the way he even ditched his phone,

240
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,120
Driver Kim didn't go missing. He chose to leave.

241
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,920
It's almost like he's telling us not to look for him.

242
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,090
Have a safe trip. See you tomorrow.

243
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,060
Yes, see you tomorrow.

244
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,370
He said he'd see me tomorrow.

245
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,400
Mr. Jang, did you send this page?

246
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,040
No, I just got the page and rushed down here.

247
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
Go Eun, was it you?

248
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,040
If none of us sent it,

249
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,380
then this message must have come from Do Gi.

250
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,180
But why send a page instead of just showing up?

251
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,820
Maybe so we wouldn't worry?

252
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,190
Then he would've called, not sent a page.

253
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,660
Something must've happened to Driver Kim.

254
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,990
We have to go find him right now.

255
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,330
I agree. We have to. We absolutely have to go!

256
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,770
Of course I want to go. But we don't know where he is.

257
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,930
I did some more digging.

258
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,910
Master Sergeant Yoo's last unit was a temp one, Unit 280.

259
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,110
And there's one more thing.

260
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,010
This is the exact spot where Driver Kim sent a page.

261
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,650
But there's nothing there.

262
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,720
That's right. The area's blurred out on Street View.

263
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,320
It has to be a military base.

264
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,120
In that case, that's most likely where Do Gi is right now.

265
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,590
CEO, you once said that there are victims,

266
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,730
but no perpetrators in two places. Hospitals and the military.

267
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,570
We have to find Driver Kim now.

268
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,970
But how do we get onto a military base?

269
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,570
Civilians can't just go waltzing in there.

270
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,540
It's a problem. What on earth are we going to do?

271
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,440
Hey, Go Eun. Any bright ideas?

272
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,450
The military? I know nothing.

273
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,780
What would...

274
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,550
Driver Kim do if he were here right now?

275
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,720
If Driver Kim were here...

276
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,720
I think I know what he would've done.

277
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,730
What?

278
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Chief Park.

279
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,970
I'll let you punch me 100 times.

280
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,570
What?

281
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,410
- Go Eun. - No, wait, make that 200.

282
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,540
An Go Eun!

283
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,350
- No way. I refuse to go. - Why refuse without knowing?

284
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,450
I don't have to. I already know what she's about to say.

285
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,390
You're going to ask me to re-enlist, aren't you?

286
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,060
No.

287
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,930
Whenever you feel like it,

288
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,100
you can hit me for the rest of your life.

289
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,030
No way. I can't. I won't. Absolutely not!

290
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,600
Please just hit me!

291
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,240
I'm not going. I can't go!

292
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,880
Over my dead body!

293
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,270
(Warning: Failure to comply will be met with fire.)

294
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,640
(For our country and our people)

295
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,449
We've filled personnel shortages.

296
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,880
We got transfers for supply and mess,

297
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,350
and one of them is a new recruit.

298
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,920
- Private First Class Park Jin Su. - Private First Class Park Jin Su.

299
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,360
Put your bag down.

300
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,520
Run in place.

301
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
Run.

302
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,470
- Gosh, this is the last one. - Is this the army or a summer camp?

303
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,270
You've all been through a lot getting here.

304
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,570
From now on, this is your home.

305
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,010
- Take them to their barracks. - Right this way.

306
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,410
Yes, sir.

307
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,250
That's right.

308
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,390
I came here to find Driver Kim Do Gi.

309
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,720
Once I find him, this will all be over.

310
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,160
What's with that guy?

311
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,690
I heard he just re-enlisted.

312
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,630
Excuse me. I'm actually looking for someone.

313
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,840
- Is there a Captain Kim Do Gi here? - Has this guy gone mad?

314
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,070
What? Is the captain your buddy?

315
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,410
That's right.

316
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,210
We're the same age, so I act casual, but he keeps things formal.

317
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,950
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

318
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:13,820
I know the army pretty well. My service number starts with 11.

319
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,190
What about you two? What do yours start with?

320
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,960
What's the status?

321
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,320
Still no word from him?

322
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,590
Yes, his comms are still off.

323
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,930
- I bet it's still in his bag. - Don't worry.

324
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,330
Jin Eon will be doing just fine.

325
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,330
This isn't his first rodeo.

326
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,570
I was wrong, sir!

327
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,480
I forgot I was in the army!

328
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,010
I was wrong!

329
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,720
What? You "forgot"?

330
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,290
Hey, this jerk...

331
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,690
When he's done with his punishment, throw him in the brig.

332
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,360
I'm sorry!

333
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,530
I was wrong! I'm sorry!

334
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,770
So I guess facing the military alone is impossible after all?

335
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,240
Looks like I'll have to go in myself.

336
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,910
You, sir?

337
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,480
Security's going to be tight there. How do you plan on getting in?

338
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,950
When you get to be my age, it's not that hard.

339
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,950
Halt.

340
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,290
(For our country and our people)

341
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,120
(For our country and our people)

342
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,730
Sir. May I ask what brings you here?

343
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,200
What kind of question is that? I'm here to see you do your job.

344
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,770
What is it? Who's that?

345
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,240
- And you are, sir? - Me?

346
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,980
General...

347
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,950
Unity!

348
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,950
What are you gawking at? Are you opening this gate or what?

349
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,490
Hey, you want me to just leave?

350
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,320
- What is it? Who is he? - He's a general!

351
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,890
My apologies, sir!

352
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,730
What are you doing? Open the gate for him, now!

353
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,130

533
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,490
Thank you. I won't burden you any further.

534
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,330
Burden? Not at all. I'm the one asking for a favor.

535
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,530
Okay. Take that car back there.

536
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,460
Everything you need is in there.

537
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:15,930
Yes, sir.

538
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,780
Halt!

539
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,450
Lights off.

540
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,220
Engine off.

541
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,890
Driver, exit the vehicle.

542
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,260
Turtle.

543
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,800
- Ladder. - Who goes there?

544
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,200
Captain Kim Do Gi.

545
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,740
State your business.

546
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,870
On assignment. I've spoken with the duty commander.

547
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,640
- Captain Kim Do Gi has arrived. - Yes, let him through.

548
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,550
Yes, sir.

549
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:40,150
- Copy that. - Identity confirmed. Unity.

550
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,580
Unity.

551
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,560
Unity.

552
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,300
We weren't expecting you today, so your room isn't ready yet.

553
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,070
We were told you'd be arriving tomorrow.

554
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,910
Don't worry about it. I can sleep anywhere.

555
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,810
So, what mission are you here for?

556
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,550
I'll brief the unit commander on the details tomorrow.

557
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,250
Is the office all set up?

558
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,820
Yes, sir.

559
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:19,180
You of all people know what Sergeant Yoo Sun A was like.

560
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
(Petition)

561
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,450
(Victim: The late Sgt. Yoo Sun A)

562
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,020
I'll be in touch.

563
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,090
I'd like you to come back then.

564
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
Understood.

565
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,100
- He came last night? - Yes, sir.

566
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,170
So where is he now?

567
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,940
He wanted his own room, so I gave him one of the empty ones.

568
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,540
He said he'd introduce himself this morning.

569
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,440
He should just do his job and leave.

570
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,350
What's the point of an introduction?

571
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,090
Unity. Apologies for the late introduction.

572
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,830
Yes. You had a long trip.

573
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,630
- I hear you arrived last night. - Yes, sir.

574
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,600
The room's great, by the way. It gets a good breeze.

575
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,030
Right.

576
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,700
And the reason for your assignment is?

577
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,240
(Colonel Kim Tae Hyun)

578
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,340
(Eagle Nest Found, Border Region Emergency Survey)

579
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:21,480
(Urgent Survey Team to the Border Region)

580
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,540
Surveying birds?

581
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,580
Yes, sir.

582
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,420
What kind of bird?

583
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,150
- Black Eagle, sir. - It's an eagle?

584
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,520
They were thought to be extinct, but a nest was recently found.

585
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,660
But...

586
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,190
- why send you for a bird survey? - I may not know about birds,

587
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,060
but I know the border ecosystem very well.

588
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,830
So what happens if you find this bird here?

589
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,500
It's an endangered species, so we'd have to protect it.

590
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,740
So if it becomes a protected area, we can't fire our weapons?

591
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,980
That's highly likely.

592
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,150
We're better off if it's not here, even if it is, right?

593
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,590
Anyway, if you need anything, let me know, okay?

594
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,920
This is my house,

595
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:09,990
so don't go wandering around like you own the place.

596
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,760
Thanks for your consideration.

597
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,900
Right. Do you need anything?

598
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,170
Do you want me to assign a soldier to you?

599
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:19,540
That's all right. I've already called someone in.

600
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,340
Unity!

601
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,680
Speak of the devil. He'll be rooming with me,

602
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,880
so you don't have to worry about a thing.

603
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,150
Yes, sir.

604
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,580
I haven't eaten yet,

605
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:37,250
so if you haven't either, would you care to join me?

606
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:38,690
I'm good.

607
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:42,660
There's a jjamppong place near the entrance. It's really good.

608
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,890
You should go try it.

609
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,790
Thanks for the tip.

610
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,660
Unity.

611
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:04,010
(Advanced barracks, elite special forces)

612
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,850
(Establishing discipline, accomplishing the mission)

613
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,750
Captain, I knew you'd call on me,

614
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,420
but I never imagined it would be for something like this.

615
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,059
- Let's get food first. - Yes, sir.

616
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,360
- You drive. - Yes, sir.

617
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,500
Hey.

618
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,600
What do you think they're really here for?

619
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,470
He said he was here for the protected species research.

620
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,440
"Protected species," my foot.

621
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:32,880
You don't think so?

622
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,310
He was a Special Warfare instructor, he's led operations,

623
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,920
and he quit after years of overseas intel.

624
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,280
You think he's here for birds? Give me a break.

625
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,260
Tail those jerks and find out what they're really up to.

626
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,830
- Dig in. - Yes, sir. You too.

627
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,540
This jjamppong is pretty good.

628
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:01,970
It is, sir.

629
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,240
I looked over the internal report on Master Sergeant Yoo's charges.

630
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,949
During a training exercise,

631
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:11,580
Master Sergeant Yoo abandoned her squad...

632
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,650
and drove a truck full of weapons into North Korea.

633
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,990
No way...

634
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,190
That's impossible.

635
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:23,830
Going AWOL from the training site, theft of weapons,

636
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,860
and attempting to contact North Korean officials.

637
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,170
She was demoted three ranks, one for each charge.

638
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:35,800
Captain, do you...

639
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,980
really believe Master Sergeant Yoo would do something like that?

640
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:43,950
Could you do it, Master Sergeant Park?

641
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,320
Commandeering a truck, stealing strategic weapons,

642
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:52,750
and coordinating a time and date with a North Korean operative.

643
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,360
All in less than a week of being deployed here?

644
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:59,760
I don't think even I could pull that off.

645
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:13,540
Quietly meet with the squad members who were with Master Sergeant Yoo.

646
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,580
All eyes will be on me for a while, so you shouldn't have any trouble.

647
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,150
Yes, sir.

648
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,590
One more thing. Do senior officers get temp posts?

649
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,650
No, sir.

650
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,260
Actually, I thought that was strange too.

651
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:30,330
A colonel living in the barracks instead of his own quarters...

652
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:33,300
Isn't that pretty unprecedented?

653
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,070
Exactly.

654
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:40,340
So do we really have to look for this bird?

655
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,710
Well, it's not like they're going to believe us anyway.

656
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,310
Gosh, this jjamppong is really good.

657
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,580
It's so good, sir.

658
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:55,950
- Was that good? - Yes. Gosh, I'm stuffed.

659
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:57,350
Good.

660
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,900
Captain, where are you going?

661
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:25,150
Looks like he's from my unit. Why is he taking my picture?

662
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,180
I'm not a bird.

663
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,650
Go tell your commanding officer.

664
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,030
Unity! You called for me, sir?

665
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,899
We got a message from Captain Kim Do Gi.

666
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,900
We did?

667
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,900
Hey, read it again.

668
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:49,000
Your jjamppong suggestion was great. Please recommend more great spots.

669
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,370
Also, I need a bird-watching camera, so I'll borrow this and return it.

670
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,540
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

671
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,249
No matter how you slice it,

672
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:59,250
it looks like that jerk, Kim Do Gi, has an ulterior motive.

673
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:02,620
- I'm sure of it. - I'll see what he's up to, sir.

674
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,120
Report the second you find anything, even if it's at dawn.

675
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,790
Yes, sir. Unity!

676
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,160
- Unity! - Unity!

677
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,470
(Investigation Team)

678
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,640
All the squad members' statements match.

679
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,039
They said on the way to the op zone,

680
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,950
Master Sergeant Yoo Sun A told them all to get out.

681
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,400
Get out.

682
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,970
- Get out now! - Yes, ma'am! Understood!

683
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,940
Everyone, dismount the truck.

684
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:00,010
Move it! Out!

685
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,740
- Yes, ma'am! - Yes, ma'am!

686
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,390
Effective immediately, you will all return to base.

687
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,020
- We must have misheard you, ma'am. - You heard me, didn't you?

688
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,520
Everyone, return to base!

689
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,990
- Yes, ma'am! Understood! - Yes, ma'am! Understood!

690
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,130
They didn't seem to be lying, sir.

691
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,140
Could Master Sergeant Yoo Sun A really have done that?

692
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,710
(Results: Explosion in Operation Area B-24)

693
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,840
Those reasons listed for her demotion...

694
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:38,850
Could they really be true?

695
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,120
The answer to that...

696
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,350
is one you've already given, Master Sergeant Park.

697
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:48,690
Yes, you're right, sir.

698
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,989
Master Sergeant Yoo Sun A would never do that.

699
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,500
I'm absolutely sure of it.

700
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,770
I agree.

701
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:11,950
Unity.

702
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,350
Unity.

703
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:20,020
Who's in charge of the vehicle movement logs?

704
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,390
The transportation unit co-manages them.

705
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,790
What's the logging interval? Every five minutes?

706
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,260
Yes, sir, that's correct.

707
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,100
And the reporting cycle to command?

708
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,930
It's automatically updated every three weeks, sir.

709
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,300
That's perfect.

710
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,340
Get me a copy for this date.

711
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,840
- Right now. - Right now, sir?

712
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,680
You must be busy betting your pay in the barracks.

713
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,280
Master Sergeant Park, why don't you get it?

714
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:44,550
Yes, sir.

715
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,550
Gambling on duty?

716
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:50,090
He seems busy. I'll get it myself, sir.

717
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:53,720
No, sir! I'll go get it right this second!

718
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,530
Really? Then you'd better be quick about it.

719
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,360
Yes, sir!

720
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,000
- Unity! - About-face!

721
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,830
On the double!

722
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,300
By the way, Captain, how do you know all that?

723
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,610
Know what?

724
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:13,710
That vehicle movements are logged in five-minute intervals.

725
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,380
They're mostly logged to evaluate training performance.

726
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,550
- But isn't that data classified? - It is.

727
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,320
But I'm the one who used to grade the performance evaluations.

728
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:26,660
I reviewed those logs and gave you the best score.

729
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,060
You did?

730
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,000
Unity!

731
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,870
These are the vehicle movement logs for the date you requested, sir.

732
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,100
- Thanks. Good work. - Unity!

733
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,080
- Unity. - Save your pay and be a good son.

734
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,440
Unity!

735
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:01,020
Let's use this to retrace her steps on the day of the incident.

736
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,560
And see what she was trying to do.

737
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:07,400
So that's why you asked for the logs from the day of the incident.

738
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,700
You never know.

739
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,330
Her route might tell us what happened that day.

740
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,170
Right.

741
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,010
Unity!

742
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:22,840
Unity!

743
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:27,450
You'd think people studying birds would have at least one photo.

744
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,680
Is there a problem, Colonel?

745
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,690
If you're here to investigate birds, you should be focused on them.

746
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,630
So why are you digging into a dead woman's business?

747
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:46,940
Why are you snooping on a traitor who betrayed her country?

748
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,140
Since you've asked, allow me to ask you something.

749
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,480
How did you know she was dealing with the North?

750
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,290
- What? - You couldn't have met either side,

751
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:08,690
- and you weren't there, were you? - Hey.

752
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,460
Do you need to be next to a fire to know it's burning?

753
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,570
You can tell there's a fire by the smoke from a distance.

754
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:22,240
Aborting the mission on her own, disobeying orders, sending men back,

755
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:26,210
then loading weapons into a truck and heading North. It's obvious.

756
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,210
Just seeing that smoke,

757
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,250
it's clear she was playing with fire, don't you think?

758
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,950
I see your point.

759
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:37,850
Hey, Kim Do Gi.

760
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,690
- Yes, sir. - I'm sure I made myself clear.

761
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,330
Don't come into my house and act like you own the place.

762
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,630
What's your real reason for being here?

763
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,400
Who sent you?

764
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:53,470
I believe I already told you. A Black Eagle nest was discovered...

765
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,440
Cut the nonsense, you jerk!

766
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,470
Black Eagle, my foot!

767
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,510
I have to get back to the nest, so if you'll excuse me.

768
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,980
Unity!

769
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,950
(Bird investigation)

770
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,360
But I guess a bird's nest is someone else's home too.

771
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,030
This is awkward.

772
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,330
And by the way,

773
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,800
people don't really put photos up on walls.

774
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,840
Not when you have one of these.

775
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:39,710
Unity!

776
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,720
That arrogant jerk...

777
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,160
A measly Captain has the nerve...

778
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:54,900
Sir, what should we do?

779
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,200
He must have someone backing him up to be so cocky, don't you think?

780
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:04,470
I'm going to go see the General.

781
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,510
(Special Warfare School)

782
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,160
Stop here for a second.

783
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:25,990
Yes, sir.

784
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,070
What is it, Captain?

785
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,479
On the day of the incident,

786
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,180
Master Sergeant Yoo had her team exit the truck here.

787
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,420
Everyone, dismount the truck.

788
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,420
Move it! Out!

789
00:55:49,421 --> 00:55:50,520
- Yes, ma'am! - Yes, ma'am!

790
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,220
She took the right fork.

791
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:01,130
What? But this is Sector B24.

792
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,300
Why? Is there a problem with that?

793
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,499
On the day of Master Sergeant Yoo's accident,

794
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,100
my team was also scheduled...

795
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:10,970
with an artillery unit for a live-fire drill.

796
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:16,110
And the target for that drill was right here, in Sector B24.

797
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,550
(Military Demarcation Line, Special Mission Unit's Area of Ops)

798
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,660
- Let's go. - Yes, sir.

799
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,350
Sector B24 starts here.

800
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:34,960
(Military Demarcation Line, Special Mission Unit's Area of Ops)

801
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,560
(Special mission code of conduct)

802
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,570
Master Sergeant Yoo was here for ten minutes.

803
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,380
Only this spot right here is empty.

804
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,360
It looks like she couldn't move everything on the shelf at once.

805
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,759
Instead of going to the base,

806
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,560
Master Sergeant Yoo went up this path to the north.

807
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,630
Yes, that's what the report said.

808
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:21,530
That she took the weapons north.

809
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:26,670
Master Sergeant Yoo didn't go north to sell the weapons.

810
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,210
Her original route back was blocked,

811
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:33,240
so she couldn't get through.

812
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,580
What?

813
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:54,030
Darn it.

814
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:57,870
Back off, you jerks! Are you disobeying a direct order?

815
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,110
Since her escape route was blocked,

816
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,940
she tried to find an alternate route.

817
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:12,709
If she sought a new route, like you said,

818
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:14,980
she had to be panicking.

819
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,590
This path is a dead end at the Military Demarcation Line.

820
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,920
And there's no way Master Sergeant Yoo didn't know that.

821
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,090
Or did she head that way knowing it was a dead end?

822
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,390
With her escape route blocked,

823
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,330
Master Sergeant Yoo would have done the only thing she could.

824
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,100
The only thing she could?

825
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:39,570
Captain Kim Do Gi!

826
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,110
I have a question.

827
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,850
There are times in the field when our mission objective...

828
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,050
is to acquire certain intelligence, right?

829
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:51,990
There'll be plenty of those in the future.

830
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,920
Let's say we've acquired critical intelligence,

831
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,460
but on our way back to base, we run into an unavoidable problem.

832
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:59,790
What do we do with the intel?

833
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,830
Your safety comes before the intel.

834
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,270
If your safety isn't guaranteed,

835
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,440
you abandon the critical intelligence.

836
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,740
But if, despite all that,

837
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:18,680
you find yourself in a life-or-death situation,

838
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:23,050
you pass on the intel using our team's protocol.

839
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:41,940
(Landmine)

840
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:56,020
Captain, you should watch your step.

841
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,960
Master Sergeant Park, search this area.

842
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:06,190
Yes, sir.

843
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,730
What is that protocol?

844
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:45,600
Find the bird's nest in the closest tree due west...

845
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,400
and secure the intel inside it.

846
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,140
A bird's nest?

847
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,970
They're sturdy, they have good drainage,

848
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,940
and they're hard to see from the ground.

849
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:58,980
I see.

850
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:05,290
Master Sergeant Park!

851
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:06,850
Sir!

852
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,430
I'll check it out.

853
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,340
I found it.

854
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,510
(Landmine)

855
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,660
If anything should happen to me,

856
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,660
I'm trusting you to find this.

857
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,300
Captain Kim Do Gi.

858
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:17,590
Master Sergeant Yoo Sun A sacrificed herself...

859
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:19,790
to save her comrades.

860
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:10,440
(Special thanks to Jeon So Nee for her guest appearance)
