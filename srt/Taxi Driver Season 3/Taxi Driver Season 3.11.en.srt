When I get involved, you jerks are all dead meat.

26
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,960
Gosh, you shouldn't sneak up on people like that.

27
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,630
I was waiting for you to finish.

28
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,230
I wasn't talking to anyone. I was just thinking out loud.

29
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,970
He listens to your thoughts well too.

30
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,140
Who is?

31
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,510
The one in the seat next to you. He's been with you this whole time.

32
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,380
You mean...

33
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,450
there's someone here?

34
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,250
The Almighty is always by your side.

35
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,890
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

36
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,760
There's something I need to tell you.

37
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,900
Okay, let me get this straight.

38
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,840
You have a younger sister, Da Som, who was adopted.

39
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,140
Her name is Park Da Som.

40
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,710
Right. Your sister, Park Da Som,

41
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,210
used a resale app to buy a 98-dollar gift for her dad.

42
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,179
It was leather gloves,

43
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,350
- but what she got was a brick. - Yes.

44
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,950
Gosh, her dad was seriously injured.

45
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,660
She said he had multiple surgeries after a car accident.

46
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,390
How old is Da Som?

47
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,160
She's eight.

48
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,700
She became part of the family two years ago.

49
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,529
It couldn't have been easy for an eight-year-old...

50
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,870
to save up 98 dollars.

51
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,800
She saved up the allowance...

52
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,880
her dad gave her for over a year to buy them.

53
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Okay.

54
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,280
That 98 dollars that Da Som saved up.

55
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,150
I'll just round it up to 100 dollars and give it to her.

56
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,520
No, you can't do that.

57
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,460
Why not?

58
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,660
I can just give her 100 dollars to buy a new pair of gloves.

59
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,130
But that wouldn't be Da Som's money.

60
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,400
Da Som said she wanted to use her own money...

61
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,430
to buy the gloves for her dad.

62
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,870
It's not the same.

63
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,710
- Maria. - Da Som.

64
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,710
I'm here with the man I told you about.

65
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,280
Hello, Mr. Hero.

66
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
What?

67
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,550
Maria told me she has a hero who protects her.

68
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,450
Oh, boy.

69
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,690
But...

70
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,500
about my dad's gloves...

71
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,860
Can you find them for me?

72
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,240
Those 98-dollar gloves that you bought.

73
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,570
- I'll find them for you. - Really?

74
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,780
Can you just tell me exactly where you bought them and from whom?

75
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,310
Driver Seo.

76
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,480
The parts will arrive this evening. I'll call when the work's done.

77
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,890
It's oil change day, so I'm swamped and my head is spinning.

78
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,620
Jin Eon is busy until tonight.

79
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,860
Chief Park.

80
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,489
I have to go out to renew my insurance.

81
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,860
Can you cover the office for a bit?

82
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,100
And Go Eun's heading out.

83
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,570
I'm swamped. Why don't you call Driver Kim?

84
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,570
I can't. He drove all night and just got in.

85
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,040
I think he just fell asleep.

86
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,310
Right.

87
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,710
You can't wake someone up after a long haul like that.

88
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,640
Fine, I'll go ask Mr. Jang.

89
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,580
Gosh.

90
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,920
Looks like it's up to me.

91
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,090
Gosh, it's hot!

(Deluxe Taxi)

95
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,540
For tricking Da Som, who isn't even ten,

96
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,480
and stealing 98 dollars from her.

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,810
(Deluxe Taxi)

98
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,720

104
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,600
I can't go. I can't see anything.

105
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,100
Stop. Goodness.

106
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,170
(Rainbow Transport)

107
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,080
Stop spraying that. I can't breathe.

(One week later)

109
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,660
To get this film on right, there can't be even a speck of dust.

110
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
I'm already wiping it so hard the glass is about to disappear.

111
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,070
Go Eun.

112
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,200
There's still a wet spot on the side.

113
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,910
- Here? - No, not there. Next to it.

114
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,040
- Here? - Next to that.

115
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,510
- Here? - Next to that.

116
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,250
- Where "next to that"? I'm done. - No,

117
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,580
I mean here. Right here.

118
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,990
Let's just do it when Chief Choi gets back.

119
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,390
No way. I promised Driver Seo I'd finish it by today.

120
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,360
Where on earth did Chief Choi go? He's not answering calls or texts.

121
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,430
Are you not done yet?

122
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,900
No.

123
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,570
It's taking forever since I'm doing it by myself.

124
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,970
"By myself"? I've helped you so much my arms are about to fall off.

125
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,980
- Any word from Chief Choi yet? - No.

126
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,080
Should I ask Mr. Jang if he's heard from him?

127
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,810
I already asked him this morning.

128
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,320
He said he'd take a few days off, but he's not answering his phone.

129
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,350
He must be on one heck of a vacation if he can't answer his phone.

130
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,390
You don't think he went abroad, do you?

131
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,260
He took the Deluxe Taxi, so he must be in the country.

132
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,889
He's making us all worry sick.

133
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,260
Just you wait until you get back.

134
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,770
- Would you buy me a coffee? - Sure.

135
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,310
- You want one too, Chief Park? - No, I'm good.

136
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,210
Guess I have to finish this myself.

137
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,440
Jin Eon.

138
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Gyeong Gu!

139
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,510
- Have you been okay? - I tried calling you so many times.

140
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,940
What happened? You look terrible.

141
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,150
Gyeong Gu, where have you been and what have you been doing?

142
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,650
- My 5,000 dollars. - What?

143
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,020
Five thousand dollars?

144
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,330
Chief Choi, come on and sit down.

145
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,030
What are you doing over there by yourself?

146
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,970
Yes. Why are you lurking over there like you committed a crime?

147
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,430
No, I'm fine.

148
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,240
I'll just stay here. I'm more comfortable.

149
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,310
Get over here and sit down while I'm still asking nicely.

150
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,150
That's our Go Eun, always so sweet with her words.

151
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,590
So, what Da Som tried to buy was a pair of gloves, right?

152
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,430
Yes. They're worth a whopping 200 dollars new,

153
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,500
but it was listed for 98 dollars because it had been "tried on once."

154
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,400
Even so, isn't that a bit pricey for a kid?

155
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,270
Her dad's in the hospital after an accident,

156
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,570
and the doctor told them to keep his hands and feet warm.

157
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,040
So Da Som took her entire life savings...

158
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,150
and used it to buy the best gloves she could find on a resale app.

159
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,920
Darn it. Of all the people to scam, they go after a kid.

160
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,620
Those jerks. Just wait until I get my hands on them.

161
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,250
Why didn't you just give 98 dollars to Da Som?

162
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,490
Hey.

163
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,190
That wouldn't be Da Som's money.

164
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,090
What's the difference?

165
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,000
I can't really explain it. But it's different.

166
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,400
But how in the world did you go from trying to get back 98 dollars...

167
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,340
to getting scammed out of 5,000 dollars?

168
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,710
That's what I'm saying! How does that even happen?

169
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,240
Well, here's what happened.

170
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,280
I almost had that jerk.

171
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,650
I went on the resale app Da Som told me about,

172
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,090
and the scam listing was still brazenly posted.

173
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,320
Wait! There it is.

174
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,790
- Username, Fishing King. - Username, Fishing King.

175
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,760
The username was Fishing Master before.

176
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,800
And that name just annoys me even more. This scum.

177
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,270
He's in the same neighborhood too.

178
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,000
This guy's got some nerve.

179
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,840
Anyway, I have him now.

180
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,110
"I want to buy a cell phone."

181
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,950
"I'd like to meet in person."

182
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,020
My plan is to pretend to be a buyer and set up an in-person meeting.

183
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,989
And when he shows up, I'd nab him.

184
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,220
What do you think?

185
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,400
My mistake was sending cash first to gain his trust.

186
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,930
He ghosted me the second he got the money.

187
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,840
Did you report the listing?

188
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,540
I did,

189
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,840
but he just posted it again under a different username.

190
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,710
But I don't think any phone would cost 5,000 dollars, would it?

191
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,950
Right.

192
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,080
- Of course not. - But you said you lost 5,000.

193
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,020
"I want to buy a bicycle."

194
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,090
"Since it's expensive, I want to meet in person."

195
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,230
It's too much money for him to pass up. He'll definitely show.

196
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,900
And that's when...

197
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,700
- I'd nab him. - Nab him.

198
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,849
It was a mistake to agree to giving him...

199
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,380
half of the deposit to put him at ease.

200
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,490
Darn it. He ghosted me after getting just half of it.

201
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,360
- Did you go to the police station? - For Da Som's case or mine?

202
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,390
- Come on. - Well... Both.

203
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,530
I reported the account number that Da Som sent money to.

204
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,740
But the officer said it'd be hard to catch him anytime soon.

205
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,340
They wouldn't even investigate? Why not?

206
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,780
Even if you report that account, it's bound to be a mule account,

207
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,310
and even if the police file to have it frozen,

208
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,950
the money will have already been transferred overseas.

209
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,150
That's why these online crimes are so hard to track.

210
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,850
Just like with that voice phishing case.

211
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,790
Yes, that's exactly what he said.

212
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,920
But you got scammed once before. How could you...

213
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,160
It felt like he was right there in front of me!

214
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,860
Nab him? You lost 5,000 dollars without even getting a glimpse.

215
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,770
We were texting back and forth, and we even talked on the phone.

216
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,200
I thought I could just reach out and grab him.

217
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,980
So I guess we'll get your money back with Da Som's, Chief Choi.

218
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,350
I guess we have to. The man who went for Da Som's money...

219
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,110
basically became Park Da Som. What are you going to do?

220
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,050
Thanks, guys.

221
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,920
Can you get me the tracking number from the brick package Da Som got?

222
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,530
Yes, I took photos of it.

223
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,660
Good job, our little Da Som. Good job.

224
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,230
Once we look up the tracking number,

225
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,230
we can find the sender's address.

226
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,740
I'll go check it out.

227
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,240
It was that simple all along.

228
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,410
You guys are amazing, as always.

229
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,910
Gosh.

230
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,520
Goodness.

231
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,050
You didn't have to come. This isn't for work.

232
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,720
Anytime you take the taxi out, it's a job for all of us.

233
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,990
I'm just going to get my stolen money back, that's all.

234
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,130
With all the grief he's given us, I don't even want to help him.

235
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Just thinking about that jerk still makes me shake with rage.

236
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,930
I'd rather reenlist in the army, you know?

237
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,570
For Chief Choi, it was never about the 98 dollars.

238
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,810
It was about Da Som's feelings behind it.

239
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,610
Yes, that's Chief Choi for you.

240
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,750
He just drives you crazy sometimes.

241
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,620
- Let's go. - All right.

242
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,889
This is so frustrating!

243
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,190
(Safety First)

244
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,160
So, what should I do? Should I wash the car or something?

245
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,800
- I'll make it spotless. - Wash yourself, not the car!

246
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,030
- Me? Clean? - Yes, you! Go clean yourself up!

247
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,770
Looks like it's the first floor of this building.

248
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,410
That was quick.

249
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,990
Hello? Anyone home?

250
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
Is anybody here?

251
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,300
I guess no one's home.

252
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,300
We found the place, but...

253
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,570
Why? Is something wrong?

254
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,540
Driver Kim, get out of there!

255
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,350
Stay back.

256
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,190
Hey! Can you hear me?

257
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,990
Are you okay?

258
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,730
Go Eun!

259
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,270
- Ma'am? Are you with us? I... - Yes.

260
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,770
- Get her on my back. - Okay.

261
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,510
One second.

262
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,870
Are you also here...

263
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,040
to get your money back?

264
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,940
What am I going to do?

265
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,740
I have nothing to give you.

266
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,710
You're right, I did come to get my money back.

267
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,550
But you don't seem like the person...

268
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,060
I should be demanding it from.

269
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,470
You're a victim in this too,

270
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,600
aren't you?

271
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,750
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,850
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,620
It's just, everyone around me blames me for this.

274
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,360
I'm sorry for misunderstanding.

275
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,300
Ms. Yoo Min Jung.

276
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,430
Can you tell me...

277
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,070
what has happened to you?

278
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,780
Oh, my. Little one, your things are so expensive.

279
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,250
I didn't realize having a baby would be this expensive.

280
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,990
I had quit my job, so we were living on just my husband's salary.

281
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,330
So I wanted to save even a little bit on our expenses.

282
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,999
(Baby Supplies: Crib, stroller, car seat)

283
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,970
(It was a gift, but it's too small for my baby, so I'm selling it.)

284
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,970
(Woori Hyunjoo Mom, For safety, use our chat and Secure Pay)

285
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,270
This looks good.

286
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,510
Hi, if these are still available, I'd like to buy the whole lot.

287
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,340
(If these are still available, I'd like to buy the whole lot)

288
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,680
Please... Cross your fingers for me, okay?

289
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,980
- I hope it comes this week. - Please send your account number.

290
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,419
Ms. Yoo Min Jung, we're ready for you.

291
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,490
- Okay. - I just sent the payment.

292
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,620
(Payment sent)

293
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,590
Be careful.

294
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,530
A few days later, a package arrived.

295
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,440
And now, it's time for the unboxing.

296
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,580
Do you know how much thought Mommy put into choosing all this?

297
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,360
What is this?

298
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,170
Just pick up the phone!

299
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,670
(4: Tracking number and photo of package contents)

300
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
The items...

301
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,740
The user ID from the secondhand marketplace app,

302
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,940
account, and tracking number.

303
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,310
I submitted all of it as evidence, including the phone number.

304
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,950
But it all traced back to different people.

305
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,290
On top of that, the phone was a burner.

306
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,890
Looks like this is a burner phone.

307
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,120
If you just go home and wait,

308
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,630
we'll contact you as soon as we have an update.

309
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,630
Do you know when that might be?

310
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,530
When? Well...

311
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,070
We have to request the app's cooperation,

312
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,170
and then wait for them to get back to us.

313
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,040
It's hard to give you an exact timeframe.

314
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,940
What's for lunch? Spicy pork or pork cutlets?

315
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,010
- Soup and rice today. - Excuse me...

316
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,820
Will you even contact me at all?

317
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,490
Contact you? Yes, of course we will.

318
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,920
I know you're upset,

319
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,360
but in cases like this, don't get your hopes up and wait.

320
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,490
That might be better for you.

321
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,030
Why soup and rice again?

322
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,040
If the police weren't going to do anything,

323
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,950
I decided I'd have to fight that jerk my own way.

324
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,620
I was too furious to just sit back and do nothing.

325
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,719
Posting my story of being scammed.

326
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,920
Everyone, please be careful. I hope you get what's coming to you.

327
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,530
I tracked down every post made with his user ID and reported them.

328
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,560
He posted another one. This post is a scam.

329
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,330
Don't buy anything from this person. Seriously.

330
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,070
That's when...

331
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,600
I got a call from that jerk.

332
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,940
Hello?

333
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,110
- We haven't been introduced. - What?

334
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,140
Who is this?

335
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,880
I'll let what's about to happen serve as my introduction.

336
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,420
Let's change your phone first.

337
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,120
Hello?

338
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,120
Are you there?

339
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,860
What was that about?

340
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
A free giveaway?

341
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,000
From that moment on,

342
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,130
he started tormenting me in these bizarre ways.

343
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,710
Hello...

344
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,739
(Is the free bike still available?)

345
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,810
I'm not the one giving away a bike.

346
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,210
(Saw your post about the free item. Still available?)

347
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,480
(I'm interested in the stroller.)

348
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,650
(Giving away an air purifier?)

349
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,220
(Hi, about the stroller you posted...)

350
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,320
Hello?

351
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,120
(Is it still available?)

352
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,460
I told you, I didn't post that!

353
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,020
(Please let me know if it's still available.)

354
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,430
(If no one else wants it, I'll take it.)

355
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,490
(If the dresser's free, I can come now.)

356
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,060
Why do I keep getting these?

357
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,260
(Me! I want it.)

358
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,400
(If the stroller's available, I'll take it!)

359
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,670
I was getting calls and texts from strangers day and night,

360
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,970
(If it's not gone yet, I'd like to have it.)

361
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,970
so it was impossible to lead a normal life.

362
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,440
You're all set up. You can start using it right away.

363
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,940
Okay, thank you.

364
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,080
You're all set. Thank you.

365
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,520
(New Plans, Number Porting, Phone Upgrades)

366
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,120
This is good.

367
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,920
- What is this? - You ordered jokbal, right?

368
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,990
No, I didn't order anything.

369
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,760
Look, right here. Isn't this your number?

370
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,230
I said I didn't order it. You have the wrong place.

371
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,490
Hey, you owe me 49 dollars for the jokbal.

372
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,660
Look, I'm closing the door.

373
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,530
Maybe someone else here ordered it. I'm in a hurry. Just pay me, please.

374
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,800
Sorry, but like I said, I didn't order it.

375
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,870
- It's the right address! - I'm closing the door.

376
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,440
Don't put that down.

377
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,570
- Excuse me. - Just give me the 49 dollars.

378
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
Excuse me!

379
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,910
- Hello? Anyone home? - Who is it?

380
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,420
Please open the door.

381
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,890
Yes? Who is it?

382
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,650
- This will only take a second. - What?

383
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,760
- I've got you now, you wench. - Who are you?

384
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,360
You thought you could steal from me? You scamming wench!

385
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,130
Scam you? What are you talking about?

386
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,560
- Give me my money back, you wench! - Who are you?

387
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,570
- Please, give me my money back! - Who are you?

388
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,640
Everyone! There's a con artist living here!

389
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,340
Please, someone call the police! Everyone! There's a scammer in here!

390
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,280
You wench! Give me my darn money! Please! Give it back to me!

391
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,850
Everyone, please someone call the police!

392
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,480
Help me with this scammer...

393
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,850
I'm a victim here too!

394
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,720
They have my address and my number, so they're using them for this scam.

395
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,360
- How do I know you're not in on it? - Ma'am, that's enough.

396
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,160
- How should I know, you wench? - Ma'am, that's enough.

397
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,760
- Please, just come to my apartment. - First, you need to calm down.

398
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,170
Please, I just need you to come to my apartment.

399
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,530
Stop lying, you wench!

400
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,340
(Concerned Citizen, Con artist, Everyone, be careful.)

401
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,500
On the app,

402
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,110
they'd turned me into a con artist before I knew it.

403
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,680
My picture, my home address,

404
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,980
(Got nothing better to do than scam kids?)

405
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,080
and even my phone number were all posted online.

406
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,350
(Get a life, you jerk.)

407
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,680
(Have you no conscience, taking people's money?)

408
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,980
(Give my money back or I'll hunt you for life.)

409
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,250
(Weren't you raised right? I'll kill you.)

410
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,390
(You scamming wench, I'll catch you.)

411
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,520
(What a scary world.)

412
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
No, sir.

413
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,360
Of course not. I would never do a thing like that.

414
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,860
I am so sorry. Yes, sir.

415
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,570
Hey, Yoo Min Jung.

416
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,110
What is this?

417
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,350
- It's not what it looks like... - Come on. Not you too?

418
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,960
You need to think about the baby.

419
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,690
Just listen to me.

420
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,060
Please?

421
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,660
Hello, sir. I just got off work.

422
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,970
The file? Now?

423
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,000
No, not a problem. I'll send it over right away. Yes, thank you.

424
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,440
Seriously...

425
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,710
- Everything looks good. - Thank you.

426
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,850
- We'll see you next week. - Okay, thank you.

427
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,420
- Can you help her finish up? - Of course, I'll clean you up.

428
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,650
Okay, thank you.

429
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,560
- Come out when you're ready. - Thank you.

430
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,820
Hello?

431
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,890
- It's me, Ms. Yoo Min Jung. - What?

432
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,730
Hello?

433
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,130
How did you get my number?

434
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,970
How do you think?

435
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,840
I got it the day after you activated it.

436
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,070
Want to see something even more fun?

437
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,550
Hey, wait.

438
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,050
Hey, hello?

439
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,420
Hello?

440
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,550
Hello?

441
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,610
Detective.

442
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,420
That jerk is here.

443
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,150
This isn't something I can discuss over the phone.

444
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,120
Could you come down to the station?

445
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,860
Okay.

446
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,729
- Yes, please come in. - I think I'm being blackmailed.

447
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,370
He just sent me this.

448
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,430
Right, I see that.

449
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,870
The thing is, a report was filed.

450
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
A report?

451
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,310
We've received several fraud reports involving your bank account.

452
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,110
- Have a seat. - You're accusing me of fraud?

453
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,180
Yes.

454
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,450
Now, could you start by filling this out, please?

455
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,650
How is this fair? I'm the victim here.

456
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,650
That jerk is the one who sent me this!

457
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,090
First, please calm down.

458
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:42,030
Oh, that jerk knows my account number.

459
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,589
I gave him my account for a refund.

460
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,960
- Now he's using it for this! - Okay.

461
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,600
Look, regardless of the amount, money was deposited in your account.

462
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,070
So you'll have to be investigated. My hands are tied.

463
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,640
But you know I'm the victim.

464
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,770
Look, I get it. Just please fill out the statement form first.

465
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,910
Gosh, she's so darn mouthy.

466
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,750
- I'm the victim here! - Okay.

467
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,550
- How annoying. - The more I pleaded my innocence,

468
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,120
the more hopeless everything felt.

469
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,120
Your name and national ID number here.

470
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,430
In the end, I moved to get away from that jerk.

471
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Honey.

472
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,870
Hello?

473
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,340
So, how's the new place?

474
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Come on, why act so surprised?

475
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,080
I'm recording your voice right now.

476
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,790
I'm reporting you to the police for making threats.

477
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,420
Goodness.

478
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,930
She still hasn't learned her lesson after all that.

479
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,160
Did the cops do anything to protect you?

480
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,870
- Hey! - The cops...

481
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,470
can't catch me.

482
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,600
But me? I can get to you.

483
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,270
Whenever I feel like it.

484
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,040
Anytime.

485
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,190
Hello? Chicken delivery!

486
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,090
- Chicken delivery! - Hey...

487
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,799
- I didn't know what you'd like, - Hello?

488
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,900
So I ordered half-and-half.

489
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,430
Is that okay?

490
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,840
- It was all my fault. - Sounds like someone's in there.

491
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,010
- I'll drop all the charges. - Hello? Delivery!

492
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,410
(Acorn Market, Yoo Min Jung)

493
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,950
I just sent you an account number.

494
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,850
Send 30,000 dollars to this account, and I'll accept your apology.

495
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,890
I was wrong.

496
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,260
- I'll never do it again. - Excuse me. Delivery!

497
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,690
- I don't have any money. - How about jokbal for a snack?

498
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,369
Gosh, stop your whining.

499
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,270
- You're too old for this. - I'm sorry!

500
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,870
- Please! I'm sorry! - Please open the door!

501
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,910
- Anyone home? - Hello! Open the door!

502
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:52,350
- Hello? It's a delivery! - Hey! Ma'am!

503
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,350
- Hey! Please open the door! - Come on, open the door!

504
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,290
- Come on. - Hey, come on!

505
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,390
- I said it's a delivery! - Delivery!

506
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,590
- Nobody's home. - Man, this delivery...

507
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,030
- Hey, what on earth? - Hey, your jokbal!

508
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,700
Hey, can't you hear us?

509
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,900
- Oh, it opened. She's coming out. - You were in there the whole time?

510
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,440
Why didn't you open the door? We've all been waiting.

511
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,640
- We need you to pay. The payment. - We're just making a delivery.

512
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,370
- Please pay for this. The payment. - Please hurry up and pay.

513
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,340
- Please pay. - What are you doing?

514
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,110
- Just pay us already! - We have to go.

515
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,050
- You came out, so take your food. - Hey, we said you need to pay! Now!

516
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,080
- Is that blood? - Gosh, what is this?

517
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,649
- Are you okay? Ma'am. - What's wrong?

518
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,020
- There's blood. - Are you okay?

519
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,720
- Ma'am? - Are you okay?

520
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,330
- Ma'am, are you all right? - Are you okay?

521
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,390
Gosh, what is this?

522
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,730
Oh, my gosh, she's bleeding so much. Ma'am! What do we do?

523
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Are you okay?

524
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,970
Ma'am, are you okay?

525
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,400
- Hey! Someone call 911! - Ma'am, stay with us!

526
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,940

The user ID is under a fake name, The phone and account are burners.

529
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,810
Nothing is actually in his name. It's all fake.

530
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,320
There is one thing that's real.

531
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,750
And what's that?

532
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,690
Voice.

533
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,390
I'm recording your voice right now.

534
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,660
I'm reporting you to the police for making threats.

535
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,800
She still hasn't learned her lesson after all that.

536
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,240
Did the cops do anything to protect you?

537
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,770
- Hey! - The cops can't catch me.

538
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,710
But me? I can get to you.

539
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,610
Whenever I feel like it.

540
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,350
Anytime.

541
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,120
From the way he talks, he's sure he'll never be caught.

542
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,520
Meaning, this isn't the first time he's done this.

543
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,960
Also,

544
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,430
that package Ms. Yoo Min Jung received...

545
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,030
The more I look at it, the more it gets under my skin.

546
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,340
"You Took the Bait"?

547
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,070
His nicknames are about fishing too. God, this jerk is infuriating.

548
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,110
What an arrogant jerk. Seriously, how do we catch him?

549
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,380
We'll start by finding the guy who took the photos.

550
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,350
The photos? The ones taken at the OB-GYN clinic?

551
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,020
Yes.

552
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,060
How's it looking? Is this the right spot?

553
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,930
You think this is it?

554
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,130
If this was taken on a cell phone, the quality wouldn't be this good.

555
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,170
With a high-angle shot like this...

556
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,840
I think Driver Kim was right. It must've been taken from here.

557
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,549
- Go Eun. - "I need CCTV of all entering..."

558
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,750
"or leaving the building opposite..."

559
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,390
"when Yoo Min Jung went into the clinic."

560
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,860
That's what you were going to ask, right?

561
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,130
Yes.

562
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,099
There wasn't much foot traffic, and it was right after lunch,

563
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,200
so hardly anyone was going in or out. I'll find him in no time.

564
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,239
Would you look at that? He even has a camera bag.

565
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,140
He took photos with a telephoto lens.

566
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,710
You already found him?

567
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,010
I'll find out where you can meet him in just a second.

568
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,760
He went so far as to hire a private detective agency...

569
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,990
to take a picture of the victim?

570
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,060
To him, it was probably an effective way to blackmail her.

571
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,300
Most victims probably got scared and gave up after seeing the pics.

- Thank you. - Yes, sure.

Personal problems, worries you can't tell anyone else,

582
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,850
when you've only got a gut feeling and no real proof,

583
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,860
and you lack time or the know-how to handle it yourself.

584
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,620
That's when our skilled staff...

585
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:33,000
can responsibly gather evidence and catch them in the act...

All right, now it's your turn.

00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,950
What is it you'd like us to find out?

591
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,830
- We're pros at paternity tests. - It looks like...

592
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,430
this photo was taken by your staff.

593
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,530
I need to see the information on your client.

594
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,010
- Are you a cop? - Hardly.

595
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,840
If you're not a cop, then pretty soon,

596
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,620
you're going to be in a whole lot of trouble.

597
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,220
Me? Or you?

Who made this coffee?

612
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,750
I did.

Well...

617
00:38:50,401 --> 00:38:51,930
(We even find the location of the moon's reflection floating on lake.)

618
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,300
Look, the request was just made over the phone,

619
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,110
and all we did was send them the picture we took.

620
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,610
That's it.

621
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:07,450
So you're saying the one who hired the private detective...

622
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,650
was Chief Choi.

623
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,190
I'm telling you, I didn't hire them! I'm being framed!

624
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:18,360
They randomly used the identities of people they'd scammed.

625
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,600
But something still feels off.

626
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,970
Why go to the trouble of hiring private investigators...

627
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,470
just to harass Ms. Yoo Min Jung like this?

628
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,840
The retaliation against Ms. Yoo from the beginning...

629
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,940
seems to be a mix of two different M.O.s.

630
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,240
One is meticulous and timid,

631
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,180
like a diligent, low-level con artist.

632
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,720
The other is bold, cruel,

633
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,350
and enjoys playing sadistic games.

634
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,090
And this situation feels more like the latter.

635
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,660
So like you said, it's not one guy, but a whole group?

636
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,700
It's clear they're organized.

637
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,070
I have to be honest. At first,

638
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:05,210
I was frustrated, wondering how people still fall for them.

639
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,040
But now I can see how it could happen.

640
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,279
It drives you absolutely crazy when you're watching.

641
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,380
It's not like they're a ghost.

642
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,979
They text me and call me.

643
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,450
If I just push a little harder, I could catch them.

644
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,520
But I just can't catch them.

645
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,290
I have an idea.

646
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,960
An idea?

647
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,030
Do you want to give it a shot?

648
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,800
They're using a private network and routing through overseas IPs,

649
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:38,040
so it's hard to track them. Chasing them just makes them run.

650
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:42,080
So instead of chasing them, we need to make them come to us.

651
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,110
I'd love for them to come to us. But how?

652
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,020
From now on, is everyone ready to do exactly as I say?

00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,460

No, you must sound more desperate than that, Mr. Jang.

657
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,500
What's with "seeking to purchase"? This is an Elements' concert!

658
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,770
- All right. - Try, "I'm dyiiing to buy tickets!"

659
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,240
- Pwease. - Get them for me, pwease.

- That's it. - And then, what was next?

663
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,080
- The crying emojis. - Right, and the crying emojis.

664
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,210
- Gosh, you're a natural. - Okay.

665

We need to make it seem like these tickets are super popular...

674
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,780
and that they're impossible to find. Keep posting to create that feeling.

675

Don't forget the crying emoji. You're all doing great. That's it.

677
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,320
- Just like that. Right. - Is it good?

678
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,750
Keep posting like an Elements fan.

My girlfriend is dying to see this concert,

680
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,060
but it's sold out.

681

Goodness. This is amazing.

682

Okay, I'll pin this post to the top.

698
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:59,880

702
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,040
Got him.

703
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:30,650
- That's the jerk. - How do you know this is our guy?

704
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,920
This resale app requires you to verify your location.

705
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,220
And when you do, it leaves behind GPS data like this.

706
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:41,390
And as you can see, the GPS of Ms. Yoo's scammer...

707
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,090
- is a near-perfect match, right? - I see.

708
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,160
- He's a creature of habit. - So we just raid the place and...

709
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:51,130
Come on. You think he'd use his own address?

710
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,470
Driver Kim, send him a reply.

711
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:01,140
(What's the most I can buy?)

712
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,850

00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,020
(Fishing Emperor: You can get up to 50)

714
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,450
Ask him for proof.

715
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,490
(Can you show me proof you have the physical tickets?)

716
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,560
To give you proof, he'll have to buy one physical ticket himself.

717
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,030
Since he's buying a real ticket, he probably won't think twice.

718
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,570
And then, it's game over.

719
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,810
But...

720
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,110
many people must be buying tickets. How do we single out the scammer?

721
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,880
Why bother singling him out? That's too much work.

722
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:40,420
If we don't, then what?

723
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,920
Elements is still in the middle of recording their album,

724
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,390
so no concert's scheduled.

725
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,420
That's our Elements manager.

726
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:50,089
I see. If the concert's fake,

727
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,530
the whole website is fake too?

728
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:52,660
Yes!

729
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,630
It's one that I made.

730
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,870
A fake website!

731
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:00,940
The only one who bought a ticket from here...

732
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,670
- must be the scammer himself. - Yes.

733
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,310

He sent the photo right after the purchase.

Gosh, look at him go.

742
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,170
Hold on a second.

743
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,840
If we play a little hard to get, he won't get suspicious, right?

744
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,410
She's treating this like a first date.

745
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,210

Gosh, look at this. They even make a site like this to send a message.

770
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,920

775
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,470
I'm actually down in Tongyeong.

776

Okay. I'll head right over. Be careful on your way.

786

796
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:16,020
Bad luck. He's in Tongyeong. It went south at the last minute.

797
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,490
So where did you leave things?

798
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,119
I told him to meet at Jungang Intersection in three hours,

799
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,490
then I hung up.

800
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,560

801
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:24,790

Hello?

807
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,979
Hi, are you the one I'm supposed to meet...

808
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,080
for the concert tickets?

809
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:51,320
Yes, that's right. I'm on my way there now.

810
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:55,160
My brother got into a car accident on his way to meet you.

811
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:57,630
So he says he won't be able to make it today.

812
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,390
Oh, no, is he badly hurt?

813
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:08,200
I'm kind of in a hurry. How about you come meet me instead?

814
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,110
I'm sorry, but I'm not comfortable meeting a stranger by myself.

815
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,740
I'll have my brother call you later when he's awake.

816
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,450
Okay, I understand. I hope he recovers...

817
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:33,800
How can she lie with such a straight face?

818
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:35,830
No wonder people fall for it.

819
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,830
Right? That's what I'm saying.

820
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,600
Isn't it tough studying for the police exam?

821
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,540
They're hiring the most this year, you know.

822
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:45,140
Competition's the lowest it's been.

823
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,810
I should probably ask what's going on.

824
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,380
Oh, no. I'm late for class again.

Hey! Over here!

Noryangjin, please!

829
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:11,570
And step on it.

830
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:17,670
Hey, I think something's wrong here.

831
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:19,010
Why is this so tight?

832
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,710
Who are you?

833
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,000
Hey, I think you've got the wrong person.

834
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,830
I'm just a part-timer.

835
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,070
I don't know anything.

836
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:20,700
I swear, I don't know anything.

837
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,940
What did you take his mask off for?

838
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,810
You'd probably be better off leaving it on.

839
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,050
In an hour,

840
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,960
you'll be on your knees, begging us to kill you.

841
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,220
Thirty minutes.

842
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,460
And that's if you're even still alive.

843
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:50,200
Please let me go.

844
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,200
I swear, I don't know anything!

845
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:58,470
Then why don't you tell me what you do know?

846
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:06,180
She still hasn't learned her lesson after all that.

847
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,580
Did the cops do anything to protect you?

848
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,520
The cops can't catch me.

849
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,190

850
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,100
This looks a little dull.

851
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,899
Just wing it.

852
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,670
It's not like it's my own flesh.

853
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,450
That voice is our general manager.

854
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,180
Where is he right now?

855
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,050
I don't know either.

856
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:46,550
I've only ever talked to him on the phone.

857
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,630
I swear, we've never met in person. Not once.

858
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,990
You've never even met him?

859
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,730
- No. - So everyone with you today...

860
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,670
has never met this so-called general manager either?

861
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:01,040
There was never any need to.

862
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:06,340
He sends us what we need by courier and wires our pay to our accounts.

863
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:07,880
Why would we go through the hassle of meeting?

864
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,410
Besides, I'm a veteran at this.

865
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,880
A "veteran"?

866
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:16,990
I'm guessing that "experience" of yours...

867
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:19,890
is based on how many innocent people...

868
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:24,530
you've successfully scammed, is that it?

869
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Should I cut here?

870
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,600
Or here? Should I start with his ankles?

871
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:31,930
Or his wrists?

872
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,170
- Well... - Gosh, it hurts!

873
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,870
Cut here.

874
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,410
- I haven't even touched you. Wait. - Please...

875
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,710
You've got something on you right here.

876
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:45,210
Help me! Please! Spare me! I wet my pants.

877
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,620
(Fight Korea)

878
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,850
What else can I do to make some cash?

879
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:52,350
Crypto's not a bad idea.

880
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,720
(Nari Coin)

881
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:02,660
(Lost Puppy)

882
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:10,440
(To the person who lost their puppy near the Namyangcheon Park fountain)

883
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,680
You're a real cutie.

884
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:21,850
This is Bangwool's owner. I'll be right there.

885
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:41,770
Come here.

886
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:49,740
There we go.

887
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:57,890
Hey! Eat!

888
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,530
Hello? Are you the person who has my Bangwool?

889
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:13,800
Bangwool is mine now.

890
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,040
(Mango)

891
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:25,480
From now on, you're Mango Six.

892
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,520
Wait, no. Seven.

893
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,520
Don't.

894
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:39,230
Stop whimpering. I hate that sound.

895
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,820
Fire in the hole!

896
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,940
Stop it. Don't bark.

897
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,310
Are you defying me?

898
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:33,080
Hey! Didn't I tell you to stop whimpering?

899
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:40,220
(The scene in which an animal is shot was created using CGI.)

900
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,890
(Taxi Driver 3)

901
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,990
I tell you, it's like they all see crime as some high-paying gig.

902
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,560
Have you ever done this kind of work?

903
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:26,400
Humans or animals, words are useless on scum like them.

904
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:29,200
- Let's see who dies first. - Hey!

905
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:34,380
There are people who run a business catering to aspiring criminals.

906
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,680
- Samheung Island? - Isn't that the island up north?

907
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,250
Something's a little off, don't you think?

908
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,080
The people on this island...

909
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,020
How should I put this? It's like they're not quite human.
