(Children and animals were filmed under guidelines.)

(Episode 2)

9
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,040
Goodness. I told that old fool to take it easy.

10
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,180
- Has she paid off her debt? - Yes, sir. She's paid in full.

11
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,290
At least put some clothes on her.

12
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,660
Understood.

13
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
All right.

14
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,670
You're still alive?

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How pathetic.

16
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,110
Must be tough, right?

17
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,350
She was stabbed with a wine opener.

18
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,780
On her upper body alone, we found 29 stab wounds.

19
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,350
There are 29 wounds?

20
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,250
So she was murdered with a wine opener?

21
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,020
The cause of death was asphyxiation.

22
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,430
From the ligature marks here,

23
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,960
it appears she was strangled with a pair of blue stockings.

24
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,130
The issue is how the body was displayed,

25
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,730
almost as if to make a statement.

26
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,900
Gosh, this is gruesome.

27
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,140
- Let me know if you find any leads. - Will do.

28
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Look at this.

29
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,720
Her fingerprints and footprints have been erased,

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,350
so we can’t confirm her identity yet.

31
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,360
But we think she’s the woman...

32
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,290
who went missing in Hong Kong two years ago.

33
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,030
Yes.

34
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,530
It's her.

35
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,070
Forensics suggest...

36
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,370
it doesn’t seem like they tried to hide anything.

37
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,640
They left her here on purpose.

38
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,640
Just like they’re saying,

39
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,480
"Here she is, come get her."

40
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,010
Yes.

41
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,150
It's getting bolder.

42
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,050
More frequent too.

43
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,260
Go ahead.

44
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,490
What? They got hit?

45
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,670
(Taxi Driver 3)

46
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,410

47
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,640
(Closed, Authorized Personnel Only)

48
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,020
- Get to work! - Yes, sir!

49
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,250
- This job will take forever. - Oh, great. Two more people.

50
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,720
Hey, get some coffee over here too.

51
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,160
Don't go playing favorites with your buddies.

52
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,340
Here, sir.

53
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,610
Boss should be satisfied with these sales numbers.

54
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,670
Profits from Korea and Hong Kong are up from the last quarter.

55
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,900
Give them a bonus.

56
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,640
Hard work must be rewarded.

57
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,940
Understood, boss.

58
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,980
My apologies, sir. Some guy suddenly started a brawl,

59
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,620
so we couldn't finish selecting the security detail.

60
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,860
He's the one who caused the scene at the gym.

61
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,460
The reason?

62
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,460
Apparently, someone spit on his shoes.

63
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,640
Tell your boss.

64
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,510
To buy me new shoes,

65
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,110
and when he does,

66
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
have him call me here.

67
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,380
Well, well. It seems we were at fault.

68
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,920
Buy him a new pair of shoes and set up a meeting.

69
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,160
When you're wrong,

70
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
you apologize.

71
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,030
Understood.

72
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,830
They hold monthly fight clubs to recruit...

73
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,200
the people they need for their organization.

74
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,970
But how did you figure that out?

75
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,970
It was on a whiteboard.

76
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,980
So that means we found a solid lead, right?

77
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,820
More like you've set the perfect bait.

78
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Chief Choi.

79
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,360
Go straight through the intersection.

80
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,930
What? What's going on?

81
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,830
We're being followed.

82
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,070
What?

83
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,340
How do you want us to back you up?

84
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,110
I'm good. It's just one car.

85
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,180
You think it's those guys from the gym?

86
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,440
Guess I'll have to ask them in person.

87
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,480
You want to go for round two...

88
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
right here?

89
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,380
- Gosh! My bad, my bad. - You're just too big.

90
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,190
I'm Detective Suzuki of the Fukuoka Prefectural Police.

91
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,100
You're coming with us.

92
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,700
Come on.

93
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,370
(Fukuoka Prefectural Police Headquarters)

94
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,310
This makes no sense.

95
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,510
How does a Korean get his hands on a Japanese taxi?

96
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,480
- It was given to me. - Answer me in Japanese.

97
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,220
Other than a taxi company,

98
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,520
where else can you get a taxi?

99
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,620
Hey. You don't realize the trouble you're in, do you?

100
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,800
Let me guess. You're really, really mad at me?

101
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,830
- Why, you little punk! - I'm so scared.

102
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Hello?

103
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,180
Kim Do Gi?

104
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,320
That's right. He's here on a special training program from our company.

105
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,590
Yes.

106
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,420
I'll fax it over to you.

107
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,260
Okay.

108
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,400
- Thank you for your help. - Of course. It was no trouble.

109
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,380
It checks out. What he said is true.

110
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,379
He’s also listed as an employee...

111
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,620
of a South Korean company called Rainbow Taxi.

112
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,420
Who is this guy?

113
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,759
Shows up out of nowhere...

114
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,160
and ruins everything we’ve been working on for months.

115
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,400
We should get him deported immediately.

116
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,470
What's that supposed to mean?

117
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,040
If, as you say,

118
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,840
he ruined our operation,

119
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,580
burned through our funds, and wasted our time.

120
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,150
Then logically,

121
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,050
he might be the only option we have left.

122
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,090
What? How does that make any sense?

123
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Lunchbox.

124
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Excuse me.

125
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,770
Care for a cup of coffee?

126
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,780
I know a place.

127
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,230
Michael Chang.

128
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,930
Interpol Inspector.

129
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,000
You know Interpol, right?

130
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,700
He's the real deal.

131
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,770
First the police, and now Interpol.

132
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,840
Feels like I'm in some serious trouble.

133
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,470
We’re making him feel worried.

134
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,670
Of course he’d feel that way.

135
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,810
Sorry if I offended you.

136
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,780
He says he's sorry.

137
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,950
Sure you are.

138
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,250
You understand English?

139
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,920
I get the feeling you’ve got something specific you want to say.

140
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:49,950
What? You speak it fluently too?

141
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,060
Have you ever seen this game before?

142
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,900
Over the past three years,

143
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,970
more and more people from Hong Kong, Taiwan,

144
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,440
and other parts of Asia have gone missing after coming to Japan.

145
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,810
Hey, isn't that the gambling game I Seo and I played?

146
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,980
And they all have a few things in common.

147
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,050
They all borrowed money from a loan company called Neko Money,

148
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
failed to repay it,

149
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,420
came to Japan,

150
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
and then vanished.

151
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,000
And this gambling game...

152
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
is where they all began.

153
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,770
Are you serious?

154
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,700
So these jerks run the same scam in other countries too.

155
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,970
Matsuda Keita.

156
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,040
Owns a loan company.

157
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,680
Also a key player in the crime gang that's been rising in this region.

158
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,280
That gym you visited?

159
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,320
Matsuda uses it as a recruitment hub for his organization.

160
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,250
And the opponent you knocked down?

161
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,990
He was actually one of our undercover officers.

162
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,560
After a few tests,

163
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,970
he was set to be selected as Matsuda’s security today.

164
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,540
Why are you telling me all this?

165
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,380
Matsuda likes trained fighters.

166
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,250
Especially someone exceptionally skilled in combat.

167
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,780
You’d be a great help.

168
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,020
And what makes you think I'd help you?

169
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,490
You show up in Japan,

170
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,930
walk into Matsuda’s gym,

171
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
pick a fight,

172
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,130
and take down one of our biggest guys easily.

173
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,370
And you’re telling me you’re just a taxi driver?

174
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,770
Come on. Even you would admit that sounds a little off.

175
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,780
I'm not going to ask who you really are...

176
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,250
or why you're trying to get close to this guy.

177
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,020
As long as it benefits both of us,

178
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
that's all that matters.

179
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,130
Thanks for the drink.

180
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,900
The more I see him, the more suspicious he looks.

181
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,110
A trilingual taxi driver?

182
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,780
Where in the world do you find someone like that?

183
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,610
Right there.

184
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,190
What are you going to do if this all goes south?

185
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,220
What about damage control?

186
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,860
Damage control is something you do after things go wrong.

187
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,830
Let’s think about it then.

188
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,230
Please, try some. Welcome.

189
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,970
Gosh, Driver Kim Do Gi is a trouble magnet, even out here.

190
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,170
But is it really okay for us to get involved in a police case?

191
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,140
It's not exactly ideal.

192
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,440
However, as things stand,

193
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:03,210
it's worth seeking common ground that helps us both.

194
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,380
And I think it might help us find I Seo too.

195
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,150
I agree.

196
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,720
Looks like I Seo is in with someone far more dangerous than we thought.

197
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,390
First, meeting this guy they call the boss...

198
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,630
- is the top priority. - Exactly.

199
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
Hey!

200
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,340
We got a customer. See, Chief? Told you we should've charged more.

201
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
I don't speak Japanese.

202
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,410
When did this place get here?

203
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,740
Should I go bring some customers here?

204
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,350
Welcome!

205
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,310
How about five dollars per head?

206
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,350
Welcome!

207
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,920
Are you messing with me?

208
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,490
Welcome.

209
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:45,660
Do you have any idea who I am?

210
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,290
I'm the man who served...

211
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,400
the original owner of this land.

212
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,770
The third-generation leader of the Haneshima Clan,

213
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,670
Hoshino Masahisa.

214
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,510
When I walked down the street,

215
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,840
no one even dared to breathe.

216
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,849
Welcome.

217
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,210
If I so much as heard...

218
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,950
so much as a breath,

219
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,720
it was off with their heads!

220
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,290
That's the man I am.

221
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,660
He wants a cut for bringing clients. Just tell him yes.

222
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,370
- Okay! Good. Okay. - Okay. Five dollars per head.

223
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,470
Okay! Yes, okay!

224
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,870
Okay! You should've just said so in the first place.

225
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,270
Let's make this work. All right.

226
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,860
What a long-winded way to say he's shaking us down.

227
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,290
What was that? He just comes in here acting like he owns the place.

228
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,789
He's probably just some washed-up yakuza.

229
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,399
Gosh, I guess our little shop has a sales rep now.

230
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,130
Salesman? He's just a thug.

231
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,930
Someone's mad. Why?

232
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,840
Hello?

233
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,580
Right. Yes.

234
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,150
If the new shoes are ready, it's time to go break them in.

235
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,450
Looks like I'll finally meet this so-called boss.

236
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,530
We've been expecting you. This way, please.

237
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,090
Have a seat.

238
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,730
I'll apologize.

239
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,330
Formally.

240
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,140
So that's him? The boss?

241
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,210
My old shoes, indeed.

242
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,750
Now it's your turn.

243
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,150
You caused a disturbance on our turf.

244
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,450
So it's only right that you apologize.

245
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,260
- Ikuya. - Yes, sir.

246
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,610
I've apologized your way.

247
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,780
So now, you will apologize my way.

248
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
It's only fair.

249
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,620
And how would you like me to apologize?

250
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,460
Leave one of your fingers behind,

251
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,460
and I'll accept your apology.

252
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,010
Don't like that idea?

253
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,890
If you're skilled enough, come and take it.

254
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,720
So you're the boss here?

255
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,030
I do want to apologize, though.

256
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,770
Do you accept a finger from someone else?

257
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,840
Please spare me, boss!

258
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,220
Boss!

259
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,020
Driver Kim Do Gi. They're here sooner than we thought.

260
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,160
Time out.

261
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,990
Get out of the way unless you want to be arrested too!

262
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,790
What? He already bolted?

263
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,600
And here I thought those uninvited guests were for me.

264
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,270
Turns out they were here for you?

265
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,680
Since I owe you one, does that mean I owe you a finger?

266
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,480
A killer from Korea.

267
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,820
I knew you weren't some average joes, but still.

268
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,220
You think you have something on me now?

269
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,390
You're not important enough to have a weakness.

270
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,160
All the powerless punks I've seen are just like you.

271
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,400
They are all bark and no bite.

272
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,130
- That's it. That's all I'm taking. - Time out, time out.

273
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,210
- See? You're all talk. - Hey, what did you just say?

274
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,010
Say it so I can understand!

275
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:48,180
- Blah, blah. - Hey. Stop the car.

276
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,350
Stop the car.

277
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
Stop the car!

278
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,120
That's right, don't stop.

279
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,120
- Stop. - Yes, sir.

280
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,430
- Don't stop. - Stop!

281
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,150
Darn it.

282
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,930
I was about to make you...

283
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,000
get me some water. Guess there's no need now.

284
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,950
Did he hit his head or something?

285
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,390
You've got a decent punch. Though you're still no match for me.

286
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,560
You want another round?

287
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,000
You got nowhere to go? Why don't you work for me?

288
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,770
What, so you can cut off my finger? I'll pass.

289
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,140
Forget the finger.

290
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,910
Work for me.

291
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,950
No.

292
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,990
Thanks for the water.

293
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,230
Hey. Work for me.

294
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,780
Welcome!

295
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,380
Thank you.

296
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,290
This is tough. Really tough.

297
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,320
Something is actually hard for you, Go Eun?

298
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,690
I've hacked into every company Matsuda supposedly runs,

299
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,460
but it looks like all the important data is analog.

300
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,900
This whole network is just a shell.

301
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,140
And there's not one clue about I Seo.

302
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,210
Am I missing a server?

303
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,120
It's like you said, Go Eun. It won't be on a server.

304
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,020
He doesn't seem like the type to trust even his own people.

305
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:56,190
The key data is probably somewhere he keeps from his own people.

306
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,600
Criminal groups usually operate as a cell network,

307
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,200
but this Matsuda fellow doesn't seem to trust his own cells.

308
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,710
On the bright side, that means we only have one person to handle.

309
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,110
Looks like you'll have to meet with him more often.

310
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,680
- Hey! - It's hot.

311
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,350
For crying out loud. He's here again?

312
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,350
Does he have to show up almost every single day?

313
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:24,650
The guy I sent earlier was here, right?

314
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,460
Welcome.

315
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,160
The fee. Five dollars.

316
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,460
Darn it.

317
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
What's this?

318
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,040
I said five dollars.

319
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,969
Wait. If a customer pays 10 dollars and ingredients cost 5 dollars,

320
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,240
and your fee is five dollars, how are we meant to make a living?

321
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,980
- See? Five dollars won't work! - What was that?

322
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,820
I'm the man who served the original owner of this land.

323
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,480
The third-generation leader of the Haneshima Clan,

324
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,389
Hoshino Masahisa.

325
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,450
How dare you?

326
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,690
You dare speak to me like that!

327
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,830
Give it to him and get rid of him before he starts on his glory days.

328
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,930
No, no. This is completely unfair.

329
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,200
I've heard that story so many times. My ears are bleeding.

330
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,810
That's more like it.

331
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,810
Hey, wait! My one dollar! You have to give me my change! Hey!

332
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,380
Just let it go. Don't pick a fight.

333
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,880
On my way here, I saw many guys like him on the main street...

334
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,490
That guy comes here often.

335
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,420
He can't get a job,

336
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,290
let alone a credit card. Even his bank accounts are frozen.

337
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,930
It's like he's living in the past, not the present.

338
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,740
Hey, you piece of trash!

339
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,740
What are you doing hanging around here?

340
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,939
What, feeling nostalgic for your old turf?

341
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,150
Actually, I can't hear you.

342
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:01,220
Here! Go hole up in a temple and die already.

343
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,650
Old geezer!

344
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,120
Sorry. That sounds good.

345
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,460
Oh, you're playing dumb?

346
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,000
Aren't those the guys who were in front of the gym?

347
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,200
You're not waiting for me to get you one, are you?

348
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,300
Funds from the foreign branches have started moving rapidly.

349
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,470
That means Matsuda is planning something.

350
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,310
We don't have time.

351
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,440
We need to come up with a plan.

352
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,650
A plan?

353
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,180
You have something in your mind?

354
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,950
We need to get inside them.

355
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,590
I was thinking of getting some food.

356
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,230
Food?

357
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,790
But to eat,

358
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,700
I'll need that guy's help.

359
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,510
What are you looking at?

360
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,080
How many units did they say are coming in today?

361
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,150
Four from the Far East.

362
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,220
Eight from Central, plus two others. We're expecting ten in total.

363
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,860
So that's 14 in total.

364
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,290
A toast, everyone?

365
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,960
- Cheers. - Cheers.

366
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,970
As always, I appreciate all your hard work.

367
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,300
It's for you, Matsuda. Of course we'll do our best.

368
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,070
And another thing.

369
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,610
Don't mistake me for a fool.

370
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,550
I'm not sure what you mean.

371
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,980
All that cash you've been pocketing...

372
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,620
Don't think for a second I didn't know.

373
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,610
You backstabbing traitor.

374
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,330
What kind of driving is that?

375
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,200
Who do you think you are?

376
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,310
You interested in finding out who I am?

377
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,320
If you're that curious,

378
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,020
why don't we discuss it over tea?

379
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,290
Hey, this isn't what you promised!

380
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,500
What are you staring at?

381
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,030
What are you staring at?

382
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,270
Go mind your business!

383
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,440
Who is it?

384
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,250
Can you even make a living doing that?

385
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,390
A man needs to make a living.

386
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,420
So move your car.

387
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,770
Hey!

388
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,640
Nice work.

389
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,180
Nice work?

390
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,950
Is this really the right way to handle this?

391
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,680
Because it feels like he's just messing with us,

392
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,020
rather than helping us.

393
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,890
Leave me out of that "us."

394
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,090
I haven't even eaten all day.

395
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,600
- This is delicious. - It's tasty.

396
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,940
I told you. It's my treat.

397
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,010
You got it last time, so it's my turn.

398
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,510
If you insist. I'll be sure to eat a lot, then.

399
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,020
Sure. Eat up.

400
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,220
Just don't have more than three.

401
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:13,000
I haven't had many fares today, so I'm a bit short on cash.

402
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,630
What's that, no money?

403
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,830
Hey, you.

404
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,800
Look, it can't be helped. It's on the house. We're closing up!

405
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,870
- What? - Hey, I said we're closing!

406
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,060
For over ten years,

407
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,560
I did every kind of dirty job imaginable.

408
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,700
While we were taking down a rival crew,

409
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,070
my guys, who were like brothers to me,

410
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,500
betrayed me and my boss.

411
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,570
I lost my crew and my boss,

412
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,180
but I made sure every one of them paid.

413
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,310
Backstabbers like them...

414
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,650
They don't deserve to live.

415
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,520
Even these shoes...

416
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,160
They were the last gift my boss ever gave me.

417
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,060
Quit driving a taxi and come work for me.

418
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,970
Don't worry about rival crews. I wiped them all out long ago.

419
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,100
I'll pay you ten times what you make as a taxi driver.

420
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,470
I'm not interested.

421
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,680
What will it take for you to join my crew?

422
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,980
I don't serve two bosses.

423
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,480
You're a stubborn one.

424
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
But...

425
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,020
I could do some freelance work.

426
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,260
Especially if it involves getting my hands dirty.

427
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,130
Because that's what I'm good at.

428
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:58,400
We're Invisible, so for big jobs, we use disposable people.

429
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,470
That's why we use freelancers.

430
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,540
So... You into young women?

431
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
Young women?

432
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,520
I have many undocumented girls you can treat like slaves.

433
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,680
Want one as a gift?

434
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,890
Is he seriously...

435
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,260
talking about the people they kidnapped?

436
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,330
A gift? Those murdering jerks.

437
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,800
What? You don't want one?

438
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,570
Any man who'd gratefully accept a woman as a gift,

439
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,440
he's the first one you should get rid of.

440
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,080
That's the kind of person...

441
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,280
you can never trust.

442
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,220
You even turn me down in style.

443
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,120
I get paid in cash.

444
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,860
Done.

445
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,420
Hey, hey, over here.

446
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,050
Okay, okay. Excuse us! Yes.

447
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,390
- All right! Hey! - Okay.

448
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,200
Okay. That's good. Looks good.

449
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,610
Hey, freelancer.

450
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,380
While the deal's going down, you all watch the perimeter.

451
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:59,090
When we're done, you pull out. You've got the back door.

452
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,160
And if anyone crashes the party,

453
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,790
I just crush them, right?

454
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,130
The less you have to do, the smoother everything's going.

455
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
Do your job well.

456
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,350
Yes, it's a beautiful night, isn't it?

457
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,450
Not that we can see anything in the dark.

458
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,920
Shall we get right to it?

459
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,830
She's 168cm, size 2.

460
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,440
This lovely lady is from Russia.

461
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,670
So when they talked about auctioning off "merchandise,"

462
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,870
they were talking about these people.

463
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,410
What? Those sons of guns.

464
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,479
She's Russian, everyone. Take a good look.

465
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,080
If you'd like to bid, please turn on your laser pointers.

466
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,690
Is that all, everyone?

467
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:09,090
You can't pass this one up. Look at this smooth skin,

468
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,790
Don't you want a taste?

469
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,960
She's cute.

470
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,710
Chief Park and Chief Choi.

471
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,910
I'm going to need some backup.

472
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,980
We're already geared up and ready.

473
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:39,890
I'm ready too.

474
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,730
No... What are we going to do?

475
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,070
No, stop!

476
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,110
She's my younger sister.

477
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,680
- What is she saying? Come here. - She's my sister!

478
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,380
- I won't! I'm staying with her! - Let go!

479
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,810
Welcome, you jerks.

480
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,290
It's okay. Don't cry.

481
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,360
You're all going home. Don't worry.

482
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:45,250
This way. Go on, head that way.

483
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,740
Yes?

484
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,840
Smoke?

485
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,080
What do you mean, smoke?

486
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,550
Got it. I'm on my way.

487
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,020
Be careful.

488
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,460
Watch out.

489
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,200
It's okay.

490
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,299
- Is that all of them? - Yes.

491
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,370
Let's go.

492
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,210
Who on earth are those jerks?

493
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,850
Yes.

494
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,220
Get them all.

495
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,560
That was the perfect chance to take them all down.

496
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,470
That could have been critical evidence.

497
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,400
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

498
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,739
You're only interested in arresting them,

499
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,810
aren't you?

500
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,340
What?

501
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,410
If you had moved in,

502
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,650
they would have cut their losses, disappeared,

503
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,920
and taken all the unfound victims with them.

504
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,290
I thought we were on the same side.

505
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,560
Are we not?

506
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,800
If our interests align,

507
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,070
then sure, we're on the same side.

508
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,550
That jerk is definitely hiding something.

509
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,450
- What? - He could be playing both sides.

510
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,590
He could just as easily team up with them,

511
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,420
as he did with us.

512
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,800
We need to keep an eye on him.

513
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,600
If they took I Seo the same way they did at the port,

514
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,370
how would we ever find her?

515
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,340
And there's only one person who would know, isn't there?

516
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,840
The man who doesn't even trust his own men.

517
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,680
Matsuda Keita.

518
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:37,650
We have to get inside his base, no matter what.

519
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,720
Driver Kim, you'll be okay, right?

520
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,490
He won't take this lying down.

521
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,190
This all happened after I joined, so I'll be his first suspect.

522
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,699
- Brought you a guest. - He's back.

523
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,200
I'm sick of this old Yakuza geezer.

524
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:05,210
I'll need you to have my back this time, Mr. Jang.

525
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,480
Me? Have your back?

526
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,980
Of course I will. Just tell me what to do.

527
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,950
Bring them here!

528
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:25,860
You too, darn it!

529
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,270
On your feet!

530
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,810
Regarding yesterday's incident,

531
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,950
the only thing that's different about our organization...

532
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,760
is the presence of you part-timers.

533
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,060
I don't know anything.

534
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,830
Then you'll die knowing nothing.

535
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,970
What about you? Do you have a guilty conscience?

536
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,540
I'm just a part-timer! Help me! Please, help me!

537
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,540
The truth...

538
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,910
I have a feeling the truth is pointless here.

539
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,760
- The truth? - Right now, you're not...

540
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:33,860
interested in finding the traitor.

541
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,530
And why would I be?

542
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,200
If I kill all of them, the traitor will die with them.

543
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,670
Coward.

544
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,610
You've never trusted anyone in your life. Not once.

545
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,350
You just kill everyone before you have to trust them.

546
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:01,790
That's because you're terrified of being betrayed.

547
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:04,830
You should answer this.

548
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:11,230
I hope you enjoyed the little gift I sent to the port yesterday.

549
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,340
Did you really think our clan would just stand by and do nothing?

550
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:17,870
Who are you?

551
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:19,440
I am...

552
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,550
the original owner of this land you're standing on.

553
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:25,680
The third-generation head of the Haneshima Clan,

554
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,650
Hoshino Masahisa!

555
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,790
Who did you say you were again?

556
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,150
Yesterday was just a warning.

557
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,960
Next time, we're coming for your lives.

558
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,889
You've got a lot of nerve for some washed-up old geezer.

559
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,000
I dare you to say that to my face!

560
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:46,900
Come find me anytime you want. I'll say it to your face all day.

561
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:53,240
- Just kill them all. - Yes, sir!

562
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:55,910
- Yes, sir! - I'm going with you!

563
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,980
I'm dying to know...

564
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,590
who it was that set me up.

565
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,610
Darn it. Nothing's gone right lately.

566
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:30,980
My goodness.

567
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,050
You didn't use to be like this.

568
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,260
I can't take this anymore.

569
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:46,560
- Hey, you have to piss again? - Come on, move it.

570
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,030
You drink way too much.

571
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,830
Let's go!

572
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,490
The Haneshima Clan.

573
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,690
So you were all still alive?

574
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,690
You don't even have a proper office anymore.

575
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,730
Just this miserable dump.

576
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,760
And you call this your office?

577
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:34,960
You arrogant little punk.

578
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,170
I won't stand for any more of your insults!

579
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:40,640
And what are you going to do about it, you old man?

580
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:44,040
Then I'll just have to crush you all.

581
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,040
You've got it all wrong.

582
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,250
Your time was over a long time ago.

583
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,080
So just wait quietly to fade into nothing.

584
00:51:58,790 --> 00:51:59,920
Back in the day,

585
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,060
when I walked these streets,

586
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,560
no one would even dare to breathe.

587
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:07,930
The moment I heard a peep,

588
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,570
they were as good as dead.

589
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:13,640
All you geezers can do is talk about the good old days.

590
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,100
Living as beggars,

591
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:20,040
you jerks will die on the street and become dog food.

592
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,480
Hey. Tell you what. I'll give you something.

593
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,310
Here, take it.

594
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:50,740
What? It's got a hole in it.

595
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,790
Bring it on!

596
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:19,970
- Boss! - Boss!

597
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:23,370
Blood...

598
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,080
We performed the ritual of brotherhood...

599
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,480
and pledged our loyalty.

600
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,620
With that much blood, he's not going to make it.

601
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:44,030
To go this far for someone so pathetic...

602
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,260
I am a yakuza!

603
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,680
I hate nothing more than someone who attacks from behind.

604
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,510
By the way...

605
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,140
You've been wearing those same shoes, haven't you?

606
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:39,850
Don't worry about what happened. This isn't my first kill.

607
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,580
What's one more?

608
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,190
I owe you one. The least I can do is pay you back.

609
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:51,660
There's no need. I just did what I had to do.

610
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:01,670
So you're the kind of jerk who loves stabbing people in the back?

611
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,940
- Get off me. - I've been stabbed.

612
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,110
I told you to stop messing around with that.

613
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,950
It was really convincing, though.

614
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,980
So, how's it going?

615
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:19,490
- I feel like I'm getting close. - Okay.

616
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,350
Boss! I'm heading out.

617
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:47,420
- Sir. - Sir.

618
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,410
Sit.

619
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,060
So, what do you think?

620
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,730
It's nice. I like it.

621
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,840
What was your boss like?

622
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,470
He always believed in me.

623
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,310
I figured as much.

624
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,910
Is that what you wanted to know?

625
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:32,490
You know, up until now, I've never truly trusted anyone.

626
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,160
No matter how much I stuck to the code,

627
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,130
I'm always the one who's betrayed.

628
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,100
That's why I have to be the one...

629
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,330
to betray first.

630
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,910
Sometimes, when I find a great place to eat,

631
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,180
I'll take a picture of my food.

632
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,410
But then, after I've taken it,

633
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,380
I realize I don't have anyone to send it to.

634
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,090
Food pictures are important.

635
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,060
Can I send them to you?

636
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:17,100
Not as my subordinate, Let's be family. You and me.

637
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,040
Family...

638
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:24,540
No, I mean like sworn brothers.

639
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,540
We'll exchange cups at the altar.

640
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,020
You win.

641
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:39,650
All right.

642
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,020
I'll set you up with a position you deserve.

643
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:47,900
So I guess the casual talk...

644
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:49,560
is over now, right?

645
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,140
Boss.

646
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,500
What the hell are you up to?

647
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:29,070
That's what I want to ask you.

648
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:32,270
What's with all the following and taking pictures?

649
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,510
So you finally decided to side with criminals?

650
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:38,610
You always assume whatever suits you best.

651
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,250
Matsuda is even throwing me a grand welcome ceremony tonight.

652
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:47,120
How many guys can I put in immediately?

653
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,420
Wait a second.

654
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,680
I wish I could at least have a hamburger steak this weekend.

655
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:15,320
For that, I just need another five bucks.

656
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:33,470
I've sent out all the invitations.

657
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:37,470
Living as beggars,

658
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,310
you jerks will die on the street and become dog food.

659
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,510
Hey. Tell you what. I'll give you something.

660
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:49,350
Go hole up in a temple and die already.

661
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,450
Give me a break!

662
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,740
You piece of trash!

663
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:12,570
What are you doing hanging around here?

664
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,480
What, feeling nostalgic for your old turf?

665
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,280
Your time was over a long time ago.

666
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,550
So just wait quietly to fade into nothing.

667
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:28,020
I am a yakuza!

668
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:15,870
By drinking from this cup, you will seal your oath as brothers.

669
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:37,430
Should I let you in on a little secret?

670
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:42,230
That first time I told you to come work for me,

671
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:45,000
if you had actually agreed,

672
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:47,070
I probably would've killed you right then and there.

673
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:48,800
It's still not too late.

674
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:00,250
Boss! You need to leave!

675
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:13,090
Who on earth are you guys? Hey, what's going on?

676
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,130
You can't just barge in here! Hey!

677
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,310
Hey, what's with all these old geezers?

678
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:30,910
We are...

679
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:33,880
all going to die here today.

680
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,319
We're yakuza!

681
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,560
- We're yakuza! - We're yakuza!

682
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,930
We're the real Yakuza!

683
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,000
Charge!

684
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,560
Hurry! We need to leave!

685
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Let's go.

686
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,080
What's with these old geezers?

687
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:42,850
Gone again.

688
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:15,880
Seriously, when did Driver Kim Do Gi even come up with this?

689
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,720
Kill with a borrowed sword.

690
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:23,160
Put your enemies against each other to easily get what you want.

691
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:28,500
That their hope to be gangsters would be stronger than we thought.

692
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,930
- That's what Do Gi figured. - But wait, where's Mr. Kim Do Gi?

693
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,370
Where do you think?

694
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,940
He's making a run for it with the boss.

695
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:33,490
Where on earth did you learn to drive like this?

696
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:37,870
I'm a taxi driver.

697
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:07,160
The more I think about it, there's only one answer.

698
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,460
There's a mole in the organization.

699
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,140
I really hate those who betray.

700
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:19,540
I'm glad I have someone I can count on right now.

701
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:29,920
Looking for this?

702
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:38,490
Kim Do Gi.

703
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:41,030
Since you can't ever trust anyone,

704
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:44,130
you've collected quite a stash, haven't you?

705
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:45,800
Why?

706
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,800
I was going to get you everything you wanted.

707
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:53,610
I was going to give the world to you.

708
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:56,640
But why?

709
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,310
What's the reason for this?

710
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:04,990
Her school break is almost over.

711
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:09,760
I Seo needs to go back to school.

712
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:11,590
What?

713
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:13,760
She has to help out at her grandma's store,

714
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,860
and when her school club lets out,

715
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,130
she has to go get her favorite tteokbokki.

716
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,700
I told you to stop speaking Korean!

717
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:25,070
A piece of scum like you would never understand.

718
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:26,940
Not until the day you die.

719
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,280
Me? Die?

720
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:32,080
You're the one who's going to die!

721
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:53,470
You know, I've noticed something.

722
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:58,410
You're not much of a fighter, are you?

723
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:23,230
Aren't you curious?

724
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,970
If you were to just disappear,

725
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:27,970
would they call it a missing person case?

726
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,970
Or just taking out the trash?

727
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:11,450
Didn't I tell you? I'll betray others first.

728
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,920
Die!

729
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,970
Not late this time.

730
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,440
Right?

731
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:42,640
Now we're in business.

732
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,100
I Seo.

733
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:05,400
I Seo.

734
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,940
I Seo, are you okay?

735
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,510
It's all over now.

736
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:17,810
Let's go home.

737
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:20,950
Let's go home, I Seo.

738
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:32,360
It's okay.

739
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:36,730
You're okay now.

740
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:53,610
Oh Ye Ji!

741
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:06,860
I'm back.

742
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,630
- I Seo. - Yes?

743
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,700
Didn't you miss me?

744
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,270
Yun I Seo.

745
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,440
I'm so glad you're back safely.

746
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,380
I was so scared.

747
01:12:57,910 --> 01:13:01,280
Driver Kim Do Gi! Don't we have one more loose end to tie up?

748
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,780
Yes, I haven't forgotten.

749
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:14,130
Who's there? What?

750
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:19,130
So you're saying I should just go in now, Go Eun?

751
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:21,340
Sorry. I should've told you sooner, right?

752
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:23,340
What the hell is that guy mumbling about?

753
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:28,680
No, it's fine. If you say the word, I'm on it.

754
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,080
- What? Hey, I locked that door. - Just get rid of him.

755
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:36,620
Talking to a brick wall? Answer me. Who on earth are you, punk?

756
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:39,190
What a shame.

757
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:41,790
I didn't come here to talk.

758
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,360
Hey, you son of a gun. Do you have any idea who we are?

759
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:45,860
That's exactly why I'm here.

760
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:07,580
So, what about our fee?

761
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,380
Right. The expenses must've been pretty high this time.

762
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,850
Everything costs an arm and a leg overseas, you know?

763
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,660
Round-trip flights, lodging, food, and car rental.

764
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,690
And parking. Man, parking in Japan is crazy expensive.

765
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,630
Make sure you add in the money that Yakuza guy shook us down for!

766
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,299
And Chief Choi's fines for driving the wrong way...

767
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,499
also came out to a pretty hefty sum.

768
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,570
Well...

769
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:33,870
That's a fortune. We can't ask a student like I Seo to pay for it.

770
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:36,280
Are you crazy? Where would a student get that kind of money?

771
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,910
- I know, right? - Don't worry.

772
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:42,620
- I've already been paid in full. - Nice!

773
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,380
- What? When? - From whom?

774
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,690
Hey, some of the money is missing!

775
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:49,860
Who touched the evidence?

776
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:51,630
No one.

777
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,290
That's all there was from the start.

778
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:57,930
- The amount in this ledger... - Come one. Let's keep moving!

779
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:59,230
What?

780
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,700
We've got a long list to round up.

781
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,100
Come on.

782
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:06,310
Whatever.

783
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:12,480
5283, ending service.

784
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:07,940
(Taxi Driver 3)

785
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,340
They say Manager Yang hooked a real sucker.

786
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:14,809
- The last owner had a DUI... - Driver Oh!

787
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:16,540
And they've taken my license plate!

788
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:21,480
- This car... It hit someone. - Sir, take your car keys.

789
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,350
I told you to take it, you punk!

790
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:25,220
First, I need that car back.

791
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:29,490
That's right, our boss is a lawyer who passed the Bar Exam.

792
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,860
He's been disbarred now. For killing someone.

793
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:35,400
The fact that no one took your side...

794
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:38,230
means you were the one in the wrong.
