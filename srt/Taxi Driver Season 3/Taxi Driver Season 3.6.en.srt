I promise I'll find you, son.

27
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,410
Yes, Min Ho.

29
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,440
Min Ho...

30
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,560
So about that car accident case from 15 years ago you asked about...

31
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,360
I looked into it,

32
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,700
and it turns out there were no CCTV cameras in the area.

33
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,940
And no witnesses either, of course.

34
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,410
The statute of limitations expired, so the case is officially closed.

35
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,440
Right now, besides the memories of those involved in the accident,

36
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,850
there's pretty much nothing we can find out.

37
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,150
Thanks for looking into it.

38
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,220
Let me know if you need anything else.

39
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,450
Hey, Seong Cheol. Let's grab some eel sometime.

40
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,050
You're buying.

41
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,410
I saw it.

42
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,180
I saw it with my own two eyes.

43
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,980
But...

44
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,660
I can't remember.

45
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,830
No matter how hard I try to remember,

46
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,030
it's no use.

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,080
Is Park Min Ho really dead?

51
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,380
You buried him for good, right?

52
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,359
Dong Hyeon.

53
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,690
What is this, all of a sudden? Why ask me about Park Min Ho?

54
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,089
Hey, you don't get to talk to me like that.

55
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,100
I even went to prison for you.

56
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,600
Are you broke?

57
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,640
You want me to bury you too?

58
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,770
Do you, Dong Hyeon?

59
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,510
You want me to bury you too?

60
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,310
Gosh!

61
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,020
You think it's funny, messing around like this?

62
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,790
No, it's not like that.

63
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,320
I don't know what's going on with you,

64
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,790
but you know I know Park Min Ho better than anyone.

65
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,160
There's no way Min Ho can reach you. You know that.

66
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,160
And even if something were to happen to you,

67
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,230
I'll have your back, no matter what.

68
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,070
You're my best friend. Right?

69
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,840
So don't worry about it.

70
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,510
I'm sorry, Seong Uk.

71
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,180
I guess I just lost it for a second.

72
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,350
Right. If you run out of money, give me a call,

73
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,350
and just quit it with the stupid jokes.

74
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,690
I have to prep for my match. You should go.

75
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,620
All right. I'll be ready too.

76
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,160
Yes. Now get lost.

77
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,100
Right. Seong Uk said so himself.

78
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,930
Then what kind of jerk is messing with me?

79
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,680
He's Jo Seong Uk. He's the same age as Park Min Ho and Im Dong Hyeon.

80
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,050
After college, he was a benchwarmer on a pro volleyball team,

81
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,550
but he never made a name for himself before retiring a few years later.

82
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,020
He had a poor record, but he became a college coach, which is tough.

83
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,590
And he held that position for a long time.

84
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,330
And without any formal coaching certifications too.

85
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,830
Any family ties to the university's board?

86
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,200
- Apparently not. - Figured as much.

87
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,970
Mr. Park Dong Su still doesn't recognize you, does he, Mr. Jang?

88
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,540
No.

89
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,940
His moments of lucidity are getting shorter and shorter.

90
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,180
It looks like, for the time being,

91
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,150
I'm going to have to stay at the hospital.

92
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,120
You're living at the hospital? That's a tough gig, you know.

93
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,820
I'll go and focus on Dong Su,

94
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,150
so I need Do Gi and the others to focus on those two.

95
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,090
You never know. We might cross paths in an unexpected way.

96
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,730
Understood.

97
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,230
- Take care. - You too.

98
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,340
But doesn't something seem off with Im Dong Hyeon and Jo Seong Uk?

99
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,569
I thought so when they were talking.

100
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,710
For friends, one's paying the other...

101
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,080
and protecting the other.

102
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,880
That's because Jo Seong Uk was probably the one...

103
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,750
in the CCTV blind spot 15 years ago.

104
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,650
Right?

105
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,590
Yes, that must be it. So Im Dong Hyeon is threatening him...

106
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,960
- and extorting money from him. - I think it's the other way around.

107
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,599
Im Dong Hyeon may be getting the money,

108
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,060
but he's the one being blackmailed.

109
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,770
- What? - Okay.

110
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,800
So, what's our first move?

111
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,310
How about we start with some therapy?

112
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Therapy?

113
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,480
Financial therapy.

114
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,610
Financial therapy.

115
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,410
Right.

116
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,180
That Im Dong Hyeon guy is a serious gambling addict.

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,880
(to refrain from paying respects.)

122
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,460
"Congratulations?"

123
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,390
You're not supposed to use these envelopes at a funeral, are you?

124
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,090
Driver Kim, you've played cards before, right?

125
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,030
No. But with you, Go Eun, what's there to worry about?

126
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,470
Sure. Just leave it to me.

You want to exchange 10,000 dollars, is that right?

140
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,800
Yes, 10,000 dollars.

142

Hang on. Do I know you?

143
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,850
Never mind. Cash, please.

144
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,590
Who runs a money exchange like that? Seriously.

145
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,590
Okay.

146
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,060
Get out now! What kind of stunt are you pulling?

147
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,300
Something wrong, sir?

148
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,960
He snuck in with a hidden camera.

149
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,729
- Darn it. - Come on.

150
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,070
Do you really have to be so rigid?

151
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,769
- What are you talking about? - Driver Kim.

152
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,170
A camera detector is at the door.

153
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,840
Get out of there for now.

154
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,180
If I leave now, it'll just make me look more suspicious.

155
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,950
So, are you exchanging money or not?

156
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,420
Once you've exchanged your money, you can go in.

157
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,030
Driver Kim, you'll be caught if you just go in.

158
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,400
When I walk out of here a big winner,

159
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,900
- I'll tip you. - What?

160
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,570
Darn it, my money! Goodness.

161
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,040
What's this?

162
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,010
Gosh. Hold on.

163
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,950
Are my ancestors telling me I'm going to lose it all?

164
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,750
Darn, this is a bad omen.

165
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,660
Darn it, he stepped on it.

166
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,290
- Seriously. - What a load of nonsense.

167
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,230
You can't just step on it! This is bad. It's a really bad omen!

168
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,330
Darn it.

169
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,500
Real smooth.

170
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,070
This is a really bad omen.

171
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,840
I'll go and pay my respects and come back.

172
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,140
Hold on a second.

173
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,580
You're going to take that with you, right?

174
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,020
That's for your trouble.

175
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,680
Give it to him.

176
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,220
Me?

177
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,420
Gosh. Just let him go.

178
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,800
Without the cameras, we have no way of helping you from out here.

179
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,240
That means you'll have to rely purely on your own skills, right?

180
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,010
Come on, Driver Kim knows what to do. Right?

181
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,880
When it comes to gambling,

182
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,580
I can't do it without you, Go Eun.

183
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,550
Goodness. There's something Driver Kim can't do?

184
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,820
Is there really no other way?

185
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,020
Wait.

186
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,830
My entire past has been leading up to this very fateful day.

187
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,100
How should I put this?

188
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
What?

189
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,570
Just have a seat.

190
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,840
Geumnam-myeon, Hwacheon-gun, Gangwon Province.

191
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,540
It's 1,160m above sea level.

192
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,080
My old company's RnD center was located there.

193
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,610
No buses or taxis, no houses nearby, and security wouldn't let us leave.

194
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,909
For three years.

195
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,350
- It was like the Arctic. - And?

196
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,090
Anyone who went in there...

197
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,160
came out as one of two things. Either a master of table tennis...

198
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,190
or a master cardsharp.

199
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,260
Because once work was done, there was nothing to do at night.

200
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,960
So which one did you become?

201
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,970
- Jin Eon, what hand would you like? - Me?

202
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,900
- Gwangttaeng? - Gwangttaeng?

203
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,970
No. I'll give you a bust.

204
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,780
Like a two-eight bust?

205
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,880
- Go Eun, what would you like? - Then I'll take the Gwangttaeng.

206
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,920
Gwangttaeng is dealt, not chosen. You've never played Seotda, right?

207
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,190
Gwang.

208
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,850
Ttaeng.

209
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,490
No way!

210
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,589
I'll teach Driver Kim quickly, and then...

211
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,630
No.

212
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,600
This time, instead of me,

213
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,670
I need you to go in, Chief Choi.

214
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,100
Me?

215
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
Why?

216
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,610
Oh, boy.

217
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,180
Call. And raise 400.

218
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,479
I can't work alone. I need a partner.

219
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,950
It's suspicious if I keep winning.

220
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,650
I can help with that.

221
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,260
- All in. - Call.

222
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,960
All right, then. Call.

223
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,800
A nine.

224
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,430
Darn it.

225
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,300
What on earth?

226
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,340
What a shame. And you went all in too.

227
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,810
Hey, I'll be back, so don't any of you go anywhere.

228
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,280
Especially you. Don't you take the money and run.

229
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,780
The important thing is, to everyone at that table,

230
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,420
we have to make it absolutely clear we aren't together.

231
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,359
Stay only by my side

232
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,960
Please don't

233
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,670
Leave

234
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,400
What's your game of choice, sir?

235
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,700
I hear the Seotda table is fun.

236
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,210
Oh, you like Seotda? Right this way to the table.

237
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,610
Excuse me, everyone.

238
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,280
Let's have some fun, shall we?

239
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,020
All right, everyone. Ready to lose your shirts?

240
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,690
Hey, now, you can't be doing that.

241
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,060
Do I know Do Gi?

242
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,829
He was the best taxi driver ever...

243
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:06,960
Gosh.

244
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,570
Gosh, you scared me!

245
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,870
Here to borrow some money for the tables?

246
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,640
Yes. I lost it all.

247
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,680
Driver Kim, your credit is good, so I'll waive the interest for you.

248
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,810
Thank you.

249
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,420
- Win big this time. - I will.

250
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,680
Hey!

251
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,090
Driver Kim! Why not have soup before you go?

252
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,290
It must be awful to lose all that money.

253
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,420
(Community Center)

254
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,230
Score!

255
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,930
For crying out loud!

256
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,800
Deal me in, okay? I'll be right back.

257
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,240
Hey, young man.

258
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,670
- Play like a gentleman. - He has no manners.

259
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,280
What gentleman? This is a card game.

260
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,110
Go Eun.

261
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,020
- What? - Hey, can you spot me five bucks?

262
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,180
No.

263
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,290
I saw you earlier. You gave Driver Kim a bag of cash.

264
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,960
- You saw that? - Of course I did.

265
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,690
Pay me back.

266
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,060
Gosh, I don't play to win. I play for fun.

267
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,260
The interest is 50 percent, okay?

268
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,630
(Cup noodle combo, yukgaejang, pork cutlet combo)

269
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,710
I wandered around and cried without knowing why

270
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,280
Is there a particular game you'd like to play?

271
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,250
- Seotda. - The Seotda table is full.

272
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
All in.

273
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,420
Pair of nines!

274
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,819
Oh, dear. Would you look at that?

275
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,160
I just happen to have the best hand.

276
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,190
Oh, my goodness!

277
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Darn it!

278
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,800
- Look. A seat just opened up. - Yes. Right this way to the table.

279
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Here you are, sir.

280
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,140
Look who's back so soon. Did you get a loan from a loan shark?

281
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,440
I'm playing for real this time, so you better watch out.

282
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,580
And you weren't serious before?

283
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,810
Come on, deal the cards already.

284
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Let's start the main event. No reason to drag this out.

285
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,220
A pair of eights for you.

286
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,530
And for Driver Kim, a pair of nines.

287
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
This one's going straight to all in, you punk.

288
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
Three thousand dollars.

289
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,650
- Phone call for player nine. - Oh, that's me.

290
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,230
Hey.

291
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,460
No, I'm not gambling.

292
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,600
Got it.

293
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,040
Gosh, I didn't realize how late it is.

294
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,800
I'm folding this hand.

295
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,940
- Cashing out for the night? - Yes.

296
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,810
- Why not stay for one more? - Could you cash these out for me?

297
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,880
- Certainly. - Gosh.

298
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,990
Gosh, what a terrible hand. I'm out.

299
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,490
Man, today is just not my day.

300
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,430
And I even said a prayer and everything.

301
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,330
- I'll come back with a lucky charm. - I guess I will...

302
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,930
Gosh, how much did you win?

303
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,070
You'll be playing all night with that.

304
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,870
- I'm so jealous. - What are you talking about?

305
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,140
I'm coming back, so you'd better still be here playing.

306
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,810
Can you cash me out too?

307
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,690
Let's keep this party going! All night long.

308
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,340
Seriously? I wondered where he went, and this is it? His gym?

309
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,910
Maybe he's more serious about this business than I thought.

310
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,370
Or maybe he's just here for a nap?

311
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,080
He rushed over right after the call, quitting the game in the middle.

312
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,310
That means he had something important to take care of.

313
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,480
Something important?

314
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,900
Unfortunately, there are no cameras in the owner's office.

315
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,800
Then we won't know what kind of important, shady stuff he's up to.

316
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,140
What do you mean? I can just go and see for myself.

317
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,140
- You're going in, Go Eun? - Driver Kim can't.

318
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,540
I'll pop in for a quick look.

319
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,380
Hey, Driver Kim, Go Eun says she's going in.

320
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,510
Like Go Eun said, it's not like I can go in there myself.

321
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,020
- I've got a card game to play. - Hello.

322
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,120
- Good to see you. Let's work out. - Hi, there.

323
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,390
- Hello. - Hi.

324
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,520
Welcome to "Find the Owner." Let's go find the owner.

325
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,960
- The owner... - Ma'am, can I help you?

326
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,130
Did you just call me "ma'am?"

327
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,930
The name's Go-vely. I'm here to see the owner.

328
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,730
- The owner isn't here right now. - What? He went out again?

329
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,670
No, he's in his office. But he said he's not to be disturbed.

330
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,640
Okay. The "not to be disturbed" guy. I think I'll go meet him right now.

331
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,510
If you'd like to leave a message, I can give it to him later.

332
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,880
It's not the kind of message I can leave. I'll tell him myself.

333
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,680
Gosh, what's so important that you can't just leave a message?

334
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,750
Today, I will meet the owner and finally...

335
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,690
- Hey! Stop... - Excuse me.

336
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,820
- This is the owner's office. - For crying out loud...

337
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,160
- It's locked, you can't get in. - We'll see about that...

338
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,390
What? It was unlocked?

339
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,360
How strange. I could've sworn it was locked.

340
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,430
Hey, come on, quick!

341
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,470
Let's see what an owner's office looks like...

342
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,530
- I'll get in trouble. - when he's gone.

343
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,899
- You can't go in. - I'll take a quick look.

344
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,399
- Please don't. - Gosh, this office is...

345
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,670
- Seriously. - The owner...

346
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,670
- Look, he's not even in there. - Goodness.

347
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,840
- What? - What?

348
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,250
- I'm serious. No one was there. - You startled me!

349
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,220
What's going on? Why is it so loud out here?

350
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,050
A woman insisted she had to see you. She said it couldn't be a message.

351
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,290
Do I know you?

352
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,890
No.

353
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,690
He is the owner?

354
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,100
Yes.

355
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,670
That's right, I'm the owner here. So, what's this urgent business?

356
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,700
He isn't the owner I was looking for.

357
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,310
The owner I'm looking for is handsome with delicate features.

358
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,840
Who is this old guy? Oh, my goodness. No way.

359
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,380
I guess I'm in the wrong place.

360
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,510
Then where in the world could the owner I'm looking for be?

361
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,680
Ugh, I need to find that guy. But this isn't it.

362
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,690
Hey, did you guys get any of that?

363
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,160
Not really.

364
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,990
She didn't smell like she'd been drinking, though.

365
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,590
Seriously, where is the owner?

366
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,500
Driver Kim, did you see that?

367
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,570
He definitely wasn't in the owner's office.

368
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,869
I saw it too. He definitely wasn't there.

369
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,640
So what he chose over gambling...

370
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,440
must be something he can't risk anyone seeing.

371
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,620
Everything tastes so good when my son makes it.

372
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,430
You're the one who made all of this, Dad.

373
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,760
All I did was plate it.

374
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,730
I got another offer from a pro team today.

375
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,540
You did? I see.

376
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,140
If all goes well, I'll probably have a team lined up before I graduate.

377
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,210
Gosh.

378
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,140
All that hard work is finally paying off.

379
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,780
It's going to be smooth sailing from here on out, right?

380
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,080
Once I get my bonus after joining the team,

381
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,920
how about renovating this shop first?

382
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,460
No. Don't you worry about me.

383
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,990
You just focus on saving your money from now on.

384
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,730
I heard that for athletes,

385
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,460
it's really important to be good at saving.

386
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,230
This is so good. Goodness.

387
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,770
I'm going to head out.

388
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,710
Hey!

389
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,340
Wait, we're having such a nice time...

390
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,710
You haven't even touched your food.

391
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,420
Wait a minute, Min Ho! Where are you going?

392
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,020
You should at least eat something before you go.

393
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
Min Ho.

394
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,070
Dad, you have to come right now. Hurry.

395
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,610
Min Ho.

396
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,760
I should be able to see it,

397
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,930
but I can't.

398
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,980
You're awake?

399
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,640
You still need to do your walking rehab.

400
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,450
We need you to walk a little.

401
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,690
Min Ho...

402
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,970
Gosh.

403
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,410
I wonder if he's in the playroom.

404
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,450
There you are. Why didn't you come out?

405
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:08,180
Gosh, why are you always sleeping in my bed?

406
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,720
Dong Su!

407
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,890
No! Help! Can we get a doctor over here, please?

408
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,830
What is this?

409
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Dong Su!

410
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,440
Doctor!

411
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,080
Actually, this isn't the first time.

412
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,350
Last time, he also self-harmed right after waking up.

413
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,880
Even after he opens his eyes,

414
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,390
it's like he's still trapped in his dream.

415
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,730
(New Spring Nursing Home)

416
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,630
"My moments of lucidity are getting shorter."

417
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,330
"And they last under three minutes."

418
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,610
I'm leaving the things I must remember and never forget.

419
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,440
I'm leaving them here.

420
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,490
My son...

421
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,860
is on the Jingwang University volleyball team. He's number ten.

422
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,230
Park Min Ho.

423
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,130
Min Ho...

424
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,830
loved Girls' Generation,

425
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:08,540
and his favorite food was the veggie bibimbap I made for him.

426
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,080
- This is so good. - Min Ho loved taking pictures.

427
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,150
- Look. - That's a great shot.

428
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,210
It's a great shot.

429
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,780
Gosh. Dad.

430
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:25,490
Today, the whole sky looks like a volleyball court.

431
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,060
It's so beautiful.

432
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,460
- It really is beautiful. - We should come here more often.

433
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,630
Min Ho...

434
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,900
said he loved the orange of the sunset.

435
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,970
Dad, I got MVP! Pretty great, right? What?

436
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,310
Hey, louder!

437
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,210
The lights.

438
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,410
(Dad, you have to come right now. Hurry.)

439
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:52,420
Min Ho's text.

440
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,980
"Come right now. Hurry."

441
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,650
A big truck.

442
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,250
Onto the sidewalk.

443
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,640
I'm sorry I couldn't find you.

444
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,550
And I'm sorry I can't remember.

445
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
(All in Gym)

446
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,960
Looks like he was in there for exactly five hours.

447
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,730
But even if Im Dong Hyeon leaves, how do we get in?

448
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,140
It's open 24-7,

449
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,170
so it looks like there are always staff and customers in there.

450
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,150
I guess there's no other way.

451
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,350
We might as well just buy the gym.

452
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,520
What? You're going to buy the gym?

453
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,790
Darn it!

454
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,130
Darn that taxi!

455
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,360
Pair of threes.

456
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,380
All right, time to focus.

457
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,090
- Are you all right? - Driver Kim...

458
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,560
You're the guy who went all-in earlier.

459
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
You look tired.

460
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,330
I was, but I'm wide awake now.

461
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,130
Gosh, you brought a lot of cash.

462
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,340
Yes. Go big or go home.

463
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,240
I'm here for a real showdown.

464
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,150
A showdown. I like it.

465
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,559
It's the guy who won my money and ran away.

466
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,500
It's called skill.

467
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,030
- Shouldn't you be in school? - Ye, school.

468
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,080
Aren't you going to look at your cards?

469
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,490
I wondered why I always lost against you.

470
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,990
And then it hit me.

471
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,990
You've been reading my tells.

472
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,260
That's why I kept losing.

473
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,700
Like I said, it's a difference in skill.

474
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Betting 10,000.

475
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,700
You're betting without even looking at your hand?

476
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,470
- I'm out. - I'll fold too.

477
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,410
- A lousy three. I'm out. - Looks like everyone's folding.

478
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,020
Gosh, this method works really well.

479
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,820
Deal them. All right, hold on.

480
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,220
Let's see what I had.

481
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,360
What? Only one point! Darn it, and I folded with a five.

482
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,900
That's how it's done.

483
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,270
Hey, pal. I'll even go to school for him,

484
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,430
so just shuffle them up good for me.

485
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:06,970
Gosh.

486
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,280
All right. Dealing.

487
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,190
I bet 30,000.

488
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,460
For crying out loud.

489
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,230
- What? - I call 30,000.

490
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,430
You've got a weird way of playing. Darn it, I fold.

491
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,770
Okay, I have five points. So, what have you got?

492
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,040
Dum-dee-dum, dum-dee-dum.

493
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,580
- Six points! - Yes!

494
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,580
Yes! I won again!

495
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,350
Gosh, this is too good.

496
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:00,460
Hey, I'm going all-in this time,

497
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,590
so shuffle me up a real winner.

498
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,900
If I could control the cards, you think I'd still be sitting here?

499
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,740
Thank you very much. All right, I'm going big.

500
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,250
I'm not looking at my cards this time either.

501
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,520
Let's make it a big one. A hundred.

502
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,160
A hundred? You mean 100,000 dollars?

503
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,460
Gosh, that's too rich for my blood. I'm out.

504
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,830
And that's one down.

505
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,050
From the look on your face, you're about to fold.

506
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:02,080
You think you can scare me just by betting blind?

507
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,890
You look pretty scared to me.

508
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,860
I'll see your 100...

509
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
and raise you another 100.

510
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,490
I fold.

511
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,260
So that's how you want to play it?

512
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,930
Should I just call?

513
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:24,970
All in.

514
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,650
Call it if you've got the guts.

515
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:34,420
There's one thing all bad gamblers have in common.

516
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,390
They think they can scare people just by throwing money around.

517
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,360
Scare tactics?

518
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,060
Can I put what's in my pocket on the table?

519
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,630
Can I?

520
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,160
Here.

521
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,130
So you'll take collateral, will you?

522
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,540
Not just any collateral. Do you know how much is at stake?

523
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,970
The gym.

524
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,180
The gym. Call?

525
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:07,420
- It's okay to admit you're scared. - Scared?

526
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,190
Write up a contract, and you've got a call.

527
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,890
You thought that would make me fold, didn't you?

528
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,360
You'll live to regret this.

529
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,760
Hey! Get me some paper and a pen over here!

530
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,110

00:49:58,670 --> 00:49:59,670
For real?

708
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,250
They had a secret place like this. It was completely seamless.

709
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:11,710
No wonder we couldn't find it.

710
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:19,290
- Hi, Mr. Jang. - Hi.

711
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:23,260
I think I'm going to need your help with something.

712
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,060
Take a look at this.

713
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,630
Dong Su was looking for some kind of number,

714
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:34,640
- but I don't know what it could be. - It's a four-digit number.

715
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,200
Don't you think it's a passcode?

716
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,670
Let's see. Right here...

717
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,110
I think it's a phone number. The last four digits.

718
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,810
Could it be a date? Like a birthday?

719
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,350
Or it could be a license plate number.

720
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,220
(24MA 5283)

721
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:02,460
What are you doing? It's dangerous standing in the road!

722
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,430
But Min Ho told me to come out here right away.

723
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:06,970
The car...

724
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,670

725
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,940
(Min Ho's text, big car, bright light)

726
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:15,180
Thanks a lot, everyone. You've been a huge help.

727
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,250
If you ever get here before I do,

728
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,190
you see that wooden clock in there?

729
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:29,320
- The one that's always stopped? - Yes.

730
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,290
That's the passcode.

731
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,930
You mean, 10:45?

732
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,870
Yes. One, zero, four, five.

733
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:44,410
The important thing is,

734
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:49,240
this way, I won't forget and I can rest easy.

735
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:16,740
I should be able to see it,

736
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,410
but I can't.

737
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:24,880
Is that it?

738
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,820
- That's it. - Dong Su.

739
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,680
This watch.

740
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,850
It was Min Ho's.

741
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:39,290
If there's a time you want to remember forever,

742
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:42,860
please set this clock to it.

743
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,830
It's important.

744
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,640
Right?

746
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,080
I can see it.

One...

748
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,360
Dong Su.

749
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,560
Are you okay?

750
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,400
Dong Su.

751
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:24,470
You went through so much.

752
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:29,170
I'll take it from here.

753
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:32,910

755
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:59,130
Looks like he came out after exactly five hours again.

756
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,530
But there's a lock on it.

757
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,970
And that's the only part obscured on our CCTV.

758
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:37,970
Hold on.

759
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,390
Three, five, seven, nine.

00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,730

What's all this?

765
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,470
The one thing important enough to make him stop gambling...

766
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:21,980
was just more gambling.

00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:29,620
So Im Dong Hyeon was here five hours doing online sports betting?

770
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:32,350
No. To be exact,

771
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,160
Im Dong Hyeon wasn't betting on sports.

772
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,790

783
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:33,180
was this all along.
