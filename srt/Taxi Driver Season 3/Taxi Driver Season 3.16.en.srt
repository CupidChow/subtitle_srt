(Jang Hyuk Jin, Bae Yoo Ram, Kim Eui Sung, Pyo Ye Jin)

(Taxi Driver 3)

4
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,375
(This drama is a work of fiction.)

5
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,375
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

6
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:41,045
(in this drama are fictitious.)

7
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:42,115
(Children and animals were filmed under guidelines.)

8
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:44,185
One.

9
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:47,055
- Two. Three. - Two. Three.

10
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:48,485
- Four. - Four.

11
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:51,895
One, two, three, four.

12
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:54,365
- Move it! One. - One.

13
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:55,765
One.

14
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:59,095
One, two, three, four.

15
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:02,535
- Hey. - Comsec.

16
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:04,735
The training's pretty brutal, right?

17
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,275
Tell me about it.

18
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:10,875
Rookies are supposed to get stuck with the tough training, you know?

19
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:14,345
Speaking of which, I have a drill the day after tomorrow.

20
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:16,885
Seriously? It wasn't on the schedule.

21
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:20,155
Yes. It's a joint operation with the artillery unit.

22
00:01:20,225 --> 00:01:22,385
A combat tactical drill for a B24 point-of-origin strike.

23
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:25,895
A combat tactical drill? I guess we can't talk for a while.

24
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:27,065
Yes, looks like it.

25
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:30,495
When you get your training bonus, you owe me barbecue and drinks.

26
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:32,535
Nice try. You're buying.

27
00:01:33,435 --> 00:01:34,635
Talk to you when you get back.

28
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:38,335
Roger that. Good luck out there.

29
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:39,575
Okay.

30
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,215
According to an intelligence report,

31
00:01:45,715 --> 00:01:49,415
the risk of a localized provocation by North Korea's army is increasing.

32
00:01:50,085 --> 00:01:52,455
The objective of this drill...

33
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:55,555
is to ensure we are fully prepared for a surprise North Korean attack.

34
00:01:56,685 --> 00:01:59,995
Assume the North will attack with their most elite forces.

35
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:05,265
Effective immediately, per this drill's security protocol,

36
00:02:05,535 --> 00:02:06,935
all personnel will surrender their cell phones...

37
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:09,835
and conduct an inspection of all personal firearms and gear.

38
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,575
Master Sergeant Yoo, stay. The rest of you, dismissed!

39
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:14,605
On your feet!

40
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:18,344
Salute the Commander!

41
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:19,845
- Unity! - Unity!

42
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:22,445
Unity!

43
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:26,485
Dismissed!

44
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:29,855
- As you were! - As you were!

45
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:40,235
Here.

46
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:46,075
- What is this, sir? - Tomorrow, your team skips K43.

47
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:48,875
You'll move to Sector B24 instead.

48
00:02:50,175 --> 00:02:51,675
Sector B24, sir?

49
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:56,715
I've marked the coordinates. Report to me as soon as you arrive.

50
00:02:57,915 --> 00:02:58,915
Any questions?

51
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:04,095
No, sir.

52
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:06,055
Unity.

53
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:07,665
Dismissed.

54
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,245
Tomorrow, your team skips K43.

55
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:24,775
You'll move to Sector B24 instead.

56
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:27,215
A combat tactical drill for a B24 point-of-origin strike.

57
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:05,715
Unity!

58
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:08,224
- Sir, I'll drive! - Just get in. We're out of time.

59
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:09,225
Yes, sir.

60
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:11,285
You'll move to Sector B24 instead.

61
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:13,415
B24.

62
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:17,355
They're going here at this hour?

63
00:05:51,755 --> 00:05:54,195
(Sector B24)

64
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:11,045
It's all getting torched anyway. Did you have to bring so much?

65
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:13,415
I prepared everything as instructed by General Oh.

66
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:14,915
General Oh, I swear.

67
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:17,684
The MDL explosion?

68
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:19,655
- Good prep. - Thank you, sir.

69
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:23,955
- What was that? - Sir? What is it?

70
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,625
Didn't you hear that?

71
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:27,195
I didn't hear a thing, sir.

72
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:30,535
Never mind. Let's unload the vests first.

73
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:31,795
Yes, sir.

74
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:01,425
Five.

75
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,125
Six.

76
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,465
Seven.

77
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:07,905
You really can't tell the difference.

78
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:10,235
Be careful, sir! It could go off!

79
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:13,275
It even weighs about the same as the standard vest.

80
00:07:13,805 --> 00:07:15,975
But sir, isn't blowing up all eight of them a bit much?

81
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:18,945
You arrogant jerk. You must've lost your mind.

82
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:21,145
I'm sorry, sir. I'll drive!

83
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:26,015
Blow them up?

84
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:05,095
(C4 military-grade explosive)

85
00:08:18,235 --> 00:08:19,535
Unit, attention!

86
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:22,875
Salute the commander!

87
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:24,575
Unity!

88
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:27,715
Unity!

89
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:33,715
At ease!

90
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,985
About-face!

91
00:08:38,095 --> 00:08:39,255
Commence training!

92
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:40,565
- Commence! - Commence!

93
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:57,475
This live drill prepares us for North Korean provocations.

94
00:08:57,615 --> 00:09:00,244
You will all advance as far as the northern perimeter of the GOP.

95
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:01,945
Upon arrival at Sector B24,

96
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:06,055
equip vests from the barracks and move out immediately.

97
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:08,825
But sir, isn't blowing up all eight of them a bit much?

98
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,265
This is a critical mission, so give it your absolute all,

99
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:17,065
and get the best rating. Understood?

100
00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:18,365
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

101
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:27,875
Get in the passenger seat. I'm driving.

102
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:31,675
- Move it! - Yes, ma'am.

103
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:08,985
Get out.

104
00:10:09,515 --> 00:10:11,455
- I said, get out! - Yes, ma'am!'

105
00:10:13,985 --> 00:10:15,485
Everyone, dismount the truck.

106
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,625
Move it! Out!

107
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:19,225
- Yes, ma'am! - Yes, ma'am!

108
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:28,165
Effective immediately, you will all return to base.

109
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:31,435
- We must have misheard you, ma'am. - You heard me, didn't you?

110
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:32,975
Everyone, return to base!

111
00:10:33,475 --> 00:10:34,575
- Yes, ma'am! Understood! - Yes, ma'am! Understood!

112
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:27,995
This is Training Headquarters. Team Alpha, do you copy?

113
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:30,495
Team Alpha?

114
00:11:32,435 --> 00:11:34,605
Team Alpha, acknowledge transmission immediately!

115
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:39,675
I repeat. This is Training HQ. Team Alpha, do you copy?

116
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:44,075
- Team Alpha, answer me! - Let me.

117
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:45,815
This is the Commander.

118
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:48,085
Master Sergeant Yoo, what is your location?

119
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:52,855
I know what you were planning to do to us.

120
00:11:53,155 --> 00:11:54,155
What?

121
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,495
What did you possibly hope to gain by sending your men to their deaths?

122
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,895
Master Sergeant Yoo Sun A, what are you talking about...

123
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:02,125
What were you planning to do with those bomb vests?

124
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:05,335
She's lost her darn mind.

125
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:07,705
If you can't answer me, then I'm going...

126
00:12:08,165 --> 00:12:11,075
straight to the Military Prosecution with what you've planted here.

127
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:15,575
Hey, Yoo Sun A! You know this is insubordination!

128
00:12:47,105 --> 00:12:49,875
(Ministry of National Defense Initial report: Explosion near MDL)

129
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:10,765
Let's do this.

130
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:36,325
Master Sergeant Yoo Sun A!

131
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:38,995
Are you really disobeying a direct order?

132
00:13:39,655 --> 00:13:40,695
Are you?

133
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:45,265
You're no longer soldiers.

134
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:47,095
Get ready to be dishonorably discharged.

135
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:50,035
You're not getting out of here with that stuff anyway.

136
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:53,235
Yoo Sun A, think this through.

137
00:13:54,135 --> 00:13:56,575
I don't know what on earth has gotten into you,

138
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,915
but you're almost up for your pension.

139
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:00,815
If you get discharged for pulling a stunt like this,

140
00:14:01,485 --> 00:14:03,685
how is your mother supposed to get by?

141
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:07,484
Let's say we've acquired critical intelligence,

142
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:10,485
but on our way back to base, we run into an unavoidable problem.

143
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:12,625
What do we do with the intel?

144
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:14,625
Your safety comes before the intel.

145
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,765
If your safety isn't guaranteed,

146
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:18,835
you abandon the critical intelligence.

147
00:14:22,665 --> 00:14:24,035
If you stop right now,

148
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:26,535
I'll make this all go away.

149
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:31,215
Master Sergeant Yoo, let's just drop this. All right?

150
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:33,145
Cut the nonsense.

151
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:41,585
That road only leads to North Korea.

152
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:43,655
What are you going to do, defect to the North with it?

153
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:45,495
This is your last chance.

154
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:47,965
If you don't surrender right now,

155
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:51,635
Master Sergeant Yoo Sun A, you'll be seen as an armed deserter.

156
00:14:51,965 --> 00:14:56,705
(Military Demarcation Line)

157
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,875
Darn it!

158
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:33,975
But if, despite all that,

159
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,775
you find yourself in a life-or-death situation,

160
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:40,745
you pass on the intel using our team's protocol.

161
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:06,335
What is that protocol?

162
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:07,475
(Landmine)

163
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:12,145
Find the bird's nest in the closest tree due west...

164
00:16:12,675 --> 00:16:13,945
and secure the intel inside it.

165
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,945
If anything should happen to me,

166
00:16:49,115 --> 00:16:50,785
I'm trusting you to find this.

167
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:52,615
Captain Kim Do Gi.

168
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:31,055
That crazy wench.

169
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:18,635
That darn commie jerk just won't listen.

170
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:20,875
What should we report to the command?

171
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:24,275
Weren't you listening?

172
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:28,215
That commie jerk smuggled out weapons...

173
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:29,985
to try and sell them to the North,

174
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:31,985
and ended up getting killed in an accident.

175
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:35,155
Yes, sir. I'll write up the incident report just like that.

176
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:36,725
Darn it.

177
00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:39,655
The general will ream me out for this.

178
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:49,735
Master Sergeant Yoo Sun A gave up her life...

179
00:18:50,265 --> 00:18:51,575
to save her comrades.

180
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:53,975
Exactly.

181
00:18:57,645 --> 00:18:58,975
And that's what makes this even more infuriating.

182
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:02,585
And nobody even knows she was murdered so unjustly.

183
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:04,555
The jerks who did this to Master Sergeant Yoo Sun A...

184
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:07,115
are still out there, walking free.

185
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:10,655
But we know the truth.

186
00:19:13,725 --> 00:19:14,865
So we have to fight.

187
00:19:19,165 --> 00:19:20,495
It's going to be a tough fight.

188
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:24,575
And it won't be over quickly. You know that too, Captain.

189
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:33,915
But if you're doing this, Captain,

190
00:19:34,545 --> 00:19:35,785
I'll see it through with you.

191
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:40,355
The methods you're used to, Master Sergeant Park,

192
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:42,425
won't work on these people.

193
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:44,795
Sir?

194
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:49,095
For people who defy all common sense,

195
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:53,135
we have to be unreasonable right back.

196
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:55,905
It's the only way.

197
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:12,714
(Taxi Driver 3)

198
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:16,485
(Taxi Driver 3)

199
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:23,195
Are these the people you called?

200
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:25,565
Yes, they are.

201
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:27,665
They are ecological survey specialists.

202
00:20:28,505 --> 00:20:29,805
Then why did you lie about being a general?

203
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:32,574
What? I never said such a thing.

204
00:20:32,575 --> 00:20:33,935
Hey, you said he pulled rank.

205
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:37,205
When we asked who he was, he just said he was a general.

206
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,375
He said if we didn't open the gate, he'd just turn around and leave.

207
00:20:40,445 --> 00:20:42,884
I didn't say I was a general.

208
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:44,415
I said, "I'm Jang Seong Cheol."

209
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:47,254
My name is Jang Seong Cheol.

210
00:20:47,255 --> 00:20:49,525
Besides, if you won't open, what can I do? I should turn around.

211
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:51,495
I ran a check on you too. Nothing came up.

212
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:54,295
I'm not surprised you couldn't find me.

213
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:56,165
You see, I am...

214
00:20:56,865 --> 00:21:00,165
a ghost agent. I exist, but on paper, I don't.

215
00:21:01,265 --> 00:21:02,805
But you said he's your son.

216
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:05,735
This is technically classified.

217
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:09,445
I'm his team leader. He's like a son to me.

218
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:10,605
And he's like a father to me.

219
00:21:13,575 --> 00:21:14,575
Why that...

220
00:21:15,385 --> 00:21:16,385
Then what's this?

221
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:18,185
We didn't want to show up empty-handed.

222
00:21:19,415 --> 00:21:21,855
So, you're all here to research birds?

223
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,525
- Yes. - And your affiliation?

224
00:21:24,695 --> 00:21:25,695
That's classified.

225
00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:29,995
You took the motor pool logs, didn't you?

226
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:32,895
- Yes. - For your darn bird investigation?

227
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,165
- That's classified. - Hey!

228
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:40,675
Birds are pretty free-spirited, aren't they?

229
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,115
Are these guys messing with me?

230
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:56,755
- Hello? - Colonel Kim Tae Hyun.

231
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,155
This is Major General Jo Sang Hoon from Special Ops.

232
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:02,095
- Sir, Unity! - Right. Keep up the hard work.

233
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:05,195
Did the people I sent make it there okay?

234
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:10,465
The Black Eagle Team. You're the one who sent them, sir?

235
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:15,105
It's of national importance, so make sure you look after them.

236
00:22:15,745 --> 00:22:18,675
Help them with anything they need. All right, carry on.

237
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:37,995
I know what you were planning to do to us.

238
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:42,105
What did you possibly hope to gain by sending your men to their deaths?

239
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:44,465
Master Sergeant Yoo Sun A, what are you talking about...

240
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:46,635
What were you planning to do with those bomb vests?

241
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:51,005
If you can't answer me, then I'm going...

242
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:54,745
straight to the Military Prosecution with what you've planted here.

243
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:09,325
What kind of person could even think about killing their own soldiers?

244
00:23:09,995 --> 00:23:12,635
That Master Sergeant Yoo Sun A was really something else.

245
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:13,935
So courageous.

246
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,775
You should've told us this was happening.

247
00:23:21,475 --> 00:23:22,945
Why did you just leave without a word?

248
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:26,515
You even ditched your phone and were completely unreachable.

249
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:28,485
You knew we'd be worried sick.

250
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:30,085
I'm sorry.

251
00:23:30,415 --> 00:23:33,285
It was too personal. I couldn't ask you guys for help.

252
00:23:33,885 --> 00:23:36,325
That's even more reason to ask for our help.

253
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,025
Hang on a second.

254
00:23:38,395 --> 00:23:41,425
Driver Kim called us for a personal matter?

255
00:23:41,725 --> 00:23:42,825
He even sent us a page.

256
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:46,635
This is basically a job request from Driver Kim. Right?

257
00:23:47,335 --> 00:23:49,804
- It's totally a job request. - Exactly.

258
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:51,065
- A job request? - I even had to...

259
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:52,875
return to the military.

260
00:23:53,235 --> 00:23:55,005
How much is the taxi fare going to be for this?

261
00:23:55,345 --> 00:23:58,475
Captain, so you're saying these people came here in a taxi?

262
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:02,144
All right, it looks like everyone's caught up.

263
00:24:02,145 --> 00:24:04,245
I think we have some work to do here.

264
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:06,555
What's our first move?

265
00:24:10,255 --> 00:24:11,255
We need to find them.

266
00:24:11,925 --> 00:24:14,895
Who did this, and why.

267
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,164
We've found two so far.

268
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,565
The colonel and the first lieutenant.

269
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:21,365
You need higher command approval to form a temporary unit...

270
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:22,865
and plan a joint operation.

271
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:25,075
You're saying a general is involved.

272
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:27,975
Someone who would go as far as killing their own allies...

273
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,405
just for personal gain.

274
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:33,175
Do you have anyone in mind?

275
00:24:34,215 --> 00:24:35,715
One person comes to mind,

276
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:37,945
but he's in no position to be doing something like this right now.

277
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,485
- Either way, I'm in. - Me too.

278
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:44,025
Just don't make us worry like that again.

279
00:24:45,795 --> 00:24:47,255
I'm docking the taxi fare from your paycheck.

280
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:52,495
I'm sorry, Captain. I have no idea what this is about.

281
00:24:56,535 --> 00:25:00,905
I'm on board too. What a great plan.

282
00:25:08,815 --> 00:25:10,644
Radio Operator!

283
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:11,985
The power's out! Go check it!

284
00:25:12,455 --> 00:25:14,415
You can't just flip random breakers like that.

285
00:25:14,485 --> 00:25:17,084
Look, I know it's a hassle. That's why I brought this order.

286
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:18,325
Look there.

287
00:25:18,455 --> 00:25:20,395
See the wire? There's a bird's nest on the wire.

288
00:25:20,455 --> 00:25:22,625
If you leave that on, what happens to us?

289
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:24,024
That's not it. If we cut the power now,

290
00:25:24,025 --> 00:25:26,495
our security will be compromised! This is wrong, I'm telling you.

291
00:25:27,435 --> 00:25:29,105
Just a little more! A little more.

292
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:30,805
Just stall for time.

293
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:32,835
If you turn it on now, I'll die!

294
00:25:33,105 --> 00:25:35,675
- He'll die! - Hey, Radio Operator.

295
00:25:35,745 --> 00:25:37,845
It's still not working. Hurry and check it.

296
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:39,715
I'm just checking on the nest right now.

297
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:42,215
- Tell him he'll be dead instantly! - We might as well just die.

298
00:25:42,285 --> 00:25:44,114
We're out of time. Should we die?

299
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:45,915
Bury me at the National Cemetery!

300
00:25:46,015 --> 00:25:48,325
- I... - Do you want to end up in the brig?

301
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:51,055
- How much longer? - All right. Five seconds!

302
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,395
- Five seconds! - Five seconds. Not six, five.

303
00:25:53,455 --> 00:25:56,065
- Hey, Radio Operator. - Yes, I'm checking it right now.

304
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:57,824
- Aren't you done yet? - Three seconds.

305
00:25:57,825 --> 00:25:59,935
- Three seconds. - Three seconds.

306
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:03,505
- Okay. Transfer complete. - Okay. We're done here too.

307
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:06,205
We did it!

308
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,875
The PC is booting up. It's coming up.

309
00:26:11,245 --> 00:26:13,245
Hey, the comms are back up. You did great.

310
00:26:14,045 --> 00:26:15,585

311
00:26:16,885 --> 00:26:18,115
Man, that was tough.

312
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:23,325
You've got what it takes to be a true soldier.

313
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:28,725
- Let's go. - A true soldier! One, two, three.

314
00:26:29,565 --> 00:26:32,435
Captain, who did you call? What do they do?

315

317
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:42,105
and you must be the one to respond. Remember I said that?

318
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:43,875
Yes.

319
00:26:45,545 --> 00:26:47,114
Whatever you see, Master Sergeant Park,

320
00:26:47,115 --> 00:26:48,345
I need you to look the other way.

321
00:26:49,145 --> 00:26:50,185
And trust me.

322
00:26:51,785 --> 00:26:54,485
If that's an order, sir, I'll do it.

323
00:26:56,925 --> 00:26:59,225
Then again, I didn't understand what you were saying anyway.

00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:06,715
and more than a few things about them are suspicious.

356
00:30:07,315 --> 00:30:11,215
Above all, this guy, Kim Do Gi, was the late Yoo Sun A's commander.

357
00:30:11,915 --> 00:30:15,585
With something this big planned, we can't afford any suspicion.

Hello, is this the Human Rights Center?

361
00:30:25,435 --> 00:30:27,735
I have something to report. I'm heading over right now.

362
00:31:05,735 --> 00:31:06,735
Hello?

363
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:10,105
Is anybody here?

366
00:32:06,335 --> 00:32:07,335
I'm okay.

370
00:32:59,815 --> 00:33:01,915
I have selected the elite personnel you requested.

371
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,495
You're more proactive than I expected.

372
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:10,825
And your training evaluations are always top-notch.

373
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:14,035
- You've earned your reputation. - Thank you, sir.

374
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:19,275
But I haven't been briefed yet. What is the mission, sir?

375
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:22,505
I have a special mission in mind,

376
00:33:23,405 --> 00:33:25,105
and I'm thinking of entrusting it to you.

377
00:33:26,415 --> 00:33:28,075
Pull this off, and I'll make sure you get promoted.

Take a platoon under your command, send them in,

381
00:33:47,865 --> 00:33:49,265
and take his head this time.

382
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:52,535
I don't see an extraction route, sir.

383
00:33:53,675 --> 00:33:54,675
Extraction?

384
00:33:55,505 --> 00:33:58,105
According to this plan, they'll run out of fuel infiltrating.

385
00:33:59,045 --> 00:34:01,345
- Extraction will be impossible. - Right.

386
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:02,915
You don't have to go.

387
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:06,315
Send your best soldiers. Don't worry about the rest.

388
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:12,225
Without an extraction route, the entire team will be killed, sir.

389
00:34:13,395 --> 00:34:15,095

You know about pigs, right?

392
00:34:27,175 --> 00:34:29,345
You fatten them up just for a single slaughter.

393
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:33,045
Those men you're training... They're all pigs.

394
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:38,115
You use them for one thing only. Only once.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

396
00:34:46,455 --> 00:34:47,455
Is this...

397
00:34:49,865 --> 00:34:50,865
an order, sir?

398
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,535
I'm not in a position to ask favors, am I?

399
00:35:04,275 --> 00:35:05,775
Crystal clear, sir.

400
00:35:06,675 --> 00:35:07,815
I'll begin preparations at once, sir.

402
00:35:12,555 --> 00:35:14,015

Sir?

412
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:57,125
I must have misheard you, sir.

413
00:35:57,225 --> 00:36:00,495
You did well in the last evaluation, and I still owe you a reward.

414
00:36:00,735 --> 00:36:02,065
So this is it.

415
00:36:03,165 --> 00:36:06,635
From this moment on, until you receive another order,

416
00:36:07,135 --> 00:36:09,745
no one is to return to base. Under any circumstances.

00:36:11,445 --> 00:36:12,475

Unity.

422
00:36:50,845 --> 00:36:52,655
It was the man I suspected.

423
00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:55,655
After his dishonorable discharge for sexual harassment,

424
00:36:55,885 --> 00:36:57,925
our records show he's raising snakes and chickens in the country.

425
00:36:58,325 --> 00:36:59,325
He's a civilian now.

426
00:37:00,255 --> 00:37:02,625
A civilian is controlling the military?

427
00:37:03,065 --> 00:37:04,525
Seriously? How is that even possible?

428
00:37:05,365 --> 00:37:08,495
The impossible is happening as we speak.

429
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:12,165
He knew our every move.

430
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:16,475
The men who attacked Driver Kim and me were soldiers.

431
00:37:16,775 --> 00:37:19,815
That means he already has his hooks in the military.

432
00:37:20,945 --> 00:37:22,915
This is far more dangerous than we realized.

433
00:37:56,115 --> 00:37:58,385
My fellow citizens.

434
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:04,655
Today, in Sector B24 near the Military Demarcation Line,

435
00:38:05,795 --> 00:38:10,625
the North Korean Army launched a large-scale armed provocation.

Our brave soldiers of the Republic of Korea...

437
00:38:17,335 --> 00:38:21,805
have fallen in an attack by the enemy.

438
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:28,375
This massive, deadly attack by North Korea...

439
00:38:35,255 --> 00:38:40,025
is an assault on our freedom, democracy,

440
00:38:41,255 --> 00:38:43,395
and the foundation of our constitutional system.

441
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:47,395
It is a crime against humanity.

Our government, in accordance with the Constitution,

443
00:38:55,905 --> 00:38:58,005

445
00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:07,915
and under the authority of Article 77 of the Constitution...

446

It's all thanks to your support.

450
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:29,775
- Thank you so much. - Is that what matters right now?

451
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:32,715
Saving our country is what matters.

452
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:38,345
A dream you dream alone is nothing but a delusion.

453
00:39:39,655 --> 00:39:42,585
This is going to happen. It's inevitable.

454
00:39:43,085 --> 00:39:45,655
All we have to do is create the pretext.

455
00:39:51,065 --> 00:39:52,065
Here.

456
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:54,165
Here.

458
00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:01,235
Yes, sir.

459
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:03,245
Are the preparations proceeding without a hitch?

460
00:40:03,505 --> 00:40:06,215
Yes, sir. As instructed, we have twice the required personnel.

461
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,415
Listen.

462
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:12,085
You can't afford any mistakes this time.

463
00:40:12,855 --> 00:40:14,455
I will not fail you again.

464
00:40:16,285 --> 00:40:17,855
Those soldiers we're sending...

465
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:21,455
Their only purpose is to train hard and die a worthy death.

466
00:40:22,095 --> 00:40:23,165
Yes, sir. That's correct.

467
00:40:23,525 --> 00:40:28,335
Those boys will be fertilizer for the boundless growth of our nation.

468
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:33,205
Ensure they get a good burial plot. Somewhere with a good breeze.

469
00:40:34,705 --> 00:40:35,735
Yes, sir. Understood.

470
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,275
Hey. Get me a glass of water over here.

471
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:44,085
- Hey, Tae Hyun. Self-serve here. - Right.

472
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:46,185
- I'll get it. - Thank you.

473
00:40:48,415 --> 00:40:49,724
- Darn it. - Gosh.

474
00:40:49,725 --> 00:40:51,185
- Darn it. Hey. - Goodness.

475
00:40:51,685 --> 00:40:53,055
I'm so sorry.

476
00:40:53,195 --> 00:40:54,995
I'll get you another cup right away. Sorry.

477
00:40:55,895 --> 00:40:58,265
- It's fine. Don't worry about it. - I'll get you another one.

478

- Go on. - Take care, sir.

481
00:41:14,475 --> 00:41:18,115
You wouldn't take my offered hand, and now you send this surprise gift.

482
00:41:18,485 --> 00:41:22,655
You mean the Black Eagle Investigation Team?

483
00:41:24,155 --> 00:41:28,095
General Oh. We still have Black Eagles in our country.

484
00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:30,925
It is a wonderful surprise, isn't it?

485
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:36,705
Let me ask you something.

486
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:39,775
There are no Black Eagles in our country.

487
00:41:42,075 --> 00:41:44,905

Good thing they didn't notice we switched out the body cam.

491
00:42:02,095 --> 00:42:04,265
So, they're going to kill us, right?

492
00:42:04,425 --> 00:42:07,095
Yes. We're the Black Eagle Investigation Team, after all.

493
00:42:07,835 --> 00:42:10,665
They'll send soldiers to the MDL's northernmost point,

494
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:12,935
then shell their position and kill all of them.

495
00:42:13,475 --> 00:42:16,445
Then they'll frame the North Korean Army for it.

496
00:42:17,445 --> 00:42:21,275
As a pretext, they attack the North, forcing them to retaliate.

497
00:42:21,545 --> 00:42:24,515
And just like that, it's war.

498
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:27,285
I'm sorry, but that sounds completely insane.

499
00:42:27,355 --> 00:42:29,825
The idea that their goal is to start a war...

500
00:42:30,225 --> 00:42:32,255

Awaiting your command, sir.

548

This is Team Beta.

557

All personnel have op vests on. Awaiting orders, do you copy?

558
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:25,245
Fire on all of them, pigs and vests. I want them obliterated.

559
00:47:31,755 --> 00:47:32,855
What is this?

560
00:47:37,765 --> 00:47:40,665
Hey, what's that? This is crazy.

561
00:47:41,795 --> 00:47:43,435
What is this operation?

562
00:47:46,605 --> 00:47:47,605
What is this?

563
00:47:50,905 --> 00:47:53,015
This is Team Beta. Do you copy?

564
00:47:53,175 --> 00:47:55,044
This is Team Beta. Respond.

565
00:47:55,045 --> 00:47:56,945
- Just cut the comms. - Yes, sir.

566
00:47:58,385 --> 00:48:00,485
One minute to fire.

567
00:48:03,585 --> 00:48:04,925
It's a great strength to have you,

568
00:48:05,955 --> 00:48:07,995
my comrades, at my side for the new world.

569
00:48:09,795 --> 00:48:10,865
We have 30 seconds.

Colonel Kim.

571
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:39,795
What?

572
00:48:43,665 --> 00:48:46,025
- Did you hear that? - I didn't hear anything.

573
00:48:47,335 --> 00:48:48,765
I don't think I heard any artillery fire.

574
00:48:49,095 --> 00:48:50,505
Hey, what happened?

575
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:54,475
(Warning)

576
00:49:02,015 --> 00:49:04,045
Are you certain you relayed the correct firing time?

577
00:49:05,545 --> 00:49:08,185
Why don't I hear any darn artillery fire?

578
00:49:08,855 --> 00:49:10,225
Because we didn't fire, sir.

579
00:49:10,985 --> 00:49:14,495
What did you just say? Say that again, you jerk!

580
00:49:14,555 --> 00:49:16,995
I'm sorry, sir, but we cannot follow that order.

581
00:49:17,565 --> 00:49:19,325
You scum, do you have a death wish?

582
00:49:19,735 --> 00:49:22,235
We cannot fire on civilians, sir.

584
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:34,315
Civilians?

585

All artillery units are pulling out.

586
00:49:46,425 --> 00:49:49,094
Captain, a civilian vehicle is approaching.

587
00:49:49,095 --> 00:49:50,165
What are you talking about?

588
00:49:50,795 --> 00:49:53,595
- What's going on? - Captain.

589
00:49:53,835 --> 00:49:56,095
- Stay sharp. On alert. - Hey, stay sharp! On alert!

590
00:49:56,165 --> 00:49:59,535
- Yes, sir! On alert! - Hey, get them!

591
00:49:59,565 --> 00:50:00,575
On alert!

592
00:50:03,805 --> 00:50:05,845
- There's a box truck coming down. - What on earth?

593
00:50:05,905 --> 00:50:07,445
- Hey! Muzzles up! - It's coming down!

594
00:50:07,775 --> 00:50:09,475
- I think it's a bus! - It looks full of civilians.

595
00:50:09,545 --> 00:50:11,245
Stay calm and don't cross your lines of fire!

596
00:50:15,585 --> 00:50:17,124
Sergeant, it looks like a civilian vehicle.

597
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:18,225
There are civilians inside.

598
00:50:25,895 --> 00:50:27,694
- Stop! - Stop! Sergeant!

599
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:29,364
- Stop! - What's the situation?

600
00:50:29,365 --> 00:50:31,165
- A bus has come in. - Hold your position.

601
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:36,705
We'll hold our position and wait for orders.

602
00:50:39,845 --> 00:50:42,915
Hey! Give me remote access now. I'll do it myself.

603
00:50:43,245 --> 00:50:46,215
They're saying there are civilians in Sector B24.

604
00:50:46,785 --> 00:50:49,925
Hey, who cares if they're civilians or soldiers?

605
00:50:49,985 --> 00:50:52,185
We'll just say the North Korean Army killed them all anyway.

606
00:50:53,025 --> 00:50:54,095
Darn it.

607
00:50:54,455 --> 00:50:55,695
What are you doing?

608
00:50:55,895 --> 00:50:57,395
Give me remote access!

609
00:51:02,835 --> 00:51:03,965
What are you doing?

610
00:51:05,035 --> 00:51:06,065
Inside that sector,

611
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:08,735
there are civilians.

612
00:51:10,645 --> 00:51:14,515
Hey, you got a death wish? Patch me through now!

613
00:51:14,915 --> 00:51:16,945
Give me remote access now!

614
00:51:20,615 --> 00:51:22,415
- Connect him. - Connecting now, sir.

615
00:51:26,595 --> 00:51:27,625
Connection established.

616
00:51:27,895 --> 00:51:29,354
- What was that? - There's a one-star here.

617
00:51:29,355 --> 00:51:30,425
This is insane.

618
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:32,265
- We're all going to die, aren't we? - Something's definitely wrong.

619
00:51:33,795 --> 00:51:34,795
Goodness.

620
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,255
Now,

621
00:51:55,255 --> 00:51:56,725
the great undertaking begins.

622
00:52:35,095 --> 00:52:36,995
- Let's go! - Hurry up!

623
00:52:40,435 --> 00:52:42,765
- Looks like it's starting. - Right. I'd better get my shots.

624
00:52:43,065 --> 00:52:44,865
- Okay, camera on. Get in there. - Right.

625
00:52:44,935 --> 00:52:45,935
Go.

Here you go, Elements light sticks.

Attack!

635

I said open fire, darn it!

636
00:53:36,985 --> 00:53:40,525
What are you waiting for, you jerks? I said, open fire!

637
00:53:40,695 --> 00:53:42,055

That Black Eagle ecological survey must have been quite the ordeal.

Do you really need that many fireworks?

I told you we should've bailed before this got messy.

But won't accepting that note cause problems for us later?

684
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:17,235
Just say you never got it.

685
00:58:17,505 --> 00:58:19,805
The CCTV at the burger joint could have caught us.

686
00:58:19,865 --> 00:58:21,535
Then say it was folded so you didn't see what it was.

687

01:00:49,315 --> 01:00:50,525
- Yes, I'm fine. - This way.

710
01:00:50,755 --> 01:00:52,585
- Chief Choi... - Yes?

711
01:01:05,265 --> 01:01:07,435
You jerks!

712
01:01:08,705 --> 01:01:12,045
Hey! Why?

713
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:15,545
Hey!

714
01:01:16,315 --> 01:01:17,945
You worthless scums.

715
01:01:21,115 --> 01:01:24,354
- Die! - Go Eun!

716
01:01:24,355 --> 01:01:25,355
- Go Eun! - Go Eun!

717
01:01:25,356 --> 01:01:26,454
- Go Eun! - Go Eun!

718
01:01:26,455 --> 01:01:27,925
- You... - Go Eun!

719
01:01:28,225 --> 01:01:29,825
Do you have any idea what you've ruined?

720
01:01:32,595 --> 01:01:34,365
This was an operation...

721
01:01:36,065 --> 01:01:39,005
to save the country from a crisis! Darn it.

722
01:01:40,035 --> 01:01:41,905
A man who claims he'll save the country...

723
01:01:42,135 --> 01:01:44,475
treats the people who live in it worse than insects...

724
01:01:44,775 --> 01:01:46,675
in reality.

725
01:01:46,975 --> 01:01:49,745
- Isn't that the bigger problem? - Hey, you think that matters?

726
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,045
What's the big deal about that?

727
01:01:53,885 --> 01:01:54,985
You people...

728
01:01:55,755 --> 01:01:57,155
are destined to lose.

729
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:01,495
- Driver Kim! - Driver Kim!

730
01:02:01,555 --> 01:02:02,625
- Driver Kim! - Driver Kim!

731
01:02:02,895 --> 01:02:03,995
- Driver Kim! - Do Gi!

732
01:02:04,795 --> 01:02:05,925
Damn it.

733
01:02:06,825 --> 01:02:08,265
We won't know how this ends...

734
01:02:09,435 --> 01:02:11,065
until we get to the end.

735
01:02:12,035 --> 01:02:15,135
When the desperation and courage of everyone come together,

736
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:18,075
it's a force to be reckoned with.

737
01:02:23,645 --> 01:02:24,645
Gosh.

738
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:33,155
Take one more step...

739
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,795
and see just how this ends.

740
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:37,695
Do you want to see?

741
01:02:40,165 --> 01:02:41,465
- Do Gi! - Driver Kim!

742
01:02:41,535 --> 01:02:42,965
Driver Kim!

743
01:02:54,215 --> 01:02:55,245
Give up!

744
01:03:01,315 --> 01:03:02,385
You should have...

745
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:06,485
just kept your head down where you belong.

746
01:03:07,295 --> 01:03:08,295
Why?

747
01:03:08,795 --> 01:03:13,625
Why on earth did you all crawl in here to die?

748
01:03:13,835 --> 01:03:14,835
Why?

749
01:03:17,165 --> 01:03:18,165
- Driver Kim! - Do Gi!

750
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:20,905
- Make one move. - Driver Kim!

751
01:03:20,975 --> 01:03:23,335
- I'll kill him! - Driver Kim!

752
01:03:23,405 --> 01:03:24,405
Don't!

753
01:03:25,905 --> 01:03:27,275
We will never...

754
01:03:32,485 --> 01:03:34,055
lose to people like you.

755
01:03:48,835 --> 01:03:51,835
- Driver Kim! - Driver Kim!

756
01:03:51,905 --> 01:03:53,605
- Do Gi! - No!

757
01:04:23,965 --> 01:04:27,375
(To save one life is to save the world.)

758
01:04:27,435 --> 01:04:30,505
You have a big appetite, Chief Choi. Why aren't you eating?

759
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:34,075
- I'm full. - Already? And you, Chief Park?

760
01:04:34,315 --> 01:04:36,145
Who taught you to grab the drumstick first?

761
01:04:36,215 --> 01:04:38,385
- I raised this chicken myself. - Thank you.

762
01:04:38,845 --> 01:04:40,345
This guy's something else.

763
01:04:41,785 --> 01:04:43,555
- Let's have a drink. - Okay.

764
01:04:44,185 --> 01:04:46,085
- Cheers. - Cheers.

765
01:04:54,365 --> 01:04:55,665
By the way,

766
01:04:56,595 --> 01:04:58,035
has this thought ever crossed your mind?

767
01:04:58,365 --> 01:05:00,005
- What? - What thought?

768
01:05:01,475 --> 01:05:04,775
If everything that happened to us never happened,

769
01:05:05,275 --> 01:05:06,745
what do you think our lives would be like?

770
01:05:07,975 --> 01:05:09,345
Do you think we ever would have met?

771
01:05:14,215 --> 01:05:15,885
I doubt we would have met.

772
01:05:16,685 --> 01:05:18,725
We'd all probably be working hard at our separate jobs.

773
01:05:18,785 --> 01:05:21,095
That's true. We're all dedicated to our work.

774
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:22,925
You never know.

775
01:05:23,925 --> 01:05:27,635
When, where, or how we might have crossed paths.

776
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:30,365
That's right.

777
01:05:31,235 --> 01:05:35,135
We could've gone on a trip one day and happened to run into each other.

778
01:05:37,905 --> 01:05:39,545
- Okay, I'm taking it now. - Okay.

779
01:05:39,575 --> 01:05:40,745
Dad, scoot in a little closer.

780
01:05:41,075 --> 01:05:43,775
Okay, big smiles now. One, two, three.

781
01:05:44,445 --> 01:05:45,915
One, two, three.

782
01:05:46,785 --> 01:05:47,915
Okay.

783
01:05:48,285 --> 01:05:50,755
It came out great. Should we get a picture of the three of us?

784
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,225
Oh, dear.

785
01:05:52,725 --> 01:05:54,355
Excuse me.

786
01:05:54,895 --> 01:05:57,025
Excuse me, would you like me to take a picture for you?

787
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:01,165
Thank you so much. That would be great.

788
01:06:06,105 --> 01:06:07,474
- Smile. - Okay.

789
01:06:07,475 --> 01:06:09,035
One, two, three.

790
01:06:11,005 --> 01:06:12,275
I'm so sorry.

791
01:06:12,345 --> 01:06:16,045
Or what if we went to a restaurant from TV and ran into one another?

792
01:06:16,115 --> 01:06:17,745
You're not late. We were just getting started.

793
01:06:17,815 --> 01:06:19,985
- You guys started eating? - This place is seriously good.

794
01:06:20,045 --> 01:06:21,085
I can't wait to see your wedding dress.

795
01:06:21,155 --> 01:06:22,155
- I come here sometimes. - Oh, really?

796
01:06:22,215 --> 01:06:23,455
- You know that one? - It's good, right?

797
01:06:23,515 --> 01:06:24,525
- Yes, it's really good. - Right?

798
01:06:24,925 --> 01:06:26,825
- Have some meat. - No, you go ahead.

799
01:06:26,885 --> 01:06:28,155
- Oh, gosh. - What is it?

800
01:06:28,225 --> 01:06:30,225
This place is amazing. I've been here before.

801
01:06:32,765 --> 01:06:36,265
Or we could've just bumped into each other walking down the street.

802
01:06:43,905 --> 01:06:44,945
Are you okay?

803
01:06:45,445 --> 01:06:47,915
Yes. Thank you.

804
01:06:48,215 --> 01:06:49,575
- No problem. - All right.

805
01:06:50,745 --> 01:06:51,745
Thank you.

806
01:06:53,115 --> 01:06:54,685
- Right. - Right.

807
01:07:15,635 --> 01:07:16,935
When you think about it,

808
01:07:17,205 --> 01:07:18,645
I guess we would've met again, no matter what.

809
01:07:20,275 --> 01:07:22,875
Somehow, I feel like we were bound to meet.

810
01:07:22,915 --> 01:07:25,245
I guess it was meant to be.

811
01:07:26,185 --> 01:07:27,955
- Here, have a drink. - Thanks.

812
01:07:33,585 --> 01:07:34,655
Me too.

813
01:07:49,205 --> 01:07:51,474
- All right, how about a toast? - Yes!

814
01:07:51,475 --> 01:07:52,675
Cheers.

815
01:08:08,995 --> 01:08:10,055
Go Eun.

816
01:08:10,895 --> 01:08:11,865
Yes?

817
01:08:12,495 --> 01:08:13,725
Could you take care of the bill?

818
01:08:14,865 --> 01:08:15,935
Sure.

819
01:08:21,975 --> 01:08:24,845
You look exhausted. Trouble sleeping again last night?

820
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:28,045
No. I think I'm coming down with a cold.

821
01:08:28,075 --> 01:08:30,145
When that happens, it's better to just get some proper rest.

822
01:08:31,415 --> 01:08:32,745
I'm fine.

823
01:08:33,245 --> 01:08:34,655
I actually feel better when I'm working.

824
01:08:36,685 --> 01:08:38,125
You sure don't look like it.

826

You get a steady paycheck, so you better earn it.

827
01:09:25,735 --> 01:09:28,005
Is killing one little wench that hard?

828
01:09:28,905 --> 01:09:32,805
Finding an agency that kills people is harder than you'd think.

829
01:09:33,845 --> 01:09:37,175
Turn on the TV. Hitmen are a dime a dozen.

830
01:09:42,255 --> 01:09:43,285
You're just...

831
01:09:43,985 --> 01:09:48,225
making excuses for your own incompetence.

832
01:09:49,755 --> 01:09:53,725
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll try looking a little harder.

833
01:09:56,465 --> 01:09:59,805
About your missing sister, Rim Bok Ja...

834
01:10:00,035 --> 01:10:02,635
Someone says she was seen overseas. I think we'll find her soon.

835
01:10:02,705 --> 01:10:03,705
Hey!

836
01:10:05,005 --> 01:10:08,875
What's this "sister" nonsense? I've never even laid eyes on her.

837
01:10:10,445 --> 01:10:14,555
Instead of her appearing suddenly demanding half the inheritance,

838
01:10:15,915 --> 01:10:20,725
getting rid of her quietly overseas is a lot cleaner, isn't it?

839
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:30,065
I believe I've found a contractor.

840
01:10:31,635 --> 01:10:33,335
The meeting spot...

841
01:10:34,235 --> 01:10:35,805
Didn't you say it was by the port?

842
01:10:36,435 --> 01:10:39,605
So why are we driving further up into the mountains?

843
01:10:42,145 --> 01:10:45,515
I think there might be an error with the GPS.

844
01:10:45,585 --> 01:10:47,615
- Rerouting. - That's strange.

845
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:51,685
We're probably losing service because you drove us out to nowhere!

846
01:11:06,165 --> 01:11:09,835
There's a taxi right here. I'll go see if it's in service.

848
01:11:19,145 --> 01:11:20,615

850
01:11:33,695 --> 01:11:34,765

851
01:11:36,195 --> 01:11:37,665
Excuse me.

852
01:11:41,835 --> 01:11:43,075
Pardon me.

853
01:11:45,805 --> 01:11:48,345
I'm a little lost.

854
01:11:49,215 --> 01:11:51,915

856
01:12:12,835 --> 01:12:15,605
I just saw the taxi here, so...

857
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:23,575
- Need a ride? - No.

858
01:12:24,385 --> 01:12:26,515
I don't want a ride.

859
01:12:29,015 --> 01:12:30,755
You saw something you shouldn't have.

860
01:12:33,155 --> 01:12:34,595
Something you shouldn't have seen.

861
01:12:35,455 --> 01:12:36,755
Gosh.

862
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:42,165
What? Isn't this a pottery kiln?

863
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:45,805
Wait a minute.

864
01:12:46,805 --> 01:12:47,805
I know...

865
01:12:48,175 --> 01:12:49,975
this is going to sound incredibly strange,

866
01:12:50,405 --> 01:12:52,505
but I've actually been desperately...

867
01:12:53,775 --> 01:12:55,275
looking for someone just like you.

868
01:12:56,815 --> 01:12:58,015
What's taking her so long?

869
01:12:58,885 --> 01:12:59,915
Hey!

870
01:13:20,765 --> 01:13:21,805
Haven't we...

871
01:13:22,405 --> 01:13:23,435
met somewhere...

872
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:25,845
before?

873
01:13:47,325 --> 01:13:48,665
If you have time,

874
01:13:49,135 --> 01:13:52,765
would you like to have a glass of wine with me?

875
01:13:54,505 --> 01:13:55,935
I have a feeling...

876
01:13:56,805 --> 01:13:58,875
you and I would really hit it off.

877
01:14:00,075 --> 01:14:01,145
Don't you think?

878
01:14:02,245 --> 01:14:03,745
I think we already have.

879
01:14:07,515 --> 01:14:08,515
It's hot.

880
01:14:28,435 --> 01:14:30,375
Okay, the feed's clear.

881
01:14:32,045 --> 01:14:34,075
