1
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,860
(Lee Je Hoon)

2
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,890
(Jang Hyuk Jin, Bae Yoo Ram, Kim Eui Sung, Pyo Ye Jin)

3
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,940
(Taxi Driver 3)

4
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,039
(This drama is a work of fiction.)

5
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,040
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

6
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,850
(in this drama are fictitious.)

7
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,910
(Children and animals were filmed under guidelines.)

8
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,230
All right. One million dollars in capital.

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,970
You managed to squirrel that away.

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,340
I swore I'd make a comeback with this no matter what,

11
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,680
- and that's what got me through. - What business were you planning?

12
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,110
Let's go with a site.

13
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,650
(Site: Illegal Gambling Sites)

14
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,320
That's not enough money.

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,050
What are you talking about? I did tech for two years.

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,220
(Tech: A scam using stocks or crypto bait)

17
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,920
And I did ping for almost two years.

18
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,990
It's time I moved up to a site. Right?

19
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,690
Gosh, he's going to be so disappointed.

20
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,890
Why don't you lay it out for him?

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,370
For ping, you just set up computers in an office and that's it,

22
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,940
but a site is like building a broadcast station.

23
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,880
You need at least three locations for the casino and call center.

24
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,010
That alone will cost you 150,000 dollars a month.

25
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,080
What, 150,000 dollars a month?

26
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,490
- Seriously? Why is it so expensive? - And that's the rock-bottom price.

27
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,190
The closer you are to the city, the more expensive it'll be.

28
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,430
And that's not including protection and broker fees for the cops.

29
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,329
Then there are the accounts.

30
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,430
A site gets 200 to 300 cases a day,

31
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,930
so you need burner accounts from "Jang,"

32
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,369
- a mule account opening company. - Doesn't this sound like...

33
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,740
some kind of business seminar?

34
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,440
By setting up a corporation under a Payment Gateway...

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,570
She sounds so professional, I find myself starting to trust her.

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,909
- I know, right? Gosh. - Goodness.

37
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,480
What's the point? It's all illegal.

38
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,380
- Right. - Right.

39
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,080
What's this? It says it costs 25,000 dollars a month?

40
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,120
And that doesn't include marketing and franchising fees.

41
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,090
Darn it, why is so much stuff not included?

42
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,400
Even if we set it up for you for next to nothing,

43
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,830
you couldn't run it for two months with what you have now.

44
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,970
But if you insist on going for a site,

45
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,410
you could run a rinky-dink site, maybe?

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,410
- All right, now. - Goodness.

47
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,380
She's the best in Asia when it comes to making these sites.

48
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,090
Right? Even if it's a bit of a hassle,

49
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,060
let's stick with ping a bit longer for two years, save up,

50
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,390
and then we can move on to a site.

51
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,830
I think that's the better move.

52
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,900
If you're the one saying it, Writer Go,

53
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,300
I guess that's the right move.

54
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
And here.

55
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,310
What's this?

56
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,310
A little something to celebrate you getting out.

57
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,510
(Payment Gateway: Setup and maintenance fees)

58
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,280
This is a premium database.

59
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,320
The success rate...

60
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,050
should be over 80 percent.

61
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,590
Gosh, you really shouldn't have.

62
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,990
You're the only one...

63
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,160
who always looks out for me, Writer Go.

64
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,600
Okay, fine! We'll go with ping!

65
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,470
You've always got to listen to the experts.

66
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,170
- It always pays off in the end. - Don't you worry.

67
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,240
Hey, you two, come on up and get your consultation.

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,480
So, it's our turn now?

69
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,750
All right, young fellas.

70
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,250
Why don't you show me how much money you've brought?

71
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,460
We'll pay you afterward.

72
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,890
You little jerks!

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,560
Hey, I thought you said you had the money!

74
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,630
This is...

75
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,700
What is this? Hey! If you pull a stunt like this on me,

76
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,570
you make me look like an idiot for vouching for you!

77
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,740
Hey, we're not trying to stiff you. We'll pay you with our earnings.

78
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,980
That makes more sense, doesn't it?

79
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,510
These guys...

80
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,550
Why are you covering that up? You have to set us up too.

81
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,220
I thought you said you don't have any money.

82
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,360
We're not running a charity here.

83
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,330
You want me to put you in the ground?

84
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,790
You've got a way with words.

85
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,730
How about we go outside and expose what you're doing here?

86
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,369
We could make easy-to-digest Shorts and flood the algorithm.

87
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,540
Do you want that?

88
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,070
Do you?

89
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,640
You mentioned virtual accounts and whatnot.

90
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,880
I know how it works. I've done it. Those corporate accounts,

91
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,610
you just find a defunct company that isn't officially dissolved.

92
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,420
If you set up affiliate accounts, you can churn them out.

93
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,419
Or post on Jang's telegram,

94
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,650
and you'd get takers in a day or two.

95
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,890
Plenty of kids will DM you their IDs for a fake loan consult.

96
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,830
All right. I've heard enough from you geniuses.

97
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,030
We're going to discuss it among ourselves,

98
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,960
so why don't you two step outside...

99
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,530
and have yourselves a nice smoke.

100
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,500
Now that's more like it.

101
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,070
Let's just keep things friendly.

102
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,579
We're not amateurs, you know?

103
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,080
Just set us up with whatever makes the most money.

104
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,250
Those darn little thugs.

105
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,390
It's like they grew up on Shorts.

106
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,220
Writer Go, I'm so sorry.

107
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,390
I'll go talk some sense into them. All right?

108
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,430
Hey!

109
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,200
See? I told you. Those jerks are cowards.

110
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,670
Totally. You see that?

111
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,740
What is this?

112
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,540
Gosh, check out the death stare on this farmer.

113
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,250
Who's this?

114
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,050
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,130
Writer Go! My gosh, Writer Go!

116
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,630
Writer Go!

117
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,500
Writer Go! What happened?

118
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,770
Writer Go!

119
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,940
Writer Go!

120
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,390
Writer Go. I just made the introduction.

121
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,860
- Please, Writer Go, I... - What are you talking about?

122
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,930
What?

123
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,640
You're one of our best clients, Mr. Lee.

124
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,310
- Aren't you? - Right.

125
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,810
Why don't you go and relax?

126
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,010
As soon as we're set up again,

127
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,010
I'll come and get you myself.

128
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,750
Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much.

129
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,970
Clean this up.

130
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,169
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

131
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,240
(7 years ago)

132
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,380
Four hundred years!

133
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,950
For 400 years, in the land of Egypt,

134
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,350
the people of Israel lived in bondage.

135
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,820
But just as God led them to a land of milk and honey,

136
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,090
- the land of Canaan! - Amen!

137
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,760
- Amen! - So too has He, our Shepherd,

138
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,630
spoken to us.

139
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,330
God speaks.

140
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,870
Lord.

141
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,840
"Leave this shabby, worn-out building..."

142
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,780
"for a comfortable and magnificent new sanctuary!"

143
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,080
"Lead my lambs to it!"

144
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,520
- For so He has commanded! - Hallelujah!

145
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,220
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

146
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,660
Hallelujah!

147
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,660
(Welcome in the Lord's love)

148
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,900
But...

149
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,270
are you sure we can do it for that cheap?

150
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,210
Are you sure you won't lose money, Pastor?

151
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,550
In Pennsylvania, where they drafted the Declaration of Independence,

152
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,550
my brother in faith, Cheol Min, and I did a very similar project.

153
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,050
To build a sanctuary for less than half the going rate,

154
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,520
that's a loss financially.

155
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,190
But when I think of the joy it will bring you elders...

156
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,060
and all the members of this spirit-filled congregation,

157
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,300
that's a profit you can't measure in dollars.

158
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,870
That's a true blessing.

159
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,170
Amen.

160
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Indeed.

161
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,210
Thank you.

162
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,450
We're grateful for meeting a pastor who's also a brilliant architect...

163
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,850
After I get back from the US, I'll come and see you all again.

164
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,990
(First Heaven Church)

165
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:46,620
- Stop! - Wait a minute, hold on!

166
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,060
- We're prosecutors. - Prosecutors? Why?

167
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,130
We have a warrant for your arrest.

168
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,630
Arrest? What arrest? Darn it! Hey! Let go of me!

169
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,030
- Hey! What division are you from? - Move out of the way!

170
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,200
Let go of me.

171
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,570
Let me go! Hey, let go!

172
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,740
Get your hands off me! Let go!

173
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,110
Pleasure to meet you. You're Ju Seok Bong?

174
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,640
You've got quite the personality.

175
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,380
Oh, gosh.

176
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,580
It's all over now, okay?

177
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,850
Have a seat.

178
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,250
Excuse me, Prosecutor.

179
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,590
Here.

180
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,150
(First Heaven Church)

181
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,860
Oh, dear.

182
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,530
What are you going to do now?

183
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,570
I bet you already paid to be smuggled out of the country.

184
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,170
That's life,

185
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,740
Prosecutor.

186
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,680
Article 347 of the Criminal Code, fraud.

187
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,990
With your priors, Article 351, aggravated penalty for repeaters.

188
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,160
You worked as a team, so Article 30, joint principal offenders.

189
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,760
The damages per victim exceed 500,000 dollars,

190
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,860
we'll also tack on Article three of the Specific Economic Crimes Act.

191
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,140
At a minimum, you're looking at seven years.

192
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,570
That mole...

193
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,940
You've got to be kidding me. What is this? How pathetic.

194
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,280
Tell you what. For a man like you, Ju Seok Bong,

195
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,320
there are two options.

196
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,690
Options?

197
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:27,430
Option 1. You go to prison and pay for your sins for 10 years.

198
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,660
Option two.

199
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,060
You take on a much more comfortable line of work...

200
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,860
and enjoy a life of complete freedom.

201
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,640
If I could actually choose the second one...

202
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,470
And legally, at that.

203
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,510
What's the catch?

204
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,450
You just have to join my company as a founding member.

205
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
So,

206
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,360
will you join us?

207
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,530
Hold on a second, Prosecutor.

208
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,970
I know this great guy. Cheol Min!

209
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,170
Get over here and say hello.

210
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Hello, sir.

211
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,010
Works for me.

212
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,950
(Interrogation room)

213
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,060
You guys haven't eaten yet, have you?

214
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
Here.

215
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,100
Go and eat comfortably.

216
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir.

217
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,340
Hello.

218
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,280
I know the investigation must have been rough,

219
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,220
so I'll get straight to the point.

220
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,820
The Apgujeong hustler.

221
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,790
I'll give you credit, you've got real talent.

222
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,060
With that talent,

223
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,730
you handled the hacking and website, the whole works.

224
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,530
If this goes to trial, you're probably looking at 15 years.

225
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,600
- What am I supposed to do? - What do you think?

226
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,500
My life is over.

227
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,410
It's not over yet.

228
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,220
At the startup I'm putting together,

229
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,120
you can keep doing exactly what you're doing now.

230
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,720
If you're interested, of course.

231
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,190
No risk of getting caught out of the blue like this.

232
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,390
A secure startup.

233
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,670
And this is a gift for our founding members.

234
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,810
What do you say?

235
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,020
I get the feeling this company isn't exactly legit.

236
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,090
Why would a prosecutor like you do this?

237
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,530
Let's say I'm tired of doing good and want to have some fun.

238
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,930
Being a prosecutor is boring, isn't it?

239
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,440
What's the point of working so hard to lock guys up for so little pay?

240
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,610
They get out in a few years and end up owning entire buildings.

241
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,980
So I'm planning on quitting.

242
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,980
And instead of a severance package,

243
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,320
someone as charming and talented as you...

244
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,420
would be the perfect person to scout.

245
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,690
I'm in.

246
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,850
Gosh, this is killer!

247
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,250
So this is our new office?

248
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,220
But why is no one else here?

249
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,420
After a few counter-spy ops here, everyone just left on their own.

250
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,290
It's a little too empty for my taste.

251
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,260
Then we can just hire our own people to fill the spots.

252
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,570
Let's fill it with foreigners. Undocumented ones.

253
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
It'll make things easier.

254
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,370
Then I guess we'll need our own police substation.

255
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,740
- Good idea, Officer Kim. - And you, Prosecutor?

256
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
Me?

257
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,310
I'll just be traveling around the island,

258
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,920
taking some landscape photos.

259
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,450
And speaking of which,

260
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,490
why don't we take a picture?

261
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,190
To commemorate our new venture.

262
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,620
- Writer Go, is it good? - Just a little...

263
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,960
A little... Okay, that's good.

264
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,630
We're taking a photo! Get over here, quick!

265
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,500
- We're losing the light! Come on. - Okay.

266
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,960
- Hurry. - Get in here!

267
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,530
Okay.

268
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,440
Come on, smile like Ju Seok Bong, will you?

269
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,810
- Okay. - The man of the hour. All right.

270
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:27,960
(Taxi Driver 3)

271
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,629
Just like Driver Kim said, Writer Go was...

272
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,630
a prosecutor in the Special Investigations Division.

273
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,070
This guy, Officer Kim, is a corrupt cop with a long record.

274
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,710
And the female motel owner... My gosh.

275
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,179
She has an illegal gambling record...

276
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,150
and was a programmer for the top illegal gaming site.

277
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,680
Then there's Seo Hwang, a con artist with ten priors.

278
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,620
And this jerk, Boss Choi, is a former overseas mercenary.

279
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,689
He was investigated for contract killing...

280
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,160
and illegal weapons possession.

281
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,890
And...

282
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,030
every single one of these jerks...

283
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,960
has one thing in common. Their charges were dropped.

284
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,970
I'm not surprised.

285
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,840
Writer Go must've dropped their charges while he was a prosecutor.

286
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,910
So he handpicked his own crew before he quit.

287
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,410
Since we've found their base, let's just go in and wipe them out.

288
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,980
We can't yet.

289
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,610
Why not? What's the problem?

290
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,050
If we just get rid of them right now,

291
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,420
we won't be able to do anything about...

292
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,590
all their criminal franchises overseas.

293
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,560
But we don't even know where those overseas franchises are.

294
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,890
How are we supposed to track them all down?

295
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,930
Writer Go creates crime scenarios...

296
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,660
and distributes them to all the franchises.

297
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,130
That means this island is connected to a global criminal network.

298
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,540
But to handle that kind of volume, they'd need a dedicated server.

299
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
And that server...

300
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,870
is most likely hidden somewhere around here.

301
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,580
- Hey. - Gosh! You scared me!

302
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,020
It's just me. Reporter Bong.

303
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,020
Do you have to sneak up on us like that?

304
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,120
Can't you just show up normally? Like you're clocking in for work.

305
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,790
Sorry, force of habit.

306
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,300
There we go.

307
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,630
But squatting for so long, doesn't it hurt your knees?

308
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,070
I'm fine.

309
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm okay because I have this. It's good for your joints.

310
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,140
- Gosh, this is... - Hey, isn't that from...

311
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,810
It looks familiar.

312
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,510
- So, what did you need? - Right.

313
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,249
I overheard you guys talking.

314
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,520
I thought maybe this could help.

315
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,990
Okay, guys.

316
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
Let's move it there.

317
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,260
Go on.

318
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,230
Those are servers and cooling equipment.

319
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,240
To bypass a dedicated server, I'll need my own equipment.

320
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,900
It's back at the office.

321
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,840
- I'll go get it in the morning. - Okay.

322
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,770
Driver Kim, can you hold out until then?

323
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,080
Go on. I'll find a way to stall them.

324
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,450
How? Those jerks will kill anyone on a whim.

325
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,050
So what?

326
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,220
We'll just do some killing of our own.

327
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,160
Hey, killing them sounds good.

328
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,030
- Who should we kill first? - Who first? We're killing them all.

329
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,060
- Let's go all out. - Right.

330
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,530
So, what's the order? We kill this one, then that one?

331
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,570
- Yes, that works. - Can I be next?

332
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,800
Oh, no. Let's just go by age.

333
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,710
- Oh, so I guess I'm up first. - Yes.

334
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,510
- Who's up after me? - That'd be me. Let's do that.

335
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,550
- We're going to get rich off this. - Yes.

336
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,190
The presentation is over,

337
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,530
but I still don't see any money on the table.

338
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,140
As I mentioned, our guy went to get the money.

339
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
Right.

340
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,370
I saw him leave on the boat.

341
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,910
Why don't you start deciding which business you'd like to open?

342
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,850
So what you're suggesting, Writer Go,

343
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,450
is we start with ping for two years to learn the ropes and get set up,

344
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,350
then switch to the site model? Is that it?

345
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,090
That's right.

346
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,160
I'll continue to send you scripts for new profitable plans quarterly.

347
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,730
And one more thing.

348
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,200
Since it got a little messy earlier, I'll take ten percent off...

349
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,840
your monthly subscription fee.

350
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,040
This is hilarious.

351
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,180
It's like a chicken franchise where you pay royalties to corporate...

352
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,250
- and sends you their secret sauce. - You're right.

353
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,480
It's pretty similar.

354
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,720
So, to ensure your future business is successful,

355
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,820
we'll do our best to help.

356
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,760
All right then, we will...

357
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,130
trust the expert...

358
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,160
- and go with ping. - Wait a minute!

359
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,070
No, wait. We have the manpower,

360
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,940
and if we just push a little harder, can't we go right to the site?

361
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,840
And from the pitch, it sounds like the cost difference isn't huge.

362
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,840
Sir, instead of doing too much from the start,

363
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,910
- build a solid base first, then... - Come on.

364
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,519
Come on. "A solid base"?

365
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,920
For us, if you get caught, it's over.

366
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,790
- Then let's go all in. Right? - Exactly.

367
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:30,060
It's about building a solid base, but we also need to save capital,

368
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,960
so we can upgrade the site later. I've explained all this already,

369
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,070
so why act like this is new to you? What do you want from me?

370
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,270
No.

371
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,240
I say we go straight for the site. I don't have much time left.

372
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,310
I can't afford to waste time like this.

373
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,780
You all came here because I said so, didn't you? Right?

374
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,610
- So just do what I say. - Says who? It's my money!

375
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,050
Then why not split the capital and do both at the same time?

376
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,350
If we do both, at least one is bound to succeed.

377
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,920
Don't be ridiculous!

378
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,890
You're new, so just stay out of it.

379
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,830
Stay out of it? I can't believe this guy.

380
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,400
Old man, just because I'm quiet, do you think I'm a pushover?

381
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,470
Did you just call me an old man?

382
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,840
With that ridiculous hair, you're getting an attitude with me?

383
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,970
Hey!

384
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,070
You'll startle the Buddha.

385
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,570
You people have no respect.

386
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,040
Monk.

387
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,180
I think we'll need a moment to talk amongst ourselves.

388
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Right.

389
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,790
I just finished setting up the barbecue.

390
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,650
Guess I'll have to feed it to the dogs.

391
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,960
Darn these guys.

392
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,330
I was wondering what that smell was. So it was the barbecue.

393
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,560
Perfect, I was starving anyway.

394
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,830
Since the fire's already going, let's eat first and talk later.

395
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,730
We're all in this together, right? Yes, let's go.

396
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,300
You got an extra pair of gloves? I'm a master at the grill.

397
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,970
- I love meat! Meat! - Gosh, my hip is killing me.

398
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,250
- Here, eat up. - Here, honey.

399
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,650
Having a barbecue at a temple.

400
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,120
- You too. - Gosh, it's delicious.

401
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,820
It's really good.

402
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,090
To think they were mortal enemies just a while ago.

403
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,160
Call me when the job comes up.

404
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,270
Aren't you having any?

405
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,570
- I'm fine. Please eat up. - This meat is incredible.

406
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,210
By the way,

407
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,310
there's something to take care of before we start the business.

408
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,220
The taxi company CEO who came with me...

409
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
I want him taken care of.

410
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,020
- Pardon? - You saw what happened earlier.

411
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,760
He's not the boss, but he acts like it and expects special treatment.

412
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,460
It's really getting on my nerves.

413
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,600
I did all the research and put this whole plan together.

414
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,400
All he needs to do is put his money in and take his cut.

415
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,140
But he still thinks he's the boss. That jerk.

416
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,080
So you're asking me to...

417
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,310
That guy... Boss Choi?

418
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,580
He seemed terrifyingly good at his job.

419
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,180
I'll make it worth his while,

420
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,590
so let's get him on it.

421
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,640
Gosh, this Maitreya Buddha looks ancient.

422
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,610
It looks like it's over 500 years old.

423
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,580
I doubt you wanted to know the Buddha's age...

424
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,680
when you asked to speak with me in private.

425
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,080
What was it you urgently needed to discuss?

426
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,450
Since you put it that way,

427
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,190
I'll get straight to the point.

428
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,290
I've been holding my tongue for a long time,

429
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,530
but I just can't take it anymore.

430
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,070
I'm older than him,

431
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,900
it's my money, and I'm the CEO,

432
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,810
but from the way he acts, you'd think he was the boss.

433
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,540
When all he did was drive us here.

434
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,680
Here's what I'm getting at, Monk.

435
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,890
I need you to take care of that taxi driver who came with me.

436
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,890
I'll make sure you're handsomely rewarded.

437
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,789
What's this all of a sudden?

438
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,260
I mean, once the tour is over,

439
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:28,060
isn't it only natural for the guide to disappear?

440
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,900
Right?

441
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,500
That's it.

442
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,500
His face...

443
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,280
- Blessed be the Goddess of Mercy. - His face...

444
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,250
Can I have a word with you?

445
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,220
After listening, I realized we don't need this many people.

446
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,520
The money comes to me first.

447
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,190
Except for me,

448
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,960
can't you kill everyone else?

449
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,040
It's easier to deal with one person than a group,

450
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,040
and it'll make getting the job done smoother, right?

451
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,840
I'll even pay you extra.

452
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
Even Kim Do Gi?

453
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,850
- Yes. - I thought you two were a thing.

454
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,850
What a nice day.

455
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,190
Finally.

456
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,890
Fi...

457
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,690
Finally?

458
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,360
Throw that jerk into the ocean.

459
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,370
Drop him somewhere deep,

460
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,340
so no one will ever find him.

461
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,810
Does that make me a bad person?

462
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,380
What...

463
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,380
What are you saying?

464
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,920
Make sure you kill him.

465
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
Honey.

466
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,960
- Honey. - Honey!

467
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,260
Honey, I brought your favorite meat.

468
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,169
- This is just... - I think it's spoiled.

469
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,970
A complete madhouse.

470
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,610
Driver Kim, in your opinion,

471
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,780
who do you think they'll listen to out of all of us?

472
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,950
I wonder.

473
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,080
They'll likely listen to me, right? I'm the boss, after all.

474
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,450
I have a feeling they'll listen to Driver Kim.

475
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,620
He and Writer Go seemed to be on the same page.

476
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,190
I have a feeling they'll listen to Go Eun.

477
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,030
It's easier to deal with one person, right?

478
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,770
What's their deal? Those losers.

479
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,570
It doesn't look like they even want to hire us.

480
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,340
Then what's with them asking us to kill each other?

481
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,880
If they don't intend on hiring us, why did they come out here?

482
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,040
I'm not curious enough to...

483
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,180
finding that out.

484
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,619
Go Eun told them to kill all of us!

485
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,450
What if those guys...

486
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,920
decide to listen to her right this second?

487
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,920
Shouldn't we be coming up with a plan right now?

488
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,220
How long have we been on this island?

489
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,630
About six or seven years?

490
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,660
It's about time we moved.

491
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,970
Let's start packing our things.

492
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,900
This time, let's find somewhere with a little more charm...

493
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,970
and a nice atmosphere.

494
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,880
Are the workers coming with us or are we hiring new ones?

495
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,080
We'll be traveling as light as possible.

496
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,380
Right.

497
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,750
Writer Go.

498
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,890
Since we're moving anyway,

499
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,520
why don't we set up near a church? I think I'm...

500
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,089
Amitabha Buddha

501
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,560
I'm more cut out to be a pastor.

502
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,360
Knock yourself out.

503
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,470
What about renewing Lee Gi Hyeon's contract?

504
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,800
- We already took all his money. - I sent my men to take care of him.

505
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,370
That's why we get paid upfront, isn't it?

506
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,910
Right. What about the people from the taxi company?

507
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,440
Once they bring the money,

508
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,650
we'll take care of them right away.

509
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,100
(Samheung Inn)

510
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,700
There are too many eyes on us here,

511
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,400
let's meet at Reporter Bong's shack later.

512
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,100
I have to check on something first.

513
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,410
Okay.

514
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,490
Yes?

515
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,120
The boat should be arriving any minute now,

516
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,360
so let's get the meeting started.

517
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,060
The sooner we get this over with, the better.

518
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,800
I was waiting. And it sounds like the boat's arriving right on time.

519
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,800
I'll see you shortly.

520
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,350
- I think Go Eun was right. - What are you talking about?

521
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,080
Lee Gi Hyeon is dead.

522
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,850
What? They took the money and just killed him?

523
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,820
As soon as Chief Park gets back, I think they'll get rid of us too.

524
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,990
How much time do you think you need?

525
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,720
Even if I find the server room on the first try,

526
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,130
if they have multi-layered security, it'll be at least 30 to 40 minutes.

527
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,030
- Thirty to forty minutes. - And that's if I'm lucky.

528
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,470
And one more thing.

529
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,370
Samheung Temple has to be empty.

530
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,120
Driver Kim, what are you doing?

531
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
How does it look?

532
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,190
- Doesn't it look like a cash bag? - Wait.

533
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,160
- Give me a hand with this. - Sure.

534
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,030
Yes, Writer Go.

535
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,970
The thing is,

536
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:13,670
I was hoping we could talk, just us, before the main meeting.

537
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,140
Right.

538
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,580
Okay, I'll head over there right now.

539
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,580
What's going on? You can't leave without telling me the plan.

540
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,280
There is no plan. Until Go Eun finishes her work,

541
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,190
we all just have to stall for time as best we can.

542
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,950
Hey...

543
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,620
What?

544
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,130
Hey, Monk. It's me.

545
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,200
I was hoping we could talk privately before the meeting.

546
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,370
Somewhere private.

547
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,180
Okay, let's meet at the gukbap place right now.

548
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,750
Gosh, if everyone just takes off, what am I supposed to do?

549
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,520
Gosh, how am I supposed to stall for time? Goodness.

550
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,690
Okay, let's do this.

551
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,930
The boat's already here,

552
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,800
so why were you in such a hurry to see me?

553
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,430
Get in. We can talk on the way.

554
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,709
It's the bag, isn't it?

555
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,940
Goodness. Come on, get in.

556
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,210
I'll put it in the back for you.

557
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,780
Gosh.

558
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,780
All right, then.

559
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,190
I'll ensure a safe ride.

560
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:50,870
Gosh, the gukbap is here. Thank you so much.

561
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:51,930
Here, let me get that.

562
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,140
- Is your name A Na? - Yes. And you are?

563
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,540
I'm Jang Seong Cheol.

564
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,480
I'll go on up and get things ready for the meeting.

565
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,080
(Samheung Gukbap)

566
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,050
This is a very serious matter.

567
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,820
Is there a problem?

568
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,790
Take a look. This here...

569
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,430
This is a Busan pork and rice soup, with boiled pork.

570
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,700
You see the clear broth?

571
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,270
But look, there are sesame seeds in it.

572
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,040
And sesame seeds are a hallmark of the Naju style, are they not?

573
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:30,110
I have to say, it's quite a perplexing combination.

574
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:33,410
I see. You must have one of those food blogs.

575
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,380
- A blog? No, certainly not. - Perhaps it's time...

576
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,920
you get to the point.

577
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,920
What was it you needed to discuss so urgently?

578
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,490
- Monk. - Yes.

579
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,560
Either way, I have the money.

580
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,160
There's no need to rush.

581
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,690
What I wanted to say was...

582
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,100
Wait, what's this?

583
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,230
Not wheat noodles,

584
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,770
but buckwheat noodles?

585
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,970
This is the Gangwon Province style.

586
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,840
Is A Na from Gangneung?

587
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,810
Is her family from Gangneung?

588
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,910
Is she?

589
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,750
Ma'am!

590
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,530
Hey, we've got plenty of time left.

591
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,070
Let's kill some time, just us. I heard that back in Apgujeong...

592
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,930
I need to go there and get ready.

593
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,670
All the money's here anyway. What's the rush?

594
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,140
Man, I even got the small bills. This thing weighs a ton.

595
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,540
This should be enough for the pot, right?

596
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,510
Not that it matters, since I'm going to win it all anyway.

597
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,650
- Isn't that company money? - So? I'll win and put it back.

598
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,090
So what should we play? Go-Stop?

599
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,160
What are you going to do if you lose it all?

600
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,530
If you lose, are you going to bet an arm or something?

601
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,500
Why is this thing still attached?

602
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,200
I can't even hold a woman's hand. Might as well cut it off.

603
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:21,320
- Seotda. How about it? - Seotda? Okay!

604
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,400
Am I in the wrong place?

605
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,600
So, when are you going to bring it up?

606
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,910
That urgent matter you wanted to discuss.

607
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:23,910
Right.

608
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,420
You still haven't decided on my proposal, have you?

609
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,120
Right, not yet.

610
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,960
Actually, I had a few drinks with the CEO,

611
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,860
and we had a real heart-to-heart.

612
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,660
I think we can spare him.

613
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,470
Seriously? You called me here in such a rush just for that?

614
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,470
Hey, what could be more urgent than this?

615
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,340
All right, fine.

616
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,810
Let's go back up. Looks like you brought the money anyway.

617
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,680
Then kill the accountant instead.

618
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,250
I've decided she has to die.

619
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,950
She's getting prettier every day. I can't have that.

620
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,590
She'll definitely cheat on me.

621
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,530
You're a real handful, you know that?

622
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
A handful?

623
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,070
This is good to have when you're tired.

624
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,740
Want some?

625
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,110
It's really delicious.

626
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,150
Delicious.

627
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,220
Well?

628
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,160
Look at these jerks.

629
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,990
Gosh, how many layers of security did they put up?

630
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,050
So paranoid.

631
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,659
Gap, Oh.

632
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,060
(Gap, Oh: March, June)

633
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,399
Hey, it's Dok, Sa.

634
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,570
(Dok, Sa: January, April)

635
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,640
Al, Li.

636
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,370
(Al, Li: January, February)

637
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:39,680
That must sting. I'll make you all some spicy soup later.

638
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,980
You're pretty good.

639
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,610
Man, Seotda looks easy, but it's actually pretty tough.

640
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,300
- Hey, what gives? - It's time to get to work.

641
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:10,140
Hey, you can't just win and run. That's just bad form.

642
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:13,410
If you really have to go, good form means you leave the money.

643
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,410
Why would I leave my own money?

644
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,750
Because it was my money to begin with.

645
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,020
Hey, we haven't even gotten a call. They'll call if they need us.

646
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,220
Come on.

647
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,860
At least clean us out before you leave.

648
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,330
Then we'll call it fair.

649
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:36,830
Fine. Let's all go all-in for the final round.

650
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,270
I'm in.

651
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,070
Okay, last hand's over and we're starting a new game,

652
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,740
so I'll be the one to deal, right?

653
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,140
- Deal. - All right.

654
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,180
Abracadabra.

655
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,920
(Firewall bypass 1: Failed)

656
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,530
(Firewall bypass 2: Failed)

657
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,530
(3rd failure triggers server shutdown.)

658
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,840
(Firewall bypass successful)

659
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,520
And as a little bonus, the premium database.

660
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,220
Go!

661
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,990
Honey. It's me. Where are you?

662
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:37,030
Hey, honey. I'm driving right now.

663
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,360
- Are you done with work? - Yes.

664
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:45,100
- I miss you so much. - You do?

665
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,400
Oh, my gosh, that's crazy.

666
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,440
I was just thinking I missed you too.

667
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,140
We're totally on the same wavelength.

668
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:56,450
- Then come see me. You will, right? - Of course I will.

669
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,980
Honey, I'm coming as soon as I can. Just wait for me.

670
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,780
Okay.

671
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,920
- I love you, honey. - I love you more!

672
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,700
Darn it. Seriously.

673
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,260
Get out.

674
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,970
- What? - You heard her. She misses me.

675
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,400
You're telling me to get out? Here?

676
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,770
We can finish our conversation after I get back.

677
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,310
Finish what?

678
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,950
What is there to finish?

679
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,880
We've been driving around until sunset.

680
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,050
We haven't said a single word to each other!

681
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,520
What? Do you want to see my girlfriend too?

682
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,630
Unbelievable...

683
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,060
Go.

684
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
(Deluxe Taxi)

685
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,610
That jerk! Who's he dealing with? Does he have any idea who I am?

686
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,780
Where am I?

687
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:08,520
In Andong, there's Jungang Market. It used to be an old cattle market.

688
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,490
In the market's center, they add scallions, oxblood, cabbage,

689
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:16,360
and simmer them into this rich, hearty stew.

690
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,730
The gukbap there is amazing. The line is always incredibly long.

691
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,100
But this gukbap...

692
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,500
is made with a rich, slow-brewed beef bone broth.

693
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:30,270
But speaking of bone broth, try the Uiryeong bean sprout gukbap.

694
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:34,210
- That stuff is on another level. - Excuse me a moment, Mr. Jang.

695
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,250
Forgive me for saying this,

696
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:42,320
but I have walking and bowel issues, and intermittent claudication.

697
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,250
I suffer from spinal stenosis that can cause these issues.

698
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,890
I can't sit still for long. So, could you stop talking about soup,

699
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:52,090
and get to the point?

700
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,060
What? Monk, I thought you liked gukbap.

701
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:57,900
Based on your face, you look like a total soup fanatic.

702
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:02,640
This information is highly prized among soup connoisseurs, Monk.

703
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,210
Your knack for reading faces has really gotten rusty.

704
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:09,980
So please, just get to the point. My back is really starting to hurt.

705
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,380
And now my ears are starting to hurt too.

706
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,250
So please, just get on with it.

707
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,620
(An Go Eun: Done)

708
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:17,920
Yes, my apologies.

709
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,460
- The thing is... - Yes.

710
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,760
Since I'll probably be asking you for many favors in the future, Monk,

711
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,900
I prepared a small gift of my appreciation.

712
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,670
A gift?

713
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,370
Yes.

714
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:38,470
Ta-da!

715
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,510
It's roasted seaweed. The delicious kind.

716
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,410
Here, look.

717
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,780
You see this seaweed? You just tear it open like this.

718
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,620
See?

719
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:52,920
Wrap it around a bite of rice like this,

720
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,830
and then you eat it.

721
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,330
It's not too salty, and it's so savory.

722
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,130
It's got a clean taste. Absolutely amazing.

723
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:06,200
Gosh, is that it?

724
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:08,900
You came all this way just to give me seaweed?

725
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,940
And not even a whole box, just a single pack.

726
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,680
If you don't want the seaweed, I guess I'll just have it myself.

727
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,510
Anyway, I'll get to my point in due time.

728
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,580
Is he trying to make me curse?

729
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,780
Gosh. They say you're supposed to talk less as you get older.

730
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:22,920
But that jerk...

731
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,190
Where did that jerk go?

732
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,390
You can run all you want, but you can't escape Buddha's hand.

733
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,390
(An Go Eun: Done)

734
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,560
Alright, all in!

735
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:36,830
All in.

736
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:39,200
- Jjangttaeng. - Gosh!

737
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:43,340
- To beat a Jjangttaeng... - It's a Gwangttaeng.

738
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:47,510
Oh dear, what are you going to do now you've lost the company's money?

739
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,380
Oh, no. All I have is a nine.

740
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,020
It's a Gwangttaeng!

741
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:58,550
Yes, I won! Game over.

742
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,490
Man, that was the best hand I could get.

743
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,360
Here, take a taxi home. It's not safe to walk.

744
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,200
That was fun.

745
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,870
- Just thinking of it upsets me. - Why?

746
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,670
- Weren't you up there? - Don't even get me started.

747
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:56,310
That guy, the taxi company's CEO, asked to meet, so I went.

748
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,080
And gosh, he just went on and on about some stupid gukbap.

749
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,150
I'm telling you, I thought my ears were going to bleed.

750
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,460
Darn it...

751
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:09,790
Weird, right?

752
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,960
I'm telling you, let's just get rid of them all!

753
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,100
What are you doing here?

754
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,700
The guys from the taxi company wouldn't let me leave.

755
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:27,480
(Successfully received Premium DB)

756
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,940
(I'll put it to good use! Thanks, Premium DB!)

757
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,010
By any chance,

758
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,820
- did we send them the script? - What script are you talking about?

759
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,950
The boat's already here,

760
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,750
so why were you in such a hurry to see me?

761
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,520
Get in. We can talk on the way.

762
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,520
Hey, honey.

763
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,160
Are you done with work?

764
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:45,490
Yes.

765
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,070
Darn it!

766
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,440
Kim Do Gi... Kim Do Gi, you scum!

767
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,840
- Darn it! - Darn.

768
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,600
What is this? All this grass...

769
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:30,210
No. What is this? Please... This can't be happening!

770
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,480
A Na!

771
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:42,180
Ana! Are you okay?

772
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,650
Darn it.

773
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:52,860
What's all the commotion? Did something happen?

774
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,730
- Hey. What's that smoke? - Isn't that the Police Substation?

775
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,870
Oh, no! Wait, hold on...

776
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,410
My gosh!

777
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,150
Hey!

778
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,420
Your opponent...

779
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,820
isn't over there, is he?

780
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:42,010
"Do no harm." Do not take a life.

781
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:47,850
How can you defy Buddha's teachings like that?

782
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,230
- You okay? - Let's go.

783
00:51:58,550 --> 00:51:59,550
Darn it.

784
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:05,890
Darn it.

(Server down)

786
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,560
What's that? Who did that?

787
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,130
- It wasn't me. - Me neither.

788
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,100
It was me.

789
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,810
A Na!

790
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:24,870
(Police Station)

791
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,640
I took care of everything.

792
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:33,280
I wasn't sure what else I could do to help.

793
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,450
- Nice work. - You're the best.

(Deluxe Taxi)

795
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,730
What happened with their affiliates?

796
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:48,600
They should be pretty much taken care of by now.

797
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:52,470
I sent it as a "special DB." They'll probably open it, right?

798
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,840
Let's get out of here on the boat before those guys notice.

799
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,410
- Okay. - I think they've already caught on.

800
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,350
You really got me good.

801
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:08,350
It feels good getting a compliment from a former prosecutor.

802
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,650
You guys doing all this...

803
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:15,760
What exactly is in it for you?

804
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,730
I've been racking my brain, but I just don't get it.

805
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,460
Why would you go to such lengths?

806
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,970
Why?

807
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:29,070
Why go through all this? Why?

808
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,570
I'm asking you, why are you doing all this?

809
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,580
Because I care about them.

810
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,520
The new mom who's trying to save even a little on baby supplies,

811
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:43,850
who spends all day looking through resale apps.

812
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,090
The eight-year-old buying gloves for her father in the hospital...

813
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:51,590
by breaking the piggy bank she'd been saving up for a year.

814
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:56,160
And that man who only feels secure when he has 5,000 dollars.

815
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,170
I care about them a lot.

816
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,980
Now I see.

817
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:16,690
Why people always died or disappeared in your wake.

818
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:21,590
But what are you going to do?

819
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:24,860
This time,

820
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,330
that's going to be you.

821
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,040
Darn it.

822
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,580
Darn.

00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,200

Follow them this way.

Bulletproof glass? Who are these guys?

845
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:24,240
You underestimated Samheung Island!

Back off!

Wait a second.

Why did I build another one of these? Go Eun will kill me.

If they never have to use it, all the better.

875
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,470
I should give Driver Kim a heads-up about it.

01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,720
Yes, I'm fine.

883
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,390
What was all that?

884
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,360
Could it be...

885
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:52,630
What's with all these cars?

886
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:57,240
The high-power discharge takes all the electrical power...

887
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:58,870
and releases it all at once.

888
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:02,280
I guess that's what fried all the other cars.

889
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,580
The Deluxe Taxi is totaled.

890
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,250
What did you say?

891
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:10,180
- Chief Park, what did you do? - Well...

892
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,920
What? You did something...

893
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:15,960
that turned our taxi into junk just like that? Is that right?

894
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,090
- No, it's just that... - But thanks to him,

895
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:19,630
I'm still alive.

896
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:21,230
Thank you,

897
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,800
Chief Park.

898
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:24,330
Really?

899
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:27,100
In that case...

900
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:28,970
Great job, Chief Park.

901
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:32,470
In that case, great job. Good work, Jin Eon.

902
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:34,080
Don't you have a mind of your own?

903
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:38,180
What does my opinion matter? What matters is what Go Eun thinks.

904
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,680
What?

905
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,550
Looks like that boat over there is moving.

906
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:57,130
It's Writer Go.

907
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:12,910
Hey. You think you've won, don't you?

908
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:14,380
Think again.

909
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,820
All I need is me.

910
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:20,790
As long as I'm around, I can rebuild everything.

912
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:25,720
Hello, this is Reporter Bong.

913
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:26,950
(NEWSTART, Live)

914
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:29,290
I've been away on assignment.

915
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,530
He's like a totally different person.

916
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:36,630
A ring providing goods and services for criminal acts,

917
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:38,830
earning massive profits in the process,

918
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,470
has finally been taken down.

919
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,270
This organization, centered around a former prosecutor,

920
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:47,270
spawned over a hundred overseas criminal franchises.

921
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:51,380
While the major media ignored this and remained silent,

922
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:54,080
our team has been covering this case.

923
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:57,120
We, the late Shin Kyung Soo investigative journalism team,

924
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,950
have witnessed firsthand...

925
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,960
what kind of lawless wasteland is created...

926
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,390
when a guardian of the law turns their back...

927
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,660
and abuses the very system they swore to protect.

928
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,930
You've all been through so much.

929
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:13,200
Tonight, premium Korean beef is on me.

930
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:14,770
Finally!

931
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:17,370
In that case, I'm definitely eating a lot tonight.

932
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:19,940
- Okay, let's go to the BBQ place. - Sounds good.

933
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:22,140
Wait, we still have to take care of business.

934
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:24,080
Take care of what business?

935
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:29,120
We have to end our operation before we can go eat. Right, Driver Kim?

936
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:34,220
- Like this? - You have to do it by the book.

937
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,490
But this isn't the Deluxe Taxi, so there's no radio...

938
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,660
Vehicle 5283 is now ending service.

939
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,460
- Time for some beef! - Let's go!

940

(Deluxe Taxi 3)

943
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:11,950
Captain Kim Do Gi. How have you been?

944
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,460
Gosh, why is his phone off?

945
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,360
To just abandon his taxi, something serious must've happened.

946
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:22,230
It says Sergeant Yoo Seon Ah went AWOL during training.

947
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:24,300
She was killed in an explosion while trying to escape.

948
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,800
It's a military base. I'm sure of it.

949
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,440
He's getting closer to the Demarcation Line. This is unnerving.

950
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,110
Something's definitely happened to Driver Kim.

951
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,610
We have to get to Driver Kim right now.

952
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,850
Halt. Driver, step out of the vehicle.

953
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:42,580
- Identify yourself. - Captain Kim Do Gi.
