181
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,700
- It's crazy right now. - Dong Su.

182
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,640
Don't you recognize me?

183
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,680
Who are you?

184
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,910
Dong Su.

185
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,850
We planned to meet, remember?

186
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,760
We'd meet when Im Dong Hyeon left. You called, remember?

187
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,890
Don't you remember?

188
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,590
It's almost time. Why aren't you here yet?

189
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,660
I never called you.

190
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,410
It's almost time for my Min Ho to get back from practice.

191
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,840
(Writing Practice)

192
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,110
Right, I have to hurry.

193
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,020
I didn't call you.

194
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,090
(An Elder's Handwriting)

195
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,930
He was in a serious car accident and was hospitalized for a long time.

196
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,830
His Alzheimer's symptoms got worse, so he was transferred to us.

197
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,100
He's been with us for about five years now.

198
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,210
By chance, is there any information on who caused the accident...

199
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,280
or any insurance records?

200
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,980
That's all we have from when he was transferred.

201
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,360
It was a hit-and-run, and they never caught the driver,

202
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,090
so as you can imagine, his insurance doesn't cover much.

203
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,500
He's only covered by medical and living assistance,

204
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,030
so he has hundreds of dollars in unpaid fees piling up monthly.

205
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,640
I'll pay the outstanding balance in full.

206
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,840
And we have all our patients fill this out.

207
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,850
Mr. Park Dong Su filled this out himself.

208
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,510
I'm not sure if it'll be helpful, though.

(100 Questions for the Heart)

210
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,390
Okay, thank you.

00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,770
(Sometimes I feel sad for no reason.)

(I sometimes find it hard to describe myself.)

222
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,100
(I feel like every day is the same.)

223
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,870
(Sometimes I feel like a stranger to myself.)

224
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,939
(I feel like someone is still waiting for me.)

225
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,709
(Life is joyful.)

226
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,080
(I'm happy to be alive right now.)

227
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,790
Out of these, it'd be great if we could get the top four soon.

228
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,590
I'll ask them to send these four by the end of the week.

229
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,060
Has anyone seen Mr. Jang today?

230
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,700
Mr. Jang?

231
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,400
- Isn't he in his office? - No. I just checked,

232
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,240
and he's not picking up his phone.

233
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,040
I tried calling him earlier, but he didn't pick up either.

234
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,710
Come to think of it, after he called to trace that number,

235
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,880
I don't think I've seen him.

236
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,820
Trace a number?

237
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,220
Yes. I don't know the details, but he sounded rushed.

238
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,570
You should have some food with your drink.

239
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,880
Go Eun would give you an earful if she saw you.

240
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,950
How did you know I was here?

241
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,020
I've noticed you come here sometimes.

242
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,180
When you have something on your mind.

243
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,520
I can't get anything past you, can I?

244
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,890
Did you get to meet who you were looking for?

245
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,900
Mind if I ask what this is about?

246
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,870
Just how incompetent...

247
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,080
and irresponsible...

248
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,810
I truly am...

249
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,150
I'll tell you when I've sobered up and have a clear head.

250
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,250
Don't say that. Just tell us now.

251
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,790
What?

252
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,860
You don't have to have a clear head.

253
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,200
I guess we'll just have to listen while we're all foggy-headed.

254
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,270
I think I'm getting drunk already just from sitting here.

255
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,400
Wait, how long have you all been here?

256
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,510
We all came together. By tailing Driver Kim Do Gi.

257
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,440
They asked where I was going,

258
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,450
so I just told them I was coming to see you.

259
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,080
You guys are impossible.

260
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,220
Please tell us what's going on.

261
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,460
Im Dong Hyeon.

262
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,100
The day Im Dong Hyeon gets out of prison,

263
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,500
I promised Dong Su I'd meet him there.

264
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,940
Fifteen years ago.

265
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,810
- Fifteen years ago? - Yes.

266
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,680
The truth is,

267
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,350
the reason I started Deluxe Taxi...

268
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,390
was all because of Dong Su.

269
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,490
Is it true you raped and assaulted the minor, Ms. Jin Yu Rim?

270
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,330
- I never forced her. - Me neither.

271
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,230
You gave consistent statements to the police and the prosecution.

272
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,370
Are you recanting all of that now?

273

(Defense)

274
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,039
I was scared and confused back then,

275
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,240
but I remember everything clearly now.

276
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,180
It's true. Yu Rim was the one who came onto us first!

277
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,310
You're lying!

278
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,150
Because of what you scums did, Yu Rim took her own life.

279
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,860
You should ask for forgiveness, not lying more, you jerks!

280
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,460
- If we're lying, go ask Yu Rim. - What?

281
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,900
You monster! How can you say that, you jerk!

282
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,230
I won't let you two get away with this!

283
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,970
The system, the police, prosecutors, and judges, had failed.

284
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,940
The law, instead of protecting them, had cast out the innocent,

285
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,810
forcing them into a lonely battle to protect themselves.

286
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,290
- There he is! He's here! - Sir! Over here!

287
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,030
- Do you admit to the charges? - A comment, please!

288
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,160
- Look over here, please! - Over here! Just give us a comment!

289
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,530
- We need a statement! - Please, just a moment!

290
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,630
Say something!

291
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:44,400
See? They're all over that celebrity scandal.

292
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,900
They couldn't care less about us.

293
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,039
Don't be nervous.

294
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,040
I met the prosecutor yesterday. It's all sorted out.

295
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,810
- This case is as good as won. - You're lying!

296
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,190
Who says you've won? This trial isn't over yet.

297
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,490
If you want to make a claim, bring some evidence.

298
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,130
You can't just throw a tantrum and make baseless claims without proof.

299
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,960
You're the ones who stopped me!

300
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,760
Whenever I tried to do anything,

301
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,600
you'd sue and block over and over!

302
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,670
You made sure I couldn't do a thing!

303
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,440
And you'd need proof of that, too, right?

304
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,970
Attorney Cha.

305
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,580
Let's go.

306
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,590
The verdict.

307
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,859
The defendant, Im Dong Hyeon,

308
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,260
is sentenced to five months in prison...

309
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,830
and 80 hours of community service.

310
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,870
What kind of justice is this?

311
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,940
He killed a man, and he only gets five months?

312
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,510
What kind of justice is this?

313
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,050
My son...

314
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,290
We still haven't even found his body!

315
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,219
I guess he really doesn't know...

316
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,820
Im Dong Hyeon wasn't even charged with murder.

317
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,490
Forget it. Let him stay ignorant.

318
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,160
- All right, let's go. - Hey! Wait!

319
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,570
Tell me where my son is. Please, just tell me.

320
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,600
He deserves a funeral, doesn't he?

321
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,870
Look, we just got into a fight. I didn't kill him.

322
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,880
- I told you, I didn't kill him. - Just tell me!

323
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,550
I said, tell me!

324
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,420
Where is my son?

325
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,590
Hey!

326
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,760
You people... Are you even human?

327
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,510
Are you even human? What kind of law is this?

328
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,250
To keep those who were wronged from giving up,

329
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,380
I sought a way to fight for them to the very end, outside the law.

330
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,490
And that's where I found Dong Su.

331

00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,780
is going to change anything?

The hope that if you die,

341
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,720
they might reopen the investigation.

I know that feeling all too well.

343
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,260

am I supposed to do?

There's nothing else...

349
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,620
I can do.

350
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,790

00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,260
Min Ho.

356
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,940
(Watch Repair, Straps, Batteries, Crystal)

357
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,490
Goodness.

358
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,560
I can't believe how many lawsuits have been filed against you.

359
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,830
If I even so much as ask what happened to my Min Ho,

360
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,770
they'd hit me with lawsuits for obstruction and damages.

361
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,940
They stopped me from doing anything.

362
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,040
I just...

363
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,980
feel so helpless not knowing the law,

364
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,150
and I had no idea what to do.

365
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,120
Let me see what I can do about these.

366
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,390
And one more thing.

367
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,560
How about we meet up once a week?

368
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,490
Once a week?

369
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Yes.

370
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,030
In the meantime, I'll go over all the documents you've gathered,

371
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,330
and I'll figure out what else we need to prepare.

372
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,570
Goodness.

373
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,740
Thank you so much.

374
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,580
Please. There's no need for that.

375
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,010
Let's just give it everything we've got.

376
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,350
All right, I'll take these with me.

377
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,660
Okay.

378
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,029
- It was 7:40pm. - At 7:40pm...

379
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,700
This one was his call with me.

380
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,670
And this last call was at 8:01pm.

381
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,570
With Im Dong Hyeon.

382
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,710
After that, I started visiting him once a week,

383
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,510
and Dong Su and I became quite close.

384
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,220
Excuse me! Hey, students! Can I ask you something?

385
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,419
- Okay. - About Park Min Ho...

386
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,820
and Im Dong Hyeon from the volleyball team.

387
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,590
Do you happen to know if something happened between them?

388
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,090
- We're freshmen, so we don't know. - Here's Park Min Ho.

389
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,160
- I'm hungry. Let's go. - Park Min Ho.

390
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,540
I was just hoping that as the coach, you might know something.

391
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,780
Sir, what am I supposed to say when you ask me that?

392
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,740
Sorry I couldn't be of any help.

393
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,450
That can't be right.

394
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,360
- Let's go ask somewhere else. - Okay.

395
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,470
Dinner's ready.

396
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,540
- Come on in. - All right, Dong Su.

397
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,540
By the way...

398
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
Yes?

399
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,910
All the other clocks are working just fine,

400
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,510
but why has that one stopped?

401
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,180
That one?

402
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,450
It's a secret.

403
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,320
What, a stopped clock is a secret now? Goodness.

404
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,830
You really shouldn't have gone to all this trouble.

405
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,570
It's nothing. I wanted to cook a meal for you.

406
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,500
Thank you for the meal.

407
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,740
Gosh.

408
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,510
You could open a restaurant. You'd make a killing.

409
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,280
Even though my Min Ho grew up without his mom,

410
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,250
I wanted him to have the same foods other kids had,

411
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,060
so I learned to cook all sorts and fed him.

412
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,290
I'm definitely going to eat too much today.

413
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:15,130
I also packed you some side dishes, so take them when you leave.

414
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
I will.

415
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,040
- Hey! You should eat too. - Right.

416
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,509
- So? What'd you find? - It was ruled a simple assault,

417
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,510
so there isn't enough data.

418
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,720
Plus, it looks like the lawyers took the little documents there were.

419
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,720
I don't know if this will be helpful.

420
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,600
(Evidence: Jingwang University)

421
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,979
- What's all this noise? - Some guy keeps demanding...

422
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,009
the files regarding Park Min Ho.

423
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,350
- He's been making a scene. - Park Min Ho? Darn it.

424
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,480
Why didn't you call the cops right away?

425
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,790
- I did, but he just came back. - What?

426
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,820
- Let me go! I'm not leaving! - Sir, you need to...

427
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,820
- I'm not leaving without them! - Quiet down!

428
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
What on earth...

429
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,470
What do you think you're doing at my office?

430
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,030
I'm here for the case files.

431
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,740
Why are you asking us for them?

432
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Because you took everything, including the original files.

433
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,210
Don't give me that nonsense and just get out immediately!

434
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,980
I'm not leaving without those files.

435
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,550
I tried asking nicely.

436
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,020
Do you really want me to sue you?

437
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,960
Do you want me to have you thrown in prison for real?

438
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,060
Prison? Great! I happen to love prison food!

439
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,360
Even if you have me arrested,

440
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:57,330
I'll come back here again when I get released.

441
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,670
I came empty-handed today, but I won't be next time. Got it?

442
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,339
- This guy's unbelievable. - Go ahead, press charges again.

443
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,980
If I get released,

444
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,980
I'm off to the parking lot to smash your car first.

445
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,550
Darn it. This guy's a loose cannon.

446
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,890
Do what you want. Sue me again. I don't care!

447
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,360
And when I get out, I'm coming to your house. Got it?

448
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,430
Fine!

449
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,060
All right!

450
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,830
Attorney Yu.

451
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,630
Just give him what he wants and get him out of here.

452
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,340
What are you waiting for?

453
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,680
I said we'll give you what you want, so take it and get out of here.

454
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,380
Would you come with me, please?

455
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,890
Hey, wait a second.

456
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,920
Let me ask you one thing.

457
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,000
Why on earth are you going to such lengths for this?

458
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,970
To be honest, this isn't even your business, is it?

459
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,110
No.

460
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,210
This is my business.

461
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,460
Gosh...

462
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,640
(Locker room CCTV)

463
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,050
Hold on a second.

464
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,850
Something looks off.

465
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,660
Right there, in the shadows...

466
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,330
Doesn't it look like he's talking to someone?

467
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,600
(Im Dong Hyeon)

468
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,170
Im Dong Hyeon...

469
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,000
wasn't alone in there that day.

470
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:20,410
(Im Dong Hyeon)

471
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,580
Dong Hyeon.

472
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,720
You're my son Min Ho's friend, aren't you?

473
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,720
I already told you the truth, so why do you keep hassling me?

474
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,790
I told you, the fight just happened, and I'm the one who hurt him.

475
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,860
I confessed, so I've been stuck here for five months.

476
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,400
So what else could you possibly want me to say?

477
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,200
I know you weren't alone.

478
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,570
That day in the locker room, behind the second set of lockers,

479
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,040
I know there was someone else with you.

480
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,050
What happened that day...

481
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,480
and where my Min Ho is.

482
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,250
Just tell me that, please.

483
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,790
You're really starting to annoy me.

484
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,490
I don't know.

485
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,130
I don't know anything.

486
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,600
I'm refusing all your visits from now on.

487
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,300
So don't come and see me again.

488
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,140
I'll find out everything, whether you tell me or not.

489
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,310
You hear me? Who you were with that day...

490
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,840
and what happened to my Min Ho.

491
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,950
I swear I will find out everything!

492
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,560
Since he's already in prison, unless he admits to another crime...

493
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,170
or some hard evidence turns up, it's going to be tough.

494
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,030
It's the principle of double jeopardy.

495
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,100
Is that right? Thanks. I'll be in touch.

496
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,240
What did he say?

497
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,280
He told me not to come back.

498
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,210
And that he'll refuse all my visits from now on.

499
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,820
Listen, Dong Su.

500
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,850
It's hot out. Why don't we get some cold noodles?

501
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:17,390
Him refusing your visits means he has something to hide.

502
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,830
That's why he's avoiding you.

503
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,570
But listen.

504
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,170
Back at the trial,

505
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,940
why did you say...

506
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,680
that your son, Min Ho, died?

507
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,350
Most parents would hope their son is still alive.

508
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,350
That he's alive out there somewhere,

509
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,820
and that one day he'll come home.

510
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,490
Because I know.

511
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,600
Even if the whole world doesn't, I do.

512
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,430
I'm his dad.

513
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,570
More than anyone else in this world,

514
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,070
I was the one who hoped my Min Ho was still alive.

515
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,610
And I prayed for him to come home.

516
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,720
But then one night, Min Ho came to me in a dream.

517
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,690
Dad!

518
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,520
Don't look for me anymore.

519
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,600
It'll only make things harder for you.

520
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,660
I'm okay,

521
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,170
so please stop looking for me.

522
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,670
Okay?

523
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,980
That's when I knew.

524
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,510
That my Min Ho was dead.

525
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,180
Those jerks...

526
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,290
had killed my son.

527
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,030
Dong Su.

528
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,040
What if we start preparing meticulously from now...

529
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,970
and wait for him right outside when that jerk gets out?

530
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,980
If we plan it out perfectly, there's no way that guy can escape.

531
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,680
We'll grab him and won't let go until he spits out the truth.

532
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,390
We won't let him go. What do you say?

533
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,160
Yes. Let's do it.

534
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,760
Then the last one there buys dinner.

535
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,200
Please, I have a huge advantage.

536
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,800
Because I fully intend to keep that promise.

537
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,600
Great. The food's here.

538
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,170
All right, thank you.

539
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,540
- Enjoy. - Thanks.

540
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,980
Oh, right. By the way,

541
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,250
I was thinking of starting up something like this.

542
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
What is it?

543
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,490
What do you think?

544
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,820
(Don't die. Get revenge.)

545
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,560
I'm 100 percent on board.

546
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:04,990
The phrase "Don't die. Get revenge." That's what kept me going.

547
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,500
(Deluxe Taxi)

548
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,100
Will you join me in getting revenge?

549
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,769
If you take this on too, you won't have time to rest.

550
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,210
You'll work yourself to death.

551
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,170
That's why I have to get revenge, not die.

552
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Go on, eat.

553
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,920
(The day of Im Dong Hyeon's release)

554
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:33,120
Since we met every week, I assumed I'd see Dong Su that day too.

555
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:36,030
(A Correctional Service Inspiring Hope and Public Trust)

556
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,460
There he is. Over here!

557
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,400
- You've been through a lot. - Yes.

558
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,270
Im Dong Hyeon!

559
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,769
Im Dong Hyeon!

560
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,210
Im Dong Hyeon, I need to talk to you.

561
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,540
Im Dong Hyeon...

562
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,210
Hey, Im Dong Hyeon!

563
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,660
Dong Su?

564
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,790
After he vanished like a mirage,

565
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,960
I never saw him again.

566
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,100
The last time I went to his watch shop,

567
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,700
someone else was already living there.

568
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,840
So he just moved without saying anything?

569
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,540
Yes.

570
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,840
I wondered if maybe he just wanted to forget everything.

571
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,280
That he wanted to leave it all behind,

572
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,780
and that's why he cut all ties with me.

573
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,620
At least, that's what I thought.

574
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:16,030
But today, I saw him again.

575
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,130
Dong Su.

576
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,200
He was in the same spot from 15 years ago...

577
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,970
exactly as he was.

578
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,370
- Looking so frail. - I never called you.

579
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,479
If only I'd tried harder to find him,

580
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,580
would things have changed?

581
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,980
If I hadn't been...

582
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,220
so darn useless,

583
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,290
I wouldn't have had to see him like that.

584
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,660
I regret that so much.

585
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,170
I don't think that's it, Mr. Jang.

586
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,440
This isn't something to regret.

587
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,940
It's something we have to fix.

588
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,240
I agree.

589
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,310
Besides, you took on his case, right, Mr. Jang?

590
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,750
You already did 15 years ago, no less.

591
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,380
So the case is still open, then?

592
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,320
You guys...

593
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,560
Gosh, how much do we even charge for a 15-year taxi ride?

594
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,990
You'd really charge him for that?

595
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,290
It was a joke. You're the jerk for taking it so seriously.

596
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,430
Goodness.

597
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,930
But he...

598
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,400
doesn't even remember that he made the request in the first place.

599
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,070
All the more reason to hurry, then.

600
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,740
Before his memory fades completely.

601
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,940
Gosh, if it's been 15 years, that's quite a long time ago.

602
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,310
The key will be how much information is still available today.

603
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
Exactly.

604
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:50,150
The more we have to work with, the more options we'll have.

605
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:54,320
Should we gather everything first and then plan our next move?

606
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,560
Mr. Jang, can we see the old case files?

607
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,709
I'll start with...

608
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,340
- the court records then. - Okay.

609
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,010
For something 15 years old, it's got to be in that corner.

610
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,710
- Let's go find it. - Okay.

611
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,020
Defendant, Im Dong Hyeon. Victim, Park Min Ho.

612
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,690
Should I start by digging into Im Dong Hyeon?

613
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,830
Okay.

614
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,029
Let's take all of them out...

615
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,800
- and look through them together. - Okay.

616
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,680
(Park Dong Su)

617
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:54,450
(Don't die. Get revenge)

618
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,669
(Perjury, prosecutors, preferential treatment for former officials...)

619
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:15,470
(I can't see a way to get revenge no matter what I try.)

620
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,430
Aren't you tired?

621
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
Thanks.

622
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,140
You're working nonstop, aren't you?

623
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,980
I have to work twice as hard on this case.

624
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,110
Why's that?

625
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,009
We have two clients, don't we?

626
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,150
Oh, you're right.

627
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,390
Closing this case would be...

628
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:08,060
a big relief for Mr. Jang, don't you think?

629
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,230
Let's hope so.

630
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,460
Cheers to that!

631
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:17,870
Cheers.

632
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,810
Dad, you have to come right now! Hurry!

633
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,720
Min Ho.

634
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,250
Min Ho... Min Ho!

635
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,090
(Watch Repair, Straps, Batteries, Crystal)

636
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,210
Dong Su!

637
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:12,050
What are you doing? It's dangerous standing in the road!

638
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,020
But Min Ho told me to come out here right away.

639
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:17,490
The car...

640
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,790
But who are you?

641
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:27,500
Do you know me?

642
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,200
Dong Su...

643
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:36,610
His periods of lucidity are becoming noticeably shorter.

644
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:41,110
If they're shorter, by how much?

645
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,710
Just last month, he was lucid for two hours a week.

646
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,220
Now, it's less than 30 minutes.

647
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,390
The lucid intervals are short,

648
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,360
and if this continues, he may soon be unable to talk.

649
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,300
Im Dong Hyeon and Park Min Ho.

650
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,770
They were both born in 1990 and were college teammates.

651
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:06,800
After a volleyball match, they went back to the school...

652
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:10,740
and fought in the locker room over the outcome of the game.

653
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:13,779
Im Dong Hyeon attacked Park Min Ho with a weapon...

654
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,710
and got sentenced to five months' imprisonment.

655
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:16,980
What?

656
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,220
But didn't Mr. Park Dong Su say Im Dong Hyeon killed his son?

657
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,720
I don't think Park Min Ho's death was even mentioned in the trial.

658
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:25,790
That's probably...

659
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,160
because of this.

660
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,300
Goodness.

661
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,840
Don't tell me it's because the murder wasn't caught on camera.

662
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,610
No. It's because of the next clip.

663
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,690
Number ten. That's Park Min Ho's jersey.

664
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:02,520
So since Park Min Ho left the dorm perfectly fine after the fight,

665
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,330
they claimed his death had nothing to do with the assault.

666
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,260
Except, I don't think the person in this footage is Park Min Ho.

667
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,770
What makes you so sure?

668
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,840
These are photos of Park Min Ho, right?

669
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:24,080
Everyone has habits they're not even aware of.

670
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,280
Someone who puts their left shoe on first will do it every single time.

671
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,350
Same goes for which shoulder they carry their bag on.

672
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:32,850
Wait.

673
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:36,060
The bag is on his other shoulder. It's left here, but right there.

674
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,899
So was someone else wearing Park Min Ho's clothes...

675
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,400
to trick people?

676
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:46,029
Maybe, but we can't be sure, can we?

677
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,440
We can barely see his face.

678
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,970
Exactly. He could've just lent his clothes to someone.

679
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,140
Even if they had gotten a shot of his face,

680
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,640
it'd be hard to identify him with that video quality.

681
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:58,610
And yet, 15 years ago, they assumed it was Park Min Ho.

682
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,290
Since no one believed Mr. Park Dong Su 15 years ago,

683
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:05,890
let's do the reverse.

684
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,090
What if we trust him completely?

685
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,330
Sounds good.

686
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,690
That's a fantastic idea.

687
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:12,790
Say no more.

688
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,400

00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,830
Of course. I've already found him.

696
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,230
Already?

697
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,830

I don't really have time. But I'll see what I can do.

709
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,090
Eun Seo.

710
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,660
You're here, Mr. Im?

711
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:50,060
Any cash come in?

712
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:53,330
Yes, today was sign-ups for the new K-pop dance class.

713
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:59,270
Looks like a good turnout. You have all the cash ready, right?

714
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,900
Yes, I've got it all right here.

715
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,000
Heading out again?

716
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,009
Yes. If anyone asks, tell them I'm at a funeral.

717
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,110
See you later.

718
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,150
Mr. Im!

719
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,580
Unbelievable.

720
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:16,550
So much here needs to be fixed, but he grabs the cash and leaves.

721
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,350
Driver Kim Do Gi, you have a fare waiting outside.

There's no door handle?

724
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,900
What?

(Deluxe Taxi)

726
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,500
Driver! Let's go, step on it.

727
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,970
Yes, I'm on my way back now.

728
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,180
Don't touch my stuff. Just leave it.

729
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,740
And tell the other guys I'll be there in a minute.

730
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:43,980
Got it?

731
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,350
Darn it, this is so frustrating.

734
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,800
Stop. Pull over right here.

735
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,670
Yes, sir.

736
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,840
(Deluxe Taxi)

737
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:14,580
- That'll be 88 dollars. - What? Why is it so expensive?

738
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,080
It's a deluxe taxi.

739
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,780
Darn it. If only I'd known before hailing it.

740
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,820
Here.

741
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,090
Your change.

742
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,700
This just looks like an ordinary funeral home.

743
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:36,700
So he really came to pay his respects?

744
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,939
Bringing a wad of cash like that...

745
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,870
This can't be a normal funeral home.

746
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:46,680
But why are there so many dusty cars at a funeral home?

747

(to refrain from paying respects.)

751
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,280
- I'm here to pay my respects. - You're in the wrong place.

752
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:39,829
What? But he didn't even say who he was here to see.

753
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:41,930
How could he be in the wrong place? What's going on?

754
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,910
They seem to be guarding the entrance, not the memorial.

755
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,440
Why is the chief mourner at the door instead of staying with the altar?

756
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,180
What a strange funeral home.

757
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:58,910
Should we go and give you a hand?

758
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,080
It's okay.

759
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,320
You've already helped.

(Deluxe Taxi)

761
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,040
Is this thing ever going to get to the top?

762
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,510
Is it even moving?

763
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:34,520
Was it always this slow?

764
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,820
I don't think it's broken, though.

765
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,950
It'd better not be.

766
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:42,289
Driver Kim, just relax for now and listen to music.

767
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:43,630
You'll have a visual soon.

768
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,230
Gyeong Gu, I think it's a little too low.

769
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,929
- It's going to be a tight squeeze. - It can't be.

770
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,640
Go Eun's watching.

771
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,140
Should I tell them to come down? It looks like a tight squeeze.

772
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,560
So it was a gambling den after all.

773
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,390
I fold.

774
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,530
- A hundred dollars? You won fast. - I'll see your 50...

775
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:24,530
- and raise 100. - They decorated with funeral items.

776
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,430
Unbelievable.

777
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:29,300
They sure put a lot of effort into hiding this place.

778
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,370
Even the police wouldn't suspect a thing.

779
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:34,210
Who'd think to put a gambling den inside a funeral home?

780
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,180
So does that mean those cars...

781
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,680
are collateral for gambling debts?

782
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,020
I checked Im Dong Hyeon's finances.

783
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:45,389
Right after he got out of prison,

784
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:47,460
he acquired a studio apartment in his name.

785
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:49,220
A studio apartment?

786
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:53,090
But there's a lien on it now. He borrowed a lot and defaulted.

787
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,339
You're betting 100 chips?

788
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,840
My gosh, are you really betting 100 on this?

789
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:07,010
What kind of hand do you have to be throwing in 100 chips?

790
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,880
I guess Mr. Im here is a rich boy, betting so recklessly.

791
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:14,050
Cut the chitchat. Are you going to fold or not?

792
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,050
You can't "die" at a funeral home, can you?

793
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,690
Call.

794
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:22,790
- A pair of sevens. - I have a pair of nines.

795
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,260
Thank you very much.

796
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:25,990
What?

797
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,600
What if Im Dong Hyeon went to prison...

798
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,830
for the purpose of covering up another truth?

799
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:35,140
- Another truth? - On that day, 15 years ago,

800
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,740
Im Dong Hyeon wasn't in the locker room alone.

801
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:43,080
Then the studio he suddenly acquired could have been his payment.

802
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:44,510
As for that answer,

803
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,920
we'll have to get it from Im Dong Hyeon himself.

804
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,250
I doubt he'll talk easily.

805
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,750
But he will for Park Min Ho.

806
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:54,060
What? Park Min Ho?

807
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,490
Let's see how Im Dong Hyeon reacts to Park Min Ho.

808
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,830
Whether he'll be happy to see him...

809
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,200
or unsettled.

810
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,970
I got my car back, but I've got nothing left. Darn it.

811
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:18,450
What's this?

812
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,750
What is this thing?

813
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,620

(Shed the Fat, Special Discount for Cash Payments)

815
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,140
- Hello, Mr. Im. - Get these ready in advance.

816
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,170
- Let me get that. - No, I've got it.

817
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,280
- Okay. - Sir, you had a phone call earlier.

818
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,350
- About four times. - Who was it?

819
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,250
He said he was a friend of yours. The name was Park Min Ho.

820
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,220
- Who? - Park Min Ho. He spelled it out.

821
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,160
What did he say?

822
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,290
He said he'd call back.

823
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:06,690
Okay, got it.

824
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:20,910
Seong Uk, that jerk never picks up when I call.

825
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:24,450
He only calls when he feels like it. Darn it.

826
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,780
Park Min Ho.

827
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,720
This really ticks me off.

828
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:39,490
There's no way.

829
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,470
Why is it so high? Darn.

830
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,670
Are these jerks messing with me with flyers?

831
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:58,680
But are you okay?

832
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,580
You said you did everything.

833
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,220
Are you really okay?

834
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:03,850
Who on earth is it?

What's our defensive strategy for tomorrow?

847
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:03,440
We'll block their straight shots and cover the cross-court hits.

848

- What about serves? - We'll serve to position two,

849

focusing on quick hits and the left.

850
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,280
- That'll make them easier to mark. - Yes, that should work.

Seong Uk.

852
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,789
- Okay, that's a wrap for today. - Yes, Coach.

00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:13,890
- Good practice. - Yes, good work.

854

What's this? Showing up unannounced?

855
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,300
Is Park Min Ho really dead?

856
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,800
You buried him for good, right?

857

858
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:36,640
What is this, all of a sudden? Why ask me about Park Min Ho?

Hey, you don't get to talk to me like that.

860

You want me to bury you too?

Do you?

867
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,270
Mr. Jang. I think I've found the person...

868
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:34,270
Im Dong Hyeon was with on that day 15 years ago.

869
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:36,000
You found him?

870

01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,920
No matter how hard I try to remember.

886
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:01,120
It's no use.

887
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,560
Dong Su.

888
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,800
I know I couldn't help you back then.

889
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,700
But I think I can now.

890
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,370
Your son, Park Min Ho.

891
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,480
I promise...

892
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,580
I'll find him for you this time.

893
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,060
Thank you.

894
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:45,900
Thank you so much.

895
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,750
(Taxi Driver 3)

896
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,680
So, what Dong Su found out...

897
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,720
was this.

898
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:39,290
Mr. Park is in danger.

899
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,690
Are you sure he's dead?

900
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,060
- You think you can do it? - Dong Su!

901
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:46,630
Help!

902
01:03:46,631 --> 01:03:49,030
Dong Su. You've done enough.

903
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,830
I'll take it from here.

904
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:52,270
How about we start with some treatment?

905
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:54,470
Financial therapy.

906
01:03:56,100 --> 01:04:00,040
So what matters more than gambling must be a secret you don't want out.

907
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,380
I found him.

908
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,050
Park Min Ho.
