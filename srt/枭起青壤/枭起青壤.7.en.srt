1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:25,700
The Festival of the Aps using a

2
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,700
Thousands of people are scattered in the south, the four of them are dead

3
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,700
The people are all dead, the four of them are dead

4
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,700
The seven of them are dead, the six of them are dead

5
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,700
The four of them are dead, the four of them are dead

6
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,700
The five of them are dead, the five of them are dead

7
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,700
The three of them are dead, the three of them are dead

8
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:36,700
The three of them are dead, the three of them are dead

9
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:45,700
They are all dead

10
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,700
I understand

11
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,700
You understand business

12
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,060
Who lies here must die!

13
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,020
I...

14
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,900
You're a person who creates tys Incredible people

15
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Torture

16
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,940
Come on, this is arrogance

17
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,900
Brother.

18
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,020
Long Bao.

19
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,700
You...

20
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,340
Why are you here?

21
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,340
Who did you follow?

22
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
I'm here.

23
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,060
Hello?

24
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,460
Are you okay?

25
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,260
I'm fine.

26
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,860
The spring has been restored.

27
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,380
We're fine.

28
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,580
We're going to the old place to fix it.

29
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,060
What about the basement?

30
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,740
It's comfortable.

31
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,180
I'll explain to you.

32
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,340
He ran away.

33
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,540
Stay safe.

34
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,700
I can't save you if God doesn't give me the fire.

35
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
What do you mean?

36
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
You were hurt by the earth fire.

37
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
You must use the natural fire to heal your wound.

38
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,700
Otherwise, it will continue to deteriorate.

39
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
When the red thread is tied,

40
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,700
you will be saved.

41
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,700
The fire?

42
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Don't ask so much.

43
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
I'll just treat your wound.

44
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,700
It's up to you to make a fortune.

45
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,700
I can't solve the problem this time.

46
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
Don't talk nonsense.

47
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Bear with it.

48
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:15,700
However much you let Liu Die down,

49
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,700
young master.

50
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,180
Xiao Gua, where is Xin Xin?

51
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,020
Where is Xin Xin?

52
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,100
Xin Xin!

53
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,820
Xin Xin!

54
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,460
Xin Xin!

55
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,580
Where is Xin Xin?

56
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,620
sleeve

57
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,400
om

58
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,280
Xin Xin!

59
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,620
What problems I'm facing...

60
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,820
Where are we going?

61
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,680
Mt. confronting the waves.

62
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,220
The highest peak in the western意思 is it,

63
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,980
Brittania will no longer be affected.

64
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,380
Tell passersby

65
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,900
to stay away from aland Ron Chang

66
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,540
and Venom Pond.

67
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,900
Keep them DCUase without arching at me.

68
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,200
If I'm not equipped

69
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,740
to shift gap between them,

70
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,080
I'll set a new trap

71
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,060
and their hearts wings will start to Director Norman's condition.

72
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,100
Juneron,

73
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,500
what mystery are you trying to get?

74
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,140
You can explain it to me.

75
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,260
of word which will be deeply learnt by you.

76
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,300
Just go to the altar

77
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,180
if you need their oùdance.

78
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,100
Round 1

79
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,300
The one who left

80
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,420
I had a hand in the military field and the hospital

81
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,820
I can be sure today

82
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,340
He has a reaction to the whip

83
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,220
But the human form of the underground

84
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,820
I don't know how many more

85
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,340
Not only does it pretend to be human form

86
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,020
I don't even smell like it

87
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,780
But before

88
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,340
The one sent by the wind

89
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,100
The taste of the body is very strong

90
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,020
I can't smell it

91
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,020
Maybe there is some kind of cover

92
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,700
I'm a little confused

93
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,260
My dad didn't tell me about this

94
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,860
What the hell is going on

95
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,900
Don't say anything else

96
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,940
That underground

97
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,420
I'm not talking about human form

98
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,820
Where did the real underground come from?

99
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,060
I should be here to find me

100
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,060
Find you

101
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,100
He was locked in the base for a while

102
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,180
Let me recite it

103
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,300
You put the underground in the base

104
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,220
I want to study it

105
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,380
Convince him

106
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,020
To do us a favor

107
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,940
Xunshui

108
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,620
How long have you been doing this?

109
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,300
Such a big thing

110
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,060
You recite it and decide it yourself

111
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,980
Yes, the hunter of the South Mountain has a underground

112
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,140
Yes, yes

113
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,340
That underground

114
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,700
We caught Xunshui 20 years ago

115
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,180
Leave it to Xingshui

116
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,220
It was the decision of all the hunters of the South Mountain at that time

117
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,580
But dad and sister-in-law

118
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,220
All know

119
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,260
The four undergrounds are very risky

120
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,700
But there is no other way

121
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,060
It's not the time to fight

122
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,700
They can catch up at any time

123
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,420
Not badly injured

124
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,300
Be careful

125
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,700
I promise to go back to the base alive

126
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,540
Discuss this matter again

127
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,860
No

128
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,620
The new standard of health in this period,

129
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,940
choose Hushu Bao.

130
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,420
Hushu Bao invites you to continue to be wonderful.

131
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,940
The fits usually back with you as you consume numerical values.

132
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,460
Wu Zi!

133
00:15:59,220 --> 00:15:59,860
So confused.

134
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,940
Let's turn back and let the motorelectronic power racing begin.

135
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,780
Sh aud credentials, please check the Ge Atl apprentices' accounts.

136
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,660
As a proof,

137
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,380
Best management of headquarters,

138
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,100
enlist remaining search engines company,

139
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,180
bullshit,

140
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,740
Commode blazing.

141
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,860
From the beginning of the ship,

142
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,800
We came to play a game of

143
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,140
Old advantages.

144
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,300
Open numerous doors of gambling.

145
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,860
Apply on the people we despaired before.

146
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,660
Hey tired.

147
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,500
Tired,

148
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,500
It's temporarily set up in the cave in the west slope.

149
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,500
If I can't convince everyone,

150
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,500
I can strengthen the cave

151
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
so that it won't return to the base.

152
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,500
You think it's good to be a prefect?

153
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,500
So you let it participate in the operation without permission?

154
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
No.

155
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,500
It came out on its own.

156
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,500
It seems like

157
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,500
you can feel that I'm in danger.

158
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Jia Shu,

159
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,500
I'm responsible for this situation.

160
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,500
I obey everyone's decision.

161
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Nan Ran and Di Xiao have been enemies for generations.

162
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,500
I will try to explain to everyone

163
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,500
how to deal with this.

164
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,500
The worst result

165
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
is to make A'luo

166
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,500
feel happy.

167
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,500
They're here.

168
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,500
You haven't come back yet.

169
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Take the car and leave some people to carry it.

170
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
No.

171
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
If we leave together,

172
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
your current speed will be caught up.

173
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Someone has to drag them.

174
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Jia Shu, I'm not discussing the deployment task with you.

175
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
I'm not going to let you go.

176
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
I'm not going to let you go.

177
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,500
I'm not going to let you go.

178
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Nan Ran, I'll leave it to you.

179
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Don't let me down.

180
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Hurry up.

181
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Where are they?

182
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Where are they?

183
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,500
They went home to rest.

184
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,500
They can't use so many people against you.

185
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Really?

186
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Those four at the door?

187
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,500
They look like paper tigers.

188
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,500
A'luo, slow down.

189
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Let's see if I'm a paper tiger

190
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
or an iron tiger.

191
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,500
I think you're a leader.

192
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,500
That's right.

193
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,500
You're wrong.

194
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,500
But I don't think you're a leader.

195
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,500
You've been working hard on your way here.

196
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,500
You might be able to hand over the task

197
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,500
when you get back.

198
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Take them away.

199
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,500
I'll go.

200
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Hello, Lin Jin.

201
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
How is it?

202
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Really?

203
00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:12,200
An

204
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Our

205
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Because

206
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
It's not serious.

207
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,060
It's just that the infection will make you feel uncomfortable.

208
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,980
Try to stay awake.

209
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,380
When you're done with the test,

210
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,580
you'll recover soon.

211
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,140
equalsSeven days ago

212
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,780
The sun's really out.

213
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,020
You're lucky.

214
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,080
Qian Feng,

215
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,320
hold on.

216
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:14,960
I let goes

217
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,520
this time.

218
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
I'll count to three.

219
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
One.

220
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,500
I'm hurt.

221
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,700
Er Shuang.

222
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,500
If you keep being reckless, you'll be dead.

223
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,500
Come on.

224
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,500
We're not friends.

225
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,500
We're not comrades who face difficulties together.

226
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,300
You're just like Sun Zhou.

227
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,500
You're innocent and you were hurt by the earth.

228
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,100
I saved you because I'm a nephew of the Lian Yan of South Hills.

229
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,700
It doesn't mean I'm not grateful to you.

230
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,100
I'm just a man.

231
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,700
How can I let you...

232
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Sun Youclock

233
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
Where are my people?

234
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,500
are treated as you are.

235
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
It's safe.

236
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,500
At least, for now.

237
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
No matter what position you're in,

238
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
what you want,

239
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,500
you should be polite and respect each other.

240
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
I think

241
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
we did

242
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
much better than you.

243
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
You?

244
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
We?

245
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Our relationship

246
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
is very likely.

247
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,500
Hunter and hunter-hunter

248
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,500
are the most shallow.

249
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
We've accumulated

250
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,500
the enemies of a thousand years of grudges.

251
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
We're enemies of the world.

252
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,500
We're enemies of the world.

253
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,500
We're enemies of the world.

254
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
We hate each other.

255
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
We're enemies of each other.

256
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
We don't like each other.

257
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,500
We don't like each other.

258
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
We don't like each other.

259
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
I think

260
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
we all have a chance.

261
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Can I know

262
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
who I'm talking to

263
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
and what I should

264
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
talk about?

265
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,500
It's not a long life.

266
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,500
But it's not a good luck.

267
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,500
We've seen

268
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
the Golden Gate 20 years ago.

269
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,500
You're the one who stole the Golden Gate.

270
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,500
How can I lose my father's leg?

271
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
Remember it.

272
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Go.

273
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
Go.

274
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
Go.

275
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Go.

276
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
How many more

277
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
are there like you?

278
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
I believe there are

279
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
as many as the number of

280
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
underground hunter-hunter in the world.

281
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
How did you

282
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,500
become like this?

283
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
I'm sorry.

284
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
I'm sorry.

285
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
I'm sorry.

286
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,500
I'm sorry.

287
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
Are you more used to

288
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
what we used to be?

289
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Like the little

290
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
goldfish you caught.

291
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
He was the one

292
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
in the forest yesterday.

293
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
The thief who escaped

294
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
was you.

295
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
It was you.

296
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
I'm sorry.

297
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
I'm sorry.

298
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
I'm sorry.

299
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
I'm sorry.

300
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
I'm sorry.

301
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
I'm sorry.

302
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
I'm sorry.

303
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
I'm sorry.

304
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
I'm sorry.

305
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
I'm sorry.

306
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
I'm sorry.

307
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
I'm sorry.

308
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
I'm sorry.

309
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
I'm sorry.

310
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
I'm sorry.

311
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
I'm sorry.

312
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
I'm sorry.

313
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
I'm sorry.

314
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
I'm sorry.

315
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
I'm sorry.

316
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
I'm sorry.

317
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
I'm sorry.

318
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
I'm sorry.

319
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
So

320
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
you were born with fire and sunshine.

321
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
This is the power from nature.

322
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,500
What's the matter?

323
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,460
Doctor Nie is a good doctor.

324
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,460
He's a good doctor.

325
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,860
If you're fine,

326
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,860
go and pack up and go down the mountain.

327
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,140
You're here.

328
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,980
Eat something and then leave.

329
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,980
What should I eat?

330
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
There's something good.

331
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,540
Wait here.

332
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,540
I'll go get it.

333
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
The business with the client

334
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,500
is not popular anymore.

335
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,500
We're hiring a high-ranking officer

336
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
to go to the general meeting.

337
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
We're also hiring clients to eat big fish and meat.

338
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Hold on.

339
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
We're doing this for camping,

340
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,500
riding,

341
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
and fishing.

342
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,500
So,

343
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
I'll keep these equipment

344
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
in the car all year long.

345
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
I'll go and get it.

346
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
I'll go and get it.

347
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
I'll go and get it.

348
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,500
I'll go and get it.

349
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,500
How long have you been putting

350
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,500
the instant noodles in the bag?

351
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Don't worry.

352
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
It won't go bad.

353
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Thank you.

354
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
It's only me.

355
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Your life

356
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
is only a bag of instant noodles?

357
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
It depends on whether

358
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Miss Nie gives me face

359
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
or not.

360
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
I'll have a chance to thank you in the future.

361
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
If I don't have a chance,

362
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
this is the most precious gift

363
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
I can get at the moment.

364
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,500
I remember when I was little,

365
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
my mom used to make instant noodles

366
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,500
for my sister and me.

367
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
She used to make this Western-style instant noodles.

368
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
It's hard to get now.

369
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
You can't eat it

370
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
whenever you want to.

371
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
You have a sister?

372
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Mom.

373
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
She's long gone.

374
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
She's gone.

375
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,500
It's also about Lin Xi Rou.

376
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
The sun is out.

377
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
The other injured people are also saved.

378
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,500
Your wound

379
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
shouldn't be able to get root.

380
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,500
But the anti-inflammatory medicine

381
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
and the wind are strong.

382
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
You should eat what you should eat.

383
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
You'd better not go to the hospital.

384
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
I guess you don't want to

385
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
leave any evidence, right?

386
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
I understand.

387
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,500
I have a doctor friend.

388
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
He can help me out.

389
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Good.

390
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Is it a heart attack?

391
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,500
No problem.

392
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
The noodles are good.

393
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Thank you.

394
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,500
You're welcome.

395
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,500
You're welcome.

396
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,500
I have a question.

397
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

398
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Go ahead.

399
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Why do you have to

400
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,500
hang me up here?

401
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:29,840

406

Sure

Duck

408
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,640
The spring text services the heart

409
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,600
Spring regularly

Peace and happiness

414
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,880
Clouds, ducks, water

415
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,760
These three elements

416
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,400
I...

417
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,800
I...

418
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,480
I'm so stupid.

419
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,000
You're not good at pretending again.

420
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,320
I told you.

421
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,080
You're a positive person.

422
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,560
Will a grown-up man

423
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,800
buy a hairpin for himself?

424
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,560
My sister.

425
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,000
I've liked

426
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,240
a lot of PR since I was a kid.

427
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,680
When I saw a live duck,

428
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,920
I was so happy.

429
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,000
So every time I saw a duck,

430
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,320
I would think of it.

431
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,800
The image of a silver duck

432
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,280
is beautiful and restrained.

433
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,880
It makes me think of myself.

434
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,800
So when I saw this hairpin,

435
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,080
I was so happy.

436
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,880
I remember

437
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,760
that it was a father-son thing

438
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,440
to not royally accept it because it was too expensive.

439
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,480
Did she always believe you?

440
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,560
I'll find her.

441
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
I'll give this to him.

442
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
He'll like it.

443
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,880
I'll be his new man.

444
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
The only man in the world.

445
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,880
I'll be your man.

446
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Say it again.

447
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
I'll record it.

448
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
Drive carefully.

449
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,880
I'll be your man.

450
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,880
The wound I've been through

451
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,880
will show hope after this.

452
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,880
The fire in the world

453
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,880
burns my skin.

In four mountains,

455
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,880
the truth is buried.

I can't be with you.

burns my heart.
