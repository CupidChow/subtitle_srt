1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
determination

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,820
teaches

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:18,640
living

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,720
cosas

5
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,720
The blue and the green moon are on its way

6
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:44,720
The blue and the green moon are on its way

7
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,720
The blue and the green moon are on its way

8
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:29,720
I'm going to help you with such a big favor

9
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,720
Just take this to break me up, right?

10
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
Blue Hunter's magic weapon

11
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Only I have this

12
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
Ordinary weapons are very difficult to deal with underground

13
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
It causes real damage

14
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,720
But it has a strange effect

15
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,720
That is to say, it's like dealing with the vampire

16
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
The plan

17
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
You can understand it like that

18
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
But the principle is different

19
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
This design is to hide

20
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
But you must remember

21
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
It's not a weapon

22
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,720
It's a tool that helps you sneak in at an important moment

23
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Can't take the initiative to attack

24
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,720
And Jiang Baichun recognized him

25
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
This

26
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
Du Jia

27
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,720
You gave me such an important thing

28
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
Can I ask you first?

29
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Who is this Jiang Baichun?

30
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
He is the leader of the Blue Mountain

31
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
I grew up with him

32
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Understand

33
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
As the teacher as the father

34
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
It's not too late

35
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Hurry up and fulfill your promise

36
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
You completely withdraw the plan of the Blue Mountain Hunter

37
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
Do you want to postpone it?

38
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Retreat and self-pity

39
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
It's not that easy to do it at will

40
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
I have been training in the high-ranking level for a lifetime

41
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
I may not be able to ask for it

42
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
OK

43
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,720
I won't talk about it later

44
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Eat breakfast first

45
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
You learn

46
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
I'll buy it

47
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Boss, two

48
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Thank you

49
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
OK

50
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Boss

51
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
What do you want to eat?

52
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
What do you have?

53
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
You can see it yourself

54
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
OK, then two

55
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
OK, wait a moment

56
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
OK

57
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Let's go

58
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Breakfast

59
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
How long have you been standing outside?

60
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
Not long

61
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
I'm hot

62
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Thank you

63
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
But I have no appetite

64
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
You didn't sleep all night

65
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
OK

66
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Don't eat and don't sleep

67
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
You guys are hardworking

68
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
It's time to resist and digest

69
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Don't eat and don't sleep

70
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
I should have let the professor be taken away

71
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Tell me

72
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
What do you need me for?

73
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Youshan Group

74
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
It's really too influential in the whole West

75
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Even if we have all the evidence

76
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Even the flesh and blood can be used to delay time by their own connections and their investment

77
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Not to mention that the chapter is still in their hands

78
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,720
It's only going to harm them if they rush to clean up

79
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
When I first saw Lin Xiruo when I was a kid

80
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
She looked like this

81
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
There has been no change in so many years

82
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
There is no change

83
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
The underground life is very long

84
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
So what she lacks most is time

85
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Do anything

86
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Be very careful and patient

87
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Roshan has experienced several big storms in the business world

88
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
But no matter who the opponent is

89
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
She can hold her breath

90
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
I'm against it

91
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Of course

92
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
She and we are short-lived

93
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
The most important thing is time

94
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,720
We are the most likely to see the flaws of our own hands and feet

95
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
So don't be hasty

96
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
The situation is important

97
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
But you can't do nothing wrong

98
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
Like?

99
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Let her hurt

100
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Let her hurt

101
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Let her hurt

102
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
Let her hurt

103
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Let her hurt

104
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Just put the box in the refrigerator

105
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
The rest is waiting for the car behind

106
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Hurry up, don't touch the road

107
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
OK, brother Zheng

108
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
That thing

109
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Brother Zheng, can I ask for leave for two days after this?

110
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
At this time?

111
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Brother, my mother is hospitalized

112
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
She needs surgery

113
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
I have to go back and have a look

114
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Don't run away this time

115
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Leave now

116
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Family is important

117
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
No need, brother Zheng

118
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
I'm not so anxious

119
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
My mother has to observe again

120
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Maybe she doesn't need surgery

121
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Are you sure?

122
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
Don't force yourself

123
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
I won't force myself

124
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,720
I won't force myself, brother Zheng

125
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
I'll go first, brother Zheng

126
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Go away

127
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
There's something here

128
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
I'll leave it here

129
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Don't miss me

130
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
I'm leaving

131
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
No

132
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
Bye

133
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
We go to the west warehouse this time

134
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,720
Is this camping or a village?

135
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Love to eat

136
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Shut up if you don't eat

137
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,720
If there is a woman who is so good to me

138
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
I can't bear to leave

139
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Sister Sizi

140
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
You said Linlin's boss is not small

141
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
I can't send it every time

142
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Let you send it to me in person

143
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,720
Sister Lin asked me to say something

144
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,720
Ask you where you went in the morning

145
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Did Lin Yi ask?

146
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,720
I was going to send it to you in person

147
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
But you went out in a hurry

148
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
I didn't see you

149
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
I'm sorry

150
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
I'm sorry

151
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
I'm sorry

152
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
I'm sorry

153
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
I'm sorry

154
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
I'm sorry

155
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
I'm sorry

156
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
I'm sorry

157
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
I'm sorry

158
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
I'm sorry

159
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
If you don't go to the company when you go out

160
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,720
Let me come and see

161
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
OK, I'll call Lin Yi later

162
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Sister Lin asked you to tell me directly

163
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
I'll go back and tell her

164
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
I just had breakfast

165
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Breakfast

166
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
I can't sleep in the middle of the night

167
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Ask me to brush my phone

168
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Guess what I brushed

169
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
When I was a kid

170
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Lin Yi always took us to eat that fried chicken

171
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Do you remember?

172
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
The one behind the school

173
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Yes, the more I think, the more I get tired

174
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
The more I get tired, I can't sleep

175
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
Dry lights are on until dawn

176
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
I didn't wash my face in the morning

177
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
I went straight back

178
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,720
Bought a lot

179
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
As a result

180
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
I didn't eat two bites and I was left with it

181
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Look, I still put it on the table

182
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
This is to say to eat

183
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
It must be the snacks Lin Lin gave me

184
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Delicious and healthy

185
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
You said we ate that oil when we were kids

186
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,720
It's not a matter of how many nights it is, right?

187
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
I have to go back to the dorm

188
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
See you, Sister Si

189
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
People

190
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
When they grow up

191
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,720
They can't eat the taste of childhood

192
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
Went to see that assistant again

193
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
What's the progress?

194
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
There is only bad news

195
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Lin Yi took their people away

196
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Wanted to let him continue to help us

197
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
This time I have to help him too

198
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
I also have a bad news

199
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,720
What is this?

200
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,720
We saw the funeral before

201
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
Those who have not been silenced

202
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Human form地消

203
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Are all going to the West Hall

204
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
There is a big action

205
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
You send me the photo

206
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
Then delete it

207
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Delete it all

208
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
Including our chat records

209
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Is it that serious?

210
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Didn't you see how Sister Si was beating the ground?

211
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
You just let her go

212
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,720
It's very dangerous under Lin Yi's eyes

213
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Absolutely can't be found

214
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Understand?

215
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
You said they came together

216
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Is it for you just mentioned that

217
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
The person who was caught by Lin Yi?

218
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
Send it to you

219
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
What is this?

220
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
There are a group of human form地消

221
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
At the same time, they want to come to the West Hall

222
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Others are all doing their job

223
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
Black bear unites the world

224
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
There is no chance at all

225
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Two of them are close to him

226
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
So drive away

227
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,720
They will stop at the right hotel on the way

228
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
I sent you the specific information

229
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Come come come

230
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
I sent you the specific information

231
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
I sent you the specific information

232
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
I sent you the specific information

233
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
I sent you the specific information

234
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
I sent you the specific information

235
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Coming coming

236
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
Old yard

237
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Thank you boss

238
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Not bad

239
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
What do you mean?

240
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Let's start from the two of them

241
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Eat

242
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
The more it is, the more you can't go back to the appetite

243
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
You sent these very useful

244
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
I have to see how I can use it

245
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
Girl

246
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Bring your boyfriend so many times

247
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Why don't you order our signature dessert?

248
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Give you a gift

249
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Wish you sweet

250
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Ok

251
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Hello

252
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Hello

253
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
I have a way

254
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Maybe I can save Jiang Shu

255
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
You say

256
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
There is a group of people

257
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
There is a group of people

258
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
On the way to the west

259
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Catch them

260
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Will contact to exchange hostage

261
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Will contact to exchange hostage

262
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Where did the news come from?

263
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
You don't believe me

264
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Even if it's really caught

265
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Are you sure he will change?

266
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
When they all arrive at the building

267
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,720
There will be no chance

268
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
How to arrange

269
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
I will follow up

270
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
You go to their destination

271
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
I will send you to the position later

272
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Follow up

273
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
Don't drive your own car

274
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
I know

275
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
I did it, Yu Yang

276
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
You

277
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
You

278
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
You

279
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
You

280
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
You

281
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
Hello everyone

282
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
It's moving

283
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
It's moving

284
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
It's moving

285
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,720
It's moving

286
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
It's moving

287
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
It's moving

288
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
Before

289
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
Before

290
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Have this happened

291
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Don't you see

292
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
This time

293
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
So eager to go to the west

294
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
So many people went

295
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Don't know

296
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
Go to the front

297
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Go up one foot

298
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Go up one foot

299
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
Can't be late

300
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Can't be late

301
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,720
Can't listen to music

302
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
Can't listen to music

303
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
Can't listen to music

304
00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:00,720
You say this Nanshan

305
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
The dog house

306
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
People smell us

307
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Our service to Lin

308
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Turned us into human

309
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
No smell

310
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:23,720
If I can't hold it in

311
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
You have a rabbit

312
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
You say this dog house

313
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,720
How far can it smell me

314
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Look at you

315
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Talk to you

316
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
You can't hear

317
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Like joking with you

318
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
You have to keep it in mind

319
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Go

320
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Let's go

321
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
What are you waiting for

322
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Can't be late

323
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
The truck

324
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Followed all the way

325
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Now in the service area

326
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
There is still a distance

327
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
But they have noticed me

328
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
I'll give you a call

329
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
No need

330
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Just ambush in the hotel

331
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
If they are half way

332
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
That's not good

333
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
If you get it in the hotel

334
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,720
It's more troublesome

335
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
If they dare to be honest

336
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
It's good to be half way

337
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Half way

338
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Don't be impulsive

339
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Okay, don't worry

340
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
I drive very slowly

341
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Wait for me to go down the high speed

342
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
It's not too late to cook

343
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
See you tonight

344
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Go

345
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Go

346
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
Nonsense

347
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
Don't talk nonsense

348
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Nonsense

349
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
Really keep up

350
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
Keep calm

351
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
Isn't that a woman

352
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
Stop her and ask clearly

353
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Maybe there are other people who are wrong

354
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Find a quiet place first

355
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
Go

356
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
OK

357
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Take all the stuff

358
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Go

359
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
Go

360
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
I'm sorry

361
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
I'm sorry

362
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
I'm sorry

363
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Go

364
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
Why haven't they come yet

365
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,440
What time is it?

366
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,040
Seven o'clock.

367
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,840
Sorry,

368
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,480

370

Tell me when you're done.

375
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,280
I'll call you back when I get there.

376
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
I'll call you back when I get there.

377

390
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720

is not available at the moment.

392
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
The subscriber you dialed

393
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
is not available at the moment.

394
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
Come on.

395

Help!

396
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,720
Joyt Ηen is Arab in Thought on being Th怎么样.

397
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,000
So how could he be afraid of her?

398
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,480
It's useless trouble.

399
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,560
Let's return to their country.

400
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
Are you mad now?

401
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,080
I must...

402
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,120
Don't be others' parents.

403
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,680
Let's return to their country.

404
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,680
You are...

405
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,680
Han Gui.

406
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,680
Han Gui!

407
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,680
Who are you?

408
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,680
Who sent you here?

409
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
Han Gui!

410
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
Stop shouting.

411
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,680
He can't hear anymore.

412
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,680
You are not a human.

413
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,680
You are...

414
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,680
Han Gui!

415
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
Ye Jiu Luo!

416
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,680
Ye Jiu Luo!

417
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,680
Ye Jiu Luo, what's wrong?

418
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,680
Are you okay?

419
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,680
Ye Jiu Luo.

420
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,680
Sir, stop!

421
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,680
Ye Jiu Luo.

422
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,680
Ye Jiu Luo.

423
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,680
Ye Jiu Luo, don't sleep. Wake up.

424
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,680
Don't sleep.

425
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,680
Han Luo.

426
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,680
Han Luo.

427
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Han Luo.

428
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,680
Wake up.

429
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,680
We are almost there.

430
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,680
Mom.

431
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,680
We can't eat anymore.

432
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,680
Didn't I promise you

433
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,680
to take you to the boat?

434
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,680
Don't forget to sleep.

435
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,680
Dad.

436
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,680
Dad.

437
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,680
Dad.

438
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,680
Next time,

439
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,680
how about I take you to my small canteen?

440
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,680
The canteen that Yan Zong Ting was in

441
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,680
was a high-class meal?

442
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,680
That's a good point.

443
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,680
I don't think it's high-class.

444
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,680
The roasted duck feet with the roasted goose is delicious.

445
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,680
The roasted osmanthus cake with the stinky cheese is delicious.

446
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,680
But I want to take you to that place.

447
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,680
You will definitely like it.

448
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,680
I'm not going to eat it.

449
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,680
I'm going to eat it.

450
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,680
I'm going to eat it.

451
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,680
I'm going to eat it.

452
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,680
You will definitely like it.

453
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,680
How do you know

454
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,680
what I like?

455
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,680
Then

456
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,680
I'll try it.

457
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,680
Okay.

458
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,680
I'll wait for you to ask me out.

459
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,680
Here.

460
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
Have a bite.

461
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,680
I'm not going to eat it.

462
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,680
I'm going to eat it.

463
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,680
I'm going to eat it.

464
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,680
I'm going to eat it.

465
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,680
I'm going to eat it.

466
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,680
I'm going to eat it.

467
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,680
I'm going to eat it.

468
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,680
I'm going to eat it.

469
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,680
I'm going to eat it.

470
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,680
I'm going to eat it.

471
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,680
I'm going to eat it.

472
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,680
I'm going to eat it.

473
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,680
I'm going to eat it.

474
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,680
I'm going to eat it.

475
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,680
Just wait.

476
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,680
Bye.

477
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,680
I'm going to eat it.

478
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,680
I'm going to eat it.

479
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,680
I'm touching it.

480
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,680
I'm just taking it out.

481
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
It's not good.

482
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,680
It's bad.

483
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,680
Too much iceきた

484
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,680
Yu Didn't say it.

485
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,680
Is not the taste of ice.

486
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,680
I will be the star of the sky, and the moon will be the sun

487
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,680
The fire in the sky is burning, burning

488
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,680
The sun is burning, burning

489
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,680
The sun is burning, burning

490
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,680
The sun is burning, burning

491
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,680
The sun is burning, burning

492
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,680
The sun is burning, burning

493
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,680

494
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,680

495
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,680

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,680
The sun is burning, burning

498
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,680
The fire in the sky is burning, burning

499
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,680
Let's recall and look fondly for

500
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,680
Where the crow flies

501
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,680
Sparrows sagen

502
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,680
We'll meet and beautiful yo-oh

503
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,680
When you're drunk she doesn't rest
