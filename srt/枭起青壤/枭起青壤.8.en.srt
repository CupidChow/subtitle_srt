18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Then,

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we'll see each other again.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We won't see each other again.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you want to thank me for saving your life,

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
you can promise me two things.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Say it.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In the future,

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
no matter what people ask about these days,

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
don't mention me.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I won't have any relationship with Nanshan Traitor

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and Ding Xiao anymore.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What about the other?

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Nanshan Traitor chose a difficult path,

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
but it's the right one.

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Although I don't have a position to say that,

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I still hope that you can continue to cooperate with them.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Because you can take this opportunity

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
to avenge your mother

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and find your sister's whereabouts.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If you agree,

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I can help you contact them.

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll go.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You are not

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
a person who can't be taken in.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I've known you for so long.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is the highest evaluation I've ever heard.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Miss Li.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Why are you back so late?

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What do you want to eat?

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Anything you want.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'll get it for you.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No, no, no.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

126
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm so sorry.

127
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
See durian......

128
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
See durian......

129
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I有您我

I have you in my mode......

132
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I have you in my mode...

133
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I have you...

134
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I am just OK with sergeant ruthless

135
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,440
You heard what I heard the

136
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,000
I am just OK with sergeant reckless

137
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I agree

138
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,720
Then let's do this normal together

139
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,920
Mrs. Ye, you can have a rest

140
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,680
I am going to make some soup

141
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,560
I'll help you

142
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,920
you don't need to stand behind the words

143
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
It's ok, I am free anyway

144
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
You promised to help your mom

145
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,680
You are now in the box

146
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,060
Lu, this is your last

147
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,700
I know

148
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,700
This is the last one.

149
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,700
Don't waste the food.

150
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,700
Look how clever our daughter is.

151
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,700
Just praise me.

152
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
The noodles are not enough.

153
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,700
I'll see what you do.

154
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,700
What's wrong?

155
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
Then the rest of the days, we will

156
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
wipe the bowls.

157
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Then you can

158
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,700
cry.

159
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,700
I like it.

160
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,700
Chenchen,

161
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,700
what happy thing came to mind?

162
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
Nothing.

163
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,700
I just think

164
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,700
it's good.

165
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,700
Good is good.

166
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,700
Then you don't

167
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,700
go outside for three days.

168
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
Go home more.

169
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
It's better to be at home.

170
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,700
You!

171
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,700
I didn't let you in.

172
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,700
I'm not going to let you in.

173
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
I'm not going to let you in.

174
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,700
I'm not going to let you in.

175
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,700
I'm not going to let you in.

176
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,700
I didn't let you in.

177
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,700
Miss Nie.

178
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
It's okay, Miss Nie.

179
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,700
She's my friend.

180
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,700
You can go back to work.

181
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Okay.

182
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,700
Uncle Jiang is in trouble.

183
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,700
You don't even need to

184
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,700
apply the ointment.

185
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
You can come and change the medicine in three days.

186
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,700
Okay.

187
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
No, that's

188
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,700
already a disease.

189
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
You don't have to bother him.

190
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,700
Change it quickly.

191
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700
Put on a chest.

192
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,700
Okay.

193
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,700
Okay.

194
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
Okay.

195
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
I'm sorry.

196
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,700
I'm sorry.

197
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,700
I'm sorry.

198
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
I'm sorry.

199
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,700
I'm sorry.

200
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,700
I'm sorry.

201
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
I'm sorry.

202
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
I'm sorry.

203
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,700
I'm sorry.

204
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,700
I'm sorry.

205
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,700
I'm sorry.

206
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,700
I'm sorry.

207
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
I'm sorry.

208
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,700
I'm sorry.

209
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,700
I'm sorry.

210
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
What does this mean?

211
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,700
What did she drag?

212
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,700
I don't know.

213
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,700
Let's try it.

214
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
You're a Tweety in the second room upstairs.

215
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,700
It looks like you're a new lady.

216
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,700
What is this?

217
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,700
There's a lack of Dragon King and Bo Yi bed.

218
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,320
and hide in the West Warehouse

219
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,560
I came here

220
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,780
to find a Chinese-Western combination

221
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,460
to be in the same place

222
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,960
No matter you have a injury

223
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,980
or a disease

224
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,740
you can find a place to stay here

225
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,880
What about Xiong Hei?

226
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,080
What's their place?

227
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,380
They run business

228
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,380
They come and go

229
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,840
They have a small business

230
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
It's normal

231
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,500
It seems that

232
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,140
Lin Yi usually supports you to open a store

233
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,840
not all for charity

234
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,340
You are using it for your own good

235
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,300
You are not a kind person

236
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,900
What?

237
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,700
You are not a friend

238
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,700
and you are going to expose me?

239
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,700
Now you know I am one of you

240
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,700
You should have stopped me

241
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,700
I am fine

242
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,200
It's okay

243
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,700
It's been so many years

244
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,200
Why are you so distant?

245
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Fine

246
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,700
You really treat me as one of you

247
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
Let me see

248
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,700
Come on

249
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
I am afraid that I will fall down

250
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Yes, it seems that I won't fall down

251
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Don't ask too much

252
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Just find me a place to stay

253
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
This is what you call falling down

254
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Do you know it?

255
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Come on

256
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Please

257
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Come on

258
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Please

259
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Come on

260
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Why did you let Uncle Jiang stay here?

261
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
The situation was urgent

262
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Uncle Jiang insisted

263
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
I didn't stay

264
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
You can insist

265
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
I am sorry

266
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
I was the one who considered it

267
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Uncle

268
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
I am sorry

269
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,200
If I stay and wait

270
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
and I am the one who was fired

271
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Would you be like this now?

272
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Uncle Jiang?

273
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Xiao Qi, Qing Lang

274
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
The first issue of the whole web

275
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Watch the first episode of the first episode first

276
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Take a screenshot of the right corner

277
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
The first issue of the first episode first

278
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Old monitor

279
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
The ancient tree tea

280
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Ping Ling

281
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
You know it too

282
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
The tea culture has been around for thousands of years

283
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
We are new to it

284
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
We dare not to say it

285
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
You are quite good

286
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
For the world

287
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
it is just a momentary history

288
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
You really dare to think you are the master of everything

289
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
The arrogance cannot be

290
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
made by human beings to today

291
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Most of us

292
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
are exposed to

293
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
curiosity

294
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
and constant correction of mistakes

295
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
We are also lucky

296
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
to get the results today

297
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
If you are like this

298
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
learning from each other

299
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
I am afraid you have to go a lot of ways

300
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
The hunter in South Mountain

301
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
What does the hunter in South Mountain

302
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
rely on now?

303
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
To defeat the enemy

304
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
or to break the bond

305
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
or to break the bond

306
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Back then

307
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
the three families of the three swordsmen and the three swordsmen

308
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
cooperated together

309
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
But this time

310
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
they only have the power of the wild dog

311
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
to fight with us

312
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I don't know when

313
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
I can see the beauty of the border

314
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
and the sword family

315
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
You are feeling regretful

316
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
I think

317
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
you should be glad

318
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
If you see the ghost border

319
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
the wild dog

320
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
and the sword family at the same time

321
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
can you still see the sun today?

322
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
I won't bother them

323
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
I can go to the meeting in person

324
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
So I would like to ask Mr. Jiang

325
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
to reveal the identity of the sword family

326
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Otherwise, you may not be able to see

327
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
the moon tonight

328
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
You asked me to drink tea just for this

329
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
You should have told me earlier

330
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
The sword master of our generation

331
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
has fought with you

332
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Give it to him

333
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
He is seriously injured

334
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Master Siqi

335
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
What's going on?

336
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Where are we going?

337
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Master

338
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Uncle Jiang

339
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
You asked me

340
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
I want to ask you what's going on

341
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
My brothers and I

342
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Are you going to save us or not?

343
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Uncle Jiang

344
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
You asked me

345
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
I want to ask you what's going on

346
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
My brothers and I

347
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Are you going to save us or not?

348
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Uncle Jiang

349
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Uncle Jiang

350
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Uncle Jiang

351
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Uncle Jiang

352
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Master

353
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Uncle Jiang

354
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
I want to change the destination

355
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
I'll take the plane. You can count on me

356
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
I'll go to Lianshan

357
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
It may be a little far

358
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
As long as you don't cross the mountain

359
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
You can go anywhere

360
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Mr. Jiang

361
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
He left with his life partner

362
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Now he suddenly confessed

363
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
How can I believe it?

364
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
I

365
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
I'm not in your hands now

366
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Fengdao's card is gone

367
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
I don't have to

368
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
make a fuss about it

369
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Maybe

370
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Maybe it's the same as what you said

371
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
The reason why the hunter of Nanshan can come to this point

372
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Is really because of the enmity

373
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
And the result is a shortcoming

374
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
I don't know

375
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
I don't know

376
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
I think we should let the enemy be free

377
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
And the result is a shortcoming

378
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
And my honesty

379
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Is to exchange for my fellow countrymen's freedom

380
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
After all, they have their own lives

381
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
The hunter of Nanshan is just a profession for them

382
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Not a mission

383
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Why didn't you see Yantuo these days?

384
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Brother Xiong

385
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
I met a girl these days

386
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
She was quite reserved

387
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
I took her to climb the mountain for a few days

388
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
If you ask her

389
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Help me cover her up

390
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Tell her I'm on a business trip

391
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Nice

392
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,820
dot

393
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
The notebook was stolen

394
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
The hunter of Nanshan

395
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
The hunter of Nanshan

396
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,500
Don't say so

397
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
I'll sell all the guns first

398
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,500
If Baichuan is not here

399
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
we'll all be in a dead end

400
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
We'll be the enemy

401
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
We'll have to find someone to deal with

402
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
How about you?

403
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
You're the oldest and the most senior

404
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Right, brother

405
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
You'll lead the way

406
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
We'll all be there

407
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,500
If I lead the way

408
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
we'll never let you all be in a dead end

409
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Those who haven't eaten

410
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
will be the ones to deal with

411
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Clean up the mess

412
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
and get Baichuan back

413
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
OK

414
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
OK

415
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
OK?

416
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Who attacked us?

417
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Who is that?

418
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
What's the route?

419
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Where is he hiding?

420
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Who knows?

421
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
And

422
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
which direction should we go?

423
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
I'm old

424
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
I know I'm a good person

425
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
I'm not very capable

426
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
and I'm not a small-minded person

427
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
When I'm in trouble

428
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,500
I don't think I'll be as calm as you guys

429
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
So I can't be the leader

430
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,500
If you really take me as your senior

431
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
I'll be the leader

432
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
OK

433
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Xing Shen has been living here all his life

434
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
He knows more about South Hill than we do

435
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
He's grown up

436
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
He'll put the interests of the hunters

437
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
at the top of everything

438
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Song Dao and Gui Bian are not here

439
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
He's the leader

440
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
He deserves it

441
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
He can be the leader of all the hunters

442
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
There's a rat in the nest

443
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I don't know what you think

444
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
I'm a bit curious

445
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
The matter has been decided

446
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
by Uncle Jiang

447
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
If it weren't for Dixiao

448
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
who suddenly appeared

449
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
and caused their disturbance

450
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
we wouldn't know how many casualties there were

451
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
It has nothing to do with Dixiao

452
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
That's right

453
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
I think we should just let him be

454
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Stop it

455
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Let's vote

456
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
I agree

457
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Xing Shen is temporarily the leader

458
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Raise your hand if you agree

459
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
I believe in you

460
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
I believe in you

461
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
I believe in you

462
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
I used to believe in you too

463
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
I believe in you too

464
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
It's the rule to hit the wooden line

465
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
It's already over half

466
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Get out

467
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
I'll leave Nan Shan to you

468
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Don't let me down

469
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Thank you for your trust

470
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,500
I'll temporarily lead Uncle Jiang's position

471
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
I've contacted the Ghost Company and Feng Dao

472
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,500
They're sure to take action

473
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
As long as we work together

474
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
we'll be able to return to Uncle Jiang as soon as possible

475
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Ghost Company and Uncle Jiang

476
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
Feng Dao was not easy to deal with

477
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
when Uncle Jiang was here

478
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Are you sure?

479
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Yes

480
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
I'm sure

481
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Yes

482
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
He will

483
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
It's really okay

484
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Don't worry

485
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
We've been working so hard these two years

486
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
We should stay with our families

487
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,500
How much trouble can we have in this Tai Ting?

488
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Even if there's a situation

489
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
I think Ban Xiaoshan and Qiao Tao Gao

490
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
and the two teams have increased their members

491
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
You can rest for half a month

492
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
It won't be a problem

493
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
It won't be a problem at all

494
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
No need

495
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
I'll just go for a walk on the mountain

496
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Don't worry

497
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Okay, that's settled

498
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Bye

499
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Why don't you recruit your members to us?

500
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
At least make it a little more luxurious

501
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Maybe we can protect people

502
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
You can't even hold your mouth to eat

503
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Peace is the best

504
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
What's wrong?

505
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
It's too easy to hold your mouth to eat

506
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
But some people can't eat anymore

507
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Sun Zhou is starting to lose his appetite

508
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Really?

509
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,500
He's been talking about how disgusting it is to see a chef

510
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
I think it's about the same

511
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
No, I have to see if it's good

512
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
We have a base here

513
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
If we keep eating, we'll feed people

514
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
We can't eat

515
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Let's go

516
00:22:49,500 --> 00:23:11,500
You should fall back

517
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,500
What's the matter with you?

518
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
Does she había stages?

519
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
равствada

520
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,500
No one would have thought that it wasn't your problem.

521
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,620
Other than apologizing to you, I also want to tell you that

522
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,260
I have a friend who might be able to help save Uncle Jiao.

523
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,860
It's just that...

524
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,460
I need to help give him some risk.

525
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,460
Friend?

526
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,740
The ghost beast is gone!

527
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
The ghost beast is gone!

528
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,500
The ghost beast is gone!

529
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Sun Zhu has been locked up for so long?

530
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,500
She's already in a red thread.

531
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,500
She was supposed to be sent to the soldiers' door, but Uncle Jiao kept coming.

532
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,700
I begged Uncle Jiao to save her as much as possible.

533
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300
You're all too soft-hearted.

534
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,100
Isn't the duty of a man to protect the common people

535
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,700
not to hurt the little ones?

536
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,700
Why are you soft-hearted again?

537
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,500
When we were young, we called you the ghost beast.

538
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Do you still remember?

539
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,500
I already forgot.

540
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,300
Uncle Jiao said that you look very good on the surface,

541
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,500
but you're more of a good person than anyone else.

542
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,500
You can't even get back to the serious matters.

543
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,100
Hurry up. We can't even get the nine-pin horse.

544
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,700
Let's go.

545
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,300
Okay.

546
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,900
How do we set up Sun Zhu?

547
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,700
Sun Zhu stole Da Tou's phone while she was running.

548
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
There's a setting on the phone.

549
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,500
Does that mean there's no function on the phone?

550
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,700
Da Tou uses the setting system that's only used by the team.

551
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,100
Maybe it wasn't used before.

552
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,900
In the future, we'll all use it.

553
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Let's see how fast it moves.

554
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,900
We're back.

555
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,900
It's too remote. I can only buy this.

556
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,700
Okay. Let's sit here.

557
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,300
Drink some water.

558
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,300
What are you doing?

559
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,900
You said you got into trouble.

560
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,100
You ran into this wilderness alone?

561
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,500
You can't even say anything.

562
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,100
Let go!

563
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
You're making me angry.

564
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Hello, Chief.

565
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,300
I'm injured. I'll take her to the hospital.

566
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,100
I'll take Sun Zhu back first.

567
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,100
She's innocent. She's just implicated.

568
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
I want to help her.

569
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,900
I will.

570
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,700
I'll go get some water.

571
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,100
Okay.

572
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,500
Miss Ye, breakfast will be ready soon.

573
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,700
Miss Ye.

574
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,300
You eat. I'll eat this.

575
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,700
Why did she leave so soon?

576
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,700
Is she not sleeping?

577
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,700
It's so early.

578
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,100
Should I call her?

579
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,300
Let her be busy.

580
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,900
Xiao Qi, Qing Lang, Quan Wang, Shou Fa.

581
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,700
Look at the first 10 episodes first.

582
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,100
Take a screenshot of the right foot.

583
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,100
Qing Lang, Shou Fa.

584
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,700
Look at the first 10 episodes first.

585
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,100
Take a screenshot of the right foot.

586
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,500
Let's not go around the village today.

587
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,300
Why are you so tired?

588
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,700
Do you want to say something polite?

589
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,300
Don't shout.

590
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,100
Okay, go ahead.

591
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,100
Jiang Bai Chuan was caught by Lin Xi Ru.

592
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,900
She's important to Nanshan Hunter.

593
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,700
She's important to me too.

594
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,500
I hope you can help me save her.

595
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,100
Of course, you might not be able to help me with this.

596
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,300
Okay, I'll help you.

597
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,900
You'll help me?

598
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,500
So straightforward?

599
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,700
Didn't you say you won't be able to get her to stop?

600
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,700
I said it, but you didn't ask.

601
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,700
Aren't you being too hasty?

602
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,900
You contacted me first.

603
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,100
That means the situation is very urgent.

604
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,300
You asked me to save her,

605
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,300
that means she's very important to you.

606
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,700
If I help you,

607
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,500
I can at least get a chance to ask you for help.

608
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,900
And if I succeed in saving her,

609
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,500
you'll owe me a huge favor.

610
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,300
So no matter what,

611
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,500
helping you is my best choice.

612
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,100
You can do whatever you want now.

613
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,300
Then I won't owe you anything.

614
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,300
It's settled then.

615
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,100
I'm helping you with such a big favor,

616
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,500
and you're going to use this to break me up?
