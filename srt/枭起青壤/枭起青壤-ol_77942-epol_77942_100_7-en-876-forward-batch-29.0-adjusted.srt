Watch out!

19
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:18,873
Old Blade.

20
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:40,873
How did you get here?

21
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:41,993
Who did you come with?

22
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:32,488
(Xing Shen)

23
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,232
Hello?

24
00:05:38,232 --> 00:05:39,073
Are you okay?

25
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:41,593
I'm fine.

26
00:05:43,153 --> 00:05:44,633
Mr. Crip has been rescued.

27
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:46,992
Our people are mostly unharmed.

28
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:50,073
Heading to the usual to regroup.

29
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:54,672
What's with that Earth Fiend?

30
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:03,112
I'll explain it to you later.

31
00:06:04,753 --> 00:06:05,513
It escaped.

32
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:07,633
Tell everyone to stay alert.

33
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,153
They're calling for rain all week.

34
00:06:31,232 --> 00:06:32,193
If heaven doesn't help,

35
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:33,112
I can't save you.

36
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:35,193
What do you mean?

37
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:37,232
An Earth Fiend wound

38
00:06:37,312 --> 00:06:38,792
must be cauterized with natural fire.

39
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:39,912
Or it'll keep festering.

40
00:06:40,112 --> 00:06:42,153
If red threads pierce your pupils,
you're done for.

41
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:44,273
Natural fire?

42
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:46,593
Stop asking.

43
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:48,073
I'll treat your wound briefly.

44
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:49,513
The rest depends on your fate.

45
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:08,833
This time,

46
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:10,393
we can't

47
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:11,792
settle payment per job.

48
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:37,833
Cut the chatter.

49
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:39,352
Bear with it.

50
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:25,352
Tuo. Tuo.

51
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:27,073
Where's Xinxin?

52
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:30,432
Where's Xinxin?

53
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:33,112
- Xinxin?
- Xinxin?

54
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,552
- Xinxin?
- Xinxin?

55
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:38,833
Xinxin. Xinxin.

56
00:08:39,672 --> 00:08:40,593
Where's Xinxin?

57
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,312
Xinxin.

58
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:43,312
Where's Xinxin?

59
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:04,672
Xinxin!

60
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:24,432
Where are we going?

61
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:27,432
Milan Mountain,

62
00:09:27,993 --> 00:09:30,153
the highest peak in Xicang,
to wait for sunrise.

63
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:36,473
If we don't see the sun
at the highest point,

64
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:38,633
then don't blame me.

65
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:45,912
Ms. Lin,

66
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,592
we've lost the crippled old man.

67
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:52,312
What about the other Hunters?

68
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:54,072
Haven't found them.

69
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:58,312
But we saw a fiend.

70
00:09:59,192 --> 00:09:59,952
A fiend?

71
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:02,753
A primal Earth Fiend
that wasn't transformed.

72
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:05,592
And it shows signs of domestication.

73
00:10:12,552 --> 00:10:15,353
I need you to do something.

74
00:11:31,552 --> 00:11:32,353
I fought the leader

75
00:11:33,672 --> 00:11:35,753
earlier at the ice factory and hospital.

76
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:38,113
Today I confirmed

77
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:40,712
he reacts to my whip whistle.

78
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:43,672
But no one knows how many

79
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:45,473
humanoid Earth Fiends there are.

80
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:47,712
They can take human form

81
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:49,473
with no fiendish scent.

82
00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:53,993
But before,

83
00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:56,712
the one Mad Blade sent over

84
00:11:56,993 --> 00:11:58,432
had a strong scent.

85
00:12:01,113 --> 00:12:02,592
They might have some way to cover it.

86
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,312
My mind's a mess.

87
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:08,113
My father never told me about

88
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:08,952
such situations.

89
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:10,432
What's really going on?

90
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:11,513
You bet.

91
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:12,552
That Earth Fiend...

92
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:14,033
I don't mean the humanoid one.

93
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,432
Where did that genuine Earth Fiend
come from?

94
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:22,832
It probably came for me.

95
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:26,633
For you?

96
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,672
It's been kept at the base,

97
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:33,792
and I've been feeding it.

98
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:40,912
You kept an Earth Fiend at the base?

99
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,832
I wanted to study it,

100
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:46,993
tame it,

101
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:49,672
and make it serve us.

102
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:53,192
Xing Shen, how long
had you been doing that?

103
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:54,873
Such a major matter,

104
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:56,672
and you decided behind our backs?

105
00:12:56,912 --> 00:12:58,552
Right. Keeping an Earth Fiend
in the base?

106
00:12:58,753 --> 00:12:59,753
- Right.
- Exactly.

107
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:00,552
Exactly.

108
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:01,792
That Earth Fiend

109
00:13:03,513 --> 00:13:07,113
was caught during patrol 20 years ago.

110
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:09,473
Leaving it to Xing Shen

111
00:13:10,993 --> 00:13:13,033
was a decision

112
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:14,633
made by all Hunters back then.

113
00:13:18,192 --> 00:13:20,033
Both Mr. Crip and Mrs. Hua

114
00:13:21,993 --> 00:13:22,712
knew about it.

115
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:31,712
Keeping an Earth Fiend was a huge risk.

116
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:34,233
But there was no other way.

117
00:13:40,072 --> 00:13:41,592
Now isn't the time for arguments.

118
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:44,513
They could catch up to us any moment.

119
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:53,993
Lightly wounded,

120
00:13:56,873 --> 00:13:58,113
on guard duty.

121
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:01,353
We must all return to base alive

122
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:03,153
before discussing this.

123
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:25,328
(In flight)

124
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:40,233
Xiong.

125
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:26,993
Did you find Locust?

126
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:32,633
I placed it in the cave
on the west slope.

127
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,473
If we can't convince everyone,

128
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:39,072
I can reinforce the cave

129
00:16:40,113 --> 00:16:41,432
to stop its return to the base.

130
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:43,672
Did you think it was tamed?

131
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:48,353
So you let it join the mission
without authorization?

132
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:50,072
No.

133
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,912
It escaped on its own.

134
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:56,393
It seemed

135
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:00,633
to sense that I was in danger.

136
00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:07,033
Jiang,

137
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:10,432
for what happened this time,

138
00:17:11,873 --> 00:17:13,153
I take full responsibility.

139
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:16,832
I'll abide by everyone's decisions.

140
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:21,312
We and Earth Fiends
have been foes for generations.

141
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:23,912
I'll clearly explain everything
to everyone

142
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:26,273
to handle Locust properly.

143
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:29,873
The worst outcome

144
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:32,952
would be having Luo

145
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:35,113
end its suffering.

146
00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:04,792
They're here.

147
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,473
Mr. Crip and Old Blade
haven't recovered yet.

148
00:18:08,592 --> 00:18:09,673
Retreat with the wounded.

149
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:10,832
Leave me strong fighters.

150
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,273
No.

151
00:18:12,552 --> 00:18:13,513
If we all move together,

152
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:14,792
we'll be overtaken quickly

153
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:15,832
at our current pace.

154
00:18:15,953 --> 00:18:16,953
Someone must hold them.

155
00:18:16,953 --> 00:18:17,392
Jiang.

156
00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:18,632
I'm assigning missions.

157
00:18:18,673 --> 00:18:19,792
Not discussing it with you.

158
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:30,473
South Mountain is in your hands now.

159
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:33,152
Don't let me down.

160
00:19:51,953 --> 00:19:52,632
Where are they?

161
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,673
All went home to rest.

162
00:19:58,753 --> 00:19:59,753
Dealing with you

163
00:20:00,872 --> 00:20:02,112
doesn't require many people.

164
00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:04,193
Really?

165
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:07,193
Those four at the entrance

166
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:11,392
seemed quite fragile,
as if made of paper.

167
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:15,072
Why not take a step forward?

168
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:19,513
To see if I'm made of paper

169
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:21,953
or forged from iron.

170
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:25,552
Well, you seem like the leader.

171
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:28,713
That's right.

172
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:31,993
But not exactly.

173
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:38,913
Yet I don't think you're the leader.

174
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:43,072
You've been anxious this
whole journey, haven't you?

175
00:20:44,273 --> 00:20:45,273
Wondering how you'll

176
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,273
report this failure?

177
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,033
Take him away first.

178
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:02,592
Come on.

179
00:21:43,993 --> 00:21:44,832
Hello? Ms. Lin.

180
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:46,433
How's it going?

181
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:49,552
We didn't find that fiend.

182
00:21:57,473 --> 00:21:58,273
But

183
00:21:58,993 --> 00:22:02,193
we caught South Mountain's leader,
Jiang Baichuan.

184
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:06,832
Is that so?

185
00:22:07,832 --> 00:22:09,832
Make sure to treat him properly.

186
00:22:10,513 --> 00:22:11,112
Understood.

187
00:22:52,392 --> 00:22:53,953
Your injuries aren't that bad.

188
00:22:54,513 --> 00:22:56,552
It's the infection
that makes you feel terrible.

189
00:22:57,552 --> 00:22:58,753
Try to stay conscious.

190
00:22:59,152 --> 00:23:00,193
You'll recover quickly

191
00:23:00,273 --> 00:23:01,392
treated by the natural fire.

192
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:42,993
The sun truly came out.

193
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:44,792
You're lucky.

194
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:53,713
Bear with it. Don't move.

195
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:15,753
I... I wasn't ready earlier.

196
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:20,832
Then I'll count to three.

197
00:25:23,753 --> 00:25:24,273
One.

198
00:25:33,993 --> 00:25:34,953
Are you treating me

199
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:36,552
or torturing me?

200
00:25:36,592 --> 00:25:37,872
Keep this, and you're a goner.

201
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:40,233
Do it.

202
00:25:43,753 --> 00:25:44,792
We're not friends.

203
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:47,993
Nor comrades fighting together.

204
00:25:48,913 --> 00:25:50,112
You're like Sun Zhou,

205
00:25:50,193 --> 00:25:52,033
another innocent hurt by Earth Fiends.

206
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:55,513
I'm saving you out of duty
as a South Mountain Hunter.

207
00:25:56,632 --> 00:25:58,473
It doesn't mean I trust you yet.

208
00:26:02,632 --> 00:26:03,673
There's time ahead.

209
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:05,792
I'll earn your trust.

210
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:47,072
Where are my people?

211
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:48,632
Same as you,

212
00:26:48,713 --> 00:26:50,072
being treated well

213
00:26:50,872 --> 00:26:51,753
and perfectly safe.

214
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:53,552
At least

215
00:26:54,392 --> 00:26:55,392
for now.

216
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,792
No matter where one stands

217
00:26:59,872 --> 00:27:01,433
and what motives they have,

218
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:04,193
maintaining courtesy
and mutual respect is essential.

219
00:27:05,193 --> 00:27:06,152
In this aspect,

220
00:27:06,832 --> 00:27:08,473
I believe we've done

221
00:27:08,953 --> 00:27:10,193
much better than you.

222
00:27:10,473 --> 00:27:11,152
You?

223
00:27:12,473 --> 00:27:13,473
We?

224
00:27:18,312 --> 00:27:21,433
Our relationship
actually holds multiple possibilities.

225
00:27:22,112 --> 00:27:23,872
Hunter and prey

226
00:27:24,753 --> 00:27:26,513
is the most superficial layer.

227
00:27:28,953 --> 00:27:31,993
Archenemies
with millennia of grievances.

228
00:27:32,832 --> 00:27:36,673
Equally matched forces of good and evil.

229
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:39,352
Sworn enemies
who can't share the same sky.

230
00:27:40,552 --> 00:27:42,632
Counterbalancing rivals
meeting their match.

231
00:27:42,632 --> 00:27:44,392
Two even parties with bridged divides.

232
00:27:44,392 --> 00:27:45,993
Or even partners forging mutual gain.

233
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:48,913
I believe all options remain possible.

234
00:27:51,993 --> 00:27:53,592
May I first know

235
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,792
who I'm speaking with

236
00:27:58,072 --> 00:27:58,953
before deciding

237
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:01,592
what should be said?

238
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:05,552
You have a short lifespan
but impressive forgetfulness.

239
00:28:06,513 --> 00:28:09,552
We met at the Golden Gate 20 years ago.

240
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:18,433
You were there
when we repaired the Golden Gate?

241
00:28:19,392 --> 00:28:21,392
You remember how Mr. Crip lost his leg,

242
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,112
don't you?

243
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:19,033
Xue!

244
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:20,713
Xue!

245
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:21,513
Xue!

246
00:29:55,632 --> 00:29:56,832
How many more like you

247
00:29:57,792 --> 00:29:58,753
exist?

248
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,193
How many South Mountain Hunters

249
00:30:02,193 --> 00:30:03,753
believe in Earth Fiends?

250
00:30:06,392 --> 00:30:07,152
How did you

251
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:11,233
become what you are now?

252
00:30:19,112 --> 00:30:21,913
Do you prefer our original forms?

253
00:30:23,832 --> 00:30:27,033
Like that young Earth Fiend
you captured?

254
00:30:34,592 --> 00:30:36,433
The one in the woods yesterday

255
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:39,392
was it, right?

256
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,713
The big one that escaped back then

257
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:50,233
was you?

258
00:31:17,872 --> 00:31:20,784
(Xiong Hei)

259
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:54,832
So the natural fire is sunlight.

260
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,433
It's pure thermal energy from nature.

261
00:31:59,632 --> 00:32:01,152
That excludes all artificial flames.

262
00:32:03,993 --> 00:32:04,953
The pain is killing me.

263
00:32:05,872 --> 00:32:07,112
But the results are immediate.

264
00:32:07,352 --> 00:32:09,392
Lightning works faster with zero pain.

265
00:32:09,753 --> 00:32:10,473
Try it next time.

266
00:32:14,872 --> 00:32:17,033
Dr. Nie, the divine healer, have mercy.

267
00:32:20,513 --> 00:32:21,592
If you're fine,

268
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,233
pack your things and let's leave.

269
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:27,632
Since we're here, eat before leaving.

270
00:32:28,832 --> 00:32:29,713
What's there to eat?

271
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:33,112
Something good. Wait here.

272
00:32:33,513 --> 00:32:34,112
I'll fetch it.

273
00:32:48,312 --> 00:32:49,913
Modern client entertainment

274
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:53,872
doesn't mean golf, nightclubs,

275
00:32:54,392 --> 00:32:56,112
or lavish feasts anymore.

276
00:32:57,872 --> 00:32:58,552
Take this.

277
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:01,433
Camping, cycling,

278
00:33:01,953 --> 00:33:02,673
and fishing.

279
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:04,072
Those are trendy now.

280
00:33:05,072 --> 00:33:06,913
So these gears

281
00:33:06,913 --> 00:33:08,913
stay permanently in my car.

282
00:33:12,713 --> 00:33:14,392
How old is this instant noodle pack?

283
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,193
Relax, it's perfectly edible.

284
00:33:26,112 --> 00:33:26,792
Thank you.

285
00:33:27,392 --> 00:33:28,233
You saved my life.

286
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:31,072
Your life's value

287
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:32,832
equals one noodle pack?

288
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,072
It depends if you
grant me future chances

289
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:42,033
to properly express gratitude.

290
00:33:42,473 --> 00:33:43,592
If not,

291
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:45,273
this humble offering becomes

292
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,273
my most precious thanks.

293
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:11,832
I remember in childhood,

294
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:14,352
my mom made casserole noodles
for me and my sister.

295
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,792
(Xicang Instant Noodles)
She used this Xicang brand.

296
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:17,753
It's hard to find now.

297
00:34:17,913 --> 00:34:20,033
Not something you can get anytime.

298
00:34:23,473 --> 00:34:24,513
You have a sister?

299
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,152
It was a long time ago.

300
00:34:31,913 --> 00:34:32,673
She went missing.

301
00:34:37,433 --> 00:34:38,713
Is it also related to Lin Xirou?

302
00:35:05,473 --> 00:35:06,433
The sun's out.

303
00:35:07,353 --> 00:35:08,953
The others will heal too.

304
00:35:17,913 --> 00:35:20,033
Your wound
won't root and sprout anymore.

305
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,833
But take the necessary antibiotics

306
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,152
and tetanus shots.

307
00:35:24,592 --> 00:35:25,592
And avoid hospitals.

308
00:35:26,513 --> 00:35:27,473
I assume you don't want

309
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:28,632
to leave evidence trails.

310
00:35:29,632 --> 00:35:31,833
Understood. I have a doctor friend.

311
00:35:31,913 --> 00:35:32,752
He can help me.

312
00:35:35,473 --> 00:35:36,152
Trustworthy?

313
00:35:36,913 --> 00:35:37,632
Sure.

314
00:35:42,513 --> 00:35:43,993
Good noodles. Thanks.

315
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:46,152
Plenty more. Say it if...

316
00:35:46,152 --> 00:35:46,873
No need.

317
00:36:12,793 --> 00:36:15,192
One question's haunted me.

318
00:36:16,513 --> 00:36:17,112
Yes?

319
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,192
Why are there five coins
hanging down here?

320
00:36:21,033 --> 00:36:22,033
Five Emperor Coins.

321
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:23,833
Round and square.

322
00:36:24,592 --> 00:36:25,592
Cosmic unity.

323
00:36:25,993 --> 00:36:27,072
They ward off evil.

324
00:36:29,232 --> 00:36:29,873
What?

325
00:36:30,793 --> 00:36:31,793
Do you think

326
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:34,793
I've ruined the integrity
of your artwork?

327
00:36:36,232 --> 00:36:37,473
Not exactly 'ruined.'

328
00:36:38,353 --> 00:36:39,873
Hermit Duck was my early creation.

329
00:36:40,152 --> 00:36:41,513
It accidentally turned out well.

330
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,072
No systematic creative philosophy
is behind it.

331
00:36:45,152 --> 00:36:46,953
I just feel they don't match well.

332
00:36:53,953 --> 00:36:54,752
A hermit

333
00:36:55,473 --> 00:36:56,752
retreats from worldly affairs,

334
00:36:57,953 --> 00:37:00,152
free from fame and wealth
and content with simplicity.

335
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:05,913
Ducks sense the warmth
of spring rivers first.

336
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:09,232
It's an image full of spring vitality,
warm and cozy.

337
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:11,712
Five Emperor Coins

338
00:37:12,953 --> 00:37:15,632
attract fortune, wealth, peace, and joy.

339
00:37:17,913 --> 00:37:20,112
Hermit, duck, and coins.

340
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:23,353
These three elements
complement each other.

341
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:24,993
A perfect combination.

342
00:37:26,552 --> 00:37:28,513
You're pretending
to be knowledgeable again.

343
00:37:31,953 --> 00:37:34,552
I told you, you're an optimistic person.

344
00:37:37,712 --> 00:37:39,072
Since when does the heir

345
00:37:39,552 --> 00:37:41,272
of Roadsound buy this for himself?

346
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:49,913
My sister

347
00:37:52,112 --> 00:37:52,953
had always

348
00:37:52,953 --> 00:37:55,033
loved yellow rubber ducks,

349
00:37:55,993 --> 00:37:57,552
and the sight of a real duckling

350
00:37:57,552 --> 00:37:58,592
would melt her.

351
00:38:00,353 --> 00:38:01,953
So whenever I see ducks,

352
00:38:02,152 --> 00:38:03,192
I think of her.

353
00:38:05,112 --> 00:38:06,592
The Hermit Duck's image

354
00:38:07,592 --> 00:38:09,072
is restrained and disciplined.

355
00:38:10,232 --> 00:38:11,632
It reminds me of myself.

356
00:38:14,353 --> 00:38:15,672
So when I saw this pendant,

357
00:38:15,913 --> 00:38:16,993
I immediately wanted it.

358
00:38:17,793 --> 00:38:18,632
I remember

359
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,873
seeing it in some client's car.

360
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:23,393
And I snatched it right off.

361
00:38:38,393 --> 00:38:40,232
Still no news about your sister?

362
00:38:47,353 --> 00:38:48,473
I'll find her.

363
00:38:50,152 --> 00:38:50,953
When that day comes,

364
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:53,192
I'll give her this duck.

365
00:38:53,953 --> 00:38:55,033
She'll love it.

366
00:39:04,272 --> 00:39:06,033
Then I'll make her a new one,

367
00:39:07,393 --> 00:39:08,632
the only one in the world.

368
00:39:30,793 --> 00:39:31,752
Say that again.

369
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:32,793
I'll record it.

370
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:35,632
Just focus on driving.
