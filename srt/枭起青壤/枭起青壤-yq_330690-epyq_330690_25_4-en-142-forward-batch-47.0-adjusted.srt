(This story is a work of fiction)

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,813
=Episode 4=

17
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,100
Hungry?

18
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:13,899
You should've told me earlier.

19
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,060
Have some.

20
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,540
Yan Tuo.

21
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:26,579
Yan Tuo!

22
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:28,019
Xiong! Xiong!

23
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:29,260
Is that you, Xiong?

24
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:38,019
Behave yourself.

25
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:44,899
Quiet down.

26
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,259
You two are unreliable.

27
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,379
This place is probably found.

28
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,220
I'll go bring him out.

29
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:28,460
You two stay here.

30
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,660
Hold the fort.

31
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:30,980
Got it.

32
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,619
Let me get you some more.

33
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,419
No, thanks. I can't eat anymore.

34
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:48,660
Starving on the road,
then stuffing myself at home.

35
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,419
Not very healthy.

36
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:51,780
When you find food you love,
why not eat your fill?

37
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,179
There's no point in saving it.

38
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,340
Of course I won't keep it.

39
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,819
But I'll keep you around.

40
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,780
With you here,

41
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,900
I can eat whatever I want.

42
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,660
After this trip,

43
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,100
you learned to sweet-talk?

44
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:12,733
(Jiang Baichuan)

45
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:16,299
Hello?

46
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:19,460
The one you sent isn't an isolated case.

47
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:22,020
Go on.

48
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,259
Except the driver,

49
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,299
the other two were taken away.

50
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,179
Several men got injured.

51
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,780
Shan Qiang's fine.

52
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,939
Mrs. Hua's in the ICU.

53
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,819
Still critical.

54
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,220
(We checked the video.)

55
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:42,660
(The Whistle Whip worked,)

56
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,059
(meaning they were Earth Fiends.)

57
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:46,619
Xiong, you okay?

58
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,419
You too?

59
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,900
(With Mrs. Hua's skills,)

60
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:54,379
(she could handle multiple opponents,)

61
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:57,179
(but that humanoid Earth Fiend
was too tough.)

62
00:08:58,499 --> 00:08:59,540
(Not sure why,)

63
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,859
(but Hound Clan
couldn't detect his scent,)

64
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,179
(so reinforcements were delayed.)

65
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:06,619
(He acted)

66
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,980
(like the Whistle Whip's sound
enraged him.)

67
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:10,739
(He attacked brutally.)

68
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,100
(So...)

69
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,900
Now, tell me
what you want from all this.

70
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,739
If you want to quit
being a South Mountain Hunter

71
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:22,820
after one more mission,

72
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:25,460
this mission

73
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:28,820
will happen soon.

74
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,379
Hope you're ready.

75
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:38,859
(Wanbao Tower)

76
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:40,019
The clothes arrive tomorrow?

77
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:40,700
Yeah, tomorrow.

78
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,539
Mr. Liu!

79
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:42,779
Going grocery shopping?

80
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,180
Garlic chives
are cheap today. Better hurry.

81
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:46,619
Even a vice principal

82
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,659
retires and buys his own groceries.

83
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,420
Dazhuang, come here.

84
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:52,980
The 108 Heroes I taught you.

85
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,739
You memorized them?

86
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:54,739
I did it ages ago.

87
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:55,739
I don't believe you.

88
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,100
Study them properly.

89
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,220
They'll help with college exams someday.

90
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:01,820
A new face?

91
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:02,940
Xia!

92
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,739
Come to my room to cool down.

93
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,600
Get lost.

94
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,820
What's on your mind?

95
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,180
Have some herbal tea to cool off.

96
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,139
You came, Dr. Lv.

97
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:09,999
Bro.

98
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,460
Look. How about it?

99
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,060
Wow.

100
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,379
You really did it.

101
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,259
Of course.

102
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:15,060
Fine. Go ahead.

103
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:16,259
It could be worse.

104
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:18,060
None of your business.

105
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:20,139
Thank you.

106
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:24,539
(Wanbao Tower, Welcome)

Dragon in the Clouds, Gongsun Sheng.

109
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,739
(Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic)
I must be the Leisure Star.

110
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:34,940
I'm genuinely idle.

111
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,019
You don't ring until I pick the bag up.

112
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,300
Just wait.

113
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,539
If I could, you think I wouldn't answer?

114
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,779
(Open)

115
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:53,379
Sis.

116
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:55,659
No, I was out buying groceries.

117
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:56,539
My hands were full.

118
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,379
Yan Tuo?

119
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,619
Okay. I'm coming right away.

120
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,499
Tell Ms. Lin not to worry, okay?

121
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,340
Bro.

122
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,659
Bro.

123
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,300
Watch the shop for me.

124
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,659
Got it.

125
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:20,379
Don't be stingy with your ointment.

126
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,659
Hand.

127
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,259
I told you I'm fine.

128
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:25,739
Since I'm here,

129
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:27,779
at least, let me give
you the full treatment.

130
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,899
You don't know it.

131
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:31,779
Patients coming to my clinic

132
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,980
either have a weak stomach

133
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,580
or fertility issues.

134
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:38,700
Without treating external injuries,
my skills will get rusty.

135
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,899
Endure it. Endure.

136
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,619
Don't move.

137
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:46,460
Using me as practice?

138
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,539
Talk. How'd this happen?

139
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:53,619
None of your business.

140
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:56,019
When men fight,

141
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:57,820
there are usually two reasons.

142
00:11:58,379 --> 00:11:59,700
Parking space disputes

143
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,580
or competition for mates.

144
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,060
What is your reason?

145
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,820
Who said this was from fighting?

146
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,859
I fell hiking.

147
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,899
Really?

148
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,220
That mountain's got sharp claws.

149
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:13,820
Enough already.

150
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,300
Your disappearance for days

151
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,619
had Ms. Lin worried sick.

152
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,619
Everyone's been searching everywhere.

153
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:23,859
And you were mountain climbing?

154
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,379
I skipped work today to give you

155
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,499
free medical care.

156
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,139
Not even worth honest words?

157
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,779
They were looking for me.

158
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,060
What did they say?

159
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:37,820
What do you think they should've said?

160
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,060
Tuo,

161
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:41,659
are you okay?

162
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:42,899
Where are you hurt?

163
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:44,379
It's nothing. Just a scratch. See?

164
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,220
You scared me to death.

165
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,100
Really, I'm fine.

166
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,820
Does it hurt?

167
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,539
No.

168
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,019
Maybe I shall go get some scrapes too.

169
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,300
Take physical pain from fights

170
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,539
for sweet concern from others.

171
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:57,340
Who did you fight with?

172
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:57,960
Not human.

173
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,080
Mountain.

174
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:00,779
Listen to this.

175
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,460
Tuofeng Mountain in Cangbei

176
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:04,220
has a very potent temple.

177
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,739
All the infertile couples
go there, right?

178
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:07,820
Can't you shut your mouth?

179
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:10,940
Does it hurt?

180
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,580
No. Really. It's barely noticeable.

181
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,259
Ms. Lin.

182
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:15,499
Thanks for coming, Lv Xian.

183
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,019
Tuo, are you alright?

184
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:17,700
Yes.

185
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,379
Don't worry. He's sturdy.

186
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,420
Some food and sleep will fix him.

187
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:23,779
Sorry to make you come here.

188
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:26,100
But I trust you more.

189
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,820
Ms. Lin, no need
for formalities with me.

190
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,899
If Roadsound Group hadn't funded

191
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:31,180
my TCM studies,

192
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,499
I wouldn't have this clinic.

193
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:33,779
You're a doctor?

194
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,340
I thought you ran a teahouse.

195
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:37,259
My examination found

196
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:38,580
he's not completely healthy.

197
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:40,019
He's got mouth issues

198
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,259
and cavities.

199
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,019
Lin Ling.

200
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,980
Take Dr. Lv out for a bit.

201
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,420
Serve some gratitude tea.

202
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,539
No need for formalities.

203
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:50,499
Just doing my duty.

204
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:51,820
Not just tea.

205
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,460
If time permits, share a meal too.

206
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,259
You young people should

207
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:57,259
interact more often.

208
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,060
Okay, Ms. Lin.

209
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,420
Dr. Lv, this way, please.

210
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,259
Enough with "Dr. Lv".

211
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:06,100
Too formal.

212
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,820
Call me Xian.

213
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,460
Hear that? Ms. Lin wants us
to hang out more.

214
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,820
You don't need to ask.

215
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,060
I'll tell you.

216
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,659
That day, didn't you ask me

217
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,379
to bring Gou Ya back first?

218
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:23,060
I encountered a landslide on the way.

219
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,460
Rocks were everywhere.

220
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,340
I couldn't see the road.

221
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,220
Difficult to navigate.

222
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,139
Out of nowhere,
a car ran fast towards me.

223
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:30,019
It hit me.

224
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,300
When I woke up,

225
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,460
I was locked up there.

226
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:33,940
What kind of car hit you?

227
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,379
It happened too fast. How could I see?

228
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,940
It might have been black.

229
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,460
How many people were there?

230
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,619
What did they say to you?

231
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,580
I saw three or four.

232
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:49,899
They didn't say anything.

233
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,980
They just locked me in an ice cellar

234
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,859
and didn't feed me.

235
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,300
Luckily, Xiong arrived in time.

236
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:55,420
I almost froze to death.

237
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:57,180
They didn't tell you anything?

238
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,420
But I pretended to be unconscious

239
00:15:00,739 --> 00:15:01,899
and heard them talking.

240
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,539
They seemed particularly
interested in Gou Ya.

241
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:06,180
Are you interested in him?

242
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:13,060
I-I-I'm just a bit curious.

243
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,779
A-A-Am I not supposed to be curious?

244
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:27,619
You've suffered.

245
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:31,019
It's nothing.

246
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,460
Do you think I owe you an explanation?

247
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,779
Explanation? It doesn't matter.

248
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,619
By all rights, this should end here.

249
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:54,940
No more discussions.

250
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,100
You're the face of Roadsound.

251
00:15:57,379 --> 00:15:59,220
You should remain spotless.

252
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,899
I've been dreaming a lot lately.

253
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,859
Always about you as a child.

254
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,340
When I wake up, I remind myself

255
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,180
you've grown up now.

256
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:12,060
Time to know some truths.

257
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,899
Even shoulder some responsibilities.

258
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:17,499
Really?

259
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,980
Ms. Lin, I'm ready.

260
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,739
We're conducting human trials.

261
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,499
For pharmaceutical companies,

262
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:35,619
time is the biggest constraint.

263
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:38,340
Endless screening, approvals,

264
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,499
animal testing, clinical trials...

265
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,899
Any delay in these stages

266
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,300
could let competitors gain advantage

267
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,820
and let us lose the entire market.

268
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,019
Roadsound is both the mountain

269
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:52,659
the industry looks up to

270
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,300
and the one everyone wants to trample

271
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,859
to conquer.

272
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,259
So I took a risky shortcut.

273
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,259
What shortcut?

274
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,899
A drug enhancing cellular activity.

275
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,700
A groundbreaking new medicine.

276
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:12,259
We recruited many volunteers,

277
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,859
but only Gou Yan met the criteria.

278
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:17,019
We promised him money

279
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,659
and a job placement.

280
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,659
The welfare home.

281
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,019
The trials required multiple phases.

282
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:24,779
Held at the welfare home,

283
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,139
because it's remote

284
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,779
and it's our own funded project.

285
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,539
Easier to control all aspects.

286
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,420
Later, the drug caused

287
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,019
side effects in him.

288
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,980
As for what happened next,

289
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,180
you already know.

290
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,019
Choosing to take risks

291
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,220
means bearing the consequences.

292
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:57,499
Those who captured me

293
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,380
want to crush Roadsound

294
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,420
and surpass it...

295
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,819
Competitors, media,

296
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,140
envious people who hate success,

297
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,819
troublemaking lunatics, and so on.

298
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,160
So...

299
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:15,819
Tuo,

300
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,259
welcome to the adult world.

301
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,620
Ms. Lin,

302
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:30,940
I stopped being a child long ago.

303
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:32,980
You should've let me face this earlier.

304
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,579
No matter what challenges
Roadsound faces,

305
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:37,579
base persons or lunatics,

306
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:39,019
open or covert,

307
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:40,099
you can tell me.

308
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,259
Let me handle it all. Okay?

309
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:45,059
No matter your age,

310
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,499
you're still my child.

311
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:50,380
Rest well.

312
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,420
You should rest early too.

313
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,940
At first, we stayed hidden

314
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,299
and couldn't confront them directly.

315
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,099
Later on, they began to lose their grip.

316
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,700
Nowadays, only small-time thugs
patrol the mountains.

317
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:39,460
It seems we're gradually
gaining the upper hand.

318
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,059
But this time, we got careless.

319
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,339
We almost capsized in a ditch.

320
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,380
Back and forth.

321
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:49,140
When will this ever end?

322
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,420
Then let's make it quick.

323
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,860
Confident?

324
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,420
That woman used a Whistle Whip.

325
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,819
She's somewhat skilled.

326
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,620
Within their ranks,

327
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:01,819
she's likely a key figure.

328
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,180
I dealt her a serious blow.

329
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,099
They won't abandon her.

330
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,420
I've checked all hospitals in Xicang

331
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,259
for patients matching her description.

332
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,779
Follow the trail,

333
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:12,099
and we'll find her.

334
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:13,460
No more mistakes.

335
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:14,739
Delays add risk.

336
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,779
Don't worry, Ms. Lin.

337
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,579
I know he wants to,

338
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,700
but keep Tuo out of this.

339
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:27,660
Of course.

340
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,739
Give it back! Give it back!

341
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,220
(Resident ID Card: Nie Jiuluo)
Nie Jiuluo.

342
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:49,660
Awake already?

343
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,660
I wanted to admire your work quietly.

344
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,180
How many years for trespassing?

345
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:18,499
Less than intentional assault, surely.

346
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,779
Self-defense.

347
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,140
No charges apply.

348
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,660
My apologies, Miss Nie.

349
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,739
This intrusion

350
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:36,700
is improper.

351
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:38,059
But these past days,

352
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,579
I've encountered inexplicable things.

353
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,180
You might hold the answers,

354
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:44,860
so I came.

355
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,360
Up.

356
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:47,940
What?

357
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,220
That's not for sitting.

358
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:51,099
Get up.

359
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:53,140
This chair?

360
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:54,980
Legacy Seat.

361
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,499
Created by Lausi Dandar in 1946.

362
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:59,140
Exhibited in 16 countries.

363
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,779
One of a kind.

364
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,420
The only one in existence.

365
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,779
No one would tell.

366
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:14,079
Listen.

367
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,440
Listen.

368
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:00,220
You prefer the hard way?

369
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:29,339
I...

370
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,099
Miss Nie.

371
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:37,980
It was a slip of the hand.

372
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,299
Your hand was cut? Is it bad?

373
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,099
No, I just fumbled it.

374
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:45,339
My hand's fine.

375
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,180
Don't worry. Stay downstairs.

376
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:48,980
Really?

377
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:53,220
I'm going to bed.

378
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:54,660
Clean up tomorrow.

379
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,900
Alright. Rest well.

380
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,860
You too.

381
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,579
Miss Nie?

382
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:23,819
What's wrong?

383
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:25,460
Nothing.

384
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,259
A fly got in.

385
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:28,299
I shooed it out.

386
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,460
Go to sleep, Lu.

387
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,499
Throwing stuff again last night?

388
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,779
Lu,

389
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,940
why mention this to him?

390
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,779
Mr. Lu came early...

391
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,499
It's fine, Lu.

392
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,819
Go about your work.

393
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:16,620
The great artist hasn't had breakfast.

394
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,420
Cook extra.

395
00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:23,779
Go, Lu.

396
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,460
Van Gogh

397
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,380
painted Sunflowers first,

398
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:36,940
and then cut off his ear.

399
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:39,620
Beethoven

400
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,380
composed his Fifth Symphony,

401
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,339
and then went deaf.

402
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,739
Hemingway finished

403
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:48,059
The Old Man and the Sea and then

404
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,579
killed himself.

405
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,620
You haven't achieved anything yet.

406
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,140
Cut the dramatic act.

407
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,499
Madness is a master's privilege.

408
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,579
You're calling me mad?

409
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,180
This is your new piece?

410
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,059
Unfinished.

411
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,819
No appeal,

412
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:09,980
and progressing slowly.

413
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,900
Patience doesn't guarantee masterpieces,

414
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,819
but rushing never does.

415
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,539
Not rushing you.

416
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,860
Here to help you focus inward.

417
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,660
(Li Sheng'er, Mixiong's Trip)
The hottest sculpting artist now.

418
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,460
Drop by for a visit when you're free.

419
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:26,900
You call this an artist?

420
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,739
Why two tickets?

421
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,539
Don't you have any male friends

422
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,819
to visit exhibitions with?

423
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:39,579
Or grab meals together?

424
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,900
Trying to set me up
with another rich guy?

425
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,259
Not this time.

426
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,019
Pure art invitation.

427
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,420
Invite whoever you want.

428
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:49,019
I'll stay out of your personal life.

429
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,180
No one. Not asking anyone.

430
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,860
I'd be embarrassed
to ask someone to this exhibition.

431
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:55,539
Is money shameful?

432
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,700
Is being admired shameful?

433
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,620
If your exhibition sold out instantly,

434
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,420
I'd take the shame.

435
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,460
Then go hold one!

436
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,499
Instead of smashing things at home

437
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:04,980
or disappearing to the countryside?

438
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,140
Maybe

439
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,140
you feel you're getting closer to art,

440
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:12,420
but farther from real life.

441
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,299
What fascinates you most

442
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:19,380
and what suits you best

443
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,900
are rarely the same.

444
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,259
But you don't have to pick just one.

445
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:30,700
Go see it alone

446
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,539
if there's no company.

447
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,180
Treat it as a critical analysis.

448
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,339
Judge how shameful it truly is.

449
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:46,099
Lu, is the meal ready?

450
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,688
(You're slightly better
than Li Sheng'er.)

451
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,420
(Li Sheng'er, Mixiong's Trip)

452
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,660
What should we do later?

453
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,259
Not sure.

454
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,220
How about finding a cafe to sit in?

455
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:12,860
Hello, Chishui Street.

456
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:19,660
You even went to this exhibition

457
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:22,180
with pure commercial hype
and zero artistic value?

458
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,660
I thought you had better taste.

459
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,499
I regret not hitting
you harder yesterday.

460
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,420
I've been puzzled all night.

461
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,620
Aren't you an artist, Miss Nie?

462
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:36,940
Why are you so skilled?

463
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:40,660
Because you're too weak.

464
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,539
So you rescued me

465
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:46,620
out of pity yesterday?

466
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,620
I feared your corpse
would stain my courtyard.

467
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:53,980
Then why let go?

468
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,059
I didn't want your blood on my hands.

469
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,579
Why so many questions?

470
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,539
What do you want?

471
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,579
I came sincerely for advice yesterday,

472
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,739
and you threw me off the second floor.

473
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,220
I threw you?

474
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:10,059
Answer three questions as compensation.

475
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:10,940
Just three.

476
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:12,059
Answer them,

477
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,299
and I'll never bother you.

478
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,739
What if I refuse?

479
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:20,819
You can't beat me.

480
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,380
Let me out now,

481
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:24,860
and we both save face.

482
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:26,019
Fine.

483
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:27,019
Let's see

484
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:28,460
who ends up losing more face.

485
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:51,059
Miss Nie,

486
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,059
how long do you think

487
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,499
it'll take me to drive

488
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:55,539
to that gap ahead?

489
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,499
Longer than beating you to a pulp.

490
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,019
Next questions.

491
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:09,739
I ask, you answer.

492
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:10,739
Quick responses only.

493
00:31:10,739 --> 00:31:12,019
Or we'll die together.

494
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,380
What are Earth Fiends?

495
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:19,259
What's "rooting and sprouting"?

496
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,700
Who are you people?

497
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:23,460
Why fight the Earth Fiends?

498
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:24,819
Done.

499
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:25,980
Do you need my repetition?

500
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:27,660
How do you know Gou Ya?

501
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,620
Not your concern.

502
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,299
You're not answering mine.

503
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,539
Why should I answer yours?

504
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:35,980
You have no choice.

505
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:53,779
Scared?

506
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:57,140
Dare to not hit the brakes?

507
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:58,660
Dare to keep silent?

508
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:06,220
Lunatic.

509
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,660
Smash the window.

510
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,420
Break it now!

511
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,019
Hydrophobia?

512
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,579
Listen.

513
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,579
The water pressure

514
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,620
blocks the doors.

515
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:40,499
Stay calm. Small breaths. Save oxygen.

516
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:42,259
Wait for the pressure to balance out.

517
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:43,220
Then open the doors.

518
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,299
Inhale and swim out.

519
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:44,900
Understood?

520
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,940
Can you swim?

521
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,620
Close your eyes and take a breath.

522
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:58,539
Trust me.

523
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,900
Inhale and hold it.

524
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,140
What are Earth Fiends?

525
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,660
What?

526
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,339
What's "rooting and sprouting"?

527
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,019
Stay away from me.

528
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,099
Who are you?

529
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,660
Why fight the Earth Fiends?

530
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:17,739
What?

531
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:19,380
Let me go!

532
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,420

Miss Nie.

535
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,300
You woke up without calling me?

536
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,579
I-I-I just woke up.

537
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,740
Perfect timing. The ginger tea's ready.

538
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,900

539

Lu,

540
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:33,659
how did I get back here?

541
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,699
You don't remember?

542
00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:39,219
I heard the doorbell ring.

543
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,699
I went to open it

544
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:42,019
and found you lying there,

545
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,579
soaked to the bone.

546
00:35:44,499 --> 00:35:46,380
I saw a white jeep.

547
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,099
It sped off as soon as I looked.

548
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:50,699
Weren't you going to the exhibition?

549
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,380
How'd you end up like this?

550
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:55,179
I-I-I drank too much.

551
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:57,059
It's fine. I had too much to drink.

552
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,340
At noon?

553
00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:00,380
Who got you this drunk?

554
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:04,380
A contact from Mr. Lu?

555
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,340
Yes, that's right.

556
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,460
First meeting, and you drank this much

557
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:11,740
and got yourself soaked?

558
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:14,900
No!

559
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,099
T-T-That's not what I meant.

560
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:17,980
I-I-I meant...

561
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,940
It's okay, Lu.

562
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,780
Just leave it there.

563
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,260
I'll drink it when I get up.

564
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,499
Alright.

565
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,659
Then drink it all while it's warm.

566
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,019
By the way,

567
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,420
I washed your wet clothes.

568
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,780
I found this in your coat pocket.

569

00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,460
