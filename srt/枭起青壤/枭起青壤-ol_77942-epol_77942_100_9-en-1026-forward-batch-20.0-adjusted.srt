15
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:44,000
(This story is a work of fiction)

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,012
=Episode 9=

17
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:29,944
I'm helping you with a huge favor.

18
00:02:29,944 --> 00:02:31,385
And you brush me off with this?

19
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:45,265
The Hunters' magic weapon?

20
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:46,945
Only I have this.

21
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:48,785
Ordinary weapons won't cause

22
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:50,304
substantial damage on Earth Fiends.

23
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:51,624
But this works wonders.

24
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:55,105
Like using garlic against

25
00:02:55,505 --> 00:02:56,144
vampires?

26
00:02:58,505 --> 00:02:59,584
That's one way to put it,

27
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:01,024
but the mechanism differs.

28
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:03,304
Its design is for easy concealment.

29
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:04,545
But remember.

30
00:03:04,704 --> 00:03:05,584
This isn't a weapon,

31
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:08,152
but something helps you escape
at critical moments.

32
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:09,992
It can't launch an attack.

33
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:12,751
And, Jiang Baichuan recognizes it.

34
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:19,872
Well...

35
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:24,152
Wait a second.

36
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,471
You gave me such a crucial tool.

37
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:28,631
May I ask

38
00:03:28,952 --> 00:03:30,791
what is Jiang Baichuan to you?

39
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:35,112
He's the leader of the Hunters.

40
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:37,511
He raised me.

41
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:43,832
I see. Like a mentor and father to you.

42
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:46,751
No time to waste.

43
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,432
Go fulfill your promise now.

44
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:51,672
Your plan to completely quit the Hunters

45
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:52,872
has delayed, right?

46
00:03:58,832 --> 00:04:00,591
Free to join or quit
and act as you please.

47
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:01,712
It's never easy.

48
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:04,191
Even revered monks practicing lifelong

49
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:05,272
may never achieve so.

50
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,992
Enough philosophical talk.

51
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:11,471
Let's get some breakfast.

52
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:12,872
You stay. I'll get some.

53
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:26,728
(Breakfast)

54
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:28,432
Two, please.

55
00:04:29,272 --> 00:04:29,791
Thanks.

56
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:30,732
Got it.

57
00:04:31,191 --> 00:04:31,832
Hey.

58
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:34,232
What will you have?

59
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:35,071
What's available?

60
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:36,392
Everything. Look yourself.

61
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:39,751
Alright, two of each then.

62
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:40,571
Right away.

63
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:41,672
Wait a moment.

64
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:46,112
Breakfast.

65
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:52,472
How long were you out there?

66
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:54,511
Not long. It's still warm.

67
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,872
Thanks, but I'm not hungry.

68
00:06:04,592 --> 00:06:05,552
Been up all night?

69
00:06:11,352 --> 00:06:13,191
Impressive. No food, no rest.

70
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:15,151
So you Hunters fight
against Earth Fiends

71
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:16,311
through sheer willpower?

72
00:06:17,232 --> 00:06:18,271
Even without food or rest,

73
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:20,951
Jiang still got captured.

74
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:33,831
Just tell me what you want me to do.

75
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,311
Roadsound Group's influence in Xicang

76
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:41,511
is tremendous.

77
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:43,792
Even with all evidence in hand,

78
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:46,472
Lin Xirou could still
use her connections

79
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,232
and excuses to stall for time.

80
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:51,271
Especially she has Jiang
as their hostage now.

81
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:54,912
Reckless moves would alert her
and endanger Jiang.

82
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:59,391
When I first met Lin Xirou as a child,

83
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:01,151
she looked exactly like this.

84
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:02,472
Many years have passed,

85
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:03,711
she looks still the same.

86
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:05,191
That's right.

87
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:07,672
Earth Fiends have long lifespans.

88
00:07:07,872 --> 00:07:09,592
So time is what she lacks the least.

89
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:12,552
She acts with meticulous care,

90
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:15,751
caution and endless patience.

91
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:18,951
Roadsound has weathered

92
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:20,311
multiple business crises.

93
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:21,751
No matter the opponent,

94
00:07:21,872 --> 00:07:24,151
she could stay composed
and counterattack.

95
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,151
Of course.

96
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:29,711
To fight us short-lived ones,

97
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:31,472
time favors her.

98
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:34,151
She waits for us to panic

99
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:35,711
and blunder.

100
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:38,872
Hence, we can't act recklessly.

101
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,112
While caution matters,

102
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:49,751
we can't stay passive.

103
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:51,391
For example?

104
00:07:54,112 --> 00:07:54,872
Make her hurt.

105
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:58,391
Put cartons in cold chain.

106
00:08:58,552 --> 00:08:59,712
The rest goes on next truck.

107
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:01,511
Drive faster. No delays.

108
00:09:01,592 --> 00:09:02,312
Got it, Zheng.

109
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:09,911
By the way, Zheng,

110
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:12,511
can I take two days off
after this delivery?

111
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:13,952
Why now?

112
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:18,592
My mom's hospitalized, needs surgery.

113
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:19,952
I'll go check on her.

114
00:09:23,151 --> 00:09:24,352
Then skip this delivery

115
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:25,592
and go now.

116
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,072
Family matters.

117
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:30,751
No need, Zheng.

118
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:32,352
Not that urgent.

119
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:34,832
My mother still needs more observation.

120
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:36,952
She might not need surgery.

(Purifies air, absorbs formaldehyde)

122
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:45,151
Are you sure?

123
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:47,631
Don't force it.

124
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:48,712
Not at all.

125
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:49,872
Not at all, Zheng.

126
00:09:50,112 --> 00:09:51,072
I'll go now, Zheng.

127
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:31,144
(Message)

128
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:32,192
Get off me!

(Bangcheng Business Travel)

130
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,551
You forgot something.

131
00:10:52,472 --> 00:10:53,431
Keep forgetting things.

132
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,031
Miss me, okay?

133
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:15,592
I'm leaving.

134
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,271
Bye.

135
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,784
(History of the World)

136
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,751
Our trip to Xicang this time

137
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:32,271
for camping or a picnic?

138
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:35,312
Eat it or not. No question.

139
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:41,551
If a woman treated me this well,

140
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:43,151
I wouldn't leave her.

141
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:24,352
Sis.

142
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,352
Lin Ling is not a kid anymore.

143
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,592
No need for you

144
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:28,952
to escort her every time.

145
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:31,192
Ms. Lin asked you

146
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:33,791
where you went this morning.

147
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:35,992
Ms. Lin asked me?

148
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:39,592
Ms. Lin intended to escort her herself,

149
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:42,751
but saw you rushing out
without going to the office,

150
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:44,112
so sent me to check.

151
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:48,511
Alright, I'll call her later.

152
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,631
Ms. Lin said you can just tell me,

153
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,112
and I'll relay it to her.

154
00:12:58,872 --> 00:13:01,031
I-I just went for breakfast.

155
00:13:01,472 --> 00:13:02,312
Breakfast?

156
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:05,872
I scrolled through videos last night.

157
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:07,271
Guess what I saw?

158
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:10,751
The fried breadstick store
Ms. Lin often bought us to. Remember?

159
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:12,511
The one behind our school?

160
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:14,671
Exactly! Seeing it made me so hungry.

161
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:15,992
I even stayed up all night

162
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:17,192
from craving.

163
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:18,872
So I went straight there

164
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:19,992
this morning

165
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:21,072
and bought a bunch.

166
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:21,992
But,

167
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:24,671
I barely ate a few bites.

168
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:26,911
Look, they're still on the table.

169
00:13:29,031 --> 00:13:30,352
When it comes to food,

170
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,671
Lin Ling's pastries are the best,

171
00:13:32,952 --> 00:13:34,031
tasty and healthy.

172
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:35,952
Who knows if the breakfast store

173
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:37,592
uses the recycled oil, right?

174

in childhood anymore.

00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,031
Any progress?

179
00:14:16,352 --> 00:14:17,352
Only bad news.

180

Ms. Lin captured their man.

181
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,431
To keep her helping us,

182
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:22,671
I must help her this time.

183

are all coming to Xicang.

Send me the photos.

192

194

Is it that serious?

195

Didn't you see how solemn Sis was?

196
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:11,031
You're under Ms. Lin's watch,

197
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:12,031
in grave peril.

198
00:15:12,472 --> 00:15:14,151
So you must not be discovered.
Understand?

These people are coming over here.

200

Let's start by targeting these two.

221
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:38,631
Eat up.

222
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,911
At times like this,

223
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:41,072
you have to have enough food.

224
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:43,872
What you sent is useful.

225
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:45,911
I need to figure out how to use it.

226
00:16:48,352 --> 00:16:51,072
Miss, you've brought
your boyfriend here so many times.

Hello.

231
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:54,911
I have a plan.

232
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:57,032
It might rescue Jiang.

233
00:17:58,072 --> 00:17:58,752
Go on.

234
00:17:59,471 --> 00:18:01,872
A group of humanoid Earth Fiends
are coming to Xicang.

235
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:02,991
Capture them

236
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,391
and trade with Lin Xirou.

237
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:05,951
Where did you get this news?

238

Don't you trust me?

239
00:18:08,032 --> 00:18:09,471
Even if we capture them,

240
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:11,631
are you sure she'll make the trade?

241
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,592
Once they reach Roadsound,

242
00:18:13,671 --> 00:18:14,792
we'll lose our chance.

243
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:18,272
What's the plan?

244
00:18:19,151 --> 00:18:20,072
I'll tail them first.

245
00:18:20,592 --> 00:18:22,032
You stake out their destination.

246
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:23,592
I'll send you the location.

247

Don't take your own car to tail them.

248

I know. I rented one.

249
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:19,711

250
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:21,911
to get moving.

Has this happened before?

254
00:20:58,112 --> 00:20:59,112
Wait, look.

255
00:21:00,352 --> 00:21:03,191
They're rushing us to Xicang this time.

256
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,431
And there are so many of us.

257
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:11,512
No idea.

258
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:17,752
Pull over at the service area.

259
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:18,792
I'll take a leak.

260
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:21,951
We can't be late.

261
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:33,951
No music.

262
00:21:34,872 --> 00:21:35,911
No chatting.

263
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:38,312
Not even leaks?

264
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,671
The Hound Clan of the Hunters

265
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:03,112
can track us by scent.

266
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:06,391
Thanks to Ms. Lin,

267
00:22:07,231 --> 00:22:08,951
we've taken human form

268
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:10,671
without any scent.

269
00:22:22,352 --> 00:22:24,631
But if I can't hold it and wet my pants,

270

the Hounds...

271

m-must smell me from afar.

272
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:34,391
Look at you.

273
00:22:34,832 --> 00:22:37,471
You never talk to me,

274
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:38,752
instead, you take my joke

275
00:22:39,832 --> 00:22:41,072
pretty seriously.

276
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:40,391
Let's go.

277
00:23:41,272 --> 00:23:43,512
Move now. You said we can't be late.

278
00:23:47,431 --> 00:23:50,072
That blue car's been tailing us.

279
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:04,231
At the service area now.
Still some distance away.

280
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:06,312
But they've spotted me.

281
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:08,991
I'll reinforce you.

282
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,072
No. Ambush them at the hotel.

283
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:14,951
What if they attack you?

284
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:17,792
Even better.

285
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:18,872
If we fight at the hotel,

286
00:24:18,872 --> 00:24:19,951
it'll be more complicated.

287
00:24:20,231 --> 00:24:21,792
If they act rashly,

288
00:24:21,832 --> 00:24:23,431
I'll take them down here.

289

290

Nie Jiuluo, wake up!

346
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:48,258
Don't pass out.

347
00:40:54,657 --> 00:40:55,258
Luo.

348
00:40:57,978 --> 00:40:58,657
Luo.

349
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:02,097
Luo.

350
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:08,017
Wake up. We're almost there.

351
00:41:09,338 --> 00:41:09,978
Mom.

352
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:13,378
Where are we going?

353
00:41:15,177 --> 00:41:16,537
I promised you

354
00:41:17,097 --> 00:41:18,378
a boat ride.

355
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:20,938
Forgot about it already?

356
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:36,818
I won't go.

357
00:41:48,097 --> 00:41:48,978
I won't go.

358
00:41:57,138 --> 00:41:57,996
Next time,

359
00:41:59,126 --> 00:42:01,145
how about I take you
to my usual canteen?

360
00:42:01,778 --> 00:42:03,321
A canteen worthy of your taste must

361
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:04,862
serve upscale French cuisine.

362
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:06,736
Not at all.

363
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:09,291
I don't find French cuisine upscale.

364
00:42:10,354 --> 00:42:12,126
Escargot can't beat
the braised duck feet.

365
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:14,436
The cheese can't beat osmanthus cakes.

366
00:42:16,594 --> 00:42:17,898
You'll definitely love the place

367
00:42:17,898 --> 00:42:18,805
I'll take you.

368
00:42:21,576 --> 00:42:22,637
How do you know

369
00:42:23,314 --> 00:42:24,147
what I like?

370
00:42:26,706 --> 00:42:29,055
Let's give it a try.

371
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:32,018
Alright.

372
00:42:32,654 --> 00:42:33,599
Looking forward to it.

373
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:36,562
Here.

374
00:42:37,135 --> 00:42:38,014
Give me five.
