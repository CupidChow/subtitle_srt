(This story is a work of fiction)

00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,813
=Episode 4=

17
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,100
Hungry?

18
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:03,899
You should've told me earlier.

19
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:09,060
Have some.

20
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,540
Yan Tuo.

21
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:16,579
Yan Tuo!

22
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:18,019
Xiong! Xiong!

23
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:19,260
Is that you, Xiong?

24
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,019
Behave yourself.

25
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:34,899
Quiet down.

26
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,259
You two are unreliable.

27
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,379
This place is probably found.

28
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,220
I'll go bring him out.

29
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:18,460
You two stay here.

30
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,660
Hold the fort.

31
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:20,980
Got it.

32
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,619
Let me get you some more.

33
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,419
No, thanks. I can't eat anymore.

34
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:38,660
Starving on the road,
then stuffing myself at home.

35
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,419
Not very healthy.

36
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,780
When you find food you love,
why not eat your fill?

37
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,179
There's no point in saving it.

38
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,340
Of course I won't keep it.

39
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,819
But I'll keep you around.

40
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,780
With you here,

41
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,900
I can eat whatever I want.

42
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,660
After this trip,

43
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,100
you learned to sweet-talk?

44
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,733
(Jiang Baichuan)

45
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:06,299
Hello?

46
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:09,460
The one you sent isn't an isolated case.

47
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:12,020
Go on.

48
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:13,259
Except the driver,

49
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,299
the other two were taken away.

50
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,179
Several men got injured.

51
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,780
Shan Qiang's fine.

52
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,939
Mrs. Hua's in the ICU.

53
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,819
Still critical.

54
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:28,220
(We checked the video.)

55
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:32,660
(The Whistle Whip worked,)

56
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,059
(meaning they were Earth Fiends.)

57
00:08:35,499 --> 00:08:36,619
Xiong, you okay?

58
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,419
You too?

59
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,900
(With Mrs. Hua's skills,)

60
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:44,379
(she could handle multiple opponents,)

61
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:47,179
(but that humanoid Earth Fiend
was too tough.)

62
00:08:48,499 --> 00:08:49,540
(Not sure why,)

63
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,859
(but Hound Clan
couldn't detect his scent,)

64
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,179
(so reinforcements were delayed.)

65
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,619
(He acted)

66
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,980
(like the Whistle Whip's sound
enraged him.)

67
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,739
(He attacked brutally.)

68
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,100
(So...)

69
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,900
Now, tell me
what you want from all this.

70
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,739
If you want to quit
being a South Mountain Hunter

71
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,820
after one more mission,

72
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:15,460
this mission

73
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:18,820
will happen soon.

74
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,379
Hope you're ready.

75
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:28,859
(Wanbao Tower)

76
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,019
The clothes arrive tomorrow?

77
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:30,700
Yeah, tomorrow.

78
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,539
Mr. Liu!

79
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:32,779
Going grocery shopping?

80
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,180
Garlic chives
are cheap today. Better hurry.

81
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:36,619
Even a vice principal

82
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,659
retires and buys his own groceries.

83
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,420
Dazhuang, come here.

84
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:42,980
The 108 Heroes I taught you.

85
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,739
You memorized them?

86
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:44,739
I did it ages ago.

87
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:45,739
I don't believe you.

88
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,100
Study them properly.

89
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,220
They'll help with college exams someday.

90
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:51,820
A new face?

91
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:52,940
Xia!

92
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,739
Come to my room to cool down.

93
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,600
Get lost.

94
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,820
What's on your mind?

95
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,180
Have some herbal tea to cool off.

96
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,139
You came, Dr. Lv.

97
00:09:59,499 --> 00:09:59,999
Bro.

98
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,460
Look. How about it?

99
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,060
Wow.

100
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,379
You really did it.

101
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,259
Of course.

102
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:05,060
Fine. Go ahead.

103
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:06,259
It could be worse.

104
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,060
None of your business.

105
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:10,139
Thank you.

106
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:14,539
(Wanbao Tower, Welcome)

Dragon in the Clouds, Gongsun Sheng.

109
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,739
(Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic)
I must be the Leisure Star.

110
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:24,940
I'm genuinely idle.

111
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,019
You don't ring until I pick the bag up.

112
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,300
Just wait.

113
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,539
If I could, you think I wouldn't answer?

114
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,779
(Open)

115
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:43,379
Sis.

116
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:45,659
No, I was out buying groceries.

117
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:46,539
My hands were full.

118
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,379
Yan Tuo?

119
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,619
Okay. I'm coming right away.

120
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,499
Tell Ms. Lin not to worry, okay?

121
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,340
Bro.

122
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,659
Bro.

123
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,300
Watch the shop for me.

124
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,659
Got it.

125
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:10,379
Don't be stingy with your ointment.

126
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,659
Hand.

127
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:14,259
I told you I'm fine.

128
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:15,739
Since I'm here,

129
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:17,779
at least, let me give
you the full treatment.

130
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,899
You don't know it.

131
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,779
Patients coming to my clinic

132
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:23,980
either have a weak stomach

133
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,580
or fertility issues.

134
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:28,700
Without treating external injuries,
my skills will get rusty.

135
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:29,899
Endure it. Endure.

136
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,619
Don't move.

137
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,460
Using me as practice?

138
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,539
Talk. How'd this happen?

139
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:43,619
None of your business.

140
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:46,019
When men fight,

141
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,820
there are usually two reasons.

142
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:49,700
Parking space disputes

143
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,580
or competition for mates.

144
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,060
What is your reason?

145
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,820
Who said this was from fighting?

146
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,859
I fell hiking.

147
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,899
Really?

148
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,220
That mountain's got sharp claws.

149
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:03,820
Enough already.

150
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:07,300
Your disappearance for days

151
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,619
had Ms. Lin worried sick.

152
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,619
Everyone's been searching everywhere.

153
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:13,859
And you were mountain climbing?

154
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,379
I skipped work today to give you

155
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:17,499
free medical care.

156
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,139
Not even worth honest words?

157
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,779
They were looking for me.

158
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,060
What did they say?

159
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,820
What do you think they should've said?

160
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,060
Tuo,

161
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:31,659
are you okay?

162
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:32,899
Where are you hurt?

163
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:34,379
It's nothing. Just a scratch. See?

164
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,220
You scared me to death.

165
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,100
Really, I'm fine.

166
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,820
Does it hurt?

167
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,539
No.

168
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,019
Maybe I shall go get some scrapes too.

169
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,300
Take physical pain from fights

170
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,539
for sweet concern from others.

171
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:47,340
Who did you fight with?

172
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:47,960
Not human.

173
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,080
Mountain.

174
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:50,779
Listen to this.

175
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,460
Tuofeng Mountain in Cangbei

176
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:54,220
has a very potent temple.

177
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:56,739
All the infertile couples
go there, right?

178
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:57,820
Can't you shut your mouth?

179
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:00,940
Does it hurt?

180
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,580
No. Really. It's barely noticeable.

181
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,259
Ms. Lin.

182
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:05,499
Thanks for coming, Lv Xian.

183
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,019
Tuo, are you alright?

184
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:07,700
Yes.

185
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,379
Don't worry. He's sturdy.

186
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,420
Some food and sleep will fix him.

187
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:13,779
Sorry to make you come here.

188
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:16,100
But I trust you more.

189
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,820
Ms. Lin, no need
for formalities with me.

190
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,899
If Roadsound Group hadn't funded

191
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,180
my TCM studies,

192
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,499
I wouldn't have this clinic.

193
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:23,779
You're a doctor?

194
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:25,340
I thought you ran a teahouse.

195
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:27,259
My examination found

196
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:28,580
he's not completely healthy.

197
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:30,019
He's got mouth issues

198
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,259
and cavities.

199
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,019
Lin Ling.

200
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,980
Take Dr. Lv out for a bit.

201
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,420
Serve some gratitude tea.

202
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,539
No need for formalities.

203
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:40,499
Just doing my duty.

204
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:41,820
Not just tea.

205
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,460
If time permits, share a meal too.

206
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,259
You young people should

207
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,259
interact more often.

208
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,060
Okay, Ms. Lin.

209
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,420
Dr. Lv, this way, please.

210
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,259
Enough with "Dr. Lv".

211
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:56,100
Too formal.

212
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,820
Call me Xian.

213
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:02,460
Hear that? Ms. Lin wants us
to hang out more.

214
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,820
You don't need to ask.

215
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,060
I'll tell you.

216
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,659
That day, didn't you ask me

217
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,379
to bring Gou Ya back first?

218
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:13,060
I encountered a landslide on the way.

219
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,460
Rocks were everywhere.

220
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,340
I couldn't see the road.

221
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,220
Difficult to navigate.

222
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:19,139
Out of nowhere,
a car ran fast towards me.

223
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,019
It hit me.

224
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,300
When I woke up,

225
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,460
I was locked up there.

226
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:23,940
What kind of car hit you?

227
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,379
It happened too fast. How could I see?

228
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,940
It might have been black.

229
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,460
How many people were there?

230
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,619
What did they say to you?

231
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,580
I saw three or four.

232
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:39,899
They didn't say anything.

233
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,980
They just locked me in an ice cellar

234
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,859
and didn't feed me.

235
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,300
Luckily, Xiong arrived in time.

236
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:45,420
I almost froze to death.

237
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,180
They didn't tell you anything?

238
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,420
But I pretended to be unconscious

239
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:51,899
and heard them talking.

240
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,539
They seemed particularly
interested in Gou Ya.

241
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:56,180
Are you interested in him?

242
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:03,060
I-I-I'm just a bit curious.

243
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,779
A-A-Am I not supposed to be curious?

244
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:17,619
You've suffered.

245
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,019
It's nothing.

246
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,460
Do you think I owe you an explanation?

247
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,779
Explanation? It doesn't matter.

248
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,619
By all rights, this should end here.

249
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:44,940
No more discussions.

250
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:47,100
You're the face of Roadsound.

251
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,220
You should remain spotless.

252
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,899
I've been dreaming a lot lately.

253
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,859
Always about you as a child.

254
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,340
When I wake up, I remind myself

255
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,180
you've grown up now.

256
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,060
Time to know some truths.

257
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,899
Even shoulder some responsibilities.

258
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:07,499
Really?

259
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,980
Ms. Lin, I'm ready.

260
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,739
We're conducting human trials.

261
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:23,499
For pharmaceutical companies,

262
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:25,619
time is the biggest constraint.

263
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:28,340
Endless screening, approvals,

264
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,499
animal testing, clinical trials...

265
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,899
Any delay in these stages

266
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,300
could let competitors gain advantage

267
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,820
and let us lose the entire market.

268
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,019
Roadsound is both the mountain

269
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:42,659
the industry looks up to

270
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,300
and the one everyone wants to trample

271
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,859
to conquer.

272
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,259
So I took a risky shortcut.

273
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,259
What shortcut?

274
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,899
A drug enhancing cellular activity.

275
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,700
A groundbreaking new medicine.

276
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:02,259
We recruited many volunteers,

277
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,859
but only Gou Yan met the criteria.

278
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:07,019
We promised him money

279
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,659
and a job placement.

280
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,659
The welfare home.

281
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,019
The trials required multiple phases.

282
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,779
Held at the welfare home,

283
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:17,139
because it's remote

284
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,779
and it's our own funded project.

285
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,539
Easier to control all aspects.

286
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,420
Later, the drug caused

287
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,019
side effects in him.

288
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,980
As for what happened next,

289
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,180
you already know.

290
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,019
Choosing to take risks

291
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,220
means bearing the consequences.

292
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:47,499
Those who captured me

293
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:49,380
want to crush Roadsound

294
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
and surpass it...

295
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,819
Competitors, media,

296
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,140
envious people who hate success,

297
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,819
troublemaking lunatics, and so on.

298
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,160
So...

299
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:05,819
Tuo,

300
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,259
welcome to the adult world.

301
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,620
Ms. Lin,

302
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:20,940
I stopped being a child long ago.

303
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,980
You should've let me face this earlier.

304
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:25,579
No matter what challenges
Roadsound faces,

305
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:27,579
base persons or lunatics,

306
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,019
open or covert,

307
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:30,099
you can tell me.

308
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,259
Let me handle it all. Okay?

309
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:35,059
No matter your age,

310
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:37,499
you're still my child.

311
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:40,380
Rest well.

312
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,420
You should rest early too.

313
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,940
At first, we stayed hidden

314
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:19,299
and couldn't confront them directly.

315
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,099
Later on, they began to lose their grip.

316
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,700
Nowadays, only small-time thugs
patrol the mountains.

317
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,460
It seems we're gradually
gaining the upper hand.

318
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,059
But this time, we got careless.

319
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,339
We almost capsized in a ditch.

320
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,380
Back and forth.

321
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:39,140
When will this ever end?

322
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,420
Then let's make it quick.

323
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,860
Confident?

324
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,420
That woman used a Whistle Whip.

325
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,819
She's somewhat skilled.

326
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:49,620
Within their ranks,

327
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:51,819
she's likely a key figure.

328
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,180
I dealt her a serious blow.

329
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,099
They won't abandon her.

330
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,420
I've checked all hospitals in Xicang

331
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,259
for patients matching her description.

332
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,779
Follow the trail,

333
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:02,099
and we'll find her.

334
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:03,460
No more mistakes.

335
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:04,739
Delays add risk.

336
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,779
Don't worry, Ms. Lin.

337
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,579
I know he wants to,

338
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,700
but keep Tuo out of this.

339
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:17,660
Of course.

340
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,739
Give it back! Give it back!

341
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,220
(Resident ID Card: Nie Jiuluo)
Nie Jiuluo.

342
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:39,660
Awake already?

343
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,660
I wanted to admire your work quietly.

344
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,180
How many years for trespassing?

345
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,499
Less than intentional assault, surely.

346
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,779
Self-defense.

347
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,140
No charges apply.

348
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,660
My apologies, Miss Nie.

349
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,739
This intrusion

350
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:26,700
is improper.

351
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:28,059
But these past days,

352
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,579
I've encountered inexplicable things.

353
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,180
You might hold the answers,

354
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:34,860
so I came.

355
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,360
Up.

356
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:37,940
What?

357
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,220
That's not for sitting.

358
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:41,099
Get up.

359
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,140
This chair?

360
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:44,980
Legacy Seat.

361
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,499
Created by Lausi Dandar in 1946.

362
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,140
Exhibited in 16 countries.

363
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,779
One of a kind.

364
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,420
The only one in existence.

365
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,779
No one would tell.

366
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:04,079
Listen.

367
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,440
Listen.

368
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:50,220
You prefer the hard way?

369
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:19,339
I...

370
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,099
Miss Nie.

371
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:27,980
It was a slip of the hand.

372
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:31,299
Your hand was cut? Is it bad?

373
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:34,099
No, I just fumbled it.

374
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:35,339
My hand's fine.

375
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,180
Don't worry. Stay downstairs.

376
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,980
Really?

377
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:43,220
I'm going to bed.

378
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:44,660
Clean up tomorrow.

379
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:47,900
Alright. Rest well.

380
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,860
You too.

381
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,579
Miss Nie?

382
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:13,819
What's wrong?

383
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:15,460
Nothing.

384
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,259
A fly got in.

385
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:18,299
I shooed it out.

386
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,460
Go to sleep, Lu.

387
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,499
Throwing stuff again last night?

388
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,779
Lu,

389
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,940
why mention this to him?

390
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,779
Mr. Lu came early...

391
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:03,499
It's fine, Lu.

392
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,819
Go about your work.

393
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:06,620
The great artist hasn't had breakfast.

394
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,420
Cook extra.

395
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:13,779
Go, Lu.

396
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,460
Van Gogh

397
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:25,380
painted Sunflowers first,

398
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:26,940
and then cut off his ear.

399
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:29,620
Beethoven

400
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,380
composed his Fifth Symphony,

401
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,339
and then went deaf.

402
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,739
Hemingway finished

403
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,059
The Old Man and the Sea and then

404
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,579
killed himself.

405
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:43,620
You haven't achieved anything yet.

406
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:46,140
Cut the dramatic act.

407
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,499
Madness is a master's privilege.

408
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,579
You're calling me mad?

409
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,180
This is your new piece?

410
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,059
Unfinished.

411
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,819
No appeal,

412
00:26:59,059 --> 00:26:59,980
and progressing slowly.

413
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,900
Patience doesn't guarantee masterpieces,

414
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,819
but rushing never does.

415
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,539
Not rushing you.

416
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,860
Here to help you focus inward.

417
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:12,660
(Li Sheng'er, Mixiong's Trip)
The hottest sculpting artist now.

418
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,460
Drop by for a visit when you're free.

419
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:16,900
You call this an artist?

420
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:18,739
Why two tickets?

421
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,539
Don't you have any male friends

422
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,819
to visit exhibitions with?

423
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:29,579
Or grab meals together?

424
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:32,900
Trying to set me up
with another rich guy?

425
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,259
Not this time.

426
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,019
Pure art invitation.

427
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,420
Invite whoever you want.

428
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:39,019
I'll stay out of your personal life.

429
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,180
No one. Not asking anyone.

430
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,860
I'd be embarrassed
to ask someone to this exhibition.

431
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,539
Is money shameful?

432
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,700
Is being admired shameful?

433
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,620
If your exhibition sold out instantly,

434
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,420
I'd take the shame.

435
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,460
Then go hold one!

436
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,499
Instead of smashing things at home

437
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:54,980
or disappearing to the countryside?

438
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,140
Maybe

439
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,140
you feel you're getting closer to art,

440
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,420
but farther from real life.

441
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:06,299
What fascinates you most

442
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:09,380
and what suits you best

443
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,900
are rarely the same.

444
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,259
But you don't have to pick just one.

445
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:20,700
Go see it alone

446
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,539
if there's no company.

447
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,180
Treat it as a critical analysis.

448
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:27,339
Judge how shameful it truly is.

449
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,099
Lu, is the meal ready?

450
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,688
(You're slightly better
than Li Sheng'er.)

451
00:28:41,688 --> 00:28:42,420
(Li Sheng'er, Mixiong's Trip)

452
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,660
What should we do later?

453
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:45,259
Not sure.

454
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,220
How about finding a cafe to sit in?

455
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,860
Hello, Chishui Street.

456
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:09,660
You even went to this exhibition

457
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:12,180
with pure commercial hype
and zero artistic value?

458
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,660
I thought you had better taste.

459
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,499
I regret not hitting
you harder yesterday.

460
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,420
I've been puzzled all night.

461
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,620
Aren't you an artist, Miss Nie?

462
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:26,940
Why are you so skilled?

463
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:30,660
Because you're too weak.

464
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,539
So you rescued me

465
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:36,620
out of pity yesterday?

466
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,620
I feared your corpse
would stain my courtyard.

467
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:43,980
Then why let go?

468
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:46,059
I didn't want your blood on my hands.

469
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,579
Why so many questions?

470
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,539
What do you want?

471
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,579
I came sincerely for advice yesterday,

472
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,739
and you threw me off the second floor.

473
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,220
I threw you?

474
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:00,059
Answer three questions as compensation.

475
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:00,940
Just three.

476
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,059
Answer them,

477
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,299
and I'll never bother you.

478
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,739
What if I refuse?

479
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:10,819
You can't beat me.

480
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,380
Let me out now,

481
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:14,860
and we both save face.

482
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:16,019
Fine.

483
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:17,019
Let's see

484
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:18,460
who ends up losing more face.

485
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:41,059
Miss Nie,

486
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:43,059
how long do you think

487
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:44,499
it'll take me to drive

488
00:30:44,499 --> 00:30:45,539
to that gap ahead?

489
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,499
Longer than beating you to a pulp.

490
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,019
Next questions.

491
00:30:59,019 --> 00:30:59,739
I ask, you answer.

492
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:00,739
Quick responses only.

493
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:02,019
Or we'll die together.

494
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,380
What are Earth Fiends?

495
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:09,259
What's "rooting and sprouting"?

496
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,700
Who are you people?

497
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:13,460
Why fight the Earth Fiends?

498
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:14,819
Done.

499
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:15,980
Do you need my repetition?

500
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:17,660
How do you know Gou Ya?

501
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,620
Not your concern.

502
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:22,299
You're not answering mine.

503
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,539
Why should I answer yours?

504
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,980
You have no choice.

505
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:43,779
Scared?

506
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:47,140
Dare to not hit the brakes?

507
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:48,660
Dare to keep silent?

508
00:31:55,339 --> 00:31:56,220
Lunatic.

509
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,660
Smash the window.

510
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,420
Break it now!

511
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,019
Hydrophobia?

512
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,579
Listen.

513
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:27,579
The water pressure

514
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,620
blocks the doors.

515
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:30,499
Stay calm. Small breaths. Save oxygen.

516
00:32:30,739 --> 00:32:32,259
Wait for the pressure to balance out.

517
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:33,220
Then open the doors.

518
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,299
Inhale and swim out.

519
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:34,900
Understood?

520
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:37,940
Can you swim?

521
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,620
Close your eyes and take a breath.

522
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:48,539
Trust me.

523
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,900
Inhale and hold it.

524
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,140
What are Earth Fiends?

525
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,660
What?

526
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,339
What's "rooting and sprouting"?

527
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,019
Stay away from me.

528
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,099
Who are you?

529
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,660
Why fight the Earth Fiends?

530
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:07,739
What?

531
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:09,380
Let me go!

532

Miss Nie.

535
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,300
You woke up without calling me?

536
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,579
I-I-I just woke up.

537
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,740
Perfect timing. The ginger tea's ready.

538
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,900

539

Lu,

540
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:23,659
how did I get back here?

541
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,699
You don't remember?

542
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:29,219
I heard the doorbell ring.

543
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,699
I went to open it

544
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:32,019
and found you lying there,

545
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,579
soaked to the bone.

546
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,380
I saw a white jeep.

547
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,099
It sped off as soon as I looked.

548
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:40,699
Weren't you going to the exhibition?

549
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,380
How'd you end up like this?

550
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:45,179
I-I-I drank too much.

551
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:47,059
It's fine. I had too much to drink.

552
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,340
At noon?

553
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:50,380
Who got you this drunk?

554
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:54,380
A contact from Mr. Lu?

555
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,340
Yes, that's right.

556
00:35:56,539 --> 00:36:00,460
First meeting, and you drank this much

557
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:01,740
and got yourself soaked?

558
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:04,900
No!

559
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,099
T-T-That's not what I meant.

560
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:07,980
I-I-I meant...

561
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,940
It's okay, Lu.

562
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,780
Just leave it there.

563
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,260
I'll drink it when I get up.

564
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,499
Alright.

565
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:15,659
Then drink it all while it's warm.

566
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,019
By the way,

567
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,420
I washed your wet clothes.

568
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,780
I found this in your coat pocket.

569

573
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:50,460
