(This story is a work of fiction)

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,813
=Episode 4=

17
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,100
Hungry?

18
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:11,899
You should've told me earlier.

19
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,060
Have some.

20
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,540
Yan Tuo.

21
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:24,579
Yan Tuo!

22
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:26,019
Xiong! Xiong!

23
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:27,260
Is that you, Xiong?

24
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,019
Behave yourself.

25
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:42,899
Quiet down.

26
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,259
You two are unreliable.

27
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,379
This place is probably found.

28
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,220
I'll go bring him out.

29
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:26,460
You two stay here.

30
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,660
Hold the fort.

31
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:28,980
Got it.

32
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:41,619
Let me get you some more.

33
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,419
No, thanks. I can't eat anymore.

34
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:46,660
Starving on the road,
then stuffing myself at home.

35
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,419
Not very healthy.

36
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:49,780
When you find food you love,
why not eat your fill?

37
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,179
There's no point in saving it.

38
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,340
Of course I won't keep it.

39
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,819
But I'll keep you around.

40
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,780
With you here,

41
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,900
I can eat whatever I want.

42
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,660
After this trip,

43
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,100
you learned to sweet-talk?

44
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:10,733
(Jiang Baichuan)

45
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:14,299
Hello?

46
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:17,460
The one you sent isn't an isolated case.

47
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,020
Go on.

48
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:21,259
Except the driver,

49
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,299
the other two were taken away.

50
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,179
Several men got injured.

51
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,780
Shan Qiang's fine.

52
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,939
Mrs. Hua's in the ICU.

53
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,819
Still critical.

54
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,220
(We checked the video.)

55
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:40,660
(The Whistle Whip worked,)

56
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,059
(meaning they were Earth Fiends.)

57
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:44,619
Xiong, you okay?

58
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,419
You too?

59
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,900
(With Mrs. Hua's skills,)

60
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,379
(she could handle multiple opponents,)

61
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,179
(but that humanoid Earth Fiend
was too tough.)

62
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:57,540
(Not sure why,)

63
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,859
(but Hound Clan
couldn't detect his scent,)

64
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,179
(so reinforcements were delayed.)

65
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:04,619
(He acted)

66
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,980
(like the Whistle Whip's sound
enraged him.)

67
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:08,739
(He attacked brutally.)

68
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,100
(So...)

69
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,900
Now, tell me
what you want from all this.

70
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,739
If you want to quit
being a South Mountain Hunter

71
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,820
after one more mission,

72
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:23,460
this mission

73
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:26,820
will happen soon.

74
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,379
Hope you're ready.

75
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,859
(Wanbao Tower)

76
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,019
The clothes arrive tomorrow?

77
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:38,700
Yeah, tomorrow.

78
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,539
Mr. Liu!

79
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:40,779
Going grocery shopping?

80
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,180
Garlic chives
are cheap today. Better hurry.

81
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:44,619
Even a vice principal

82
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,659
retires and buys his own groceries.

83
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,420
Dazhuang, come here.

84
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:50,980
The 108 Heroes I taught you.

85
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,739
You memorized them?

86
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:52,739
I did it ages ago.

87
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:53,739
I don't believe you.

88
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,100
Study them properly.

89
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:57,220
They'll help with college exams someday.

90
00:09:58,859 --> 00:09:59,820
A new face?

91
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:00,940
Xia!

92
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,739
Come to my room to cool down.

93
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,600
Get lost.

94
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,820
What's on your mind?

95
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,180
Have some herbal tea to cool off.

96
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,139
You came, Dr. Lv.

97
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:07,999
Bro.

98
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,460
Look. How about it?

99
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,060
Wow.

100
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,379
You really did it.

101
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,259
Of course.

102
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:13,060
Fine. Go ahead.

103
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,259
It could be worse.

104
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,060
None of your business.

105
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:18,139
Thank you.

106
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,539
(Wanbao Tower, Welcome)

Dragon in the Clouds, Gongsun Sheng.

109
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,739
(Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic)
I must be the Leisure Star.

110
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:32,940
I'm genuinely idle.

111
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,019
You don't ring until I pick the bag up.

112
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,300
Just wait.

113
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,539
If I could, you think I wouldn't answer?

114
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,779
(Open)

115
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:51,379
Sis.

116
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:53,659
No, I was out buying groceries.

117
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:54,539
My hands were full.

118
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,379
Yan Tuo?

119
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,619
Okay. I'm coming right away.

120
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,499
Tell Ms. Lin not to worry, okay?

121
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,340
Bro.

122
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,659
Bro.

123
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,300
Watch the shop for me.

124
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,659
Got it.

125
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:18,379
Don't be stingy with your ointment.

126
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,659
Hand.

127
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:22,259
I told you I'm fine.

128
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:23,739
Since I'm here,

129
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:25,779
at least, let me give
you the full treatment.

130
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,899
You don't know it.

131
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,779
Patients coming to my clinic

132
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,980
either have a weak stomach

133
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,580
or fertility issues.

134
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:36,700
Without treating external injuries,
my skills will get rusty.

135
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:37,899
Endure it. Endure.

136
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,619
Don't move.

137
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,460
Using me as practice?

138
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,539
Talk. How'd this happen?

139
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:51,619
None of your business.

140
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:54,019
When men fight,

141
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,820
there are usually two reasons.

142
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:57,700
Parking space disputes

143
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,580
or competition for mates.

144
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,060
What is your reason?

145
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,820
Who said this was from fighting?

146
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,859
I fell hiking.

147
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,899
Really?

148
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:10,220
That mountain's got sharp claws.

149
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:11,820
Enough already.

150
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,300
Your disappearance for days

151
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,619
had Ms. Lin worried sick.

152
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,619
Everyone's been searching everywhere.

153
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:21,859
And you were mountain climbing?

154
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,379
I skipped work today to give you

155
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:25,499
free medical care.

156
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,139
Not even worth honest words?

157
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,779
They were looking for me.

158
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,060
What did they say?

159
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,820
What do you think they should've said?

160
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,060
Tuo,

161
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:39,659
are you okay?

162
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:40,899
Where are you hurt?

163
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:42,379
It's nothing. Just a scratch. See?

164
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,220
You scared me to death.

165
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,100
Really, I'm fine.

166
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,820
Does it hurt?

167
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,539
No.

168
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,019
Maybe I shall go get some scrapes too.

169
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,300
Take physical pain from fights

170
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,539
for sweet concern from others.

171
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,340
Who did you fight with?

172
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:55,960
Not human.

173
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,080
Mountain.

174
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:58,779
Listen to this.

175
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,460
Tuofeng Mountain in Cangbei

176
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,220
has a very potent temple.

177
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:04,739
All the infertile couples
go there, right?

178
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:05,820
Can't you shut your mouth?

179
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:08,940
Does it hurt?

180
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,580
No. Really. It's barely noticeable.

181
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,259
Ms. Lin.

182
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:13,499
Thanks for coming, Lv Xian.

183
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:15,019
Tuo, are you alright?

184
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:15,700
Yes.

185
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,379
Don't worry. He's sturdy.

186
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,420
Some food and sleep will fix him.

187
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:21,779
Sorry to make you come here.

188
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,100
But I trust you more.

189
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,820
Ms. Lin, no need
for formalities with me.

190
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,899
If Roadsound Group hadn't funded

191
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,180
my TCM studies,

192
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,499
I wouldn't have this clinic.

193
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:31,779
You're a doctor?

194
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:33,340
I thought you ran a teahouse.

195
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:35,259
My examination found

196
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:36,580
he's not completely healthy.

197
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:38,019
He's got mouth issues

198
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,259
and cavities.

199
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,019
Lin Ling.

200
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,980
Take Dr. Lv out for a bit.

201
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,420
Serve some gratitude tea.

202
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,539
No need for formalities.

203
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:48,499
Just doing my duty.

204
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:49,820
Not just tea.

205
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,460
If time permits, share a meal too.

206
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,259
You young people should

207
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:55,259
interact more often.

208
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,060
Okay, Ms. Lin.

209
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:00,420
Dr. Lv, this way, please.

210
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,259
Enough with "Dr. Lv".

211
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,100
Too formal.

212
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,820
Call me Xian.

213
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:10,460
Hear that? Ms. Lin wants us
to hang out more.

214
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,820
You don't need to ask.

215
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,060
I'll tell you.

216
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,659
That day, didn't you ask me

217
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:18,379
to bring Gou Ya back first?

218
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,060
I encountered a landslide on the way.

219
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,460
Rocks were everywhere.

220
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,340
I couldn't see the road.

221
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,220
Difficult to navigate.

222
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:27,139
Out of nowhere,
a car ran fast towards me.

223
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:28,019
It hit me.

224
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,300
When I woke up,

225
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,460
I was locked up there.

226
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:31,940
What kind of car hit you?

227
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,379
It happened too fast. How could I see?

228
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,940
It might have been black.

229
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,460
How many people were there?

230
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,619
What did they say to you?

231
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,580
I saw three or four.

232
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,899
They didn't say anything.

233
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,980
They just locked me in an ice cellar

234
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,859
and didn't feed me.

235
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,300
Luckily, Xiong arrived in time.

236
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:53,420
I almost froze to death.

237
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:55,180
They didn't tell you anything?

238
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,420
But I pretended to be unconscious

239
00:14:58,739 --> 00:14:59,899
and heard them talking.

240
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,539
They seemed particularly
interested in Gou Ya.

241
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,180
Are you interested in him?

242
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:11,060
I-I-I'm just a bit curious.

243
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,779
A-A-Am I not supposed to be curious?

244
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:25,619
You've suffered.

245
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:29,019
It's nothing.

246
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,460
Do you think I owe you an explanation?

247
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,779
Explanation? It doesn't matter.

248
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,619
By all rights, this should end here.

249
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:52,940
No more discussions.

250
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:55,100
You're the face of Roadsound.

251
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:57,220
You should remain spotless.

252
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,899
I've been dreaming a lot lately.

253
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,859
Always about you as a child.

254
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,340
When I wake up, I remind myself

255
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,180
you've grown up now.

256
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:10,060
Time to know some truths.

257
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,899
Even shoulder some responsibilities.

258
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:15,499
Really?

259
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:19,980
Ms. Lin, I'm ready.

260
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,739
We're conducting human trials.

261
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:31,499
For pharmaceutical companies,

262
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:33,619
time is the biggest constraint.

263
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,340
Endless screening, approvals,

264
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,499
animal testing, clinical trials...

265
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,899
Any delay in these stages

266
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,300
could let competitors gain advantage

267
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,820
and let us lose the entire market.

268
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,019
Roadsound is both the mountain

269
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,659
the industry looks up to

270
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:53,300
and the one everyone wants to trample

271
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,859
to conquer.

272
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,259
So I took a risky shortcut.

273
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,259
What shortcut?

274
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,899
A drug enhancing cellular activity.

275
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,700
A groundbreaking new medicine.

276
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:10,259
We recruited many volunteers,

277
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,859
but only Gou Yan met the criteria.

278
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:15,019
We promised him money

279
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,659
and a job placement.

280
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,659
The welfare home.

281
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,019
The trials required multiple phases.

282
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,779
Held at the welfare home,

283
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:25,139
because it's remote

284
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,779
and it's our own funded project.

285
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,539
Easier to control all aspects.

286
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,420
Later, the drug caused

287
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,019
side effects in him.

288
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,980
As for what happened next,

289
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,180
you already know.

290
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,019
Choosing to take risks

291
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,220
means bearing the consequences.

292
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:55,499
Those who captured me

293
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:57,380
want to crush Roadsound

294
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
and surpass it...

295
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:00,819
Competitors, media,

296
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,140
envious people who hate success,

297
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,819
troublemaking lunatics, and so on.

298
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,160
So...

299
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:13,819
Tuo,

300
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,259
welcome to the adult world.

301
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,620
Ms. Lin,

302
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,940
I stopped being a child long ago.

303
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:30,980
You should've let me face this earlier.

304
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:33,579
No matter what challenges
Roadsound faces,

305
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,579
base persons or lunatics,

306
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,019
open or covert,

307
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:38,099
you can tell me.

308
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,259
Let me handle it all. Okay?

309
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:43,059
No matter your age,

310
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:45,499
you're still my child.

311
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:48,380
Rest well.

312
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,420
You should rest early too.

313
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,940
At first, we stayed hidden

314
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,299
and couldn't confront them directly.

315
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,099
Later on, they began to lose their grip.

316
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,700
Nowadays, only small-time thugs
patrol the mountains.

317
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,460
It seems we're gradually
gaining the upper hand.

318
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,059
But this time, we got careless.

319
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,339
We almost capsized in a ditch.

320
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,380
Back and forth.

321
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:47,140
When will this ever end?

322
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,420
Then let's make it quick.

323
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,860
Confident?

324
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,420
That woman used a Whistle Whip.

325
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,819
She's somewhat skilled.

326
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:57,620
Within their ranks,

327
00:19:58,019 --> 00:19:59,819
she's likely a key figure.

328
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,180
I dealt her a serious blow.

329
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,099
They won't abandon her.

330
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,420
I've checked all hospitals in Xicang

331
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,259
for patients matching her description.

332
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,779
Follow the trail,

333
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:10,099
and we'll find her.

334
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:11,460
No more mistakes.

335
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:12,739
Delays add risk.

336
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,779
Don't worry, Ms. Lin.

337
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,579
I know he wants to,

338
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,700
but keep Tuo out of this.

339
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:25,660
Of course.

340
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,739
Give it back! Give it back!

341
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,220
(Resident ID Card: Nie Jiuluo)
Nie Jiuluo.

342
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,660
Awake already?

343
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,660
I wanted to admire your work quietly.

344
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,180
How many years for trespassing?

345
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:16,499
Less than intentional assault, surely.

346
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,779
Self-defense.

347
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,140
No charges apply.

348
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,660
My apologies, Miss Nie.

349
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,739
This intrusion

350
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:34,700
is improper.

351
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:36,059
But these past days,

352
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,579
I've encountered inexplicable things.

353
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,180
You might hold the answers,

354
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,860
so I came.

355
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,360
Up.

356
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:45,940
What?

357
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,220
That's not for sitting.

358
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:49,099
Get up.

359
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:51,140
This chair?

360
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:52,980
Legacy Seat.

361
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,499
Created by Lausi Dandar in 1946.

362
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,140
Exhibited in 16 countries.

363
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,779
One of a kind.

364
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,420
The only one in existence.

365
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,779
No one would tell.

366
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:12,079
Listen.

367
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,440
Listen.

368
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,220
You prefer the hard way?

369
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:27,339
I...

370
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,099
Miss Nie.

371
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:35,980
It was a slip of the hand.

372
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:39,299
Your hand was cut? Is it bad?

373
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:42,099
No, I just fumbled it.

374
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:43,339
My hand's fine.

375
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,180
Don't worry. Stay downstairs.

376
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,980
Really?

377
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:51,220
I'm going to bed.

378
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:52,660
Clean up tomorrow.

379
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:55,900
Alright. Rest well.

380
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,860
You too.

381
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,579
Miss Nie?

382
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:21,819
What's wrong?

383
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:23,460
Nothing.

384
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,259
A fly got in.

385
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:26,299
I shooed it out.

386
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,460
Go to sleep, Lu.

387
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,499
Throwing stuff again last night?

388
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,779
Lu,

389
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,940
why mention this to him?

390
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,779
Mr. Lu came early...

391
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:11,499
It's fine, Lu.

392
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,819
Go about your work.

393
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:14,620
The great artist hasn't had breakfast.

394
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,420
Cook extra.

395
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:21,779
Go, Lu.

396
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,460
Van Gogh

397
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:33,380
painted Sunflowers first,

398
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:34,940
and then cut off his ear.

399
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:37,620
Beethoven

400
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,380
composed his Fifth Symphony,

401
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,339
and then went deaf.

402
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,739
Hemingway finished

403
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:46,059
The Old Man and the Sea and then

404
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,579
killed himself.

405
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:51,620
You haven't achieved anything yet.

406
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:54,140
Cut the dramatic act.

407
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,499
Madness is a master's privilege.

408
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,579
You're calling me mad?

409
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,180
This is your new piece?

410
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,059
Unfinished.

411
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,819
No appeal,

412
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:07,980
and progressing slowly.

413
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,900
Patience doesn't guarantee masterpieces,

414
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,819
but rushing never does.

415
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,539
Not rushing you.

416
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,860
Here to help you focus inward.

417
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,660
(Li Sheng'er, Mixiong's Trip)
The hottest sculpting artist now.

418
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,460
Drop by for a visit when you're free.

419
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:24,900
You call this an artist?

420
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:26,739
Why two tickets?

421
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:33,539
Don't you have any male friends

422
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,819
to visit exhibitions with?

423
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:37,579
Or grab meals together?

424
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:40,900
Trying to set me up
with another rich guy?

425
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,259
Not this time.

426
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,019
Pure art invitation.

427
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,420
Invite whoever you want.

428
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,019
I'll stay out of your personal life.

429
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,180
No one. Not asking anyone.

430
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,860
I'd be embarrassed
to ask someone to this exhibition.

431
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:53,539
Is money shameful?

432
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,700
Is being admired shameful?

433
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,620
If your exhibition sold out instantly,

434
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,420
I'd take the shame.

435
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,460
Then go hold one!

436
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,499
Instead of smashing things at home

437
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,980
or disappearing to the countryside?

438
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,140
Maybe

439
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,140
you feel you're getting closer to art,

440
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:10,420
but farther from real life.

441
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:14,299
What fascinates you most

442
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,380
and what suits you best

443
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,900
are rarely the same.

444
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,259
But you don't have to pick just one.

445
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:28,700
Go see it alone

446
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,539
if there's no company.

447
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,180
Treat it as a critical analysis.

448
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:35,339
Judge how shameful it truly is.

449
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:44,099
Lu, is the meal ready?

450
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,688
(You're slightly better
than Li Sheng'er.)

451
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:50,420
(Li Sheng'er, Mixiong's Trip)

452
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,660
What should we do later?

453
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:53,259
Not sure.

454
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,220
How about finding a cafe to sit in?

455
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,860
Hello, Chishui Street.

456
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:17,660
You even went to this exhibition

457
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:20,180
with pure commercial hype
and zero artistic value?

458
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,660
I thought you had better taste.

459
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,499
I regret not hitting
you harder yesterday.

460
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,420
I've been puzzled all night.

461
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,620
Aren't you an artist, Miss Nie?

462
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:34,940
Why are you so skilled?

463
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:38,660
Because you're too weak.

464
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,539
So you rescued me

465
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:44,620
out of pity yesterday?

466
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,620
I feared your corpse
would stain my courtyard.

467
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:51,980
Then why let go?

468
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:54,059
I didn't want your blood on my hands.

469
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,579
Why so many questions?

470
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,539
What do you want?

471
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,579
I came sincerely for advice yesterday,

472
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,739
and you threw me off the second floor.

473
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,220
I threw you?

474
00:30:06,499 --> 00:30:08,059
Answer three questions as compensation.

475
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:08,940
Just three.

476
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,059
Answer them,

477
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,299
and I'll never bother you.

478
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,739
What if I refuse?

479
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:18,819
You can't beat me.

480
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,380
Let me out now,

481
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:22,860
and we both save face.

482
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:24,019
Fine.

483
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:25,019
Let's see

484
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:26,460
who ends up losing more face.

485
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,059
Miss Nie,

486
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:51,059
how long do you think

487
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,499
it'll take me to drive

488
00:30:52,499 --> 00:30:53,539
to that gap ahead?

489
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,499
Longer than beating you to a pulp.

490
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:07,019
Next questions.

491
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:07,739
I ask, you answer.

492
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:08,739
Quick responses only.

493
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:10,019
Or we'll die together.

494
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,380
What are Earth Fiends?

495
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:17,259
What's "rooting and sprouting"?

496
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
Who are you people?

497
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:21,460
Why fight the Earth Fiends?

498
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:22,819
Done.

499
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:23,980
Do you need my repetition?

500
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:25,660
How do you know Gou Ya?

501
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,620
Not your concern.

502
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:30,299
You're not answering mine.

503
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,539
Why should I answer yours?

504
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:33,980
You have no choice.

505
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:51,779
Scared?

506
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,140
Dare to not hit the brakes?

507
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:56,660
Dare to keep silent?

508
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:04,220
Lunatic.

509
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,660
Smash the window.

510
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,420
Break it now!

511
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,019
Hydrophobia?

512
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,579
Listen.

513
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:35,579
The water pressure

514
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,620
blocks the doors.

515
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,499
Stay calm. Small breaths. Save oxygen.

516
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,259
Wait for the pressure to balance out.

517
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,220
Then open the doors.

518
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,299
Inhale and swim out.

519
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:42,900
Understood?

520
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,940
Can you swim?

521
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,620
Close your eyes and take a breath.

522
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:56,539
Trust me.

523
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,900
Inhale and hold it.

524
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,140
What are Earth Fiends?

525
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,660
What?

526
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,339
What's "rooting and sprouting"?

527
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,019
Stay away from me.

528
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,099
Who are you?

529
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,660
Why fight the Earth Fiends?

530
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:15,739
What?

531
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:17,380
Let me go!

532

Miss Nie.

535
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,300
You woke up without calling me?

536
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,579
I-I-I just woke up.

537
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,740
Perfect timing. The ginger tea's ready.

538
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,900

539

Lu,

540
00:35:29,499 --> 00:35:31,659
how did I get back here?

541
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,699
You don't remember?

542
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:37,219
I heard the doorbell ring.

543
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,699
I went to open it

544
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:40,019
and found you lying there,

545
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,579
soaked to the bone.

546
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:44,380
I saw a white jeep.

547
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,099
It sped off as soon as I looked.

548
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,699
Weren't you going to the exhibition?

549
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,380
How'd you end up like this?

550
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:53,179
I-I-I drank too much.

551
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,059
It's fine. I had too much to drink.

552
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,340
At noon?

553
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:58,380
Who got you this drunk?

554
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:02,380
A contact from Mr. Lu?

555
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,340
Yes, that's right.

556
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:08,460
First meeting, and you drank this much

557
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:09,740
and got yourself soaked?

558
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:12,900
No!

559
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,099
T-T-That's not what I meant.

560
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:15,980
I-I-I meant...

561
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,940
It's okay, Lu.

562
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,780
Just leave it there.

563
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,260
I'll drink it when I get up.

564
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,499
Alright.

565
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:23,659
Then drink it all while it's warm.

566
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,019
By the way,

567
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,420
I washed your wet clothes.

568
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
I found this in your coat pocket.

569

573
00:36:57,219 --> 00:36:58,460
