It's a long way ahead.
Let me tell you the full story.

55
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,000
Long ago,

56
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,120
there lived a deranged old woman
in Nanba Weald.

57
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,879
Childless her whole life,

58
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,159
yet she took in every orphan,

59
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,599
abandoned child,

60
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,560
or disabled infant

61
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:37,879
from nearby villages and towns

62
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:41,439
and raised them all alone
in the mountains.

63
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:43,840
A living saint, people said.

64
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,560
But here's the twist.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,919
Guess what?

and help each other,

92
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,040
right?

93
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,720
- Right.
- Right.

- Right.

a promising young leader

- You flatter me.
- We're finally meeting you in person.

100
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,240
Mr. Zheng, you're too kind.

101
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,720
My main purpose

102
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,959
is to introduce

103
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,759
Mr. Gou Yan to everyone

104
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,319
and to thank you

105
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
for giving our Roadsound Group

106
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,519
an opportunity to give back to society.

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,439
The one in green.

108
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,800
Your blood bag.

109
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,319
Keep close watch.

110
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,000
Mr. Yan, you're too kind.

111
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,000
Let me tell you straight up.

112
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,920
That old woman wasn't human at all.

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,959
She was a man-eating mountain fiend.

114
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,920
Hadn't the magistrate
whose daughter was missing

115
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,879
mobilized hunters
to search the mountains,

116
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,120
(Qiao Ya)
who knows...

117
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:51,920
Sorry.

118
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,720
This is my wife.

119
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,839
Mr. Yan, I know you're busy,

120
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,839
but today,

121
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,480
you must stay for dinner.

122
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,480
Mr. Zheng, thank you,

123
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,879
but we have other plans.

124
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,279
We shouldn't trouble you further.

125
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,680
Don't be so formal.

126
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,040
It's no trouble at all.

127
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,560
Just share a simple meal with the kids.

128
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,800
It's by your group's stan...

129
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,759
We have other matters to attend to.

130
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,639
I see.

131
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,560
Ms. Wang,

132
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,480
take Mr. Gou to acquaint him

133
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,759
with the facilities.

134
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,240
I'll escort the guests out.

135
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,160
Yes, Director.

136
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,480
It's okay, Tutu.

137
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,800
I will come find you later.

138
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,800
Go with Ms. Huang first.

139
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,759
Let's go.

140
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,759
Let's go.

141
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,800
Hello, Mr. Gou.

142
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,079
Ms. Wang,

143
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,839
be careful with your bandaged hand.

144
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,959
Just a minor cut.

145
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,879
It'll heal soon.

146
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,560
Alright then. After you, sir.

147
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,120
Mr. Zheng, you first.

148
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,800
After you.

149
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,439
Take a look.

150
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:10,920
Please.

151
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,160
We have an art studio,

152
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,360
a dance studio, and so on.

153
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:18,600
After you.

154
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,519
After you.

155
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,439
It was over.

156
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,959
A complete disaster.

157
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,639
Twenty strong hunters

158
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,839
were all bitten to death
by an old woman.

159
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,759
The magistrate was so terrified.

160
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,959
He stood frozen in the yard,

161
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,160
trembling like a leaf.

162
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,319
His head was spinning.

163
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,160
And he couldn't move an inch.

164
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:45,759
Finally,

165
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,879
he managed

166
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,879
to croak out a sound.

167
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,279
Then the old woman,

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,720
silent as death,

169
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:57,959
appeared right...

170
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,040
Darn it!

171
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:04,319
Rushing to your grave?

172
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,920
Nearly ran us into the ditch.

173
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,679
In this backwater place,

174
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,679
if anything happens,

175
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,879
there's no help for miles.

176
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,720
Oh my.

177
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,919
Miss Nie,

178
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,759
my apologies.

179
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,120
Where were we earlier?

180
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,879
Let's continue.

181
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,879
Mr. Sun,

182
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,480
please focus on the road.

183
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,879
Got it.

184
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,320
We're almost there.

185
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,840
Just past this bend.

186
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,720
Molten iron was poured

187
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,519
cauldron after cauldron

188
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,240
into these marshes.

189
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,679
Then one day,

190
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,799
torrential rains came,

191
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,440
making the area

192
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,480
steam for three days straight.

193
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,679
Ever since,

194
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,799
nothing grows for miles around.

195
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,399
Know what villagers call this area?

196
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,399
The Iron Coffin.

197
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,840
And where's this coffin?

198
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,600
Right behind this very mountain.

199
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,200
So

200
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,360
the old woman's tales

201
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,159
originated from here.

202
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,200
Villagers feared her

203
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,240
and worried she'd return to feast.

204
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,080
Guess what?

205
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,919
They pooled funds
to build a Temple of the Righteous Lord.

206
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,240
You know?

207
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,600
It's a Temple of Zhong Kui.

208
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,919
The temple enshrines
Lord Zhong Kui himself.

209
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,399
Mind the steps.

210
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,480
Zhong Kui catches ghosts, right?

211
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,399
With this lord

212
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,080
standing guard here,

213
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,519
no ghost,

214
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,960
fiend, or wraith

215
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,080
would dare come near.

216
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,279
But before building this temple,

217
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,440
something even stranger happened.

218
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,399
One day, the magistrate's mansion
caught fire...

219
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,480
What did you call this temple?

220
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,559
Temple of Lord Zhong Kui.

221
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,759
Does he have three heads and six arms?

222
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,559
Yes or no?

223
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,759
Aren't you the tour guide?

224
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,720
Well,

225
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,559
our Yanguan Province
has countless heritage-listed

226
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,679
grotto Buddha statues.

227
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,919
Four 5A-rated scenic spots

228
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,720
in Xicang alone.

229
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,080
Let me take you there.

230
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,320
It'll be worth your trip.

231
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,480
No need.

232
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,039
I came to see something unique.

233
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,440
Fair enough.

234
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,720
Artists always
take unconventional paths.

235
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,919
Such kinds of

236
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,039
folk religious carvings

237
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,000
don't follow standard conventions,

238
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,720
but they have their own charm.

239
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,799
Do you hate tourists like me

240
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,320
who ask about attractions

241
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,600
not in your scripted tour?

242
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,679
Nonsense.

243
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,440
It's a learning opportunity for me.

244
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,136
(Roadsound Welfare Home)

245
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,759
- Hurry.
- Come play.

246
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,960
Alright, kids,

247
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:07,159
let's wash up and eat. Come on.

248
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,399
- Okay.
- Okay.

249
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,480
Be careful.

250
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,080
Sculptor? Pfft.

251
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,279
I checked.

252
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:41,799
She sells toys.

253
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,000
And they're toy ducks.

254
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,720
No matter

255
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,440
how famous she is,
she shouldn't be so rude.

256
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,960
Look how she puts on airs,

257
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,720
acting like she carved

258
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,600
the Venus de Milo, David,

259
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,960
The Thinker,

260
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,759
or something.

261
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,759
So pretentious.

262
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,279
I told you not to take this job.

263
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,399
You wouldn't listen.

264
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,480
It's not that.

265
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,919
When the money's good,

266
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,759
cabbage becomes jade.

267
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,039
Who says no to that?

268
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,679
The big artist is paying well.

269
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,519
I need to save up
for the betrothal gifts.

270
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,360
Cut the act.

271
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,039
I think you're just

272
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,799
smitten with her pretty looks.

273
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,039
Don't be ridiculous.

274
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:25,879
You call her pretty?

275
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,440
She's nowhere near you. Right?

276
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,720
What's wrong?

277
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,080
I'll talk to you later.

278
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:36,879
Gotta go.

279
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,720
Sales of the old models

280
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,200
have dropped 40% already.

281
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
By month's end,

282
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,679
Ninja Duck needs three new skins.

283
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
(Mr. Lu)
Though you created it,

284
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,519
it doesn't belong to you anymore.

285
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,440
It belongs to customers and fans.

286
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,679
Harry Potter isn't J.K. Rowling's.

287
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,679
Sun Wukong isn't Wu Cheng'en's.

288
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,879
And Ninja Duck isn't yours, Nie Jiuluo.

289
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,759
Hermit Duck.

290
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,159
What?

291
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,960
It's Hermit Duck, not Ninja Duck.

292
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,720
That's what customers call it.

293
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,639
Don't correct your gods' pronunciation.

294
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,480
I can't cater to these 'gods' anymore.

295
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,720
I need real artwork.

296
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,360
Proper sculptures.

297
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,600
Not mass-produced toys.

298
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,799

299
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,320

Master Nie.

301
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,720
Your current wealth,

302
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,080
resources, and followers

303
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,679
all come from those mass-produced toys.

304
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,600
You're financially set now.

305
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,120
And you want to pursue art?

306
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,159
Don't take this the wrong way.

307
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,840
You're burning the bridge you crossed.

308
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,080
Burning the bridge?

309
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,879
There's landscape, architecture,

310
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,960
expression, and rage.

311
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,360
Great material. Let me jot this down.

312
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,080
New skins. New skins. New skins.

313
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,080
I want new skins
by the end of this month.

314
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,440
Ninja Duck.

315
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,399

316
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,720
Everyone back to your rooms.

317
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600

318

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,519
She started saying she hurts

323
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,240
and won't stop asking for Ms. Wang.

324

Where's Ms. Wang?

325
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,840
She's not back yet. Check on Tian first.

326
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,320
Okay.

327
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:50,919

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,720
It's done.

345
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:06,680
What?

346
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,920
Didn't you want to keep

347
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,559
(Diploma)
this outing with me from Ms. Lin?

348
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,559
I just deleted
the entrance surveillance footage.

349
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,039
Okay.

350
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,200
Thank you.

351
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,279
I'll treat you to dinner.

352
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,480
Where are you?

353
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,880
I can't cover for you for long.

354
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,799
Didn't I tell you I'm meeting a client?

355
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,559
I'll buy you some late-night snacks.

356
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,079
Mr. Gou Ya.

357
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,000
Yan Tuo?

358
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,000
What's wrong? Where are you?

359
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,920
Yan Tuo?

360
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:09,920
Yan Tuo?

361
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,400
Yan Tuo, talk to me.

362
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,079
Yan Tuo?

363
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,119
Yan Tuo?

364
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,599
Yan Tuo, talk to me.

365
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,119
Xiong.

366
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,920
I don't need a refund

367
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,559
or compensation.

368
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,519
I just need a proper explanation.

369
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,160
How could your guide

370
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,079
abandon a client
in the middle of the tour?

371
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:30,799
And even now,

372
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,319
I still can't reach him.

373
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,519
Didn't you say
to send another car for me?

374
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,079
Where's the car now?

375
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,200
How long must I wait?

376
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,200
Hello?

377
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,519
Hello?

378
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:52,793
(Low Battery)

379
00:25:18,312 --> 00:25:26,280
(Roadsound Welfare Home)

380
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,480
Hello?

381
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,240
Xiong, what's this?

382
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,519
You're just injecting him?

383
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,519
Weren't you meeting a client?

384
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,839
I was supposed to,

385
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,519
but then I couldn't find my phone.

386
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,079
I searched the car.

387
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,480
I thought maybe I left it

388
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,880
in the welfare home restroom.

389
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,279
So I came back,

390
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,599
and there it was on the sink.

391
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,880
Since I was already here,

392
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,440
and Gou Yan is your relative

393
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,400
in this new place,

394
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,160
I went to his dorm to leave some money.

395
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,839
Then what?

396
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,920
As soon as I entered
the dorm, you called.

397
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:08,839
Then

398
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,240
he lunged at me covered in blood.

399
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,240
You know the rest.

400
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:29,960
Wait.

401
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,240
Are you sure
he didn't bite or scratch you?

402
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,359
Absolutely not.

403
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,160
Didn't I tell you?

404
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,640
I checked my whole body.

405
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,279
You said

406
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,119
he lunged at you covered in blood?

407
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,039
Yeah.

408
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:46,119
He was covered in blood
when you saw him?

409
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:47,200
Right.

410
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,079
If you're not hurt,
where'd the blood come from?

411
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:32,279
(Ms. Lin)

412
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,079
Xiong?

413
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,319
Don't come closer.

414
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,240
Wait there for me.

415
00:30:11,432 --> 00:30:16,296
(Room 302, Binhai Grand Hotel)

416
00:30:23,784 --> 00:30:26,152
(Lu)

417
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,799
(Miss Nie, look.)

418
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:32,319
(I learned how to braise beef shank
from online videos.)

419
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,839
(It looks decent.)

420
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,079
(Miss Nie, the osmanthus
in our yard has bloomed.)

421
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,759
(Miss Nie,)

422
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,079
(I've already
changed the bedsheets twice)

423
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,640
(and cleaned all the windows.)

424
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,480
(If you don't come back soon,)

425
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,960
(I'll have to dig up
all the courtyard tiles)

426
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,480
(and relay them from scratch.)

427
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,480
(Otherwise, I'll feel guilty)

428
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:58,599
(about getting paid to loaf around.)

429
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,960
Mr. Sun?

430
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,640
What's wrong?

431
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,440
I...

432
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,319
I've already quit.

433
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,759
You'll get a refund.

434
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,759
If you need compensation,

435
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:02,960
contact the agency.

436
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,599
How did you get hurt?

437
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,920
Let me check.

438
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,279
No need. I have to leave.

439
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,920
You should leave too.

440
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,359
What happened?

441
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,920
Mountain fiend.

442
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,200
It was a mountain fiend.

443
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,720
It's alright. Stay calm.

444
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,440
Tell me what happened.

445
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,119
I can help you.

446
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,200
Mountain fiend.

447
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,599
Mountain fiend.

448
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,440
Let me see your wound.

449
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,960
Mountain fiend.

450
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,640
Mountain fiend.

451
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,000
Mountain fiend. Mountain fiend.

452
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:43,599
It's here.

453
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:44,559
Stay quiet.

454
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,559
The power's out.

455
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:35,240
What's going on?

456
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,240
The power's out?

457
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,640
Exactly. Why the blackout?

458
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:56,759
Mountain fiend.

459
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,088
Mountain fiend.

460
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,160
Mountain fiend.

461
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:00,960
Mountain fiend!

462
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,400
- What's wrong?
- Why the blackout?

463
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,920
Why isn't the power back?

464
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,079
The alarm!

465
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,840
Where?

466
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,280
Is there a fire?

467
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,119
- Go.
- Go downstairs.

468
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,840
- Fire!
- There's a fire!

469
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,360
Let's go.

470
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:10,719
Make way.

471
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,360
I'll leave.

472
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,639
Use the stairs.

473
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,880
This way.

474
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,000
Stop her!

475
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,519
Get downstairs now.

476
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,160
Hello, I'm Vivian.

477
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,120
Hi, I'm Yukou.

478
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,480
- We're the Vi-Yu Girls.
- We're the Vi-Yu Girls.

479
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,040
- Vi-Yu Girls!
- Vi-Yu Girls!

480
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,960
You're Mr. Gou?

481
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,960
Gou Yan. Just call him 'Gou Ya.'

482
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,040
Mr. Gou Ya.

483
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,040
Why not let Ms. Lin
get you an easier job?

484
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,680
Office work would be better.

485
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,200
Why come to this remote mountain area?

486
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,720
Look, there's nothing here.

487
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,760
If not for you,

488
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,960
I wouldn't have known

489
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,040
we support a welfare home.

490
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,200
Ms. Lin said

491
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,000
charity should stay pure.

492
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,280
It's not advertising.

493
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,520
No need for fanfare.

494
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,880
See? That's visionary thinking.

495
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,360
Mr. Gou Ya,

496
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,960
once we arrive,

497
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,160
just tell me what you need.

498
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,360
We're all family here.

499
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,280
Don't be shy.

500
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,320
I suppose it's in the family blood.

501
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,720
Your relative's quieter than you.

502
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,560
Not a relative.

503
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,560
More like a clansman.
