=Episode 11=

17
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,960
Get the door.

18
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,119
Open up.

19
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,039
The door is knocked off.

20
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,860
Xiong.

21
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,920
Business is picking up?

22
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,399
I found it yesterday.

23
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,599
Have you had blood drawn recently?

24
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,240
Not recently.

25
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
The last time

26
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,839
was during last year's
physical examination.

27
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,999
Last night when I was sleeping,

28
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,439
I felt it was strange.

29
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,559
Like I was passing out.

30
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:16,800
It was hazy.

31
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,040
I felt...

32
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:21,920
I felt like...

33
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,839
someone was touching me.

34
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,439
Don't panic yet.

35
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,879
You might've been exhausted lately

36
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,719
and had a bad dream.

37
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:42,999
Was this a dream too?

38
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,800
If this happens again,

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,960
call me immediately.

40
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
I did call,

41
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,480
but you were busy.

42
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,119
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,439
It was my oversight.

44
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,920
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,080
Hello?

46
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,080
Well?

47
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,679
Tell me, am I sharp or not?

48
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,279
I told you to leave early.

49
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:35,999
Wasn't I right?

50
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,879
What's wrong?

51
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,960
You know what?

52
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,679
Xiong Hei carried someone in.

53
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,080
He looked rushed.

54
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Looks like

55
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,159
it was a real struggle for them
to nab him.

56
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,039
No idea what that man did wrong.

57
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,560
Xiong Hei and his men
kept slapping him around.

58
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,279
They wanted me
to wake him up immediately.

59
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,560
Do you know who he is?

60
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,599
I didn't dare ask.

61
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:56,640
That's not protocol.

62
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,399
Heard them call him 'Gou' or something.

63
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:00,520
Gou Ya?

64
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,440
Yes.

65
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
Does that even sound like a decent name?

66
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,640
When I looked,

67
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,880
he looked like gang muscle.

68
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,479
Maybe even a top enforcer.

69
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,320
Even Xiong Hei's goons

70
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,880
got beaten to a pulp by him.

71
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,200
Got it.

72
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:13,479
Talk later.

73
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,239
Don't let Ms. Lin find out
that you've noticed this.

74
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,479
Keep your head down.

75
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't confront them.

76
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,760
Give me more time.

77
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,719
I'll fix this.

78
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,440
Okay?

79
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,919
If he hadn't run,

80
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,880
maybe it wouldn't have come to this.

81
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,960
Should we follow protocol?

82
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,640
Or let the group decide?

83
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:34,599
Ms. Lin, you have guests?

84
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,880
Perfect, let me introduce them.

85
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,440
Who doesn't know Ms. Lin's prized jewel?

86
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,560
We can introduce ourselves.

87
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:49,880
Hi, I'm Yan Tuo.

88
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:51,760
Sorry,

89
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,399
Ms. Lin never mentioned you all.

90
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,599
We've heard plenty
about you from Ms. Lin.

91
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,640
Ms. Lin, playing favorites?

92
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,200
The one who can't speak properly

93
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:04,279
is Yang Zheng.

94
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,320
Among the names we saw earlier,

95
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,760
(Roadsound Group List)
those who are still active...

96
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,520
That woman

97
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,760
is Li Yueying.

98
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:14,839
(They are all coming to Xicang.)

99
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,359
Let me formally introduce myself.

100
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,760
Feng Mi.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,239
Mi as in 'honey.'

102
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,479
Hello.

103
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,359
That bracelet's gorgeous.

104
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,880
Where'd you get it?

105
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,960
From a client.

106
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:43,919
Ms. Lin,

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,560
something's come up at work. Got to go.

108
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,520
My treat later.

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,799
Go ahead.

110
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,599
Okay.

111
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,560
Stay a bit longer.

112
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,279
Got shut down, huh?

113
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Ms. Lin,

114
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,440
your eldest son's quite the character.

115
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,919
I like him.

116
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,239
Enough.

117
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,440
How is Gou Ya doing?

118
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,120
Not badly hurt. He's fine.

119
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,560
Xiong Hei said they'll take him
when he wakes.

120
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,120
He ordered his men
to prepare at some farm.

121
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,200
Farm?

122
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,760
Lv Xian.

123
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,640
Mr. Lv, you're my savior.

124
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,039
Help me one more time.

125
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,919
Find any way to keep him here longer.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,479
How am I supposed to do that?

127
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,640
Should I tell him,
"We haven't bonded enough

128
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,080
and should drink and chat,"

129
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,159
when he wakes up?

130
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,320
Why not just keep him under?

131
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,880
This is urgent.

132
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,839
You really need to help me again.

133
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,999
What's going on?

134
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,839
Fine.

135
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,560
Then you should think carefully.

136
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,280
About what?

137
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,280
Obviously, how to thank me properly.

138
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,479
How to keep him?

139
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,759
They've all been treated.

140
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,759
Rest assured.

141
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:40,999
Those pals are all fine too.

142
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:41,999
Superficial wounds.

143
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:43,080
Except these two.

144
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,599
You should've come earlier for stitches.

145
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,119
Now it's too late.

146
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,960
Might leave a scar.

147
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Your wrist needs rest to heal.

148
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:56,040
Can't be helped.
Bone injuries need three months.

149
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:56,879
Right?

150
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,080
By the way, Xiong,

151
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,359
are you feeling alright?

152
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,320
It's a stupid question.

153
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,519
You're as tough as forged iron.

154
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,599
So go back and rest.

155
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,999
I'll tell you when he wakes.

156
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,280
No need.

157
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,119
We'll take him immediately
when he wakes.

158
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,400
At least eat something first.

159
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,680
You've been up all night.

160
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,160
Xiong,

161
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:24,519
the noodle shop to the right is good.

162
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:25,896
Try the green pepper noodle.

163
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:27,200
Tell their owner I sent you.

164
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:29,200
- You'll get extra toppings.
- Are you hungry?

165
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,080
No.

166
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,160
No.

167
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,160
Fully dedicated to your duties.

168
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,599
Selfishly embracing the world.

169
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,519
T-Then I'll refill his IV fluids.

170
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:50,719
Not hungry?

171
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,160
Yet who ate my takeout?

172
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,879
Not hungry?

173
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,599
Xiong.

174
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,400
What's that?

175
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,639
Medication. I'm switching it.

176
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,440
Why's the color different?

177
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,680
T-This is stronger.

178
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,800
You wanted him awake fast, right?

179
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,200
Wait.

180
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,359
W-What's with this?

181
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:33,639
What are you doing?

182
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Xiong, you don't trust me?

183
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:45,719
Remember this.

184
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,800
Roadsound Group helped me.

185
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,359
Ms. Lin isn't my mom.

186
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,160
But she raised me.

187
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,920
I know where my loyalty lies.

188
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,960
All these years,

189
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,800
you've come through here so many times.

190
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,119
Did I ever ask questions?

191
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,680
Did I demand a single cent?

192
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,879
Why?

193
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,519
I care about you buddies.

194
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,599
I know

195
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,400
your work's tough and thankless,

196
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,599
righteous but unseen.

197
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,599
I understand. I feel for you.

198
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,080
But who cares about me?

199
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:12,479
You keep coming here,

200
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:13,439
not holding back at all.

201
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,839
One day, you'll attract the police.

202
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:16,264
What becomes of Wanbao Tower then?

203
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,719
So I wanted to use strong medicine

204
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,239
to wake him fast.

205
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,440
So he can be taken away soon.

206
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,200
For you and me,

207
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,680
and for everyone, it's good, right?

208
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,560
You don't trust me? Fine.

209
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,800
Let's stick to conservative treatment.

210
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,320
Give back my fried noodles.

211
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,080
Why not use it earlier?

212
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,759
That medicine

213
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,920
has some side effects.

214
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:46,216
It might damage his brain.

215
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,759
He's brainless. Use it.

216
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,519
Are you sure?

217
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:56,960
Buy some fried noodles.

218
00:12:58,599 --> 00:12:59,239
Make it a large.

219
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,400
Fine.

220
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:05,680
Bro.

221
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,719
You and I have a history.

222
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:08,960
After all we've been through,

223
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,560
drop the tough act.

224
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,999
Alright?

225
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,119
Xiong.

226
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,879
Hei.

227
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,119
Get back to work.

228
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,479
You two still haven't finished?

229
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,280
Almost done.

230
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,320
Alright, I'll do it.

231
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,160
Come on.

232
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:45,320
Unbelievable.

233
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,359
Is it shift change time?

234
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:48,479
Not yet.

235
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,479
What? Am I early?

236
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,160
Then you continue.

237
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,999
No.

238
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:55,320
You've already started.

239
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,040
Not my shift yet.

240
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,479
You take over. I'm leaving.

241
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:57,999
Wait.

242
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,920
- Let's go.
- You two... I...

243
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,359
How utterly shameless.

244
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,080
Unbelievable.

245
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,719

(I gave strong meds. But he woke.)

250
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,639
(Xiong Hei took him away.)

251
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:44,839
Do you think Ms. Lin

252
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,359
will spare Gou Ya's life?

253
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:49,560
Why keep him? Let him bite you later?

Xiong.

265
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,559
Ms. Lin,

266
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:40,479
I was wrong.

267
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,799
Gou Ya...

268
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,559
Gou Ya was wrong.

269
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:49,440
Gou Ya was wrong.

270
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,799
Ms. Lin, his mistakes

271
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,519
deserve multiple deaths.

272
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,920
But with our current shortage,

273
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,519
keeping him

274
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,200
even as experimental material
to improve root removal...

275
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,360
If it were just occasional omnivory,

276
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,840
maybe we could spare him.

277
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,039
But fleeing recklessly
and nearly exposing us

278
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:22,440
endangered all of us.

279
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,920
We're already on thin ice.

280
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,440
There's no room for error.

281
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,279
My bottom line is absolute.

282
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:34,999
It's crossed by no human

283
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,719
and defied by no kin.

284
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,319
He's to be executed.

285
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,239
Is this necessary?

286
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:17,279
Baring fangs at Ms. Lin

287
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,424
is intolerable.

288
00:22:19,424 --> 00:22:20,512
(Mr. Changxi: It's me. Are you okay?)

289
00:22:20,512 --> 00:22:21,400
Exactly.

290
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,519
(It's me. Are you okay?)
Baring fangs at kin is taboo.

Hope it's also the last.

305

it's time for external ones.

You think we'd lock you up?

312
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,600
Leaving without a word?

313
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,559
Why is that?

314
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,440
I haven't had time to explain.

317
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:07,440
I'd never seen an Earth Fiend before.

318
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,479
I wasn't scared.

319
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:09,799
Now,

320
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,960
with so many
humanoid Earth Fiends out there,

321
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,600
can we tell them apart?

322

Even Shen

323
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,200
secretly kept
a live Earth Fiend at the base.

324
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:20,999
Tell me,

325
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,440
shouldn't I be scared?

326
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,960
I'm scared.

327
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,680
I fear death.

328
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,920
I fear my wife and my kids losing me

329
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,239
and my parents having to bury me.

330
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,079
Working with you,

331
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:32,960
it doesn't feel safe.

332
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:39,079
Anyone else leaving?

333
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,680
Anyone?

334
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,120
Speak up now.

335
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,920
Sorry, Big Head.

336
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,400
Any others?

337
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:32,759
Names once etched in fiend bones
are now burned to be sealed.

338
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,479
Leaving South Mountain behind,
no more fellowship remains.

339

340

Fiend bones tremble.

341
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,160
You're the Ghost Whip, Yu Rong?

342
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,680
You're back.

343
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,160
Shen, we've got a chance.

344
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,160
Sorry, who are you?

345
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,920
No one else leaving?

346
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,960
We'll introduce each other later.

347
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,400
Burn the bones.

348
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,600
Open the cauldron.

349
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,039
Stealing the Whip Clan's job?

350
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,999
Now you're secretly taming a fiend.

351
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,559
I've replicated 70% to 80%

352
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,120
of the Earth Fiends'
communication frequency.

353
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,279
With proper training,

354
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,999
it could become our ultimate weapon.

355
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:15,279
True, certain acoustic devices exist

356
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:18,680
to drive away protected marine species

357
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,600
and mammals.

358
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,759
But

359
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,519
we're far from fully controlling them

360
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,799
or communicating

361
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,799
with them.

362
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,960
Earth Fiends

363
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,880
aren't like trained seals

364
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,759
at an aquarium,

365
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,440
clapping on command

366
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,559
or balancing balls.

367
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,160
Whether to keep that Earth Fiend

368
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,319
can be put to a vote.

369
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,999
I vote to keep it.

370
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,120
To let it go, where could it go?

371
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:10,999
To keep it,

372
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,680
here's the safest place.

373
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,239
Our priority is rescuing Jiang.

374
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,999
I have no time for that thing.

375
00:33:52,704 --> 00:33:55,744
(Wanbao Tower)

376
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,039
Can't you see the sign says 'Closed'?

377
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,559
Come back tomorrow.

378
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,039
Open up.

379
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,600
I wondered who'd be so clueless.

380
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,840
What's your act now?

381
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,279
I keep asking for favors,

382
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:36,600
so I came to repay the debt.

383
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,160
As Wanbao Tower's esteemed owner,

384
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,519
shouldn't you dress sharply

385
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:41,440
and presentably?

386
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:43,079
Impossible.

387
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,479
From the out-of-season discount rack?

388
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,759
Or gifts from someone

389
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:48,440
in the wrong size? My gain then.

390
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,200
Don't want them?

391
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,920
Fine, I'll take them back.

392
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,559
Put them down.

393
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,519
After careful consideration,

394
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,440
you're up to no good.

395
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,720
As your sworn brother
from another mother,

396
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,960
I feel for you.

397
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,240
I can't bear seeing you rot

398
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,039
in this gloomy shack all day.

399
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,920
So change into these new clothes

400
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,199
and join me for some hiking.

401
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,519
No way.

402
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:27,999
No way.

403
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,479
Wait.

404
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,519
Wearing such expensive clothes
for hiking?

405
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,639
You've lost it.

406
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,720
Actually, fair point.

407
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,559
I brought something more practical.

408
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,679
If I return it, is it still mine?

409
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,240
This isn't meant for me, is it?

410
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,720
A deal is a deal.

411
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,440
We're here.

412
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,840
Master Wang, please.

413
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,880
Hurry up, or should I drag you?

414
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,360
Commit to the act fully.

415
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:31,800
Here we go.

416
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,840
Marvel at this.

417
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,800
Master Wang.

418
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:38,079
My humble collectibles

419
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,440
are displayed inside.

420
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,920
I've never really appreciated
those intricately crafted gold, silver,

421
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,519
and jade ornaments.

422
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:46,360
Elegant.

423
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:47,679
Very elegant.

424
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,360
Having your esteemed presence

425
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,639
truly brings radiance
to our modest venue.

426
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,440
You flatter me.

427
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,199
Please help me with your expert opinion.

428
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,240
Of course.

429
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,039
After you.

430
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,400
Hello, Mr. Yan.

431
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,119
Ms. Lin previously said

432
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,559
the Rare Stone Garden

433
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,400
won't be open to outsiders for now.

434
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,679
To outsiders?

435
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,679
Who is the 'outsider'?

436
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,880
Me or Master Wang?

437
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,479
Step aside...

438
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,720
Yan,

439
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,679
all matters
require proper timing and affinity.

440
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,960
If today is not the day,
we can try another day.

441
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,960
Actually, I have dinner plans tonight...

442
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,639
Such great patina.

443
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,199
With important clients and executives.

444
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,519
I should go get ready now.

445
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:30,479
It's about time anyway.

446
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:31,519
No.

447
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:32,400
Master Wang.

448
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,479
Please wait a moment.

449
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:34,559
My apologies.

450
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,920
What's wrong with you?

451
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,519
He's a notable guest for us.

452
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,199
Yanguan Province's urban plan
was designed

453
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,479
using his feng shui.

454
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,639
Do you know how much effort it took

455
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,199
to invite him
to inspect our Rare Stone Garden?

456
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:52,559
But it's closed to outsiders now.

457
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,400
Let me report this.

458
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,320
To whom?

459
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,440
I'm the General Manager.

460
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,599
Who will you report to?

461
00:37:59,079 --> 00:37:59,800
Listen.

462
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,280
If you mess this up today,

463
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,320
I'll skin you alive.

464
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:03,440
Treat him properly.

465
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,280
Now.

466
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,479
Master Wang.

467
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,360
Come on.

468
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,119
Master.

469
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:08,760
After you.

470
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,159
My apologies. Just a minor hiccup.

471
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,232
- Right.
- Not forcing you?

472
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:11,760
Not at all.

473
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,519
What are you talking about?

474
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,440
Please come inside.

475
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,240
As you can see,
this is our Rare Stone Garden.

476
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,599
Master Wang, what should

477
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,159
my mom be cautious about?

478
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Don't all parents say,

479
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,320
"Your wings have hardened,
and you no longer listen"?

480
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,999
So the root cause

481
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,639
lies in the wings.

482
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,639
The wings?

483
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,240
Make your mom believe
your wings aren't fully developed

484
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,599
and you can't fly far yet.

485
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,639
This will ease her mind.

486
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,039
How to achieve this?

487
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,079
She must avoid certain foods.

488
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,559
Certain foods?

489
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:45,280
Avoid anything with wings.

490
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:47,400
Like chickens and geese.

491
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,599
Well...

492
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,400
Quail.

493
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,440
Quail.

494
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,639
Ducks.

495
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,760
Cicadas, butterflies.

496
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,800
She can't have those.

497
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,920
That makes sense.

498
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,440
But my mom is a vegetarian.

499
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,240
Master, please come in.

500
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:08,159
Of course I know she's a vegetarian.

501
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,280
I was testing you.

502
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,280
Never mind.

503
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,960
Let me consult the hexagrams
for your mom

504
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,599
and create a dietary plan

505
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,599
to ensure absolute safety.

506
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,559
Excellent, Master Wang.

507
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,599
Master Wang,

508
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:29,800
this way, please.

509
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,800
Troubling.

510
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,720
What's wrong?

511
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,199
Don't scare me like that.

512
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,519
I rushed out this morning

513
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,199
and didn't cast a hexagram.

514
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,920
But getting angry just now
made me realize today is auspicious

515
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:45,920
for travel, weddings, and construction.

516
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,079
Everything's good to go,

517
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,999
just can't slip up.

518
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:51,199
What does that mean?

519
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,039
Can't have

520
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,880
slip-up lions.

521
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,199
Master Wang?

522
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,039
What did you say to him?

523
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:01,679
What happened?

524
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:02,479
Nothing.

525
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:03,519
We talked about my mom.

526
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:04,920
Then he suddenly became like this.

527
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,760
Right.

528
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:07,199
It's... It's Mom

529
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,039
Oh, my God.

530
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,800
From ancient times,

531
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,920
my great-grandmother is calling me.

532
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,039
Take care of him.

533
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:18,960
I'll get help.

534
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,280
You, come here and help.

535
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,400
Hurry up.

536
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,840
Help him.

537
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,119
Press his philtrum.

538
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,800
Check his pockets for medicine.

539
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,920
I'll call an ambulance.

540
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,639
Take care of him.

541
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,920
Any chance for a change in the menu?

542
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,240
Make the dough softer.

543
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,999
Who uses unleavened dough
for steamed buns?

544
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:50,159
Jiang Baichuan.

545
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,400
What? You're interested in this too?

546
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,720
Very interested.

547
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,560
Then you should thank Mr. Yan.

548
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,000
Mr. Yan.

549
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,080
Please come in.

550
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,920
You're Zhang, right?

551
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,920
Yes.

552
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,800
After eating your mulberries,

553
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,400
let me give you some advice.

554
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,880
Lean closer. I have some wisdom for you.

555
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,080
Yes, Master Wang?

556
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,160
Judging from your facial features,

557
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,760
tell your mom
to watch her digestive health.

558
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,640
You can tell my mom's

559
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,280
health condition from my face?

560
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,040
Of course.

561
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,120
Longing is a mysterious thing.

562
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,560
Your mom's concern for you

563
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,440
is like an invisible hand,

564
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,120
following you everywhere.

565
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,640
It rests on your shoulders,

566
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,920
weighs on your chest,

567
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,120
and manifests in your complexion.

568
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,200
Please continue, Master Wang.

569
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,480
I'm all ears.
