(This story is a work of fiction)

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,960
=Episode 8=

17
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:25,004
Then,

18
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:26,323
goodbye.

19
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:29,404
We're unlikely to meet again.

20
00:02:33,963 --> 00:02:36,043
If you want to thank me
for saving your life,

21
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,603
promise me two things.

22
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:39,404
Go ahead.

23
00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:41,763
No matter

24
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:44,323
who asks about recent events,

25
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:45,483
never mention me.

26
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:47,684
I want no more ties

27
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:49,364
to South Mountain Hunters
or Earth Fiends.

28
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:52,284
And second?

29
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:57,163
The South Mountain Hunters have chosen

30
00:02:57,203 --> 00:02:58,524
a difficult yet righteous path.

31
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:01,524
Though I'm not in a position to judge,

32
00:03:02,323 --> 00:03:03,084
I still hope

33
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:04,603
you'll keep cooperating with them.

34
00:03:05,364 --> 00:03:06,763
This could be your chance

35
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:09,443
to avenge your mother

36
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,723
and find your sister.

37
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:14,923
If you agree,

38
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:16,524
I can help arrange contact.

39
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:18,964
Deal.

40
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,284
You actually

41
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:54,323
do have some redeeming qualities.

42
00:03:58,483 --> 00:03:59,524
After all this time,

43
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:01,163
it's the highest praise

44
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:02,524
I've ever gotten from you.

45
00:04:15,284 --> 00:04:16,163
Miss Nie.

46
00:04:18,163 --> 00:04:19,483
You're finally back.

47
00:04:21,004 --> 00:04:21,832
What's for the meal?

48
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:23,964
Whatever you make is fine.

49
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:25,603
Let me help.

50
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:26,163
No need.

51
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:27,723
I can handle it myself.

52
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:06,248
(Nie Jiuluo)

53
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:04,804
The long blade dispels life.

54
00:06:06,044 --> 00:06:07,164
The short one pursues death.

55
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:09,164
Luo,

56
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:12,924
with the Life-Death Blade,

57
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:15,564
you are Mad Blade.

58
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:28,044
Miss Nie, you should rest.

59
00:07:28,203 --> 00:07:29,963
I'll make soup dumplings quickly.

60
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:31,244
Let me help.

61
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:32,724
No need to trouble yourself.

62
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:35,604
It's okay. I'm just idling anyway.

63
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:40,724
Weren't you supposed to help Mom?

64
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:42,484
Why are you crafting alone?

65
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,604
Luo, this is the last one.

66
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,124
We can't waste food.

67
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:51,564
See how skillful our daughter is.

68
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:57,523
Keep praising her.

69
00:07:57,523 --> 00:07:58,564
We'll run out of dough.

70
00:07:58,643 --> 00:07:59,564
This is on you.

71
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:00,843
So what?

72
00:08:01,323 --> 00:08:02,804
We can turn the rest of the filling

73
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:04,164
into meatballs.

74
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:08,443
Press here.

75
00:08:10,763 --> 00:08:11,523
Spin faster.

76
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:12,283
Your method...

77
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:13,843
isn't working.

78
00:08:19,484 --> 00:08:22,164
You remembered something happy?

79
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:30,484
Nothing.

80
00:08:31,203 --> 00:08:33,484
Just feels nice like this.

81
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:36,443
That's good.

82
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:38,083
Then in the future,

83
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,763
stop wandering off so often.

84
00:08:39,924 --> 00:08:40,763
Come home more.

85
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:42,484
No place compares to home.

86
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:00,084
You...

87
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:01,604
I didn't let you in.

88
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:03,484
Miss Nie.

89
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,283
It's okay, Ms. Lu. He's my friend.

90
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:09,163
You can go.

91
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:11,004
Alright.

92
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:16,683
Jiang's in trouble.

93
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,016
(Massage, Foot Spa, Wellness)

94
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,046
(Nutritious Breakfast)

95
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:48,084
(Free Checkups)

96
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:49,923
Keep it dry. Avoid irritants.

97
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,283
I shouldn't need to remind you.

98
00:09:51,403 --> 00:09:53,160
Return in three days
for a dressing change.

99
00:09:53,324 --> 00:09:53,844
Got it.

100
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:55,923
You're practically a doctor by now.

101
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:56,883
So no need to return.

102
00:09:57,124 --> 00:09:58,364
Buy gauze and do it yourself.

103
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:00,283
Say hi to Xiong.

104
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:01,724
- Okay.
- Okay.

105
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,512
(Massage)

106
00:10:25,604 --> 00:10:26,523
What?

107
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:27,763
Forget something?

108
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:32,563
Can't you read 'Closed'?

109
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:46,124
Front shop, back clinic.
This is shady business.

110
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:48,043
Don't say that.

111
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:50,043
If the Dragon King needs a jade bed,

112
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:51,643
Xicang's Wanbao Tower has it.

113
00:10:52,244 --> 00:10:53,324
My dream was to open

114
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:56,204
an East-meets-West place

115
00:10:57,163 --> 00:10:58,403
where food is medicine.

116
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:00,444
Whether you're injured

117
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:01,643
or ill or something,

118
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:03,244
you can find solutions here.

119
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:04,964
What about Xiong Hei?

120
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:06,444
What 'solutions' for them?

121
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:09,964
Aren't they doing business?

122
00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:12,124
Working in all weathers,

123
00:11:12,244 --> 00:11:13,403
illnesses and ailments

124
00:11:14,043 --> 00:11:14,643
are normal.

125
00:11:17,204 --> 00:11:18,084
Seems like

126
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:20,643
Ms. Lin hasn't funded
your education or business

127
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:22,484
entirely for charity.

128
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,163
You apply what you've learned.

129
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:30,403
Aren't you from Roadsound too?

130
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:32,364
What?

131
00:11:32,923 --> 00:11:34,763
Are you turning in your own?

132
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,763
Now you accept me as your own?

133
00:11:39,004 --> 00:11:40,803
Weren't you guarding against me earlier?

134
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:48,124
What do you want?

135
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:50,124
What's with you?

136
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:52,324
After all these years, what now?

137
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:53,923
You came all this way to expose me?

138
00:11:57,403 --> 00:11:59,844
Fine. If you truly consider me your own,

139
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:02,403
examine me.

140
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:09,883
I got injured from a hiking fall.

141
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:20,204
Yes. It doesn't look
like hiking injuries.

142
00:12:20,444 --> 00:12:21,204
No questions.

143
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:22,724
Just find me a resting place.

144
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:28,163
It's definitely from hiking.

145
00:12:29,043 --> 00:12:29,923
I can tell.

146
00:12:30,324 --> 00:12:30,923
Stop that.

147
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,124
After you.

148
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,403
Why did you leave Jiang here?

149
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:55,883
It was urgent,

150
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:57,803
and he insisted on staying.

151
00:13:58,444 --> 00:13:59,244
So I didn't argue...

152
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:00,523
But you should've insisted too.

153
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:04,204
I'm sorry, Luo.

154
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:06,124
It's my mistake.

155
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:23,883
If

156
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:26,283
I had stayed to cover

157
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,244
and gotten captured instead,

158
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:33,444
would you be blaming Jiang

159
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:35,683
the way you are now?

160
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:14,923
Laobanzhang Tea,

161
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:16,604
an ancient tree tea.

162
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:26,163
You people

163
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:28,364
know tea?

164
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:31,403
With millennia of tea culture,

165
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:34,004
we newcomers wouldn't claim expertise.

166
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:36,604
Yet you presume mastery.

167
00:15:37,124 --> 00:15:38,444
With history merely a blink

168
00:15:38,643 --> 00:15:41,004
in the eyes of heaven and earth,

169
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:44,124
how dare you pose as nature's overlords?

170
00:15:47,844 --> 00:15:49,803
Arrogance didn't bring humanity

171
00:15:49,803 --> 00:15:50,844
to its current state.

172
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:54,364
Most of our progress

173
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:57,803
comes from exploration, curiosity,

174
00:15:58,004 --> 00:15:59,283
and constant error correction,

175
00:15:59,283 --> 00:15:59,844
and yes,

176
00:16:01,324 --> 00:16:02,283
some luck.

177
00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:04,964
That's how we've achieved this.

178
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,484
If you just imitate us

179
00:16:06,763 --> 00:16:09,964
without understanding,

180
00:16:11,563 --> 00:16:13,204
you'll stumble through endless detours.

181
00:16:15,523 --> 00:16:18,724
So how did
the South Mountain Hunters decline

182
00:16:19,124 --> 00:16:20,004
to this state?

183
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:21,604
Underestimation?

184
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:23,043
Complacency?

185
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:24,283
Or fractured organization?

186
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:30,643
Once the Blade, Hound, and Whip clans

187
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:32,563
worked seamlessly together.

188
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:35,324
Yet this time,

189
00:16:36,004 --> 00:16:38,124
only Mad Dog fought seriously.

190
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:42,444
When will we see the Whip Clan

191
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:44,883
and Blade Clan's prowess?

192
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:53,683
Do you feel sorry?

193
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:00,004
I'd say

194
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:01,803
you should be grateful.

195
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:05,324
Had you encountered all three,
Ghost Whip,

196
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:06,523
Mad Dog,

197
00:17:07,043 --> 00:17:07,883
and Mad Blade,

198
00:17:08,964 --> 00:17:10,484
you wouldn't live to see the sun.

199
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:11,724
No need to summon them.

200
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:14,004
I'll visit them myself.

201
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,244
So Mr. Jiang,

202
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:19,283
please reveal Mad Blade's identity.

203
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:22,084
Or you won't live to see

204
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,604
tonight's moon.

205
00:17:27,084 --> 00:17:29,163
So this tea meeting is about this?

206
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:31,123
Should've said so earlier.

207
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:35,283
Our generation's Mad Blade
was Old Blade.

208
00:17:35,884 --> 00:17:37,323
You've already fought him.

209
00:17:39,164 --> 00:17:39,684
He was

210
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:42,123
badly wounded by him.

211
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:46,404
Old Blade!

212
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:21,884
Sir?

213
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:23,204
What's happening, sir?

214
00:18:24,164 --> 00:18:25,083
Where are we going?

215
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:28,004
Sir?

216
00:18:31,523 --> 00:18:32,204
Jiang?

217
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:35,523
You ask me?

218
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:37,924
I should be questioning you.

219
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,283
Will you rescue me

220
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:42,283
and my brothers or not?

221
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:01,843
Jiang! Jiang!

222
00:19:05,164 --> 00:19:05,884
Jiang!

223
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:20,484
Sir,

224
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:22,843
I want to change the destination.

225
00:19:23,043 --> 00:19:24,884
The meter's running. It's up to you.

226
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:28,924
I'm going to South Mountain.
It might be a bit far.

227
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:32,283
Anywhere within the province is fine.

228
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:42,964
You risked your life

229
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:44,884
covering your team's retreat.

230
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:46,964
Now you're suddenly being candid?

231
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:48,843
How can I trust you?

232
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:06,924
I

233
00:20:09,763 --> 00:20:11,004
am in your custody now.

234
00:20:11,964 --> 00:20:13,684
And we've lost Mad Blade
as our trump card.

235
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:16,603
There's no reason for me
to bluff with you.

236
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:23,444
Maybe...

237
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:26,444
maybe it's just as you said.

238
00:20:27,563 --> 00:20:29,644
The South Mountain Hunters
declined to this state

239
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,843
because of underestimation, complacency,

240
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:34,563
and fractured organization.

241
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:39,283
Moreover, my candor

242
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:42,123
is meant to secure
my companions' freedom.

243
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,123
They have their own lives to live.

244
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:50,523
For them, being South Mountain Hunters

245
00:20:51,123 --> 00:20:52,404
is just a job,

246
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:54,204
not a calling.

(Rare Stone Garden)

248
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,523
I haven't seen Yan Tuo
these past few days.

249
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:27,763
"Xiong,

250
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,363
I met this girl recently.

251
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:31,684
Feisty one.

252
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:33,964
I'm taking her hiking
for a couple of days.

253
00:21:34,523 --> 00:21:35,924
If Ms. Lin asks,

254
00:21:36,043 --> 00:21:37,523
cover for me.

255
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:39,363
Say I'm on a business trip."

(Xicang's Nanshan Rescue Team's

258
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:03,323
First Mrs. Hua was seriously injured.

259
00:22:04,004 --> 00:22:05,404
Then Mr. Crip.

260
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:11,043
Now even Jiang's been captured.

261
00:22:11,444 --> 00:22:12,803
South Mountain Hunters?

262
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:15,563
More like South Mountain prey.

263
00:22:17,523 --> 00:22:18,884
Enough talk.

264
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:23,204
I'll pull seniority to speak first.

265
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:25,363
With Baichuan gone,

266
00:22:25,363 --> 00:22:26,644
we can't remain leaderless.

267
00:22:27,164 --> 00:22:28,164
The priority

268
00:22:28,444 --> 00:22:29,724
is finding someone to lead.

269
00:22:30,603 --> 00:22:31,444
That should be you.

270
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:33,283
You're the most senior and respected.

271
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:34,444
Right, Mr. Crip.

272
00:22:34,924 --> 00:22:35,884
You should lead us.

273
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,043
We'd all follow.

274
00:22:38,164 --> 00:22:39,244
If I lead,

275
00:22:39,684 --> 00:22:41,323
I won't let us be humiliated like this.

276
00:22:41,644 --> 00:22:43,204
Those inhuman beings,

277
00:22:43,204 --> 00:22:44,283
every last one of them,

278
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:45,684
will be wiped out.

279
00:22:45,724 --> 00:22:46,924
We'll rescue Baichuan.

280
00:22:47,123 --> 00:22:49,043
- Great!
- Great!

281
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:52,204
Great?

282
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:55,763
Who attacked us?

283
00:22:56,724 --> 00:22:57,603
Who are they?

284
00:22:57,684 --> 00:22:58,484
Where are they now?

285
00:22:58,523 --> 00:22:59,244
Do you know?

286
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:00,884
And

287
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:03,363
which direction should we investigate?

288
00:23:10,843 --> 00:23:12,004
At my age,

289
00:23:13,004 --> 00:23:14,803
I know my limitations.

290
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,684
I'm more temper than talent.

291
00:23:18,404 --> 00:23:19,363
In real crises,

292
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:22,283
I might not stay calm
like you youngsters.

293
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,363
So I can't lead.

294
00:23:25,964 --> 00:23:27,123
But if you

295
00:23:27,244 --> 00:23:28,803
truly respect me as your elder,

296
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,004
I'll name someone.

297
00:23:46,563 --> 00:23:47,484
Xing Shen

298
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,283
has lived here for years

299
00:23:50,603 --> 00:23:52,603
and knows South Mountain
better than any of us.

300
00:23:53,363 --> 00:23:54,843
I watched him grow up.

301
00:23:55,444 --> 00:23:56,563
Everything he does

302
00:23:57,004 --> 00:23:59,004
prioritizes the Hunters' interests

303
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,004
above all else.

304
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:03,763
With Mad Blade and Ghost Whip gone,

305
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:06,563
Mad Dog should naturally lead.

306
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:10,004
Someone who kept an Earth Fiend
leading us?

307
00:24:10,724 --> 00:24:12,283
It's like a rat among the cats' ranks.

308
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:13,763
I don't know about you,

309
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,083
but this disgusts me.

310
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:16,323
About that matter,

311
00:24:16,484 --> 00:24:18,043
Jiang already concluded it

312
00:24:18,043 --> 00:24:19,164
with proper resolution.

313
00:24:19,843 --> 00:24:22,043
Hadn't that Earth Fiend
appeared that day,

314
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:23,803
disrupting the enemy's plans,

315
00:24:24,244 --> 00:24:25,724
we'd have suffered heavier losses.

316
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:27,244
Since when did that fiend help?

317
00:24:27,323 --> 00:24:27,884
Exactly.

318
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:28,644
I think...

319
00:24:29,404 --> 00:24:30,603
We need long-term planning.

320
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:31,924
Enough arguing.

321
00:24:39,884 --> 00:24:40,843
Let's vote then.

322
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,603
I agree Xing Shen
should lead temporarily.

323
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:47,884
Show of hands.

324
00:25:04,843 --> 00:25:06,763
Shen will help us all.

325
00:25:08,763 --> 00:25:10,204
Ma trusts him.

326
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:11,803
Ma trusts in Shen.

327
00:25:14,123 --> 00:25:14,924
In the past,

328
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,803
Mom trusted Shen too.

329
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:48,404
The ink line on wood becomes the rule.

330
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:49,964
It's majority support.

331
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:50,803
Done.

332
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:56,484
South Mountain is in your hands now.

333
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:01,803
Don't let me down.

334
00:26:36,043 --> 00:26:37,404
Thank you for your trust.

335
00:26:38,244 --> 00:26:39,323
I'll

336
00:26:40,363 --> 00:26:42,484
temporarily take Jiang's position.

337
00:26:43,043 --> 00:26:45,603
I've contacted Ghost Whip and Mad Blade.

338
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,043
They've confirmed participation.

339
00:26:49,724 --> 00:26:51,444
With unity,

340
00:26:51,803 --> 00:26:53,803
we'll rescue Jiang quickly.

341
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:55,724
Ghost Whip is one thing,

342
00:26:55,724 --> 00:26:56,444
but Mad Blade

343
00:26:57,164 --> 00:26:59,484
was difficult even when Jiang led us.

344
00:27:00,004 --> 00:27:00,964
Will she come?

345
00:27:02,043 --> 00:27:02,644
Right.

346
00:27:06,244 --> 00:27:07,004
She will.

347
00:27:12,763 --> 00:27:13,763
It's fine.

348
00:27:14,004 --> 00:27:15,123
Don't worry.

349
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:18,083
You've worked hard these years.

350
00:27:19,283 --> 00:27:20,404
Spend time with family.

351
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:22,924
In these peaceful times,

352
00:27:23,004 --> 00:27:24,123
what could go wrong?

353
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:24,924
Right?

354
00:27:25,323 --> 00:27:26,484
Even if trouble comes,

355
00:27:26,724 --> 00:27:28,964
Banya Mountain and Qiaotou Gully

356
00:27:29,444 --> 00:27:31,603
have sent reinforcements recently.

357
00:27:32,803 --> 00:27:34,603
You just rest another fortnight.

358
00:27:35,123 --> 00:27:35,964
We got this.

359
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:38,803
No need.

360
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,684
I just check on the mountains
once in a while.

361
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:43,363
Stop worrying.

362
00:27:45,603 --> 00:27:46,843
Alright, it's settled then.

363
00:27:47,004 --> 00:27:47,603
I need to go.

364
00:27:52,523 --> 00:27:54,164
Why not recruit your team

365
00:27:54,563 --> 00:27:55,884
to join us?

366
00:27:56,924 --> 00:27:58,523
At least we'd look formidable.

367
00:27:59,123 --> 00:28:00,444
Might scare others.

368
00:28:05,363 --> 00:28:06,684
Can't even shut you up with food?

369
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:10,763
'Peaceful times'?

370
00:28:11,444 --> 00:28:12,123
What's wrong?

371
00:28:12,283 --> 00:28:14,083
Having food is peace.

372
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:17,763
But some can't eat anymore.

373
00:28:18,884 --> 00:28:20,843
Sun Zhou is starving himself.

374
00:28:21,763 --> 00:28:22,283
Really?

375
00:28:24,043 --> 00:28:25,083
He's been refusing meals,

376
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,004
saying cooked food disgusts him.

377
00:28:27,283 --> 00:28:28,763
I think it's time.

378
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,763
I need to check on him.

379
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:34,763
We already have one Earth Fiend.

380
00:28:34,924 --> 00:28:37,004
Can't handle another biter.

381
00:29:41,644 --> 00:29:42,444
Today,

382
00:29:46,283 --> 00:29:47,363
I spoke harshly.

383
00:29:47,363 --> 00:29:49,083
I should've stayed behind

384
00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:52,323
instead of letting Jiang take the risk.

385
00:29:58,803 --> 00:30:00,164
No one expected

386
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:01,763
that situation.

387
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:03,244
It's not your fault.

388
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:07,083
Besides apologizing,

389
00:30:08,164 --> 00:30:09,323
I want to say

390
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:11,724
I have a friend

391
00:30:12,484 --> 00:30:14,164
who might help rescue Jiang.

392
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:16,083
But

393
00:30:17,924 --> 00:30:19,004
it's risky.

394
00:30:21,164 --> 00:30:21,843
A friend?

395
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:24,244
Sun Zhou's gone!

396
00:30:24,684 --> 00:30:25,924
Sun Zhou's gone!

397
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:49,484
All this time,

398
00:30:49,684 --> 00:30:50,924
Sun Zhou has been locked up?

399
00:30:53,563 --> 00:30:55,283
He has red threads through his pupils.

400
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:58,404
We should've sent him to Golden Gate,

401
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,603
but Jiang stopped us.

402
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,924
I begged Jiang to save him.

403
00:31:12,444 --> 00:31:13,884
You're too softhearted.

404
00:31:15,523 --> 00:31:17,043
It's South Mountain Hunters' duty

405
00:31:17,404 --> 00:31:18,563
to protect civilians

406
00:31:18,563 --> 00:31:19,684
from Earth Fiends.

407
00:31:20,363 --> 00:31:21,523
How's that softhearted?

408
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,043
We called you 'Nine Oxen' as kids.

409
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:28,523
Do you remember?

410
00:31:33,803 --> 00:31:34,803
I'd forgotten.

411
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:37,684
Jiang said

412
00:31:38,444 --> 00:31:40,004
you seem obedient,

413
00:31:41,283 --> 00:31:42,603
yet stand firmest.

414
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:45,004
Not even nine oxen

415
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:47,684
can turn you from your course.

416
00:31:50,563 --> 00:31:51,404
If we delay,

417
00:31:51,684 --> 00:31:53,043
even nine horses won't catch him.

418
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:54,244
Sit tight.

419
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:04,323
How'd you track Sun Zhou?

420
00:32:04,644 --> 00:32:05,924
He stole Big Head's phone

421
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,244
while escaping.

422
00:32:08,164 --> 00:32:09,244
It has GPS.

423
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:12,523
Jiang's phone doesn't?

424
00:32:14,123 --> 00:32:15,363
Big Head uses the rescue team's

425
00:32:15,363 --> 00:32:16,684
dedicated tracking system.

426
00:32:21,123 --> 00:32:22,404
Maybe we didn't need it before.

427
00:32:23,684 --> 00:32:25,843
Let's get everyone equipped
in the future.

428
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,404
Given his movement speed,

429
00:32:31,803 --> 00:32:32,763
let's go faster.

430
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:02,043
I'm back.

431
00:33:04,644 --> 00:33:05,763
It's too remote here.

432
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:07,563
This was all I could get.

433
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:10,644
Make do with this for now.

434
00:33:15,523 --> 00:33:16,244
(Cang Water)
Have some water.

435
00:33:22,924 --> 00:33:23,724
What are you doing?

436
00:33:32,523 --> 00:33:33,484
Are you in trouble?

437
00:33:34,563 --> 00:33:37,444
You came alone to this wilderness,

438
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:40,404
saying you were hiding at your uncle's.

439
00:33:46,204 --> 00:33:47,283
Let me go.

440
00:33:48,563 --> 00:33:49,684
I'll get mad.

441
00:34:09,244 --> 00:34:10,204
Let me go.

442
00:35:03,243 --> 00:35:05,163
She's fine, no bites.

443
00:35:05,243 --> 00:35:06,312
I'll get her to hospital.

444
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:09,163
I'll take Sun Zhou back then.

445
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:12,523
He's innocent.
He just got dragged into it.

446
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:14,163
Try to help him.

447
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:17,844
I will.

448
00:37:10,964 --> 00:37:12,924
(Nie Jiuluo: 9:00, Spring Return Road)

449
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:21,243
(Just saw it. On my way now,)

450
00:37:21,243 --> 00:37:23,563
(but I'll be a few minutes late.)

451
00:37:35,804 --> 00:37:36,643
Miss Nie,

452
00:37:36,643 --> 00:37:38,083
breakfast will be ready soon.

453
00:37:39,163 --> 00:37:39,884
Miss Nie?

454
00:37:40,243 --> 00:37:41,203
Ms. Lu, you have it.

455
00:37:41,203 --> 00:37:42,163
I need to go out.

456
00:37:42,324 --> 00:37:44,083
Leaving again right after coming back?

457
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:47,043
Don't young people today ever sleep?

458
00:38:02,444 --> 00:38:03,203
He left so early?

459
00:38:05,444 --> 00:38:06,764
Do you want me to call and check?

460
00:38:08,804 --> 00:38:09,924
Leave him for now.

461
00:38:42,324 --> 00:38:44,683
No beating around the bush today, okay?

462
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:50,404
You look exhausted.

463
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:52,004
Skip the formalities too.

464
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:53,203
No small talk.

465
00:38:54,484 --> 00:38:55,563
Alright, go ahead.

466
00:38:58,563 --> 00:39:01,284
Someone named Jiang Baichuan
was captured by Lin Xirou.

467
00:39:02,203 --> 00:39:04,043
He's crucial
to the South Mountain Hunters.

468
00:39:04,404 --> 00:39:05,723
And to me too.

469
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:08,123
I hope you can help me rescue him.

470
00:39:08,924 --> 00:39:09,523
Of course,

471
00:39:09,523 --> 00:39:10,884
you might not be able to help.

472
00:39:10,884 --> 00:39:12,163
Okay, I'll help you.

473
00:39:13,683 --> 00:39:14,364
You will?

474
00:39:15,683 --> 00:39:16,444
So straightforward?

475
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,563
Wasn't it you who said,

476
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:20,123
'No beating around the bush'?

477
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:24,683
I did say that.

478
00:39:24,924 --> 00:39:26,203
But you didn't ask anything.

479
00:39:26,804 --> 00:39:27,683
Isn't that rash?

480
00:39:29,324 --> 00:39:30,484
You contacted me proactively.

481
00:39:30,563 --> 00:39:32,404
It shows the situation is urgent.

482
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:34,964
You asked me for help.

483
00:39:34,964 --> 00:39:37,203
It means he's very important to you.

484
00:39:37,404 --> 00:39:38,844
If I help with this,

485
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,364
at least I'll gain a chance

486
00:39:40,364 --> 00:39:41,404
to ask for your help.

487
00:39:42,804 --> 00:39:44,404
Moreover, if I successfully rescue him,

488
00:39:44,404 --> 00:39:46,364
you'll owe me a huge favor.

489
00:39:46,444 --> 00:39:47,484
Therefore,

490
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:49,563
helping you
is my best option either way.

491
00:39:50,123 --> 00:39:51,444
Still think I'm being rash now?

492
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:53,563
I won't owe you favors.

493
00:39:53,804 --> 00:39:54,683
I'll pay you.

494
00:40:01,163 --> 00:40:01,603
Wait,

495
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:03,563
I'm helping you with a huge favor.
