(This story is a work of fiction)

00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,056
=Episode 6=

17
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:27,336
(Toxic and Hazardous)

18
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:15,802
Mad Blade sits in the central tent.

19
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:20,122
Once entering the Twilight Chasm,

20
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:25,362
fiends hunt human monsters.

21
00:04:27,763 --> 00:04:32,923
Blades and hounds
walk the Turquoise Land,

22
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:39,682
and Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

23
00:04:44,322 --> 00:04:46,083
Are you a South Mountain Hunter?

24
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:49,603
Just wait.

25
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:52,122
When Mad Blade arrives,

26
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:54,603
your membranes will be split open,

27
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:57,283
your rotten guts

28
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:02,163
spilled to the sun.

29
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:03,362
Listen to me.

30
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,483
I'm not an Earth Fiend.

31
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:05,523
I'm here to help you.

32
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:09,643
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

33
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:14,083
The Golden Gate
is fortified beyond defeat.

34
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:17,643
Blades, hounds, and whips unite.

35
00:05:17,643 --> 00:05:22,643
None of you invaders will return alive.

36
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:26,483
Have some water.

37
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:27,843
Take your time. Speak slowly.

38
00:05:39,843 --> 00:05:44,802
A patrol checks
the Golden Gate every fourth year.

39
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:51,002
No more wrongful deaths in Nanba.

40
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:24,923
In this greenhouse of ours,

41
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:28,122
the catalytic spray
activates periodically.

42
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:31,723
It significantly improves
medicinal herb grafting success.

43
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:34,283
But it's extremely harmful to humans.

44
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:36,322
Hence the alarm system.

45
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:37,283
See?

46
00:06:38,122 --> 00:06:39,682
The spraying will start any minute.

47
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:42,362
You need to figure out quickly

48
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:43,603
how to explain this to me.

49
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:52,802
Am I the General Manager
of Roadsound Group?

50
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:54,043
Yes.

51
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,723
Then why do I always
feel like an outsider?

52
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:01,163
I know less
about core operations and personnel

53
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:02,483
than you do.

54
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:04,523
I get it now.

55
00:07:05,643 --> 00:07:06,643
So,

56
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,963
you're conducting field research?

57
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:09,923
Right?

58
00:07:23,483 --> 00:07:24,643
You're hiding things from me.

59
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:28,403
Since I first met Ms. Lin as a kid,

60
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:29,843
she hasn't aged a single day.

61
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:31,242
Xiong,

62
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:33,322
you've fought hard for the group

63
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:35,682
and taken serious injuries
multiple times, right?

64
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:37,403
But after resting for a few days,

65
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,523
you recover completely.

66
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:39,603
Do you think I buy that?

67
00:07:40,603 --> 00:07:42,083
I don't care what you're developing

68
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:44,322
or if it's supposedly to protect me.

69
00:07:44,322 --> 00:07:45,562
But I'm not a child anymore.

70
00:07:45,562 --> 00:07:46,723
Nor am I a fool!

71
00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:48,603
I'm part of this family too!

72
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:58,202
I won't be a mascot anymore,

73
00:07:58,723 --> 00:08:01,002
playing cards with this CEO

74
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:02,762
or fishing with that president.

75
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:17,083
To reach this day,

76
00:08:24,163 --> 00:08:27,122
to become my true self,

77
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:29,122
I've exhausted myself.

78
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:34,322
If...

79
00:08:34,643 --> 00:08:36,242
If I can't...

80
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:40,562
If I can't become one of you,

81
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,083
then today...

82
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:47,923
let's end this all.

83
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:51,283
Let me...

84
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:54,802
finally...

85
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:56,442
be free.

86
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:38,442
Ms. Lin, you understand Yan Tuo best.

87
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:41,763
The "invite-the-enemy-into-jar" trick
worked perfectly.

88
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,562
He went to the farm?

89
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:48,763
His reaction suggests no suspicion.

90
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:51,643
Just curiosity and wanting to belong.

91
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:54,842
But if we keep lying,

92
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:57,202
and he discovers something

93
00:09:57,202 --> 00:09:58,842
and then confronts you about it,

94
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:00,602
that'll be worse.

95
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:02,763
Speak your mind directly.

96
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:05,883
Once he truly understands

97
00:10:05,883 --> 00:10:08,482
he's not like us,

98
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:10,602
he'll have two choices.

99
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:12,722
Either assimilate

100
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:14,082
or leave.

101
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:19,243
Assimilation requires
full disclosure from you.

102
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,403
No reservations.

103
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:23,123
If he chooses to leave,

104
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:26,163
we have to eliminate him.

105
00:10:26,602 --> 00:10:28,243
He's not a blood bag after all.

106
00:10:29,802 --> 00:10:30,523
Ms. Lin,

107
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:33,602
it's time to decide.

108
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:40,923
Whether we let the fox
in the henhouse remains uncertain,

109
00:10:42,202 --> 00:10:46,962
but it's time to lure the enemy out.

110
00:10:57,058 --> 00:10:59,656
(Nanshan Rescue Team,
Xicang City, Yanguan Province)

111
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:06,442
You see,

112
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:08,043
this is where we treat injuries

113
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,202
at the base.

114
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:10,682
Conditions aren't hospital-grade.

115
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:12,682
And this is the best equipment

116
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:14,082
we can get.

117
00:11:16,523 --> 00:11:18,802
Mrs. Hua is in a stable condition now.

118
00:11:19,283 --> 00:11:21,923
Let's arrange shifts then.

119
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:22,962
Keep a close eye.

120
00:11:23,962 --> 00:11:26,123
All right. I'll take
the first shift tonight.

121
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:29,003
Ma Hanzi and I are usually
at the base most of the time.

122
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,842
He's familiar with this place.

123
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:32,283
He can take more shifts.

124
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:34,802
Our top priority right now is

125
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:36,602
to find out any news about Mr. Crip.

126
00:11:40,202 --> 00:11:41,243
What's up, Jiang?

127
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,523
It's from the hospital.

128
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:45,802
They said they received

129
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:47,842
a letter addressed to Mrs. Hua.

130
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:49,523
The head nurse mentioned

131
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:52,082
the envelope reads,

132
00:11:52,923 --> 00:11:54,482
"To the South Mountain Hunters,

133
00:11:55,523 --> 00:11:57,082
from an old friend at the Golden Gate."

134
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:12,243
Since you like cats so much,

135
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:15,643
why not properly adopt a pretty one?

136
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:17,482
This scruffy calico cat

137
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:18,842
eats and runs.

138
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:20,363
It won't even let us pet it once.

139
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:23,442
In the feline world,

140
00:12:23,722 --> 00:12:25,322
calicos are seen as the most beautiful.

141
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:26,602
Don't you think it is

142
00:12:26,602 --> 00:12:28,043
independent and full of character?

143
00:12:28,842 --> 00:12:30,003
Free-spirited

144
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:31,363
and reliant on no one.

145
00:12:31,482 --> 00:12:33,562
Then it shouldn't come here
for free meals.

146
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:34,763
Let it catch mice itself.

147
00:12:36,202 --> 00:12:38,043
That's exactly what makes it remarkable.

148
00:12:38,962 --> 00:12:40,283
No begging or groveling,

149
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:42,363
yet it makes people care about it

150
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:43,523
and want to pamper it.

151
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,883
By your logic,

152
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:46,523
when young people date,

153
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:49,202
they should learn from stray cats?

154
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,322
Not exactly.

155
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:53,403
If humans acted like that,

156
00:12:53,403 --> 00:12:54,802
they'd become rather annoying.

157
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:02,482
(Nobody)
(New updates. Same spot tonight?)

158
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:09,082
Thank you.

159
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:09,722
Enjoy your meal.

160
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:10,763
You came.

161
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:22,842
How did you know my favorite dishes?

162
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:24,442
You're a regular here.

163
00:13:25,163 --> 00:13:26,123
The owner knows.

164
00:13:29,763 --> 00:13:31,883
How did she know who you meant?

165
00:13:33,243 --> 00:13:34,123
I asked her,

166
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:36,283
"The exceptionally beautiful lady

167
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,523
with sharp-tongued remarks

168
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,523
and an artistic appearance,

169
00:13:40,043 --> 00:13:42,722
but hiding countless secrets.

170
00:13:42,842 --> 00:13:43,962
What did she usually order?"

171
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:46,322
She recognized you instantly.

172
00:13:47,763 --> 00:13:49,163
So that was a compliment?

173
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:52,082
What does Mad Blade mean?

174
00:13:53,802 --> 00:13:54,523
Mad Blade.

175
00:14:00,202 --> 00:14:03,523
A performing troupe
calls their year-end finale

176
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:04,523
Closing the Chest.

177
00:14:05,003 --> 00:14:06,602
A footballer's farewell match

178
00:14:06,602 --> 00:14:07,722
is Hanging Up the Boots.

179
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:08,842
So, I think

180
00:14:09,163 --> 00:14:10,883
it means retirement from the world

181
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:11,763
of combat.

182
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:15,403
Fine.

183
00:14:16,243 --> 00:14:17,923
Keep your secrets if you must.

184
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:19,883
I just want you to know

185
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:21,682
they're deeply concerned
about Mad Blade.

186
00:14:23,722 --> 00:14:25,202
This intel's on the house.

187
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:26,442
Not included in the tally.

188
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:35,163
Thanks.

189
00:14:35,923 --> 00:14:37,043
Shall we cut to the chase?

190
00:14:41,403 --> 00:14:42,283
I located the man.

191
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,082
Where?

192
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:48,523
Heavily guarded.

193
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:51,163
Probably tortured too.

194
00:14:51,403 --> 00:14:52,523
His mind's gone foggy.

195
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:54,363
But he's tight-lipped.

196
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:55,523
He disclosed nothing.

197
00:14:58,923 --> 00:14:59,962
How can you be sure

198
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,363
that the one you found

199
00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:02,682
is the one I mentioned?

200
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:09,523
Disabled left calf, correct?

201
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:21,003
Mad Blade... It's a person, isn't it?

202
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:24,003
What's your real angle here?

203
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:25,003
He said

204
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,482
Mad Blade could pierce
the Earth Fiends' membranes,

205
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:31,202
exposing their guts to daylight.

206
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:33,842
Therefore, Mad Blade

207
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:36,082
must be your trump card
against the Earth Fiends.

208
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:40,363
Not discussing this today.

209
00:15:41,763 --> 00:15:43,643
Only matters I care about.

210
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:45,123
The man I want to save.

211
00:15:47,482 --> 00:15:48,003
Understood.

212
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:52,082
He's still valuable to Lin Xirou.

213
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:53,763
No immediate danger.

214
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:56,283
But Xiong Hei

215
00:15:56,283 --> 00:15:58,243
threatens how long that'll hold.

216
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:00,043
If you want to save him, act fast.

217
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:03,043
Also, I need to make this clear upfront.

218
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:04,802
In fact, I want to help you.

219
00:16:05,003 --> 00:16:06,003
But this matter

220
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:07,722
has made Xiong Hei suspect me.

221
00:16:08,403 --> 00:16:09,403
At this point,

222
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,363
I consider the mission accomplished.

223
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:13,682
Now, it's your turn to pay
per our agreement.

224
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:16,322
No need to remind me.

225
00:16:20,802 --> 00:16:21,482
Say it.

226
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:26,722
Next time,

227
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:29,883
whenever and for whatever reason,

228
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:31,003
if I ask to meet you,

229
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:32,243
you can't refuse.

230
00:16:44,722 --> 00:16:46,722
All of you are indispensable.

231
00:16:47,082 --> 00:16:49,322
They're trying
to wipe us all out at once.

232
00:16:51,082 --> 00:16:52,682
Inviting all of us

233
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:54,123
shows they've got a solid plan.

234
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:56,923
No dirty tricks, a straight fight.

235
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,123
We fear nobody.

236
00:16:58,643 --> 00:16:59,722
At the ice factory,

237
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:01,482
we were ambushed,

238
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:03,202
which led to Mrs. Hua's injury.

239
00:17:03,802 --> 00:17:04,682
Underhanded tactics

240
00:17:04,962 --> 00:17:05,962
are their specialty.

241
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:08,363
Then what do we do?

242
00:17:08,722 --> 00:17:09,802
Mrs. Hua's unconscious,

243
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:10,842
and Mr. Crip...

244
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:17,403
Show of hands.

245
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:18,842
Go or not?

246
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:22,523
I absolutely must go.

247
00:17:24,082 --> 00:17:25,482
I missed out last time,

248
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:27,682
so I'm definitely going this time.

249
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,322
Would anyone actually skip this?

250
00:18:10,843 --> 00:18:11,923
Mr. Crip has been captured.

251
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:15,163
If you still won't take action,

252
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,083
consider this visit nonexistent.

253
00:18:23,563 --> 00:18:24,242
Time?

254
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:25,722
Location?

255
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:28,643
You should join our operation.

256
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:29,962
That way...

257
00:18:29,962 --> 00:18:31,163
I told Jiang.

258
00:18:32,202 --> 00:18:33,603
After this mission ends,

259
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:34,682
I'll quit completely.

260
00:18:35,163 --> 00:18:36,123
When peace returns,

261
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:39,002
you can make new plans.

262
00:18:39,722 --> 00:18:41,202
But now that enemies have emerged,

263
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:43,403
how could we not have the Mad Blade?

264
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:48,682
We both have our own duties

265
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:49,843
and desires.

266
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:52,442
I won't interfere with your choices,

267
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:54,722
and I hope you'll respect mine.

268
00:18:55,923 --> 00:18:57,323
Send me the time and place.

269
00:18:58,282 --> 00:18:59,202
I'll be there on time.

270
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:07,403
Tomorrow's a day off.

271
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,123
I'll go to an art exhibition downtown.

272
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:10,202
What about you?

273
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,563
Not in good form today.

274
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,403
Wrapped in a hide,

275
00:19:18,403 --> 00:19:19,643
the fiend bone is scentless.

276
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:23,682
I'll try it alone tomorrow.

277
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:24,962
Tomorrow's a day off.

278
00:19:25,323 --> 00:19:26,722
There's an art exhibition downtown.

279
00:19:26,722 --> 00:19:27,242
I want to go.

280
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:28,682
What's your plan?

281
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,002
I heard.

282
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:35,962
Go by yourself then.

283
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:38,883
I want extra practice.

284
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:41,563
Fine. Keep drilling.

285
00:19:43,962 --> 00:19:44,643
Luo.

286
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:48,682
You know about Huoquan Pills?

287
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:52,563
Yes.

288
00:19:53,123 --> 00:19:54,762
But I don't believe they work.

289
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,522
Hope you don't either.

290
00:19:57,962 --> 00:19:59,482
The Hound Clan relies on smell,

291
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:01,282
but our five senses

292
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:03,603
each drain energy.

293
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:06,442
Sacrificing one

294
00:20:06,603 --> 00:20:07,803
to enhance another

295
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:09,883
seems worthwhile to me.

296
00:20:10,762 --> 00:20:12,042
Seems foolish to me.

297
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,242
Huoquan Pills,

298
00:20:26,682 --> 00:20:28,042
the hunters' ancient formula,

299
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:30,282
clear nasal passages,

300
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:32,202
remove congestion

301
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:34,643
and help one detect fiends miles away.

302
00:20:38,482 --> 00:20:41,242
But effects and toxicity coexist.

303
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:45,442
A clear nose brings blindness.

304
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:47,403
Inferior medicine.

305
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:51,563
Best left unconsumed.

306
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,123
May not be fully blind.

307
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:56,403
I've researched.

308
00:20:57,002 --> 00:20:59,522
Huoquan Pills only
dilate pupils in daylight,

309
00:20:59,762 --> 00:21:00,843
blinding glare vision.

310
00:21:01,282 --> 00:21:03,083
Night vision remains.

311
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:05,323
All Mad Dog candidates

312
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,843
can choose to take the pills or not,

313
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,002
but consumption
doesn't guarantee selection.

314
00:21:14,242 --> 00:21:17,323
Consequences are your own.

315
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,123
Jiang,

316
00:21:25,123 --> 00:21:26,123
I've made up my mind.

317
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:28,803
Don't you want

318
00:21:30,242 --> 00:21:31,442
to talk to Luo first

319
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:33,522
and hear what she thinks?

320
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:37,242
Becoming a Mad Dog

321
00:21:38,123 --> 00:21:40,202
is about becoming
a stronger South Mountain hunter

322
00:21:41,722 --> 00:21:43,202
to protect everyone better.

323
00:21:53,123 --> 00:21:55,042
This is my decision
after careful consideration.

324
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,803
No more discussions with anyone.

325
00:22:19,883 --> 00:22:20,803
Have you had a friend

326
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:24,282
or perhaps a companion?

327
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:27,123
I mean,

328
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:30,442
someone other than me?

329
00:22:32,242 --> 00:22:33,083
Or rather

330
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:36,923
before you came here,

331
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:40,762
among your own kind,

332
00:22:42,843 --> 00:22:43,883
was there anyone

333
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:47,603
you felt close to and trusted?

334
00:22:51,363 --> 00:22:52,442
If there was,

335
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,282
and the one once inseparable from you

336
00:23:00,482 --> 00:23:02,042
gradually grows distant,

337
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:05,202
becomes a stranger,

338
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:08,803
and even no longer agrees with you

339
00:23:10,403 --> 00:23:11,202
or understands you,

340
00:23:14,522 --> 00:23:15,403
what would you do?

341
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:24,002
Resent her?

342
00:23:26,442 --> 00:23:27,363
Blame her?

343
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:33,363
Though we're nothing alike,

344
00:23:36,202 --> 00:23:37,442
surely this feeling

345
00:23:41,363 --> 00:23:42,803
isn't hard for you to grasp.

346
00:23:52,643 --> 00:23:54,843
Only one bottle
contains fiend bone powder.

347
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:56,403
Whoever finds it first

348
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,323
gets to sleep in an hour tomorrow.

349
00:23:58,442 --> 00:23:59,002
Begin!

350
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:09,722
It's diluted in water.

351
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,762
How can we smell it?

352
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:13,123
Exactly.

353
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:13,803
Right.

354
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:16,202
Left side.

355
00:24:19,522 --> 00:24:20,282
Third one.

356
00:24:29,282 --> 00:24:30,363
Xing Shen rests.

357
00:24:30,563 --> 00:24:31,762
You guys run three laps.

358
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:35,883
Wait, wasn't the deal to reward us

359
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,123
with extra sleep?

360
00:24:37,123 --> 00:24:37,803
Five laps!

361
00:24:38,363 --> 00:24:39,002
Hurry up!

362
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:40,522
- Go.
- Go.

363
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:43,442
Run faster!

364
00:25:00,363 --> 00:25:01,643
But no matter what,

365
00:25:04,563 --> 00:25:05,883
companions remain companions.

366
00:25:08,682 --> 00:25:10,403
Even if we can't be open with each other

367
00:25:10,403 --> 00:25:11,603
like before,

368
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:13,643
even if

369
00:25:15,363 --> 00:25:16,603
one day in the future,

370
00:25:16,603 --> 00:25:18,643
we'll become strangers,

371
00:25:21,202 --> 00:25:23,563
right now we share the same struggle.

372
00:25:25,403 --> 00:25:27,123
We'll fight side by side.

373
00:25:29,242 --> 00:25:29,962
Otherwise,

374
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,123
how could we call ourselves companions?

375
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,482
I'll be away soon.

376
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:46,042
Be good.

377
00:25:46,923 --> 00:25:47,803
Wait for me to return.

378
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:51,843
I'll bring your favorite wild boar.

379
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,083
Xing Shen said

380
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:31,282
you agreed to join the mission.

381
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,163
Mr. Crip's in trouble.

382
00:26:33,563 --> 00:26:35,002
I can't just stand by.

383
00:26:35,923 --> 00:26:36,563
Good.

384
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:38,403
Be careful.

385
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:41,603
You too.

386
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,163
These Earth Fiends we're facing now

387
00:26:44,163 --> 00:26:45,603
are unlike any we've encountered.

388
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:47,843
We must prepare thoroughly this time.

389
00:26:48,282 --> 00:26:49,442
South Mountain Hunters

390
00:26:49,762 --> 00:26:50,643
stay ever-ready.

391
00:26:51,762 --> 00:26:53,803
Though we haven't hunted
real fiends in years,

392
00:26:54,002 --> 00:26:55,242
our skills remain sharp.

393
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:57,323
Just like I never worry

394
00:26:57,962 --> 00:27:00,563
you'll lose your Mad Blade skills.

395
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:04,843
This hardship is temporary.

396
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:07,363
It will pass.

397
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:08,843
Let's hope so.

398
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:10,803
See you then.

399
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:37,442
What's wrong?

400
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:38,682
Tuo, where are you going?

401
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:41,803
I saw Xiong Hei
rushing around anxiously.

402
00:27:42,242 --> 00:27:43,123
It must be serious.

403
00:27:43,123 --> 00:27:44,042
I'm following him.

404
00:27:44,323 --> 00:27:46,682
Isn't their rushing around normal?

405
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,442
Maybe you should come back.

406
00:27:49,442 --> 00:27:50,242
I'm worried.

407
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:51,403
Some things,

408
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,202
once decided, must be faced

409
00:27:53,282 --> 00:27:54,442
sooner or later.

410
00:27:54,962 --> 00:27:57,242
But what if...?

411
00:27:57,482 --> 00:27:58,083
Don't worry.

412
00:27:58,962 --> 00:27:59,722
I have my plan.

413
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:14,242
Today,

414
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:18,323
Ms. Lin brought up
me inviting Lv Xian to dinner again.

415
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:20,002
You're not home.

416
00:28:22,363 --> 00:28:23,442
I don't want to go.

417
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:26,403
It's strange how eager she is

418
00:28:26,522 --> 00:28:27,563
to push you two together.

419
00:28:27,722 --> 00:28:29,403
But we've known Lv Xian for ages.

420
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:30,923
He's a bit talkative,

421
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:32,202
but he's still reliable.

422
00:28:32,403 --> 00:28:34,242
Stop overthinking. Let it be.

423
00:28:34,643 --> 00:28:35,482
I know.

424
00:28:36,843 --> 00:28:37,883
But I really...

425
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:38,722
Gotta go now.

426
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:39,442
I'm losing him.

427
00:28:48,578 --> 00:28:50,952
(Entrusted by All, Aid from All Sides)

428
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:30,403
Jiang.

429
00:29:35,282 --> 00:29:36,643
- Jiang.
- Jiang.

430
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:38,722
Jiang.

431
00:29:55,843 --> 00:29:57,123
Everyone who could come is here.

432
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,768
Once entering the Twilight Chasm,
fiends hunt human monsters.

433
00:30:01,768 --> 00:30:03,643
Blades and hounds
walk the Turquoise Land,

434
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,442
and Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

435
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,403
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

436
00:30:07,843 --> 00:30:09,722
The Golden Gate
is fortified beyond defeat.

437
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:21,883
(We South Mountain Hunters,)

438
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,202
(by imperial decree,)

439
00:30:24,442 --> 00:30:25,962
(traversed the Nanba Weald)

440
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:29,323
(to brave fiends in battle.)

441
00:30:29,843 --> 00:30:32,803
(Skilled in combat and sensing fiends,)

442
00:30:33,323 --> 00:30:35,002
(lurking in mountain shadows,)

443
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:36,843
(indifferent to death,)

444
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:39,442
(driving beasts from villages)

445
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:42,202
(and protecting people from harm.)

446
00:30:43,403 --> 00:30:44,603
(Hounds)

447
00:30:45,442 --> 00:30:47,442
(track by scent.)

448
00:30:47,643 --> 00:30:50,363
(Fiends find no hiding.)

449
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:52,762
(Whips)

450
00:30:53,682 --> 00:30:55,363
(crack like thunder,)

451
00:30:56,002 --> 00:30:58,403
(binding fiends' steps.)

452
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:01,002
(Blades)

453
00:31:01,482 --> 00:31:02,762
(feed their weapons with blood.)

454
00:31:03,123 --> 00:31:06,083
(Fiends die on sight.)

455
00:31:07,883 --> 00:31:10,883
Our ancestors fought
on the Turquoise Land,

456
00:31:11,522 --> 00:31:13,123
harassed by Earth Fiends.

457
00:31:13,843 --> 00:31:15,883
The king established
South Mountain Hunters

458
00:31:15,923 --> 00:31:17,363
to resist fiends unto death.

459
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:19,643
This legacy continues.

460
00:31:20,403 --> 00:31:21,843
Now, Earth Fiends return.

461
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:23,962
We summon the Hunter King Cauldron

462
00:31:24,923 --> 00:31:26,083
and pray to our ancestors

463
00:31:27,163 --> 00:31:28,163
for protection.

464
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:31,442
No fiends in the South Mountain,

465
00:31:32,762 --> 00:31:34,042
peace for all.

466
00:31:34,282 --> 00:31:35,762
- No fiends in the South Mountain,
- No fiends in the South Mountain,

467
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:37,603
- peace for all.
- peace for all.

468
00:32:20,883 --> 00:32:21,883
Let me introduce.

469
00:32:22,682 --> 00:32:23,843
This is Quecha who's been

470
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:25,803
with me for over a decade.

471
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,563
For this mission,

472
00:32:28,843 --> 00:32:30,803
we need home guards

473
00:32:31,163 --> 00:32:32,722
to watch Mrs. Hua

474
00:32:33,923 --> 00:32:34,843
and Ma Hanzi.

475
00:32:35,002 --> 00:32:35,762
Jiang,

476
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:37,083
will Mad Blade come?

477
00:32:38,563 --> 00:32:39,202
Yes.

478
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:43,202
She'll definitely come.

479
00:32:44,522 --> 00:32:46,803
Stars sink, mountains darken.

480
00:32:48,282 --> 00:32:50,482
Fiends rise on the Turquoise Land.

481
00:32:51,442 --> 00:32:53,442
Wrap our heads and seal the gold.

482
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:56,123
- Guard our home.
- Guard our home.

483
00:32:57,123 --> 00:32:59,242
- Old lineage,
- Old lineage,

484
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:01,883
- shared duty.
- shared duty.

485
00:33:02,803 --> 00:33:04,762
- Gate opens.
- Gate opens.

486
00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:07,163
- Follow our ancestors.
- Follow our ancestors.

487
00:33:07,883 --> 00:33:09,522
- Gate opens!
- Gate opens!

488
00:33:09,843 --> 00:33:11,482
- Follow our ancestors!
- Follow our ancestors!

489
00:34:38,442 --> 00:34:41,203
South Mountain Hunters

490
00:34:43,203 --> 00:34:47,122
are not rabbit-shooting amateurs.

491
00:34:48,683 --> 00:34:51,243
Guns can't harm you.

492
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,883
Today, you'll witness true power.

493
00:34:57,323 --> 00:35:00,162
Mad Blade alone could end you.

494
00:35:01,923 --> 00:35:04,803
Even our hounds' hammer strike

495
00:35:06,283 --> 00:35:11,042
hits harder than bullets.

496
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:12,602
Xiong,

497
00:35:13,002 --> 00:35:14,923
can we silence this old man?

498
00:35:15,962 --> 00:35:19,162
Sweet bait catches big fish.

499
00:35:22,082 --> 00:35:23,962
None of you invaders...

500
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:27,363
None of you invaders...

501
00:35:28,403 --> 00:35:31,962
None of you invaders will return alive.

502
00:36:14,562 --> 00:36:16,642
Jiang, we'll lead the charge.

503
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:18,122
Leave some men

504
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:19,403
to wait here with you,

505
00:36:19,602 --> 00:36:20,442
ready to support.

506
00:36:21,562 --> 00:36:22,243
Agreed.

507
00:36:23,122 --> 00:36:25,082
Retreat if things turn.

508
00:36:27,522 --> 00:36:28,522
We'll reinforce.

509
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,080
Dashuang, Xiaoshuang.

510
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,803
- Here.
- Here.

511
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:34,522
Wu San.

512
00:36:34,522 --> 00:36:35,042
Here.

513
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:36,162
- Pazi.
- Here.

514
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:37,203
We'll stay here.

515
00:36:37,243 --> 00:36:38,002
The rest of you,

516
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:39,243
