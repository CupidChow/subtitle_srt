=Episode 11=

17
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,960
Get the door.

18
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,119
Open up.

19
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,039
The door is knocked off.

20
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,860
Xiong.

21
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,920
Business is picking up?

22
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,399
I found it yesterday.

23
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,599
Have you had blood drawn recently?

24
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,240
Not recently.

25
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
The last time

26
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,839
was during last year's
physical examination.

27
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,999
Last night when I was sleeping,

28
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,439
I felt it was strange.

29
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,559
Like I was passing out.

30
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:16,800
It was hazy.

31
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,040
I felt...

32
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:21,920
I felt like...

33
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,839
someone was touching me.

34
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,439
Don't panic yet.

35
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,879
You might've been exhausted lately

36
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,719
and had a bad dream.

37
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:42,999
Was this a dream too?

38
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,800
If this happens again,

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,960
call me immediately.

40
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
I did call,

41
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,480
but you were busy.

42
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,119
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,439
It was my oversight.

44
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,920
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,080
Hello?

46
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,080
Well?

47
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,679
Tell me, am I sharp or not?

48
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,279
I told you to leave early.

49
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:35,999
Wasn't I right?

50
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,879
What's wrong?

51
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,960
You know what?

52
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,679
Xiong Hei carried someone in.

53
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,080
He looked rushed.

54
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Looks like

55
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,159
it was a real struggle for them
to nab him.

56
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,039
No idea what that man did wrong.

57
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,560
Xiong Hei and his men
kept slapping him around.

58
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,279
They wanted me
to wake him up immediately.

59
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,560
Do you know who he is?

60
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,599
I didn't dare ask.

61
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:56,640
That's not protocol.

62
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,399
Heard them call him 'Gou' or something.

63
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:00,520
Gou Ya?

64
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,440
Yes.

65
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
Does that even sound like a decent name?

66
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,640
When I looked,

67
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,880
he looked like gang muscle.

68
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,479
Maybe even a top enforcer.

69
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,320
Even Xiong Hei's goons

70
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,880
got beaten to a pulp by him.

71
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,200
Got it.

72
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:13,479
Talk later.

73
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,239
Don't let Ms. Lin find out
that you've noticed this.

74
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,479
Keep your head down.

75
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't confront them.

76
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,760
Give me more time.

77
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,719
I'll fix this.

78
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,440
Okay?

79
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,919
If he hadn't run,

80
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,880
maybe it wouldn't have come to this.

81
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,960
Should we follow protocol?

82
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,640
Or let the group decide?

83
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:34,599
Ms. Lin, you have guests?

84
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,880
Perfect, let me introduce them.

85
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,440
Who doesn't know Ms. Lin's prized jewel?

86
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,560
We can introduce ourselves.

87
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:49,880
Hi, I'm Yan Tuo.

88
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:51,760
Sorry,

89
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,399
Ms. Lin never mentioned you all.

90
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,599
We've heard plenty
about you from Ms. Lin.

91
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,640
Ms. Lin, playing favorites?

92
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,200
The one who can't speak properly

93
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:04,279
is Yang Zheng.

94
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,320
Among the names we saw earlier,

95
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,760
(Roadsound Group List)
those who are still active...

96
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,520
That woman

97
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,760
is Li Yueying.

98
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:14,839
(They are all coming to Xicang.)

99
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,359
Let me formally introduce myself.

100
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,760
Feng Mi.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,239
Mi as in 'honey.'

102
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,479
Hello.

103
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,359
That bracelet's gorgeous.

104
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,880
Where'd you get it?

105
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,960
From a client.

106
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:43,919
Ms. Lin,

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,560
something's come up at work. Got to go.

108
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,520
My treat later.

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,799
Go ahead.

110
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,599
Okay.

111
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,560
Stay a bit longer.

112
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,279
Got shut down, huh?

113
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Ms. Lin,

114
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,440
your eldest son's quite the character.

115
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,919
I like him.

116
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,239
Enough.

117
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,440
How is Gou Ya doing?

118
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,120
Not badly hurt. He's fine.

119
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,560
Xiong Hei said they'll take him
when he wakes.

120
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,120
He ordered his men
to prepare at some farm.

121
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,200
Farm?

122
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,760
Lv Xian.

123
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,640
Mr. Lv, you're my savior.

124
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,039
Help me one more time.

125
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,919
Find any way to keep him here longer.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,479
How am I supposed to do that?

127
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,640
Should I tell him,
"We haven't bonded enough

128
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,080
and should drink and chat,"

129
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,159
when he wakes up?

130
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,320
Why not just keep him under?

131
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,880
This is urgent.

132
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,839
You really need to help me again.

133
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,999
What's going on?

134
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,839
Fine.

135
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,560
Then you should think carefully.

136
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,280
About what?

137
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,280
Obviously, how to thank me properly.

138
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,479
How to keep him?

139
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,759
They've all been treated.

140
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,759
Rest assured.

141
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:40,999
Those pals are all fine too.

142
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:41,999
Superficial wounds.

143
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:43,080
Except these two.

144
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,599
You should've come earlier for stitches.

145
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,119
Now it's too late.

146
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,960
Might leave a scar.

147
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Your wrist needs rest to heal.

148
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:56,040
Can't be helped.
Bone injuries need three months.

149
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:56,879
Right?

150
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,080
By the way, Xiong,

151
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,359
are you feeling alright?

152
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,320
It's a stupid question.

153
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,519
You're as tough as forged iron.

154
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,599
So go back and rest.

155
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,999
I'll tell you when he wakes.

156
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,280
No need.

157
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,119
We'll take him immediately
when he wakes.

158
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,400
At least eat something first.

159
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,680
You've been up all night.

160
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,160
Xiong,

161
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:24,519
the noodle shop to the right is good.

162
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:25,896
Try the green pepper noodle.

163
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:27,200
Tell their owner I sent you.

164
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:29,200
- You'll get extra toppings.
- Are you hungry?

165
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,080
No.

166
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,160
No.

167
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,160
Fully dedicated to your duties.

168
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,599
Selfishly embracing the world.

169
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,519
T-Then I'll refill his IV fluids.

170
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:50,719
Not hungry?

171
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,160
Yet who ate my takeout?

172
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,879
Not hungry?

173
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,599
Xiong.

174
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,400
What's that?

175
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,639
Medication. I'm switching it.

176
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,440
Why's the color different?

177
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,680
T-This is stronger.

178
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,800
You wanted him awake fast, right?

179
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,200
Wait.

180
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,359
W-What's with this?

181
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:33,639
What are you doing?

182
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Xiong, you don't trust me?

183
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:45,719
Remember this.

184
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,800
Roadsound Group helped me.

185
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,359
Ms. Lin isn't my mom.

186
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,160
But she raised me.

187
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,920
I know where my loyalty lies.

188
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,960
All these years,

189
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,800
you've come through here so many times.

190
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,119
Did I ever ask questions?

191
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,680
Did I demand a single cent?

192
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,879
Why?

193
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,519
I care about you buddies.

194
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,599
I know

195
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,400
your work's tough and thankless,

196
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,599
righteous but unseen.

197
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,599
I understand. I feel for you.

198
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,080
But who cares about me?

199
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:12,479
You keep coming here,

200
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:13,439
not holding back at all.

201
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,839
One day, you'll attract the police.

202
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:16,264
What becomes of Wanbao Tower then?

203
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,719
So I wanted to use strong medicine

204
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,239
to wake him fast.

205
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,440
So he can be taken away soon.

206
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,200
For you and me,

207
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,680
and for everyone, it's good, right?

208
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,560
You don't trust me? Fine.

209
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,800
Let's stick to conservative treatment.

210
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,320
Give back my fried noodles.

211
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,080
Why not use it earlier?

212
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,759
That medicine

213
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,920
has some side effects.

214
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:46,216
It might damage his brain.

215
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,759
He's brainless. Use it.

216
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,519
Are you sure?

217
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:56,960
Buy some fried noodles.

218
00:12:58,599 --> 00:12:59,239
Make it a large.

219
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,400
Fine.

220
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:05,680
Bro.

221
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,719
You and I have a history.

222
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:08,960
After all we've been through,

223
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,560
drop the tough act.

224
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,999
Alright?

225
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,119
Xiong.

226
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,879
Hei.

227
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,119
Get back to work.

228
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,479
You two still haven't finished?

229
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,280
Almost done.

230
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,320
Alright, I'll do it.

231
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,160
Come on.

232
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:45,320
Unbelievable.

233
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,359
Is it shift change time?

234
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:48,479
Not yet.

235
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,479
What? Am I early?

236
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,160
Then you continue.

237
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,999
No.

238
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:55,320
You've already started.

239
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,040
Not my shift yet.

240
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,479
You take over. I'm leaving.

241
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:57,999
Wait.

242
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,920
- Let's go.
- You two... I...

243
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,359
How utterly shameless.

244
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,080
Unbelievable.

245
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,719

(I gave strong meds. But he woke.)

250
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,639
(Xiong Hei took him away.)

251
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:44,839
Do you think Ms. Lin

252
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,359
will spare Gou Ya's life?

253
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:49,560
Why keep him? Let him bite you later?

Xiong.

265
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,559
Ms. Lin,

266
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,479
I was wrong.

267
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,799
Gou Ya...

268
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,559
Gou Ya was wrong.

269
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,440
Gou Ya was wrong.

270
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,799
Ms. Lin, his mistakes

271
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:21,519
deserve multiple deaths.

272
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,920
But with our current shortage,

273
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,519
keeping him

274
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,200
even as experimental material
to improve root removal...

275
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
If it were just occasional omnivory,

276
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,840
maybe we could spare him.

277
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,039
But fleeing recklessly
and nearly exposing us

278
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:47,440
endangered all of us.

279
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,920
We're already on thin ice.

280
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,440
There's no room for error.

281
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,279
My bottom line is absolute.

282
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,999
It's crossed by no human

283
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,719
and defied by no kin.

284
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,319
He's to be executed.

285
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,239
Is this necessary?

286
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,279
Baring fangs at Ms. Lin

287
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,424
is intolerable.

288
00:21:44,424 --> 00:21:45,512
(Mr. Changxi: It's me. Are you okay?)

289
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,400
Exactly.

290
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,519
(It's me. Are you okay?)
Baring fangs at kin is taboo.

Hope it's also the last.

305

it's time for external ones.

You think we'd lock you up?

00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,600
Leaving without a word?

313
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,559
Why is that?

314
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,440
I haven't had time to explain.

316

317
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:32,440
I'd never seen an Earth Fiend before.

318
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,479
I wasn't scared.

319
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:34,799
Now,

320
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,960
with so many
humanoid Earth Fiends out there,

321
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,600
can we tell them apart?

322

Even Shen

323
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,200
secretly kept
a live Earth Fiend at the base.

324
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:45,999
Tell me,

325
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,440
shouldn't I be scared?

326
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:48,960
I'm scared.

327
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,680
I fear death.

328
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,920
I fear my wife and my kids losing me

329
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,239
and my parents having to bury me.

330
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,079
Working with you,

331
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:57,960
it doesn't feel safe.

332
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:04,079
Anyone else leaving?

333
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Anyone?

334
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,120
Speak up now.

335
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,920
Sorry, Big Head.

336
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,400
Any others?

337
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,759
Names once etched in fiend bones
are now burned to be sealed.

338
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,479
Leaving South Mountain behind,
no more fellowship remains.

339

340

Fiend bones tremble.

341
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,160
You're the Ghost Whip, Yu Rong?

342
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,680
You're back.

343
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,160
Shen, we've got a chance.

344
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Sorry, who are you?

345
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,920
No one else leaving?

346
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,960
We'll introduce each other later.

347
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,400
Burn the bones.

348
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:54,600
Open the cauldron.

349
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,039
Stealing the Whip Clan's job?

350
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:15,999
Now you're secretly taming a fiend.

351
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:20,559
I've replicated 70% to 80%

352
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,120
of the Earth Fiends'
communication frequency.

353
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,279
With proper training,

354
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,999
it could become our ultimate weapon.

355
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:40,279
True, certain acoustic devices exist

356
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,680
to drive away protected marine species

357
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,600
and mammals.

358
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,759
But

359
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,519
we're far from fully controlling them

360
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:53,799
or communicating

361
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,799
with them.

362
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,960
Earth Fiends

363
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,880
aren't like trained seals

364
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:02,759
at an aquarium,

365
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,440
clapping on command

366
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,559
or balancing balls.

367
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,160
Whether to keep that Earth Fiend

368
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,319
can be put to a vote.

369
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,999
I vote to keep it.

370
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,120
To let it go, where could it go?

371
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:35,999
To keep it,

372
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,680
here's the safest place.

373
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,239
Our priority is rescuing Jiang.

374
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,999
I have no time for that thing.

375
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,744
(Wanbao Tower)

376
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:34,039
Can't you see the sign says 'Closed'?

377
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,559
Come back tomorrow.

378
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,039
Open up.

379
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,600
I wondered who'd be so clueless.

380
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,840
What's your act now?

381
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,279
I keep asking for favors,

382
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,600
so I came to repay the debt.

383
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,160
As Wanbao Tower's esteemed owner,

384
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:05,519
shouldn't you dress sharply

385
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,440
and presentably?

386
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,079
Impossible.

387
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:10,479
From the out-of-season discount rack?

388
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,759
Or gifts from someone

389
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,440
in the wrong size? My gain then.

390
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Don't want them?

391
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,920
Fine, I'll take them back.

392
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:18,559
Put them down.

393
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,519
After careful consideration,

394
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,440
you're up to no good.

395
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,720
As your sworn brother
from another mother,

396
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,960
I feel for you.

397
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,240
I can't bear seeing you rot

398
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,039
in this gloomy shack all day.

399
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,920
So change into these new clothes

400
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:46,199
and join me for some hiking.

401
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,519
No way.

402
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:52,999
No way.

403
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,479
Wait.

404
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,519
Wearing such expensive clothes
for hiking?

405
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,639
You've lost it.

406
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,720
Actually, fair point.

407
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,559
I brought something more practical.

408
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,679
If I return it, is it still mine?

409
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,240
This isn't meant for me, is it?

410
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,720
A deal is a deal.

411
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,440
We're here.

412
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,840
Master Wang, please.

413
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,880
Hurry up, or should I drag you?

414
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,360
Commit to the act fully.

415
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:56,800
Here we go.

416
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,840
Marvel at this.

417
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,800
Master Wang.

418
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:03,079
My humble collectibles

419
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,440
are displayed inside.

420
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,920
I've never really appreciated
those intricately crafted gold, silver,

421
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,519
and jade ornaments.

422
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,360
Elegant.

423
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:12,679
Very elegant.

424
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,360
Having your esteemed presence

425
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,639
truly brings radiance
to our modest venue.

426
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,440
You flatter me.

427
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,199
Please help me with your expert opinion.

428
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,240
Of course.

429
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,039
After you.

430
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,400
Hello, Mr. Yan.

431
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,119
Ms. Lin previously said

432
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,559
the Rare Stone Garden

433
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:32,400
won't be open to outsiders for now.

434
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,679
To outsiders?

435
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,679
Who is the 'outsider'?

436
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:35,880
Me or Master Wang?

437
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,479
Step aside...

438
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,720
Yan,

439
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,679
all matters
require proper timing and affinity.

440
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,960
If today is not the day,
we can try another day.

441
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,960
Actually, I have dinner plans tonight...

442
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,639
Such great patina.

443
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:53,199
With important clients and executives.

444
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,519
I should go get ready now.

445
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:55,479
It's about time anyway.

446
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,519
No.

447
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,400
Master Wang.

448
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,479
Please wait a moment.

449
00:36:58,479 --> 00:36:59,559
My apologies.

450
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,920
What's wrong with you?

451
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,519
He's a notable guest for us.

452
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,199
Yanguan Province's urban plan
was designed

453
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,479
using his feng shui.

454
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,639
Do you know how much effort it took

455
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,199
to invite him
to inspect our Rare Stone Garden?

456
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,559
But it's closed to outsiders now.

457
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,400
Let me report this.

458
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,320
To whom?

459
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,440
I'm the General Manager.

460
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,599
Who will you report to?

461
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:24,800
Listen.

462
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,280
If you mess this up today,

463
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,320
I'll skin you alive.

464
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,440
Treat him properly.

465
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:29,280
Now.

466
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,479
Master Wang.

467
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,360
Come on.

468
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,119
Master.

469
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:33,760
After you.

470
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,159
My apologies. Just a minor hiccup.

471
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,232
- Right.
- Not forcing you?

472
00:37:36,232 --> 00:37:36,760
Not at all.

473
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,519
What are you talking about?

474
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,440
Please come inside.

475
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,240
As you can see,
this is our Rare Stone Garden.

476
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,599
Master Wang, what should

477
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,159
my mom be cautious about?

478
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
Don't all parents say,

479
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,320
"Your wings have hardened,
and you no longer listen"?

480
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,999
So the root cause

481
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,639
lies in the wings.

482
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,639
The wings?

483
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,240
Make your mom believe
your wings aren't fully developed

484
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,599
and you can't fly far yet.

485
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,639
This will ease her mind.

486
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,039
How to achieve this?

487
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,079
She must avoid certain foods.

488
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,559
Certain foods?

489
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:10,280
Avoid anything with wings.

490
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,400
Like chickens and geese.

491
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,599
Well...

492
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,400
Quail.

493
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:18,440
Quail.

494
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,639
Ducks.

495
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,760
Cicadas, butterflies.

496
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,800
She can't have those.

497
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:25,920
That makes sense.

498
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,440
But my mom is a vegetarian.

499
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,240
Master, please come in.

500
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:33,159
Of course I know she's a vegetarian.

501
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,280
I was testing you.

502
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:37,280
Never mind.

503
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,960
Let me consult the hexagrams
for your mom

504
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,599
and create a dietary plan

505
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,599
to ensure absolute safety.

506
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,559
Excellent, Master Wang.

507
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,599
Master Wang,

508
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,800
this way, please.

509
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,800
Troubling.

510
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,720
What's wrong?

511
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,199
Don't scare me like that.

512
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,519
I rushed out this morning

513
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:05,199
and didn't cast a hexagram.

514
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,920
But getting angry just now
made me realize today is auspicious

515
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:10,920
for travel, weddings, and construction.

516
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,079
Everything's good to go,

517
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,999
just can't slip up.

518
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:16,199
What does that mean?

519
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,039
Can't have

520
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,880
slip-up lions.

521
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:24,199
Master Wang?

522
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,039
What did you say to him?

523
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:26,679
What happened?

524
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:27,479
Nothing.

525
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:28,519
We talked about my mom.

526
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:29,920
Then he suddenly became like this.

527
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,760
Right.

528
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,199
It's... It's Mom

529
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:34,039
Oh, my God.

530
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,800
From ancient times,

531
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,920
my great-grandmother is calling me.

532
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,039
Take care of him.

533
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:43,960
I'll get help.

534
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:47,280
You, come here and help.

535
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,400
Hurry up.

536
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,840
Help him.

537
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,119
Press his philtrum.

538
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,800
Check his pockets for medicine.

539
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,920
I'll call an ambulance.

540
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,639
Take care of him.

541
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,920
Any chance for a change in the menu?

542
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:12,240
Make the dough softer.

543
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,999
Who uses unleavened dough
for steamed buns?

544
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:15,159
Jiang Baichuan.

545
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,400
What? You're interested in this too?

546
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,720
Very interested.

547
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,560
Then you should thank Mr. Yan.

548
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,000
Mr. Yan.

549
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,080
Please come in.

550
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,920
You're Zhang, right?

551
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,920
Yes.

552
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,800
After eating your mulberries,

553
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,400
let me give you some advice.

554
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,880
Lean closer. I have some wisdom for you.

555
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,080
Yes, Master Wang?

556
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,160
Judging from your facial features,

557
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,760
tell your mom
to watch her digestive health.

558
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,640
You can tell my mom's

559
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,280
health condition from my face?

560
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,040
Of course.

561
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,120
Longing is a mysterious thing.

562
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,560
Your mom's concern for you

563
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,440
is like an invisible hand,

564
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,120
following you everywhere.

565
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,640
It rests on your shoulders,

566
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,920
weighs on your chest,

567
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,120
and manifests in your complexion.

568
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,200
Please continue, Master Wang.

569
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,480
I'm all ears.
