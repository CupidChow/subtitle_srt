Hurry!

18
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,168
Let's go.

19
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:54,488
Stop her!

20
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:14,328
This way!

21
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:16,009
- Go!
- This way!

22
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:16,809
Is everyone here?

23
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,328
No one missing?

24
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:19,289
Stop her!

25
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:20,648
Stop her!

26
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:21,849
No one's missing.

27
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:22,648
Be careful.

28
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:23,448
Go! This way.

29
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:24,249
Hurry!

30
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:27,928
Xiong.

31
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:28,768
Why are you here?

32
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,529
Locked the car?

33
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:30,888
The fire alarm. I came to check.

34
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:31,809
Stay with Gou Ya.

35
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:46,328
Move!

36
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:48,768
Move!

37
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:50,809
Watch your step!

38
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,208
I'm coming out now.

39
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:55,848
Go! Let's move.

40
00:04:56,528 --> 00:04:57,249
A few more floors.

41
00:04:57,249 --> 00:04:58,009
Don't panic.

42
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:09,489
Sun Zhou.

43
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:51,528
Ms. Lin.

44
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:52,528
Have a seat.

45
00:09:32,808 --> 00:09:33,969
Have no appetite?

46
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:38,048
I ate late at noon.

47
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:39,688
Not hungry yet.

48
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:43,168
You need to eat properly.

49
00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:47,528
Slim figures aren't trendy anymore.

50
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,209
Guys prefer some curves now.

51
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:05,168
Ms. Lin.

52
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:06,888
I...

53
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:08,768
I'm really not hungry.

54
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:16,209
Ms. Lin, Gou Ya messed up.

55
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:46,849
Are you sure?

56
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:50,329
The woman had a fresh wound on her hand.

57
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:51,888
Gou Ya just broke free recently,

58
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:53,369
couldn't resist the blood scent,

59
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:54,528
then went wild.

60
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:55,568
What now?

61
00:11:55,729 --> 00:11:56,768
He's under control now.

62
00:11:58,089 --> 00:11:58,928
How could it be?

63
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:08,129
Trained? A South Mountain Hunter?

64
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:09,648
Too dark to see clearly.

65
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:11,449
Definitely a woman though.

66
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:14,849
I failed to watch over Gou Ya.
Sorry to trouble you.

67
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:19,249
We barely managed to place
his blood bag's descendant

68
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:20,768
to the welfare house.

69
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,048
So you mean...

70
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:26,688
Bring him back first.

71
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:27,849
Understood.

72
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:31,329
And

73
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:34,168
Yan Tuo was there during the incident.

74
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:36,048
Tuo?

75
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:38,249
Not his fault.

76
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:39,928
I was careless.

77
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:42,249
I'll tell you details when I return.

78
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:43,329
No.

79
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:45,209
I'll come apologize.

Tuo.

88
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:04,688
There's something I need to remind you.

89
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:09,209
Our Roadsound Group has grown this big

90
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:10,768
with many competitors.

91
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:12,729
Some compete fairly,

92
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:15,048
while others play dirty.

93
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,408
The business world is competitive.

94
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:20,209
I don't hide things from you on purpose.

95
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:22,489
It's to protect you better.

96
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:26,048
Can you understand, Tuo?

97
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:27,688
I understand.

98
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:30,528
But Ms. Lin, I'm not a kid anymore.

99
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:31,168
I...

100
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:32,849
Xiong Hei has matters to attend to.

101
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:34,969
Bring Gou Ya back first.

102
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:40,369
What about the client?

103
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:46,489
Okay. I'm heading back.

104
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:48,808
Drive safely.

105
00:14:58,888 --> 00:14:59,489

After all, starting today,

I'm one of the hunters.

125
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:49,808
Why pull on such a trick?

126
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,928
Even I couldn't figure it out.

127
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:53,849
Can't even handle such a simple task?

128

What's wrong with you?

129
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:56,609
Are you a fool?

130
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:57,729
Send it again.

131
00:16:59,048 --> 00:16:59,888
What did you say?

132
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:02,849
Nothing.

Can you tell me what's happening?

Today is my first time

to take on the patrol mission.

150
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:12,209
Just call me Shorty.

151
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:14,249
Actually, I'm familiar

152
00:18:14,249 --> 00:18:15,288
with you all here.

153
00:18:15,368 --> 00:18:16,288
Enough of that.

154
00:18:16,288 --> 00:18:17,768
Just do what you're told.

155
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:21,449
Hello.

156
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:22,848
Hello, what's going on?

157
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:24,929
You know it?

158
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:26,288
Something happened.

159
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:27,889
But I don't know what it is.

160
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:29,729
A long story. We'll talk later.

161
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:32,128
Have you been exposed?

162
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:33,209
Probably not.

163
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:35,209
Alright.

164
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:37,528
Be careful then.

165
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:39,249
Keep in touch.

166
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:40,288
You too.

167
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:55,169
The three clans.

168
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:57,128
Blade, Hound, and Whip.

169
00:18:57,368 --> 00:18:59,608
We Hound Clan have the most members.

170
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,608
We handle search and assault.

171
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:03,808
The Whip Clan uses their whips

172
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:05,409
to herd and tame.

173
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:07,169
The Blade Clan is special.

174
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:09,409
They deliver the critical strikes.

175
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:12,768
Speaking of the Hound Clan,

176
00:19:12,848 --> 00:19:13,889
we must mention

177
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:15,808
the leader of South Mountain Hunters,

178
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:16,489
Jiang.

179
00:19:17,368 --> 00:19:19,209
My father mentions his name

180
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,568
more than my mom's.

181
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:22,489
Wait, no.

182
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:26,088
Mad Dog leads the charge,
Mad Blade stays in command,

183
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:28,808
and Ghost Whip cracks a glowing whip.

184
00:19:30,088 --> 00:19:32,528
But not just Mad Blade,

185
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:34,328
Mad Dog and Ghost Whip are also absent.

186
00:19:35,848 --> 00:19:37,608
Ghost Whip is overseas,

187
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:39,328
not joining this patrol.

188
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:42,848
But if needed,

189
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:45,288
he'll come immediately.

190
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:47,368
Mad Dog lives here.

191
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:49,489
He's kind of eccentric.

192
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:51,249
I'll fetch him later.

193
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:54,489
Others will arrive shortly.

194
00:19:56,808 --> 00:19:57,568
Jiang.

195
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,768
Maybe call it off.

196
00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:04,169
We don't share the same mind,
and can't gather everyone.

197
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:06,969
I'll go ask Big Head.

198
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,768
Exactly! I forgot someone.

199
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,368
The watchdog Big Head,

200
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:14,568
the captain of this rescue center.

201
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:16,009
Guests are here already,

202
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:16,848
why is he...

203
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:20,528
Guests?

204
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:23,768
In here,

205
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:25,368
we're all family.

206
00:20:31,704 --> 00:20:37,400
(Nanshan Rescue)

207
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:06,608
Hello.

208
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:09,288
Done yet?

209
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:12,528
No.

210
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:15,009
Read Mad Blade's message?

211
00:21:16,128 --> 00:21:16,848
Yes.

212
00:21:18,128 --> 00:21:19,768
Yan A96331.

213
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:21,288
What model?

214
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:22,048
Not sure.

215
00:21:22,768 --> 00:21:24,249
No follow-up message.

216
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:26,409
Newbies can't be trusted.

217
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:28,169
Old-timers are aged.

218
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:30,889
Key members aren't all here.

219
00:21:31,808 --> 00:21:33,048
You hurry up.

220
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:35,449
Wrap it up...

221
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:35,969
Wait.

222
00:21:36,568 --> 00:21:37,288
What's wrong?

223
00:21:41,752 --> 00:21:42,296
(Stop)

224
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:50,712
(Do Not Enter)

225
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:56,856
(Yan A96331)

226
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:05,528
Okay.

227
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:14,729
What's going on here?

228
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,009
Where are you going?

229
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:18,088
Heading to the city.

230
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:21,808
Can't go through.

231
00:22:22,449 --> 00:22:23,088
Why?

232
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:24,808
There's a landslide.

233
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:26,969
See the rocks on the ground?

234
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:29,729
Just got word.
The situation ahead is worse.

235
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:30,848
Roads are all closed.

236
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,689
S-Should I turn back or...

237
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:35,449
No need. Just follow me.

238
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:40,209
I'm changing shifts.
I'll lead you the way.

239
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:43,249
Behind this mountain

240
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:45,489
there's an internal road
for our rescue team.

241
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:47,288
Your GPS won't show it.

242
00:22:48,048 --> 00:22:49,649
The road is rough but shorter.

243
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:51,088
Bypass this section,

244
00:22:51,568 --> 00:22:53,048
turn west and you'll see the highway.

245
00:22:56,528 --> 00:22:58,048
Alright. Thank you then.

246
00:22:58,969 --> 00:22:59,848
Follow me.

247
00:22:59,848 --> 00:23:00,568
Got it.

248
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:53,169
Stop wasting time here!

249
00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:54,288
Listen to me.

250
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:55,489
We're already handling it.

251
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:56,288
(Binhai Grand Hotel)
We...

252
00:23:56,288 --> 00:23:57,088
No more excuses.

253
00:23:57,128 --> 00:23:59,568
What's the use of all that talk?
Does it help?

254
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:00,328
Well, listen.

255
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:01,929
Let's hear me out. Everyone...

256
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:03,528
Alright, how about this?

257
00:24:03,528 --> 00:24:04,328
We'll compensate.

258
00:24:04,729 --> 00:24:06,449
- Who's in Room 302?
- No more excuses.

259
00:24:06,768 --> 00:24:08,409
Please wait a moment.

260
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:10,528
- I was here first. Get in line.
- Who are you?

261
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:11,568
I'll compensate you.

262
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:12,689
I'll compensate you.

263
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:13,768
Well, what's...

264
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:14,969
Well, what's the matter?

265
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,848
Tell me who's in Room 302.

266
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:20,649
Sir, here's the thing.

267
00:24:20,969 --> 00:24:22,729
Our hotel regulations

268
00:24:23,288 --> 00:24:25,768
prohibit disclosing guest information.

269
00:24:27,128 --> 00:24:28,209
It's about privacy.

270
00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:31,449
Your hand should get...

271
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:37,169
Tell me who's in Room 302.

272
00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:38,729
And give me surveillance footage

273
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,649
of the lobby
and the third-floor stairway.

274
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,209
Stop it.

275
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:42,848
Give me the surveillance footage.

276
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:43,528
Stop!

277
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:45,929
Heard me? Give it to me.

278
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:47,649
Don't cause trouble here.

279
00:24:48,848 --> 00:24:49,689
Stop causing trouble.

280
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:52,889
You can't leave.

281
00:24:53,288 --> 00:24:54,009
You can't leave.

282
00:24:55,088 --> 00:24:56,288
Think you can get away?

283
00:24:57,768 --> 00:24:58,328
You hit him.

284
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:01,128
What's going on?

285
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:05,568
Y-You finally came.

286
00:25:05,568 --> 00:25:06,328
You finally came.

287
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:07,649
He hit us.

288
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:09,608
Look at my injuries.

289
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:11,449
Are you the manager?

290
00:25:11,768 --> 00:25:12,288
I am.

291
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:14,608
He hit me.

292
00:25:38,424 --> 00:25:40,792
(I smell)

293
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:53,848
(Burn After Reading: I smell the Fiend.)

294
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,063
(New Message)

295
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,521

296
00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:04,409
(Burn After Reading: I smell the Fiend.)

297
00:26:40,568 --> 00:26:42,608
Hello, Xicang Traffic
Information Center.

298
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:43,368
Hi.

299
00:26:43,608 --> 00:26:44,288
May I ask

300
00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:46,209
Jingyun Road is currently closed?

301
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:47,048
Is there an accident?

302
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:48,048
Jingyun Road?

303
00:26:48,048 --> 00:26:49,368
Yes, it's in Fenglai District.

304
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,169
I saw road rescue crews

305
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,649
mentioning a landslide.

306
00:26:53,088 --> 00:26:54,729
There was indeed a landslide earlier,

307
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,848
but we haven't received
road closure updates.

308
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:57,649
So it's not closed?

309
00:26:57,729 --> 00:26:58,249
Correct.

310
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,449
Debris should've been cleared already.

311
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:02,009
So it's passable now, right?

312
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:03,048
Currently, yes.

313
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:04,848
I see. Thank you.

314
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:05,568
You're welcome.

315
00:27:05,848 --> 00:27:06,848
Is there anything else...

316
00:32:19,864 --> 00:32:20,536
(New Message)

317
00:32:24,328 --> 00:32:25,808
(I lost it.)

318
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:28,649
(The Fiend is definitely
in the car Mad Blade mentioned)

319
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,328
If you keep damaging things,

320
00:34:15,328 --> 00:34:16,929
I won't buy you toys anymore.

321
00:34:20,048 --> 00:34:20,889
You'll have

322
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:24,088
to lay low for a while.

323
00:34:25,328 --> 00:34:27,169
South Mountain Hunters
are everywhere now.

324
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:30,969
I can't take you out for walks anymore.

325
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:33,528
But the Turquoise Land patrol

326
00:34:34,608 --> 00:34:35,929
only happens every four years.

327
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:38,729
Bear with it.

328
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,288
Soon we could climb trees again.

329
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:45,088
Stay here

330
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:47,009
and keep quiet.

331
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:48,289
Just behave.

332
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,289
You heard me?

333
00:34:54,568 --> 00:34:55,289
Locust.

334
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:07,969
Big Head says he smells the Fiend.

335
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:19,648
He is on a mission.

336
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:21,336
Definitely not Locust.
