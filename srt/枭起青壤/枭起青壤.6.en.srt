1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
He He really really

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:03,640
can

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:12,060
move

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,280
What

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,100
do you need to clarify?

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,320
How can you be so clear with me?

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,040
Because I don't want to get involved with the character

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,680
far too much

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,020
ok, I agree with you

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,000
Do you think you can do it?

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,400
If you love Su Professor реж

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,940
you must watch

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Can I do it today?

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,760
I'm afraid I can't do it.

42
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,880
Heaven's

43
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,660
And on the left

44
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,700
It's like a father and a son

45
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,520
The PK

46
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,820
Sharing the blame

47
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,960
are to share do

48
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,860
the thunder

49
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,420
and the very

50
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
You're a Blue Mountain hunter?

51
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
I'm waiting.

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
When the wind comes,

53
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
I'll cut your heads open

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
and open your stomachs.

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
I'll let your rotten hearts

56
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
see the light.

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
I'm not Li Xiao.

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
I'm here to help you.

59
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,760
One knife on both sides of the mouth.

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,760
The enemy's heart is broken.

61
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,760
The knife on the left side is the skin of the three.

62
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,760
The knife on the right side is the skin of the three.

63
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
The knife on the left side is the skin of the three.

64
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,760
The knife on the right side is the skin of the three.

65
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,760
You can talk about it later.

66
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,760
The poor people of the land.

67
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,760
They can't live in peace.

68
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
Let's take drought medicine.

69
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
Take up to the vane to the land.

70
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
Your brain can support the capital.

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
Go to the。

72
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,760
Are you worried about yourself?

73
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,760
What do you think I'm worried about?

74
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Stop.

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Stop swearing.

76
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
I'm here to help you

77
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
take up the nerve.

78
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Just vote.

79
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,560
the cost of the food and the price of the goods

80
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,760
But it's very harmful to the human body

81
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,160
So we set up a warning

82
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,360
Right

83
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
The spray will start soon

84
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,560
You have to think about how to explain to me

85
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,360
OK

86
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,360
I'm the general manager of Roushan Group, right?

87
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
That's right

88
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,360
Why do you always think I'm an outsider?

89
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,760
As for the core business, the price of the personnel

90
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,160
I don't need you to know

91
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
I understand

92
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,760
So you're the next-level business expert

93
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,760
You must have something to hide from me

94
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
Since I was a kid

95
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,160
The first time I saw Lin Yi

96
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,760
He didn't even grow a single ear

97
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,360
Brother, you've been working for the group

98
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,160
You've been injured more than once or twice

99
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,360
But every time you rest for two days

100
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
You're like a nobody

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
Do you think I'm crazy?

102
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,160
I don't care what you're doing

103
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,160
I don't care if it's to protect me

104
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
But I'm not a kid anymore

105
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
I'm not a fool

106
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,760
I'm also a member of this family

107
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
I don't want to be like Ji Xiao Wu

108
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
I want to be like this boss

109
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
I want to be like that boss

110
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,160
I want to be like that boss

111
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
For today

112
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
I'm really tired

113
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
In order to be myself

114
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
I'm really tired

115
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,760
If

116
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
If I can't

117
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
If I can't

118
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760
If I can't

119
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
If I can't

120
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,360
Be myself

121
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Be myself

122
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
Today

123
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Today, I'll do a second part

124
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
Let me

125
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,360
Kill

126
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
The bad guy

127
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
The bad guy

128
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
The bad guy

129
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
He's the boss

130
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,760
I understand what she said.

131
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,760
You're a soldier, you have nothing to fear.

132
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
She went to the farm?

133
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
From the reaction, there should be no problem.

134
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,760
She just wants to include us.

135
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,760
But if we continue to hide,

136
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,760
and let her find something and ask you in return,

137
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
then it will be more troublesome.

138
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
If you want to say something, just say it.

139
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,760
After she realized she and we were not of the same kind,

140
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,640
There are only two options.

141
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,000
One is to enter the room, and the other is to leave.

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,840
The former one requires you to be close to him and not keep anything from him.

143
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,120
If it's the latter one,

144
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,840
then it can only be clear.

145
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,280
After all, he's not a blood man.

146
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,440
Lü Jie, it's time to make a decision.

147
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,120
We don't know if it was a hidden wolf or a meat-eater.

148
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,000
But it was indeed time for the snake to come out.

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Think about it.

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,040
This is a place where we usually treat foreign injuries.

151
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,520
The conditions are definitely not as good as the hospital.

152
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,640
And this is also the best and most professional equipment we can get.

153
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,880
Sister-in-law Hua is in a stable state now.

154
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,080
She's not in a bad state.

155
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,120
She's not in a bad state.

156
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,480
Then let's arrange for someone to do the duty.

157
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,920
We have to be more careful.

158
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,640
Okay.

159
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,960
I'll go first tonight.

160
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,360
Ma Hanzi and I are usually at the base.

161
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,760
She's more familiar with this place.

162
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,360
We can do more duties.

163
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,840
The most important thing for us now is to find out the news of the missing father.

164
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,840
What's wrong, Uncle Jiang?

165
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,320
The hospital called.

166
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,600
They said they received a letter from Sister-in-law Hua Liu Bei.

167
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,080
The nurse said that the letter was written on the envelope.

168
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,120
The hunter of the southern mountain is clear.

169
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,080
The gold people are always quiet.

170
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,320
Let me see it.

171
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,040
What day was it yesterday?

172
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
The huntین?

173
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,280
Ioan time?

174
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,880
Wo Wen 조금 late,

175
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,360
Didn't we have an item in your house?

176
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,200
The crime made the thief drop an item at the gunpoint.

177
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,520
I hold the bag very tightly to protect Xu Wei Yu.

178
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,040
If we are too shortsighted,

00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,400
How do you know I like this flow?

187
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,200
You're a regular, right?

188
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,700
I started when you asked me

189
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,040
The Tracy keeps asking who you're comparing encounter

190
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,600
I asked,

191
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,400
Although she looks beautiful,

192
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,700
she has big itching

193
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,000
She seems to be artistic

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,660
In my heart,

195
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,100
She is like a secret activist

196
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,520
who is usually Millennial

197
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,940
She is her Box

198
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,940
So you're praising me?

199
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,340
What does the knife mean?

200
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,340
Wind blade.

201
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,700
The last party of the wedding

202
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,420
is called the wind incense.

203
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,060
The last game of football

204
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,820
is called the hanging.

205
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,740
The name of the wind blade

206
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,420
means to withdraw from the world

207
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,180
and to take a chance to win.

208
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,060
It's okay.

209
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,060
It's okay to tell me this.

210
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,660
I just want to tell you

211
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,020
that they care about this wind blade.

212
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,740
It's okay to tell you.

213
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,060
I'll send you the information.

214
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,140
You don't have to ask me to tell you.

215
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,140
Thank you.

216
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,660
Can we talk about the real thing?

217
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,820
I've found the person.

218
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,300
Where?

219
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,860
He was looked at very closely.

220
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,820
And he should have been injured.

221
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,020
The doctor didn't believe it.

222
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,460
But he was very obedient.

223
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,420
He didn't say anything.

224
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,820
How do you know

225
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,900
that the person you found

226
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,020
is the one I told you about?

227
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,860
The left leg is the disabled.

228
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,460
Yes.

229
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,620
The wind blade should be a person.

230
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,980
What do you want to say?

231
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,980
He said that the wind blade

232
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,500
can break the earth's soil.

233
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,780
Let them open the way to see the heaven.

234
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,980
I think the wind blade

235
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,660
should be the code of the earth.

236
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,580
What do you want to say?

237
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,020
I'm talking about something

238
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,540
I really don't want to talk about with you.

239
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,060
I only want to talk about

240
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,200
the person I care about

241
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,380
and the person I want to save.

242
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,540
All right.

243
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,820
He still has some value for Lin Xuzhou.

244
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:34,500
There is no likely מאׂ

245
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,300
Say it.

246
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,500
Next time,

247
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,020
When will you admit it?

248
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,020
What's the reason?

249
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,020
I asked you out.

250
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,020
You can't refuse.

251
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:26,520
It's have Hao Dong's

252
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Triple Whip.

253
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,020
What's follow about Yout vezes people make family?

254
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,720
That's the same one with them NATO.

255
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,520
It's the same.

256
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
I'll go to the court to report it

257
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
You can say it

258
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Do you agree?

259
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
He must go

260
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
I was wrong last time

261
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Of course I have to go back this time

262
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,520
Will someone still not go?

263
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
I'll go back

264
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
The whole team was caught

265
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,520
If you're still not moving

266
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Just pretend I didn't come today

267
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
Time, time

268
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
I think you should go with us

269
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
I don't want to go

270
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,520
I told Uncle Jiang

271
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,520
I'll leave after this operation

272
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Calm down

273
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,520
You have new plans

274
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,520
But now the enemy appears

275
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
How can the hunter not be crazy?

276
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,520
We all have our own things to do

277
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,520
I won't interfere in your choices

278
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
I hope you can respect me

279
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Send me the time and location

280
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
I'll be there on time

281
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Tomorrow is my day off

282
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
I'm going to the city to see a painting exhibition

283
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
What are you going to do?

284
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,520
I'm not feeling well today

285
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,520
I'm not able to stand the smell of alcohol

286
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
I want to try it myself

287
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Tomorrow is my day off

288
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,520
There's a painting exhibition

289
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
I want to see it

290
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
What are you going to do?

291
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
I heard it

292
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
You go by yourself

293
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
I want to practice at home

294
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Okay, practice hard

295
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
Hello

296
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Do you know the selection list?

297
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
I know

298
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
But I don't believe that thing works

299
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,520
I hope you don't believe it

300
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
The dog family relies on the sense of embroidery

301
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
But there is no sense of relationship

302
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
Each kind has to go with the experience

303
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,520
Sacrifice one kind to add another

304
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
I think it's worth it

305
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
I think it's stupid

306
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,520
Well said

307
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,520
What kind of thing that's I really don't trust

308
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
A olive will find its owner

309
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
In the underneath of the casting

310
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Talk to me

311
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Don't talk to me

312
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,760
Is that a processlv

313
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Listen, I think

314
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,660
longevity may be any

315
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,560
chil

316
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,520
ara

317
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,520
Uh, not the trinn

318
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
That's strange

319
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
and the people will be scattered.

320
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
There will be no light.

321
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
The power of the night will not be affected.

322
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
All the candidates for the wild dog

323
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,520
have the right to choose whether to eat the wild dog or not.

324
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
But if they eat it,

325
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
they may not be able to become a wild dog.

326
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Any consequences

327
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
must be taken care of by themselves.

328
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
Uncle Jiang,

329
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
I've thought it through.

330
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,520
Don't you want

331
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
to talk to A'Ruo first

332
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
and listen to her ideas?

333
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
To become a wild dog

334
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,520
is to become a better Southern Mountain Hunter

335
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
and protect everyone better.

336
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,520
This is my decision after I've thought it through.

337
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
No need to discuss it with anyone else.

338
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
I have to do it.

339
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,520
Did you ever have friends

340
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
or partners?

341
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
I mean

342
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
people other than me.

343
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
Or

344
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
before you came here,

345
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
in your class,

346
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
If there is,

347
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,520
this person who was close to you before

348
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,520
will gradually become distant and unfamiliar with you.

349
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
They will become unfamiliar with you.

350
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,520
They will even not recognize each other.

351
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
They will not understand you.

352
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
What will you do?

353
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,520
Come to see her.

354
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Compromise her.

355
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Blame her.

356
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,520
Although we are completely different,

357
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
this feeling

358
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
shouldn't be hard to understand.

359
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Only one bottle of the powder.

360
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,520
Whoever wants to find it first can smell it for an hour tomorrow.

361
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Start.

362
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,520
I'll go.

363
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
It's all mixed in the water.

364
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
How can I smell it?

365
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,520
It's hot.

366
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Left side.

367
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
Third cup.

368
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
Rest.

369
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
You guys run three laps.

370
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Okay.

371
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Didn't we agree

372
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
that the reward will be given tomorrow?

373
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Let's go.

374
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Hurry up.

375
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
Hurry up.

376
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
Hurry up.

377
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Hurry up.

378
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:05,580
How about the

379
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
next day?

380
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
We'll be strangers one day.

381
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
Let's go.

382
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,520
Let's go.

383
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
Hurry up.

384
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Hurry up.

385
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Hurry up.

386
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Hurry up.

387
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
Hurry up.

388
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Hurry up.

389
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
Hurry up.

390
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
Hurry up.

391
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
We'll be strangers one day.

392
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
But if we encounter the same problem,

393
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
we'll always fight side by side.

394
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,520
Otherwise,

395
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
how can we still be friends?

396
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
I want to go out.

397
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,280
I'll give you wild boar, your favorite.

398
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,720
I heard from Xing Chen that you agreed to join the operation.

399
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,840
If something happens to the snow mountain, I can't just let it go.

400
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,480
Okay. Be careful.

401
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,120
You too.

402
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,080
We've never faced such a situation before.

403
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
We must be fully prepared this time.

404
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,400
The men's hunting is a long-term plan.

405
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,920
Although I haven't hunted wild boars for years, I haven't lost my skills.

406
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,240
I don't have to worry about wasting my skills.

407
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,440
It's just a matter of time.

408
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,440
How can we get there?

409
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,720
I hope so.

410
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,320
See you then.

411
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,800
Isn't it common for them to rush out?

412
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,400
Why don't you just come back?

413
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,760
I'm worried...

414
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,160
There's something that I've decided to do.

415
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,120
I'll face it sooner or later.

416
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,360
But what if...

417
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
Don't worry. I know what to do.

418
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,360
I'll face it sooner or later.

419
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,360
I'll face it sooner or later.

420
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
I'll face it sooner or later.

421
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
I'll face it sooner or later.

422
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
I'll face it sooner or later.

423
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,360
I'll face it sooner or later.

424
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Xing Chen, Lin Yi asked me to go to Lv County for dinner.

425
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,360
You're not at home.

426
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,360
I don't want to go.

427
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,360
I don't want to go.

428
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
It's strange that he's so desperate to meet you.

429
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,360
But he's been with Lv County for so long.

430
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
He's not a reliable person.

431
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Don't think about it. Just be angry.

432
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,360
I know.

433
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
But I really...

434
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
I'll tell you later. I'll throw it away.

435
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,360
I'll take you to Lv County.

436
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,360
I'll tell you later.

437
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,360
Don't worry.

438
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,360
I'll be with you.

439
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Don't worry.

440
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,360
I'll go to Lv County with you.

441
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,360
I'm not afraid of anything.

442
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
It's okay.

443
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,360
How about your brother?

444
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,360
He's a good man.

445
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,360
He's not afraid of anything.

446
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
I'm here for you.

447
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,360
Don't worry.

448
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,620
Jugas

449
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
How many of them Andre?

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,580

The sword is like a thunderbolt, and the blade is like a tree.

458
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,620
The sword is like a blade, and the blade is like a tree.

459
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,620
The sword is like a blade, and the blade is like a tree.

00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,620
The sword is like a blade, and the blade is like a tree.

461
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,620
The sword is like a blade, and the blade is like a tree.

462
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,620
The sword is like a blade, and the blade is like a tree.

463
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,620
The sword is like a blade, and the blade is like a tree.

00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,580
I'm here to introduce you to this man.

473
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,580
This is Que Chang.

474
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,580
He's been with me for over ten years.

475
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,580
This time,

476
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,580
someone is staying at home to watch Sister Hua.

477
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,580
There's also a horseman,

478
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,580
a general.

479
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,580
He'll come from the morning.

00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,580
He will.

481
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,580
He will definitely come.

482
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,580
The stars are bright,

483
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,580
the sun is bright,

484
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,580
the sun is bright,

485
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,580
the sun is bright,

486
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,580
they all rise up and fall.

487
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,580
The wind suck at the termites.

488
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,900
The wind suck at the termites.

489
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,380
Blood-dry the ashes,

00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,380
the gander's smallges沒事.

491
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:14,180
By launching scared flags across the를

492
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,180
we led the imperial king away.

493
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,580
I'm not the master of the Jiangtong rabbit

494
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,580
I can't hurt you

495
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,580
Today I just opened my eyes

496
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,580
I can't stop the wind

497
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:46,580
I'm afraid that the dog's horn will blow

498
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,580
I'm more dangerous than the gun

499
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,580
Brother Xiao, can you shut this old man's mouth?

500
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,580
I think I can be a little bigger

501

What day is it?

505
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,580
Let me guess

506
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,580
It's almost the new year

Hurry about it

531
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,260
Put it down

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,120
Hon, you should stay

533
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,680
This is a desert

534
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,720
I was invited here alone

535
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,080
Just look at this

536
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,500
Such sharp hands

537
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,500
Where are they?

538
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,580

There must be a ease in this neighborhood

541
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:14,800
Have you heard of the

542
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:15,940
