Nie Jiuluo, wake up!

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Don't pass out.

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,839

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,160
Luo.

23
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,359
Wake up.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,959
We're almost there.

25
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,040
Luo.

26
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:55,000
Mom.

27
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,399
Where are we going?

28
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,519
I promised you

29
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:03,119
a boat ride.

30
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,880
Forget about it?

31
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:21,799
I won't go.

32
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,519
Nie Jiuluo.

33
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,880
Nie Jiuluo.

34
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,839
I won't go.

35
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,679
You're finally awake.

36
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,440
Let me help you.

37
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:58,920
I can manage.

38
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,119
Almost there.

39
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:15,600
Wait for me. Just a moment.

40
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,600
What? You scared me.

41
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Stop it. Get the door.

42
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,119
The clinic is not yours.

43
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,000
Bro, what's wrong?

44
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,559
Move!

45
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,280
Let's go.

46
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,119
T-To the operating room.

47
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,280
A penetrating wound.

48
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,319
Lie down first.

49
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,808
I'll prepare for sterilization.

50
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,559
Don't just stand there.

51
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:07,559
Cut the clothes open.

52
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,199
Wait, I...

53
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,520
Well, I...

54
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,720
Get out.

55
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,520
How is it?

56
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,439
Got no clues.

57
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,999
Did Mad Blade contact you?

58
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,640
Go on searching?

59
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,080
Retreat.

60
00:08:05,888 --> 00:08:08,832
(Herb)

61
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,040
She's stable for now.

62
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,400
If you're trying to poison her,

63
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,239
my surgery would be pointless.

64
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:54,760
Thanks.

65
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,240
H-How long have we known each other?

66
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,920
Wanbao Tower didn't even exist
when we met.

67
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,079
Now it's becoming a century-old shop.

68
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:15,000
So?

69
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:17,000
So, we're buddies.

70
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,959
Right?

71
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:22,880
Ms. Lin has been

72
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,240
more than a mother to us both.

73
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:27,360
We never swore brotherhood,

74
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,799
but we are kind

75
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,120
of best buddies.

76
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,839
Fine.

77
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:36,640
You helped me today,

78
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,120
and I owe you this.

79
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,959
But

80
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,199
if you leak a word,

81
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,400
especially to Ms. Lin,

82
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,799
you'll be out of Xicang.

83
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,599
Believe me?

84
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,839
Tuo.

85
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,520
You wouldn't come to me
unless desperate.

86
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,040
Stop the threats.

87
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:05,040
If you don't trust me, take her away.

88
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,319
I won't leak a word.

89
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,040
Thanks.

90
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,439
Alright, enough.

91
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:19,160
Stop it. Get me a bowl.

92
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,839
I'll test for poison.

93
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,400
What did you put in?

94
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,599
Not worried about incompatibility?

95
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,120
Big Head, Shan Qiang.

96
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,920
Take a team each tomorrow

97
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,120
(Clues Map)
to find Chen Fu and Han Guan.

98
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:05,360
Said to find Jiang, yet found nothing.

99
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,240
A lot of nonsense.

100
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,520
Double-check vehicle info later.

101
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:09,839
Got it.

102
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,920
Even support Mad Blade
hunting Earth Fiends.

103
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,040
Found no Fiends,
yet Mad Blade's missing.

104
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,120
Humanoid Earth Fiends have no scent,

105
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,199
but put three Hounds in each team,

106
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,479
just in case.

107
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,679
The Hounds are sharp.

108
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:24,799
They bark without smelling anything.

109
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:30,120
Rest up.

110
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:31,760
Assemble at 6 AM.

111
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:34,640
Alright.

112
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:35,760
Bedtime.

113
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,400
Exhausted.

114
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,240
If not for Jiang,

115
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,000
we wouldn't be alive.

116
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,719
Everything we're doing

117
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,959
is for Jiang.

118
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:54,719
I want to find Jiang too.

119
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:56,160
But where is he anyway?

120
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,880
What do Han Guan

121
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,280
and Chen Fu have to do with me?

122
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,839
You're not the only one
thinking this way now.

123
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,520
But internal conflicts solve nothing.

124
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,640
We need someone to lead now.

125
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,719
Better than being in a mess,
no matter how you deny.

126
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,760
Fine, my mistake.

127
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:27,200
(Clue Map)

128
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:29,400
Sorry,

129
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,400
the subscriber you dialed
is unavailable.

130
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,240
Please try again later.

131
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,400
I already brushed my teeth.

132
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:52,479
Stop pushing yourself. Go take a nap.

133
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:54,719
It's fine.

134
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,120
Don't worry about me.

135
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,439
I'm not worried about you, okay?

136
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:01,240
Having one critical patient exhausts me.

137
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:03,439
If you collapse here from exhaustion,

138
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,079
how can I keep this clinic running?

139
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,479
I'm just worried about myself.

140
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,679
When will she wake up?

141
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,120
No idea.

142
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,160
Don't you see her severe injure?

143
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,880
But luckily,

144
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,559
it's not fatal

145
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,240
and no vital organs were damaged.

146
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,439
Tuo.

147
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,559
What's her background?

148
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,559
She's slim,

149
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,120
but her wounds heal freakishly fast.

150
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:31,880
Can't believe it.

151
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:34,040
She's like the Wolverine.

152
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,920
You're awake.

153
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:41,959
How are those two Earth Fiends?

154
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:43,479
What?

155
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
W-What Fiends?

156
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:47,760
Filets.

157
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,920
She meant filets.

158
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,959
Probably hungry.

159
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,040
I'll go reheat the congee.

160
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,120
Wait. Hold on.

161
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:55,880
I'm being honest.

162
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,920
Don't stay here.

163
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,880
Xiong Hei could show up anytime.

164
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,199
What to explain if we get caught?

165
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,319
And, this is my only bed.

166
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:05,360
Do you expect me

167
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,719
to sleep on the operating table?

168
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,719
Find her a proper recovery spot.

169
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,199
I've tended her wound

170
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,400
and got her tetanus shot.

171
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,719
Just help her change dressing.

172
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,880
Got it. Thanks.

173
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,080
She's awake. You stay with her.

174
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,039
I'll get the congee.

175
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,800
Thanks.

176
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:44,999
Don't worry.

177
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,784
I'll handle the Earth Fiends.

178
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:50,759
How are you feeling now?

179
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,959
Careful. Here.

180
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,479
Are you sure

181
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,600
you can clean up the mess alone?

182
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,039
Your injuries need attention.

183
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,640
I'll go handle it later.

184
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:29,920
Go now.

185
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,880
Can't delay any longer.

186
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,999
I'll take you home first.

187
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:33,999
You need proper care.

188
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:35,719
I...

189
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:41,800
I don't want Ms. Lu

190
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,360
to see me like this.

191
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,400
Then what?

192
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,199
Want some dumplings?

193
00:21:03,256 --> 00:21:06,616
(Changxi Dumplings)

194
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:11,544
(Dumplings)
Mr. Changxi.

195
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,120
Mr. Changxi.

196
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,160
Coming.

197
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,800
This is the man I mentioned

198
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,199
on the way here.

199
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,120
He's a good man, great cook,

200
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:23,519
old but vigorous,
and best at cooking dumplings.

201
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,239
Mr. Changxi.

202
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,320
Don't trust his nonsense.

203
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,840
Miss Nie, right?

204
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:29,519
Come on, hurry up.

205
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,120
Dumplings get cold.

206
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,239
Mr. Changxi, sorry for bothering you.

207
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,999
Don't mention it.

208
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,719
Tuo said you're unwell.

209
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:40,999
These fillings are light,
nutritious, and easy to digest.

210
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:41,920
Try some.

211
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:44,039
Wipe your hands.

212
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,840
Here. Clean now.

213
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:02,320
You are so caring.

214
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,920
What a wonder.

215
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,759
Eat up.

216
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,439
Thank you.

217
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:11,199
No problem.

218
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,719
Eat up.

219
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,952
(Open)

220
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:23,096
(Closed)

221
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,759
Don't you like the food?

222
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,080
No, it's delicious.

223
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,600
Still feeling unwell?

224
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,560
I'll get you some broth.

225
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:40,560
No need.

226
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,679
Just get some rest.

227
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,920
Eating and sleeping
are the best medicine.

228
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,800
The room's ready.
You can stay in my room.

229
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:48,199
What about you?

230
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,679
I'll take the back room.

231
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,959
Think I'd sleep on the streets?

232
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,880
Want more?

233
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,959
Go take her to her room.

234
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,360
Okay.

235
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,400
Take a look around.

236
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:20,160
Let me know if you need anything.

237
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,080
Thank you.

238
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,080
Thanks a lot.

239
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,239
Sit down and rest.

240
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,120
This isn't the time to rest.

241
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,439
Don't worry. I'll handle those two.

242
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:44,320
We can't use

243
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,600
them to get Jiang back.

244
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:47,840
It'll only provoke Lin Xirou.

245
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,600
Eliminate them as soon as possible.

246
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,519
Got it. Leave it to me.

247
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,999
I'll also try

248
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,080
to get news about Jiang.

249
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:55,719
Sit down.

250
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:57,539
Careful.

251
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,679
I've been away too long.

252
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:10,320
I need to show my face to Lin Xirou.

253
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,199
You need proper care.

254
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,160
Mr. Changxi

255
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,600
watched me grow up.

256
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,959
He's practically a father to me.

257
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:17,959
You can trust him.

258
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:33,320
Rest up.

259
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,239
Sent it.

260
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,039
Did you get it?

261
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:54,080
Codonopsis, astragalus, pseudoginseng,

262
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:55,519
and pigeon?

263
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,120
Right.

264
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,959
Where am I supposed to catch a pigeon?

265
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,800
Get one in the morning market.

266
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,120
Herbal shops open early.

267
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,160
The herbs are easy to get.

268
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,880
I checked it up.

269
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:06,424
It is helpful for replenishing
blood after an injury.

270
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,920
Thank you a lot.

271
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,120
Best if Miss Nie can drink this soup

272
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:11,400
once she wakes tomorrow.

273
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,600
Replenishing blood?

274
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:18,360
Tuo, did she go through a cesarean?

275
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:19,959
What?

276
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:20,880
Not at all.

277
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,320
She just got an injury.

278
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,920
Tuo, be honest with me.

279
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:28,640
Where did you find this girl?

280
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
Why is she injured?

281
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,439
I promised your parents.

282
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,600
I won't let you stray
down the wrong path.

283
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,800
Don't get fooled.

284
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,479
I understand. Don't worry.

285
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,400
Miss Nie is trustworthy.

286
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,080
She matters a lot to me.

287
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,560
But I have urgent matters

288
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,400
to attend to.

289
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:51,199
And you're the person I trust most.

290
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,239
Please take good care

291
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:53,999
of her for me.

292
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:54,759
When I return,

293
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:55,999
I'll explain everything to you.

294
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:56,600
Okay?

295
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,120
I'm leaving.

296
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,199
Hold on.

297
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,800
If her injury

298
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,519
is related to you,

299
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:11,959
you have to take full responsibility.

300
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,239
Understood.

(Changxi Dumplings)

302
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,239
Is the room acceptable?

303
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,360
Sorry, it's a modest room.

304
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,039
Not at all, Mr. Changxi.

305
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:07,719
I should thank you.

306
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,519
This is the new phone

307
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:13,479
Tuo got for me recently.

308
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,759
Please take it for now.

309
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,800
Here's the landline number downstairs.

310
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,759
Call me if you need something.

311
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,880
That's unnecessary, Mr. Changxi.

312
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,279
I'll be fine alone.

313
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,719
Tuo doesn't ask me for favors often.

314
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,120
He told me repeatedly

315
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,640
to take good care of you.

316
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:38,080
I can't let him down.

317
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,039
Alright.

318
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,039
Well, if he ever treats you badly,

319
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,920
just tell me.

320
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:50,759
I'll lecture him.

321
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,039
Mr. Changxi, you've misunderstood.

322
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,080
We are not in a relationship.

323
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,880
No?

324
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,199
Anyway,

325
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,920
I can still lecture him.

326
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,959
Thanks then.

327
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:08,199
No problem.

Tell Mad Blade

she failed to kill me,

The pigeon soup stewed
with astragalus and codonopsis.

346
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,536
I skimmed off the grease,

347
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,360
so it's not greasy at all.

348

Have it.

00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,680
Thank you, Mr. Changxi.

350
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,159
You're so considerate.

351
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,159
Tuo told me to do so.

352
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:14,840
I'm an expert at dumplings,

353
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,119
but this is not my expertise.

354
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,479
Thank him then.

355
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,880
Dumplings are available.

356
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:21,760
If you get hungry,

357
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,400
you can always get fresh ones.

358
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,439
You can go with your work. Thanks.

359
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:28,760
Nothing. Drink it.

360
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,159
(Lin Ling's Health Report)
The liver, kidneys, thyroid,

361
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,159
including gynecology,

362
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,800
all indicators are good

363
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:05,119
and above standards.

364
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,840
Her current age and physical condition

365
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,519
are perfect.

366
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:16,176
(Yan Tuo)

367
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,800
Why so nervous?

368
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,039
Nothing.

369
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,959
When the season of flowers has passed,

370
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:25,400
not even a bud remains,

371
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:26,680
which is the greatest pity.

372
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,800
Flower appreciation

373
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
must follow nature's timetable.

374
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,519
Though flowers may bloom again,

375
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,320
youth never returns.

376
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,680
People of each age should
fulfill the tasks they have.

377
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,479
Have dinner with Lv Xian this weekend.

378
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,680
I-I don't want to go.

379
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:01,920
I said

380
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,360
I don't want to go.

381
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,200
Compared to peers his age,

382
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:18,639
Lv Xian is nice in any aspect.

383
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,280
For someone like you,

384
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,559
he's an excellent choice.

385
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:31,079
Self-awareness is a virtue.

386
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,479
For someone like you,

387
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:34,360
you don't have much room to be picky.

388
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,079
Why do you always make me

389
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,240
do things I hate?

390
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,159
All these years,

391
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,959
have you ever cared what I like to eat,

392
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,240
who I fancy,

393
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,240
or what life I want to live?

394
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:50,079
Are you truly doing this for me,

395
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,920
or just tormenting me?

396
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,320
What should you say to me?

397
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:13,840
I'm sorry.

398
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:14,880
Say it.

399
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,360
I'm sorry, Ms. Lin.

400
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,519
Sis will tell you

401
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:54,800
the dinner location.

402
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,999
Ms. Lin.

403
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,840
You're finally back.

404
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,599
Logistics department

405
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:08,959
said customs seized some medicine.

406
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,680
It's urgent. We scrambled for help.

407
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:11,639
And now?

408
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,880
All resolved. Don't worry.

409
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:19,200
Had a quarrel?

410
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,360
Don't fret. I'll talk sense into her.

411
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,760
Ms. Lin.

412
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,079
My dear Ms. Lin.

413
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,400
Have you behaved lately?

414
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,079
Been behaving properly.

415
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,439
Ms. Lin.

416
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,119
You're here, and I'm relieved.

417
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,479
Yueying.

418
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,559
All these years,

419
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:22,920
you haven't changed a bit.

420
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:37,840
You might as well

421
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,360
stay longer.

422
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,880
Let me help you recuperate.

423
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,400
Thank you, Ms. Lin.

424
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,632
Where are Han Guan and Chen Fu?

425
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:56,240
Probably still dawdling on the way.

426
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:57,599
You're

427
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,959
the dawdling one.

428
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,479
Yueying and I

429
00:44:00,479 --> 00:44:01,999
had waited for you for long.

430
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,039
I can't hear you!

431
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:05,639
Blah blah blah!

432
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,599
Where's Xiong Hei? Why isn't he here?

433
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:16,559
Gou Ya escaped.

434
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,559
Xiong Hei took people to search for him.

435
00:44:19,439 --> 00:44:20,119
He escaped?

please leave.
