(Yan Tuo, General Manager
of Roadsound Group)

(Legal Representative, Lin Xirou)

20
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:08,280
(Mr. Lu)

21
00:03:10,652 --> 00:03:12,611
Could you stop rushing me?

22
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:15,092
The world has changed.

23
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:17,372
Aesthetic tastes
are growing more unpredictable.

24
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:19,411
What are you talking about?

25
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:21,652
Your unmarketable new creation

26
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:22,851
caught someone's eye.

27
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:24,131
Really?

28
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:26,812
I told him

29
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:27,972
only drafts exist

30
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:29,291
and the final product isn't done.

31
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:30,652
Yet he insisted

32
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:32,812
it's okay and he'd wait.

33
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:36,212
Don't joke with me.

34
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:37,652
Not sure if it's a joke.

35
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,611
He prepaid for three pieces outright.

36
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:40,772
He only wants

37
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:41,972
to meet you

38
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,372
and discuss art in person.

39
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:44,972
Who is he?

40
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:48,212
We can't pry about his background.

41
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:50,212
Anyway, he's declared

42
00:03:50,652 --> 00:03:52,291
he'll buy whatever you produce.

43
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:54,731
See? The world has changed.

44
00:04:20,652 --> 00:04:22,252
Are you sure nothing is wrong with him?

45
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:23,851
A decent business owner.

46
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:26,611
He started from scratch
through honest work.

47
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:28,731
Since when do decent people
meet in cemeteries?

48
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:30,492
It's why he's remarkable.

49
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:31,451
Think about it.

50
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:33,731
No invite to dinner
avoids dietary preferences.

51
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:35,812
No invite to drinks
prevent seeming frivolous.

52
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:38,972
No office meet avoids formal stiffness.

53
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:39,812
No gallery meeting

54
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:42,372
presumes you've outgrown such spaces.

55
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:45,411
Which place has serene
yet meaningful setting

56
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,812
suitable for discussing art freely

57
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:48,372
and contemplating life deeply?

58
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,851
Hotel executive lounge?

59
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:50,731
Too pedestrian.

60
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:52,372
Can a lounge allow you

61
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:53,492
to explore life's essence,

62
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:55,532
human destiny,

63
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:57,812
or the end of life?

64
00:04:58,891 --> 00:04:59,812
I need to go.

65
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:01,012
I see him.

66
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:09,132
Is this how you treat clients?

67
00:05:10,572 --> 00:05:11,652
I'll require a refund.

68
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:13,731
No need. I won't sell it to you.

69
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:15,811
Your work is about rebirth, right?

70
00:05:18,572 --> 00:05:19,371
Madman.

71
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:25,931
Though newly created

72
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:27,291
with limited impact,

73
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:29,251
I've read critiques

74
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:31,291
that mostly interpret your work

75
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:35,212
as depicting suffocation and confinement

76
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:37,652
and conveying dark emotions.

77
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:40,652
If you continue,

78
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:42,332
you'll expose your ignorance.

79
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:47,452
Whenever I come here,

80
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:50,212
I don't feel death or fear.

81
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:52,572
Your sculptures

82
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,411
inexplicably

83
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:54,611
don't oppress me.

84
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,892
They evoke childbirth's struggle.

85
00:05:57,332 --> 00:05:59,692
Of course, it's agonizing

86
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,371
for the mother and child,

87
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:03,012
yet the miracle

88
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:04,731
of new life emerging

89
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,332
is the ultimate hope.

90
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:07,491
So I believe

91
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,772
you're fundamentally optimistic.

92
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:11,452
True, I'm no art expert,

93
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:12,772
but I'm not pretending.

94
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:14,411
I genuinely admire your work.

95
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:20,332
Let me share my interpretation.

96
00:06:20,332 --> 00:06:21,332
I'm all ears.

97
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,332
Outsiders see

98
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:25,811
a pampered heir

99
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:27,371
living carefree.

100
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:29,931
Even you've bought into this facade,

101
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:30,731
trapped in

102
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:32,892
an identity and fate you despise.

103
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:35,452
If you truly appreciated my art,

104
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:37,452
you'd recognize

105
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:39,332
the dark emotions, such as suffocation

106
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,452
and confinement

107
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:42,851
that mirror your reality,

108
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:44,972
instead of standing

109
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:46,051
in front of me,

110
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:47,772
spouting empty praise.

111
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:54,051
Surprising depth of understanding

112
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,851
for new acquaintances like us.

113
00:06:56,892 --> 00:06:59,452
I have no interest in understanding
a reckless madman

114
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,931
who'd drown others with him in a car.

115
00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:03,452
My apologies. I acted rashly.

116
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:05,772
I just wanted calm dialogue

117
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:07,012
and honest communication.

118
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:08,171
If you still think

119
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:09,532
I'm mad after hearing me out,

120
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:11,532
I'll put a stop to it.

121
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,532
No more bothering.

122
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:21,611
I'm not sure

123
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:22,892
what you gain from being here.

124
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:25,212
But this place makes me uneasy.

125
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,132
Get to the point.

126
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:31,332
I invited you here
to show you a piece of work.

127
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:33,731
Work?

128
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,012
A tombstone.

129
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:45,411
A woman

130
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:47,931
ruined my family.

131
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:50,572
(Lin Xirou)
She even stole my mother's name.

132
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,332
Lin Xirou is now

133
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:55,652
in charge of the entire Roadsound Group,

134
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:56,731
living carefree.

135
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,012
This tombstone was erected for my mother

136
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:02,972
and will also eventually be hers.

137
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:06,291
Are you saying your biological mother
was named Lin Xirou,

138
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:10,371
and the current Lin Xirou
of Roadsound Group

139
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:12,491
is the one who killed her?

140
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:30,892
I got you.

141
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:32,411
Wait a bit longer.

142
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:33,572
Dad will be home soon.

143
00:08:35,212 --> 00:08:35,811
Tuo.

144
00:08:36,371 --> 00:08:37,572
Dad.

145
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,132
Sorry for being late.

146
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:40,171
Here.

147
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:42,371
Happy birthday.

148
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:44,012
Such a beautiful toy car.

149
00:08:44,012 --> 00:08:44,972
Do you like it?

150
00:08:44,972 --> 00:08:46,851
Yes, I love it.

151
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:49,051
Who is she?

152
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:51,371
Honey,

153
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,972
this is Li Ergou's sister,

154
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:55,772
Shuangxiu. Li Shuangxiu.

155
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:59,012
Since the baby you're carrying develops,

156
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:00,772
and there's so much housework,

157
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:02,731
Shuangxiu will stay here from now on.

158
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:04,212
Order her around for chores

159
00:09:04,332 --> 00:09:05,892
like she's one of our family.

160
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:07,532
Let me show you the place.

161
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:11,171
You're about to give birth
and you're still doing chores.

162
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:12,772
Dashan went to pick Tuo up from school.

163
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:14,171
I'll go meet them halfway.

164
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:53,731
Tuo,

165
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:57,972
I have something very important to do.

166
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:00,771
Be good and wait here, okay?

167
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:25,131
Tuo, you may call me
Ms. Lin from now on.

168
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:26,812
Ms. Lin.

169
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:33,812
My full name is Lin Xirou.

170
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:49,771
After that,

171
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:51,251
she became

172
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,692
the lady of our household.

173
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:57,371
As a kid, I was clueless.

174
00:10:57,692 --> 00:10:58,771
For years,

175
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,491
I had genuinely considered
her my family.

176
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:05,371
After I eventually found

177
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:06,651
my mother's diary,

178
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:07,611
I realized...

179
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:13,412
Why are you telling me this?

180
00:11:15,052 --> 00:11:15,972
Gou Ya

181
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:18,452
was sent to the welfare home
by Lin Xirou.

182
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:21,092
If he's truly an Earth Fiend,

183
00:11:22,251 --> 00:11:23,972
then Lin Xirou must control the key

184
00:11:24,052 --> 00:11:25,891
to transforming Earth Fiends
into human form.

185
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:28,452
What else do you know?

186
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:31,172
I've looked for a long time.
But she's too cautious.

187
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,491
She has guarded against me.

188
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:35,172
I found nothing.

189
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:37,412
But now that Gou Ya is in trouble

190
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:38,851
and I've met you

191
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:40,172
and your organization,

192
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:41,851
it gives me hope.

193
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:43,972
I just want to know

194
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:45,092
what I should do

195
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,092
(Lin Xirou)
to avenge my mother.

196
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:50,011
First, you need to find out

197
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:51,572
exactly what Lin Xirou is.

198
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:53,131
I don't care what she is.

199
00:11:54,891 --> 00:11:56,292
But I'm certain

200
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:58,292
her connection
to Earth Fiends is unusual.

201
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:00,851
If you truly oppose

202
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:01,731
the Earth Fiends,

203
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:02,771
working with me

204
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:04,731
is a golden opportunity.

205
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:08,731
You said it you considered
her your family.

206
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:10,052
And she raised you.

207
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:12,611
Do you think I'll take such a risk

208
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,692
by working with you?

209
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:16,292
If a hunter teams up with a wolf cub,

210
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:17,972
they could destroy the entire wolf den.

211
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:19,131
Isn't that worth the gamble?

212
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:20,771
Don't flatter yourself as a wolf.

213
00:12:21,212 --> 00:12:23,332
You could be the snake
in the farmer's story.

214
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:26,851
Fine.

215
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:31,131
I know you're not afraid
of snakes or wolves.

216
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:34,572
But you're afraid of water.

217
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:38,251
I also know your home address
and workplace.

218
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:39,932
Even your artistic philosophy.

219
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:41,972
Driving a car into water

220
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:43,572
was me going too far.

221
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:45,412
But I can't promise

222
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:46,812
I won't do it again.

223
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:55,011
You're truly something.

224
00:12:55,771 --> 00:12:57,651
How rare to hear you say something kind.

225
00:12:58,491 --> 00:12:59,412
What do you mean?

226
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:02,891
After hearing your life story earlier,

227
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:04,172
I genuinely felt

228
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:05,851
a slight sense of empathy.

229
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:07,172
I even forgot about

230
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:08,251
our past unpleasantness.

231
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:09,932
But just now

232
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:11,212
your words

233
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,531
revived my disgust toward you.

234
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,412
You have a way with people.

235
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:17,891
If that's the case,

236
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:19,651
your being immune to all persuasion

237
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:20,812
and your sarcastic skills

238
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:21,972
are thoroughly impressive.

239
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:24,092
A truly dedicated

240
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:25,572
and virtuous artist.

241
00:13:29,972 --> 00:13:30,572
Come with me.

242
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:31,851
To where?

243
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:34,491
I'll show you a sculpture.

244
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,332
(Temple of the Righteous Lord)

245
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:03,452
In ancient times,

246
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,131
a meteor fell
into South Mountain's ancient woods.

247
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:09,371
The meteor melted into the earth,

248
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:10,771
turning the soil turquoise.

249
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:15,212
Plants and animals mutated,
and strange occurrences multiplied.

250
00:14:16,092 --> 00:14:19,611
Then a type of light-fearing,

251
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:21,651
carnivorous savage beasts

252
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:23,172
started roaming South Mountain.

253
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:25,812
The locals

254
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,812
named those beasts Earth Fiends.

255
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:30,731
Earth Fiends were brutal killers.

256
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:32,131
People suffered terribly.

257
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:33,972
Later,

258
00:14:34,692 --> 00:14:36,172
the emperor sent troops

259
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:38,491
to drive the Earth Fiends underground.

260
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:41,172
The soldiers who stayed

261
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:43,611
abandoned their identities

262
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:45,692
and called themselves
South Mountain Hunters.

263
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:47,292
and swore enmity with Earth Fiends.

264
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:48,731
This legacy continues today.

265
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:53,011
Such detailed settings?

266
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:54,572
Not writing a novel wastes them.

267
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:55,851
I've said my piece.

268
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:57,731
Believe what you will.

269
00:14:59,611 --> 00:15:00,212
Go on.

270
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:02,572
Those injured by Earth Fiends

271
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:04,092
develop filmy tissue

272
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,371
over wounds after some time,

273
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:08,011
like rooting and sprouting.

274
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:10,412
Though revealing this to an outsider

275
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:11,651
breaks our rules,

276
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,531
soon I'll also be an outsider.

277
00:15:13,531 --> 00:15:14,332
It doesn't matter.

278
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:16,371
Besides,

279
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:18,172
what I described earlier

280
00:15:18,172 --> 00:15:19,611
were beast-like Earth Fiends.

281
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:22,651
Humanoid ones might differ entirely.

282
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,011
So

283
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:26,651
you're also a South Mountain Hunter,

284
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:27,771
like my kidnappers?

285
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:30,332
I've already answered

286
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:31,932
your question.

287
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:34,851
Thank you for your honesty, Miss Nie.

288
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:38,332
You remember the way back?

289
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:39,891
Excuse me.

290
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:35,731
Don't panic.

291
00:17:37,572 --> 00:17:39,251
You've contracted a contagious disease

292
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:43,452
requiring quarantine.

293
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:45,292
Who are you fooling?

294
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,972
This place isn't medical-looking.

295
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,852
It's hard to explain briefly.

296
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:51,771
It's fine.

297
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:53,051
Explain slowly.

298
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:53,811
I'll listen.

299
00:17:55,731 --> 00:17:56,571
Your condition

300
00:17:58,932 --> 00:18:00,372
requires sunlight

301
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:01,612
for treatment.

302
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:02,776
(Nanshan Rescue)

303
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:05,172
Earth Fiends fear fire and light.

304
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:06,972
Within three days of injury,

305
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:10,132
cauterize the injured
with natural fire to heal them.

306
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:14,531
If the timing is missed,
red threads pierce pupils,

307
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:15,652
and fate is sealed.

308
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:16,412
Ma Hanzi.

309
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:18,612
He's way worse than me.

310
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:20,172
Who's really sick here?

311
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:21,892
Even if I'm sick,

312
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,091
I can go to the hospital.

313
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:24,051
Let me out. Come on.

314
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:25,531
Sorry,

315
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,212
you need to stay here longer.

316
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:30,612
Bro?

317
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:32,051
Bro?

318
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,132
Bro?

319
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:35,652
Bro!

320
00:18:41,132 --> 00:18:42,491
Back off now. Did you hear me?

321
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:44,011
I just want to check on her.

322
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:46,251
Mr. Crip, if you're this impatient,

323
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,731
how can we get work done?

324
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:49,692
I don't need your guidance for my work.

325
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,452
Our ice factory base

326
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:55,291
has been exposed.
There are too many people here.

327
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,811
We're exposed, and they're in shadows.

328
00:18:56,892 --> 00:18:57,652
What should we do?

329
00:18:57,652 --> 00:18:58,051
Exactly.

330
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:00,132
So we should leave Mrs. Hua alone
in the ward?

331
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:01,212
Move aside.

332
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:02,132
Wait.

333
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:12,972
Mrs. Hua's condition is stable now.

334
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:14,531
Nursing staff is attending to her.

335
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:18,132
Nothing will go wrong.

336
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:20,491
Stop yelling.

337
00:19:20,612 --> 00:19:21,452
This is a hospital.

338
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:24,932
Are you all Zhang Shanqiang's relatives?

339
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:27,372
Visiting hours don't allow
this many people.

340
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:29,892
Sorry, we're leaving right away.

341
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:32,811
My leg is broken. I can't move.

342
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:56,172
Tuo, I brought you some food.

343
00:19:56,372 --> 00:19:56,972
Here.

344
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:01,051
You should head back first.

345
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:03,251
I'll personally escort Lin Ling
back to you later.

346
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:03,932
Rest assured.

347
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:11,331
Take care.

348
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:17,852
I've checked all the files you sent me.

349
00:20:18,491 --> 00:20:19,771
It's mostly as you suspected.

350
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,612
Gou Yan's identity is fabricated.

351
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,212
I'm not in the mood.

352
00:20:37,091 --> 00:20:37,811
I...

353
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:42,212
I know some things.

354
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:44,372
You may not believe it.

355
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,251
But I still need to tell you.

356
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:50,412
Tuo, you're scaring me.

357
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,091
Do you remember

358
00:20:54,972 --> 00:20:56,932
when Xiong Hei lost two fingers

359
00:20:57,571 --> 00:20:58,491
and was badly wounded?

360
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:00,051
He said it was a motorcycle crash.

361
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:01,692
He was fully recovered in days.

362
00:21:03,652 --> 00:21:04,892
Ms. Lin said

363
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,731
he had his fingers reattached
at the hospital.

364
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,731
Right.

365
00:21:08,372 --> 00:21:09,531
But think about it now.

366
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:11,011
Does that seem possible?

367
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,212
Gou Yan is the same.

368
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:16,491
I watched him fall from the building,

369
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:17,452
severely injured.

370
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:19,692
But within half a day,

371
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:21,251
his wounds began healing.

372
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:22,531
Tuo,

373
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:25,852
what are you implying?

374
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:34,251
There are creatures
known as Earth Fiends

375
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:36,291
existing for centuries.

376
00:21:36,972 --> 00:21:38,531
But at some point,

377
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,212
they gained the ability
to take human form.

378
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:43,811
Their human appearance is mere mimicry.

379
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:45,132
Or a disguise.

380
00:21:45,892 --> 00:21:47,331
Beneath the human skin,

381
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:50,011
they remain beasts.

382
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:56,692
What's wrong?

383
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:00,452
When you had the accident,

384
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:03,251
I secretly recorded this.

385
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:05,251
(Recording)

386
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:09,011
(We barely put his blood bag descendant)

387
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:10,811
(in the welfare home.)

388
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,811
Blood bag put in...

389
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:14,251
Listen.

390
00:22:15,452 --> 00:22:16,692
(Bring him back first.)

391
00:22:19,692 --> 00:22:20,571
(Tuo?)

392
00:22:32,932 --> 00:22:33,771
What's that sound?

393
00:22:34,972 --> 00:22:37,452
I was right outside that day.
I heard nothing.

394
00:22:38,212 --> 00:22:39,972
Only Ms. Lin was inside.

395
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,491
But that night,

396
00:22:41,491 --> 00:22:43,612
when I reviewed the recording,

397
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,251
I heard it.

398
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:51,571
It's like a peculiar frequency.

399
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:58,692
If Xiong Hei and Gou Yan aren't human,

400
00:23:00,771 --> 00:23:03,132
could Ms. Lin also be what you said...

401
00:23:04,972 --> 00:23:05,612
An Earth Fiend.

402
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,291
I'm sorry, Ms. Lin.

403
00:23:28,571 --> 00:23:29,251
I'm so sorry.

404
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:30,172
(Deregistered)
I'm sorry, Ms. Lin.

405
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:39,091
Let her clean it.

406
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:40,132
Okay.

407
00:25:41,011 --> 00:25:41,652
Qiang! Qiang!

408
00:25:41,652 --> 00:25:42,412
Emergency!

409
00:26:33,731 --> 00:26:34,132
Qiang!

410
00:26:34,132 --> 00:26:34,892
What are you doing?

411
00:26:35,132 --> 00:26:35,892
What are you doing?

412
00:26:35,892 --> 00:26:37,452
Stop! What are you doing?

413
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:39,811
Stop! I'm talking to you!

414
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:40,412
Qiang?

415
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:43,852
You! Stay where you are!

416
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:45,412

418
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,291
Stop the car!

419
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:49,251
Stop the car!

420
00:26:50,212 --> 00:26:52,731
Medical, Lower Level 1. To the exit!

421
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:53,652
Stop him!

422
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:05,912
(Breeding Report, Gou Yan)

423
00:28:28,571 --> 00:28:31,372
So this is the new skin?

424
00:28:32,331 --> 00:28:32,892
Right.

425
00:28:35,652 --> 00:28:36,771
Let me ask you something.

426
00:28:36,892 --> 00:28:40,251
About this bright green hat,

427
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,331
what's its symbolism?

428
00:28:42,692 --> 00:28:44,132
The theme is forgiveness.

429
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:45,452
It's Forgiveness Duck.

430
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:48,452
Forgiveness?

431
00:28:50,652 --> 00:28:52,051
Then why not just make

432
00:28:52,172 --> 00:28:53,491
a duck in mourning attire?

433
00:28:53,771 --> 00:28:54,612
That'd be so festive.

434
00:28:58,172 --> 00:28:58,852
Great idea.

435
00:29:03,251 --> 00:29:04,091
Nie Jiuluo.

436
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:06,852
Just think about it.

437
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:12,011
A duck wearing a green hat.

438
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,091
Who would buy this?

439
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:16,491
I handle art, and you handle business.

440
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:17,452
Wasn't this our

441
00:29:17,452 --> 00:29:18,452
agreed division of labor?

442
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:20,731
You wanted new skins? I delivered.

443
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:21,612
As for selling them,

444
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:22,571
that's your job.

445
00:29:24,372 --> 00:29:25,452
If you put it that way,

446
00:29:26,051 --> 00:29:27,372
it's growing on me now.

447
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:30,172
This is basically me.

448
00:29:30,731 --> 00:29:32,011
Fooled by you repeatedly,

449
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:33,531
yet I keep forgiving you.

450
00:29:34,132 --> 00:29:35,051
Well done, Nie Jiuluo.

451
00:29:35,652 --> 00:29:36,291
Keep it up.

452
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:37,251
I'll consider it a yes.

453
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:38,972
Excellent. Keep it up.

454
00:29:41,372 --> 00:29:42,531
Ms. Lu, any leftovers?

455
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:48,612
Jiang.

456
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:54,011
When did it happen?

457
00:29:56,811 --> 00:29:57,612
Lu,

458
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:00,892
contact that rich kid

459
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:01,811
again for me.

460
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:03,771
Who?

461
00:30:04,692 --> 00:30:06,132
The art-talking guy in the cemetery.

462
00:30:06,132 --> 00:30:07,291
I want to meet him again.

463
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:10,571
Always acting on whims.

464
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,771
Hurry up.

465
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,280

(Breeding Report, Gou Yan)

469
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,811
If we're right,

470
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:33,491
they're all Earth Fiends
disguised as humans.

471
00:30:34,372 --> 00:30:36,852
Besides Gou Ya and Xiong Hei,

472
00:30:37,172 --> 00:30:38,168
do you know anyone else?

473
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:47,652
Tuo.

474
00:30:49,372 --> 00:30:51,011
Do you remember

475
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:53,972
that place we went to when we were kids?

476
00:30:58,011 --> 00:30:58,771
The farm?

477
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:01,212
Lin Ling? Lin Ling?

478
00:31:02,452 --> 00:31:03,412
Where are you?

479
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:05,291
Come out. This is not fun.

480
00:31:05,452 --> 00:31:07,051
Ms. Lin will scold us if she finds out.

481
00:31:11,652 --> 00:31:12,412
Lin Ling?

482
00:31:14,612 --> 00:31:15,291
Lin Ling?

483
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:19,972
Lin Ling? Lin Ling?

484
00:31:42,051 --> 00:31:42,811
Lin Ling?

485
00:31:44,892 --> 00:31:45,731
Lin Ling?

486
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:51,372
Tuo, it hurts.

487
00:31:52,212 --> 00:31:54,051
Hang in there. I'll get you out.

488
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,172
Come on.

489
00:32:18,571 --> 00:32:19,652
How's the preparation?

490
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:22,531
After pre-treatment,
we can remove the roots.

491
00:32:23,452 --> 00:32:24,372
And Xu Anni?

492
00:32:24,932 --> 00:32:26,011
Someone has taken over.

493
00:33:06,811 --> 00:33:09,972
You think that farm

494
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:12,372
is the secret base where Ms. Lin

495
00:33:12,372 --> 00:33:14,291
transforms Earth Fiends into humans??

496
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:16,212
Very likely.

497
00:33:17,771 --> 00:33:20,452
Tuo, maybe

498
00:33:21,692 --> 00:33:22,571
you should stop.

499
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:25,612
If kindness retreats out of fear,

500
00:33:25,652 --> 00:33:27,251
it only lets malice grow stronger.

501
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:29,011
Only by finding the truth

502
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,452
can you be truly safe.

503
00:33:32,491 --> 00:33:33,212
Don't worry.

504
00:33:34,051 --> 00:33:35,412
I've met someone recently

505
00:33:36,372 --> 00:33:37,932
who could be a huge help.

506
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,811
Pardon me, Mr. Yan.

507
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:47,132
Miss Nie wants me to ask you

508
00:33:47,452 --> 00:33:48,612
(Mr. Lu, Nie's agent)
if she can meet you

509
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:51,972
at Baogeland Hotel for a talk

510
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:54,011
at 8 PM tomorrow.

511
00:33:54,571 --> 00:33:56,452
Speak of the devil.

512
00:34:27,863 --> 00:34:33,374
(Braised meat)

513
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:34,932
I...

514
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:49,412
(Braised meat)

515
00:34:49,412 --> 00:34:50,011
You're here.

516
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,291
Come in and have a seat.

517
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:07,972
Haven't we settled up?

518
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:09,732
What's this honor

519
00:35:10,252 --> 00:35:11,892
of dining with you, Miss Nie?

520
00:35:13,051 --> 00:35:14,011
I have a companion

521
00:35:14,372 --> 00:35:15,812
probably in your people's custody.

522
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:17,691
I want to know his whereabouts.

523
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:19,571
And before we rescue him,

524
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:20,812
you need to keep him safe.

525
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:23,372
What would you like to eat?

526
00:35:24,131 --> 00:35:24,812
Let me see.

527
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,491
A triple-braised platter.

528
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:28,651
Okay.

529
00:35:28,732 --> 00:35:31,491
Tripe, chicken feet, and...

530
00:35:32,332 --> 00:35:33,171
Any recommendations?

531
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:36,852
The beef intestines.

532
00:35:37,131 --> 00:35:37,651
Okay.

533
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:38,611
That's all for now.

534
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:39,292
Coming right up.

535
00:35:39,332 --> 00:35:39,972
Thanks.

536
00:35:43,332 --> 00:35:45,852
The braised dish seems ready-made.

537
00:35:46,332 --> 00:35:48,252
Just scoop, slice, and serve.

538
00:35:48,611 --> 00:35:49,812
But to prepare it,

539
00:35:49,972 --> 00:35:51,292
how many spices are used,

540
00:35:51,292 --> 00:35:52,491
how much time is spent,

541
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,091
and how many steps are involved

542
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,051
to transform rankness into delicacy?

543
00:35:57,292 --> 00:36:00,051
Yet its good taste
only lingers for a few seconds.

544
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:02,091
Once swallowed,

545
00:36:02,571 --> 00:36:03,852
it's flushed away the next day.

546
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:07,892
Say what you want directly.

547
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:09,412
If you help me this time,

548
00:36:09,452 --> 00:36:10,772
I won't let you work for nothing.

549
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:13,051
Here you are.

550
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:14,812
Enjoy your meal.

551
00:36:14,892 --> 00:36:15,651
Thanks.

552
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:19,372
Then I need to think carefully.

553
00:36:20,332 --> 00:36:21,332
For how long?

554
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:23,292
Hard to say.

555
00:36:24,452 --> 00:36:26,292
Maybe as long
as this braised dish lasts,

556
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,292
depending on if it suits my taste.

557
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:30,372
Or maybe overnight,

558
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:32,972
depending on how well I sleep.

559
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:34,852
It also could take a month,

560
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:35,932
depending on

561
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:37,812
whether this month's
financial report is good.

562
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:42,171
Well then, Mr. Yan,

563
00:36:42,812 --> 00:36:44,372
keep considering while enjoying

564
00:36:44,372 --> 00:36:45,292
the beef intestines.

565
00:36:47,491 --> 00:36:49,292
Or it might be decided in an instant

566
00:36:50,932 --> 00:36:52,812
depending on your sincerity.

567
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:03,491
From now on, we'll settle accounts
after each meeting.

568
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:05,452
You grant me a request,

569
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:07,252
and I'll grant you one in return.

570
00:37:07,732 --> 00:37:08,651
I pay each time.

571
00:37:08,972 --> 00:37:09,972
Why so calculative?

572
00:37:10,091 --> 00:37:11,011
Because I don't want

573
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:12,211
to get entangled with you.

574
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:14,131
Fine, as you say.

575
00:37:14,372 --> 00:37:15,332
Have you decided?

576
00:37:16,571 --> 00:37:17,932
What's your request this time?

577
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:21,372
I've decided.

578
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,571
Add me on WeChat. Scan my code.

579
00:37:29,571 --> 00:37:31,051
What brings you here today?

580
00:37:32,171 --> 00:37:34,772
I tried a braised dish spot
last night and found it good.

581
00:37:35,091 --> 00:37:36,452
The owner said they do breakfast,

582
00:37:36,452 --> 00:37:38,651
so I woke early to get you some.

583
00:37:39,252 --> 00:37:39,972
Try it first.

584
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:41,091
I haven't tried it.

585
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:43,091
Don't expect too much.
It might disappoint.

586
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:47,131
Not bad.

587
00:37:47,372 --> 00:37:48,131
It's good?

588
00:37:48,491 --> 00:37:49,452
I'll buy more next time.

589
00:37:54,531 --> 00:37:57,051
I saw the report.
Our business are thriving.

590
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:58,892
Don't just see the surface.

591
00:37:59,051 --> 00:38:00,252
Such a large group

592
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:03,292
has countless trivial matters
beneath your notice.

593
00:38:03,732 --> 00:38:05,011
Don't focus only on now either.

594
00:38:05,292 --> 00:38:07,211
The future remains uncertain.

595
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:09,491
If Roadsound's competitors

596
00:38:09,611 --> 00:38:11,651
had half your crisis awareness,

597
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:13,611
they wouldn't have stayed
underfoot forever.

598
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:17,651
You think these internal
and external troubles are imaginary?

599
00:38:19,892 --> 00:38:21,091
That's why I brought breakfast

600
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:22,332
to ease your mind.

601
00:38:25,412 --> 00:38:26,491
I heard the other day

602
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,252
Xiong caught someone.

603
00:38:28,252 --> 00:38:29,011
What happened?

604
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:37,892
I know you want to help me,

605
00:38:38,211 --> 00:38:39,892
but some grassroots matters

606
00:38:40,171 --> 00:38:41,772
are better left untouched.

607
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:42,611
Understood.

608
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,812
The schedule is tight today.

609
00:38:48,211 --> 00:38:50,452
I need to visit the farm
before heading to the office.

610
00:38:51,651 --> 00:38:53,332
You even personally
oversee the planting?

611
00:38:53,611 --> 00:38:55,452
I need to check. I can't rest easy.

612
00:39:24,091 --> 00:39:25,732
Anyone here?

613
00:39:46,611 --> 00:39:49,972
Speak up now if you want less suffering.

614
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:54,812
I'm old.

615
00:39:55,412 --> 00:39:56,452
I can't handle turmoil.

616
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:57,772
Let's talk civilly.

617
00:40:01,051 --> 00:40:02,852
Where's the base
of South Mountain Hunters?

618
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:04,171
How many members in total?

619
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:06,972
What's your next action plan?

620
00:40:08,292 --> 00:40:09,011
The base...

621
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:12,292
The base is at the South Heavenly Gate.

622
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:16,691
Their numbers are hundreds of thousands,
and they are from a celestial army.

623
00:40:17,372 --> 00:40:21,292
And they plan to descend
to eradicate demons and monsters.

624
00:40:26,211 --> 00:40:27,372
Bad with essay questions?

625
00:40:27,852 --> 00:40:29,332
Then we'll make it multiple choice.

626
00:40:30,651 --> 00:40:31,732
How do you want to die?

627
00:40:32,412 --> 00:40:34,332
Bleed out? Heart extraction?

628
00:40:34,651 --> 00:40:36,011
Or live burial?

629
00:40:36,372 --> 00:40:38,812
If you'd brought Mrs. Hua with you,

630
00:40:39,412 --> 00:40:41,051
I'd choose live burial.

631
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:44,131
We couldn't be together in life.

632
00:40:44,531 --> 00:40:45,932
Sharing a grave in death

633
00:40:46,051 --> 00:40:48,091
would fulfill my wish.

634
00:40:48,332 --> 00:40:49,972
That woman in the hospital

635
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:51,611
is in such bad shape.

636
00:40:52,772 --> 00:40:54,892
She'll never speak again.

637
00:41:08,211 --> 00:41:09,531
He's quite spirited.

638
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:12,252
Calm him down.

639
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:24,812
Long time no see.

640
00:41:24,892 --> 00:41:26,211
Who are you?

641
00:41:27,372 --> 00:41:28,491
Twenty years ago,

642
00:41:28,932 --> 00:41:29,772
I offended you.

643
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:31,732
Who?

644
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:36,372
Don't tell me you're holding a grudge,

645
00:41:37,732 --> 00:41:39,732
wanting me to repay you with a leg?

646
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:59,343
(Greenhouse)

647
00:42:10,372 --> 00:42:12,292
Don't be fooled
by his usual carefree demeanor.

648
00:42:12,812 --> 00:42:14,772
He definitely has his own thoughts.

649
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:16,491
He just buries them well.

650
00:42:17,491 --> 00:42:19,051
It's fine if it's not a deal-breaker.

651
00:42:19,651 --> 00:42:21,011
It's been many years.

652
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,531
This whole mother-and-son-bond act

653
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:26,091
has to continue, doesn't it?

654
00:42:26,412 --> 00:42:27,531
No matter what,

655
00:42:27,972 --> 00:42:29,892
Yan Tuo is my own son.

656
00:42:31,412 --> 00:42:33,892
Wake the old man below
and resume interrogation.

657
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:36,452
We must extract information
about the Mad Blade.

658
00:42:36,611 --> 00:42:37,772
Understood. We'll handle it.

659
00:42:58,812 --> 00:42:59,651
(Lin Ling?)

660
00:43:02,011 --> 00:43:02,732
(Lin Ling?)

661
00:43:04,732 --> 00:43:06,171
(Where are you? Come out.)

662
00:43:07,531 --> 00:43:08,332
(Lin Ling.)

663
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:10,892
(Lin Ling?)

664
00:43:12,972 --> 00:43:14,171
(Come out now.)

665
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:15,852
(This is not fun.)

666
00:43:15,932 --> 00:43:17,611
(Ms. Lin will scold us
if she finds out.)

667
00:43:20,252 --> 00:43:21,011
(Lin Ling?)

668
00:43:21,691 --> 00:43:22,452
(Lin Ling?)

669
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:25,972
(Lin Ling?)

670
00:43:53,976 --> 00:43:56,664
(Toxic and Hazardous)

671
00:44:24,312 --> 00:44:25,200
Lin Xirou.

672
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,880
This humanoid Earth Fiend
and the Roadsound Group

673
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,280
must be closely connected.

674
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,080
This intel is crucial.

675
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,600
We'll investigate immediately.

676
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:36,800
Thank you.

677
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,640
How's Sun Zhou?

678
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,880
Overcast skies may make us

679
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,720
miss the window.

680
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,120
Do what you can.

681
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,560
If even heaven won't save him,

682
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,880
we can't help with that.

683
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,200
Then

684
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,840
we'll have to banish him to Golden Gate

685
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,160
by Hunters' rules.

686
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,680
Those wounded by Earth Fiends before

687
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,800
and became infected
without timely fire purification

688
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,120
were all Hunters

689
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,040
who vowed to accept this fate.

690
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,240
They were all prepared.

691
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,080
But Sun Zhou is a civilian.

692
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,840
For him,

693
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,800
it's too cruel.

694
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:11,465
Of course.

695
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,880
I'll explore alternatives.

Speaking of which,

about the informant you mentioned,
who tipped you off

701
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,840
about Lin Xirou and the Roadsound Group,

702
00:45:33,048 --> 00:45:34,090
who is he?

703
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,720
You think he's unreliable?

704
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,520
I'm worried for your safety.

705
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,120
How did you connect with him?

706
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,720
Maybe my unique constitution

707
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,000
attracts oddities.

708
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,520
We've got plenty of oddities here too.

709
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,320
They're all here at the hospital
keeping watch over Mrs. Hua.

710
