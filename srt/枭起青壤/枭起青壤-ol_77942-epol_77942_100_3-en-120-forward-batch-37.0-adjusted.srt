in the car Mad Blade mentioned.)

20
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,659
Wake up.

21
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,539
Wake up. Don't sleep.

22
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,060
Don't be afraid. I'm not a good person.

23
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:40,300
What?

24
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,339
I said I'm not a good person.

25
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:45,899
You're not a good person either.

26
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,060
We're the same.

27
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,139
So don't be afraid.

28
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,579
Who are you?

29
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,860
Why don't you tell me who you are first?

30
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:56,940
Or...

31
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,579
Who's in the trunk?

32
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,379
Where is he?

33
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,339
Answer my question first.

34
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,019
I'm a sculptor.

35
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,540
I came here for inspiration.

36
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:11,940
My driver was injured.

37
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,459
I need to get him to the hospital.

38
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,940
Listen,

39
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,459
if he dies because of your delay,

40
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,339
you'll be responsible.

41
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,540
The driver was injured,

42
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,300
so you stuffed him in a duffel bag

43
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:23,500
and threw him in the trunk?

44
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,579
Are you saving him or dumping a body?

45
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:27,379
What do you want?

46
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,980
Do you want money?

47
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,139
I'll give you money.

48
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,019
Let me go.

49
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,899
Untie me quickly.

50
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:33,899
Let me go!

51
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,779
Back off.

52
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:38,740
Let go! Don't touch me!

53
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:44,100
Give it back.

54
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,219
Give it back!

Don't move.

58
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,219
What are you doing?

59
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,740
Give it back.

60
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,779
Stop looking. Give it back!

Sculpting?

62
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,819
Your hands are really rough.

63
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,899
They don't match your face.

64
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,180
But rough hands

65
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,699
don't mean you're a sculptor.

66
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,219
You could be a kidnapper

67
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,660
or a crazy killer.

68
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
You're insane.

69
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:37,980
You really are a sculptor.

70
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,139
I'm a public figure.

71
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:41,019
If I go missing,

72
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:42,980
my agent and fans will notice.

73
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:43,899
Let me go now,

74
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:45,339
and I won't hold you responsible.

75
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:47,699
A public figure?

76
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,579
With so few followers?

77
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,500
Don't worry.
You fear your fans will be concerned?

78
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,259
I'll help you.

79
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,620
In retreat for focused creation.

80
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,180
Cutting off contact to concentrate.

81
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,620
I'm warning you,

82
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,620
put down my phone right now.

83
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,699
Striving for better works.

84
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:29,779
Await my return. Don't worry.

85
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,579
Here's the thing about me:

86
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:33,620
easy to invite, hard to send away.

87
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,779
No problem.

88
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:38,579
I'm good at sending people off.

89
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,459
I can even send you to die.

90
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:44,300
I know.

91
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,379
What's in your car's trunk

92
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,139
is something shady too, right?

93
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,579
What?

94
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,020
Stop pretending.

95
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:17,180

96
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:18,499
Ventolin.

97
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:19,859
What?

98
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,579
Asthma.

99
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,619
Steroid spray.

100
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,699
Where is it?

101
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,060
It's not here.

102
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:34,780
The car crash...

103
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,540
Dropped it.

104
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:36,380
Water.

105
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,979
Such a hassle.

106
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,979
Where's Xinxin?

107
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,140
Where's Xinxin?

108
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,699

(Yan Tuo)

111
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,060
Three types of goods. Inspect them.

112

Jiang.

113
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,579
Long time no see.

114
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:55,180
Jiang.

115
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,260
How have you been?

116
00:13:58,699 --> 00:13:59,459
Jiang.

117
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,780
I've been doing well lately.

118
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,420
Though I haven't found a boyfriend,

119
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:07,900
living alone

120
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,780
has been quite enjoyable.

121
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,940
An opening line like this

122
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:21,660
is difficult for you?

123
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,900
Must we be this frosty?

124
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,339
Let's settle accounts.

125
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,979
Three unique goods. What's their worth?

126
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,380
Between us, there is

127
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,540
no need for meticulous accounting.

128
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:42,819
Not between you and me.

129
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:45,336
Between me and South Mountain Hunters.

130
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:48,260
We'd better settle this now.

131
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,979
I don't want emotional baggage.

132
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,979
I don't want to force you.

133
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:55,660
If you're determined to leave,

134
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:57,940
who could stop you?

135
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,300
No need to repay debts.

136
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:02,739
Just peacefully

137
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,499
live your life as an artist.

138
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,619
That's exactly what I fear most.

139
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:10,660
Emotional debts

140
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,979
are much harder to repay.

141
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:15,819
If only you truly believed that.

142
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:19,540
Let's calculate it my way.

143
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,420
After I deliver these goods

144
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:22,979
and complete one more task,

145
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:24,339
we'll be square.

146
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:25,660
After the next patrol,

147
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,219
I'll quit completely.

148
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,140
This man works for the Earth Fiend.

149
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,979
He is Yan Tuo.

150
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:38,780
That's my driver.

151
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:40,900
Got bitten by the Earth Fiend.

152
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,420
It has already rooted and sprouted.

153
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,099
Earth Fiend?

154
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,699
How can a human
smell like the Earth Fiend?

155
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,540
I examined the driver's wound.

156
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:19,979
Human teeth marks.

157
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,099
This vehicle is 96331.

158
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,739
He drove. He was in the trunk.

159
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,739
So the scent Big Head detected

160
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,180
must've been from this man.

161
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:34,260
This Earth Fiend.

162
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:51,060
Human-form Earth Fiend?

163
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,739
I pondered all the way here

164
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:04,339
before reaching this

165
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,859
extremely unpleasant conclusion.

166
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,859
If you have a better explanation,

167
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,260
do share it with me.

168
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,300
The driver's name is Sun Zhou.

169
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,180
He took this job because of me.

170
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,540
He got bitten by an Earth Fiend.

171
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:30,420
If possible,

172
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:33,579
try to save him.

173
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,819
But it's been cloudy lately.

174
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,300
We might not get the natural fire.

175
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:43,340
Even if heaven won't help,

176
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,940
we can't just watch him die.

177
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,860
He's innocent, after all.

178
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,100
Handle the other two as you wish.

179
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:06,180
Are you hurt?

180
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,059
Minor injuries. Nothing serious.

181
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:11,180
Good. Your constitution is unique.

182
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:12,940
Now that circumstances have changed,

183
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,180
we must stay cautious.

184
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:20,779
I bought it on the way.

185
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:22,739
Take one.

186
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:24,779
Better than nothing.

187
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,224
(Throat Lozenges)

188
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:30,380
I hope it's an isolated case.

189
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,499
Life-Death Blade?

190
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:11,459
Do you like it?

191
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,420
I can't accept it.

192
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,779
Your solo reconnaissance missions

193
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:19,779
yield more than our group patrols.

194
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,580
You deserve to have that knife.

195
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,459
I just got lucky.

196
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:26,900
Luck is a skill too.

197
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,420
Then I'm quite skilled indeed.

198
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:31,979
I'll see you off.

199
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,100
No need.

200
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,979
Let's talk right here.

201
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,059
You're really leaving?

202
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,860
What else?

203
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,900
I smelled it when your car arrived.

204
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:49,420
That person's definitely a Fiend.

205
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,539
Mad Dog.

206
00:19:55,699 --> 00:19:57,019
Your nose truly is sharp.

207
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,580
Since you brought that rich boy here,

208
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,180
you must've dealt with him before.

209
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:03,580
Stay and interrogate him together.

210
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,860
You just said yourself.

211
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:08,539
My solo achievements

212
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:09,900
outshine your entire team.

213
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,340
Want to exhaust me?

214
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:13,620
Luo.

215
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:16,180
Aren't you being too willful?

216
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,699
Before, South Mountain was peaceful.

217
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:20,459
Everyone lived peacefully.

218
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,059
It was acceptable
for you to be detached.

219
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:24,539
But what about now?

220
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:26,660
A humanoid Earth Fiend appeared.

221
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,699
You personally captured him.

222
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,779
We're now in a situation

223
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:32,660
that even our ancestors

224
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,739
never encountered.

225
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:37,459
Can you still believe
that this has nothing

226
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:38,739
to do with you?

227
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:42,019
I came to deliver goods.

228
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:45,620
Not to listen to your lectures.

229
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:49,420
We've trained so hard

230
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:50,940
since we were little

231
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,940
just to eliminate the Earth Fiend
completely.

232
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,979
The opportunity has come.

233
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,580
Why are you leaving?

234
00:20:57,459 --> 00:20:58,259
I don't understand.

235
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:07,620
The noble-sounding reason is

236
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,499
that I don't want
to see people die anymore.

237
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:14,580
The more selfish reason is

238
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:17,299
that I want to be an ordinary girl.

239
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,620
Reasonably,

240
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,059
we've been indoctrinated
with the mission

241
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:23,299
to fight the Earth Fiend,

242
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:25,180
but our generation

243
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,340
has never actually
seen the real Earth Fiend.

244
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:29,539
And the first one we saw

245
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,180
is actually a human form.

246
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,420
The ideas instilled in me
by the organization

247
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:35,019
and the skills I learned

248
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:36,100
may no longer apply.

249
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,820
So I became afraid and hesitant.

250
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:39,820
I want to run away.

251
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:42,380
I think any of these three reasons

252
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:45,140
could be convincing enough.

253
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,459
Choose one that you can accept.

254
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:58,779
I know you always want to be a hero.

255
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:00,620
I also know you've been

256
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,620
wanting an opportunity.

257
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,940
But I'm telling you,

258
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,380
chaotic times produce heroes

259
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,340
and malevolent spirits.

260
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:12,820
Maybe you like the Mad Blade,

261
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,860
but I don't.

262
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,059
(Every four years again?)

263
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,340
Each time could be the final one.

264
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:51,180
Right now, tell me.

265
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:53,459
Is this family important?

266
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,140
Is our child important?

267
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,180
Or is your patrol more important?

268
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:58,979
If you find Luo troublesome,

269
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,860
send her to her uncle's place.

270
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:03,900
If you think we can't stay together,

271
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:05,219
use this time

272
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,539
to find a family woman.

273
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,499
I won't stop you.

274
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,140
Give me my bag.

275
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,219
Give it to me.

276
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,499
During this period,

277
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,100
listen to your dad at home.

278
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,900
I will return soon.

279
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,019
Mom, the dumplings are ready.

280
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,219
Thank you, Luo. I won't eat them.

281
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:45,180
You eat them.

282
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,059
Patrolling is my work

283
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,699
as a South Mountain Hunter.

284
00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:58,860
It's also to protect our family.

285
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:00,499
You can blame me,

286
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:02,420
but I have no regrets.

287
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,539
When you grow up,

288
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,979
you'll understand.

289
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,539
Such good dumplings.

290
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,699
Must you wait
until they're cold to eat them?

291
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,900
If your tummy hurts,

292
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,219
your uncle will blame me.

293
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,299
Stop burning incense every day.

294
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:42,140
The house is filled with smoke.

295
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,459
It's completely messy.

296
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,699
Get out.

297
00:24:46,699 --> 00:24:47,660
Don't stay here anymore.

298
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:50,940
Anyway, you're now qualified to stay

299
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,539
- in any welfare home.
- Enough, enough.

300
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,140
Why are you so angry?

301
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,580
Can't you be quiet?

302
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,699
The ritual offerings are done.

303
00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:04,620
Eat dumplings.

304
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,459
Stay as long as you want.

305
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,979
I'll never drive you away.

306
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:30,940
Eat the dumplings

307
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,380
while they're warm.

308
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,059
Don't worry.

309
00:25:34,219 --> 00:25:35,459
The South Mountain Education Center

310
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:37,299
is a state-funded boarding school

311
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:38,459
with qualifications.

312
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,459
I'll take good care of her.

313
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,100
Whip!

314
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:48,140
Is it good?

315
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,620
Look at me.

316
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,259
Any difference? Look.

317
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,800
Medium, medium, large.

318
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,699
Large, medium, small.

319
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
Small, medium, large.

320
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,699
Smell carefully.

321
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:03,499
There's also a muddy scent.

322
00:26:03,499 --> 00:26:05,100
And a hint of herbal medicine.

323
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:08,259
Engage your waist.

324
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:12,499
Arms, spread your arms out.

325
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,860
Look, your bees have all scattered now.

326
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,940
Watch again.

327
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,340
Watch again.

328
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,360
Wrist.

329
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,320
Wrist.

330
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,299
The wrist. See it?

331
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:31,059
Like this. Arms open.

332
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,219
This will be your home from now on.

333
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,259
You look just like her.

334
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,140
I was your mom's good friend.

335
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:52,420
You can treat me like your family.

336
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,499
Everyone here calls me Ling.

337
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,739
Call me whatever you like.

338
00:26:58,219 --> 00:26:58,820
Take it off.

339
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:05,180
Training matters

340
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,420
are all handled by Jiang.

341
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,299
If you're hungry,

342
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:08,580
cold, or afraid,

343
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,459
come find me.

344
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:13,420
Listen,

345
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,539
don't be fooled by her smile.

346
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,180
During the Golden Gate repair mission,

347
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,499
she and your mom

348
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,059
were among the first to charge forward.

349
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,420
When you reach her training module,

350
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:34,739
you'll suffer.

351
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:38,299
Without your mom,

352
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,180
during the Golden Gate incident,

353
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,459
none of the hunters would've survived.

354
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,299
We all owe her.

355
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,580
No matter what happens,

356
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:56,860
come find me. Okay?

357
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,860
Okay.

358
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,820
We'll be serving chilled bean soup soon.

359
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:08,620
Take this.

360
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:10,420
Clean up first,
and then come drink some.

361
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,100
Alright?

362
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:15,979
Xing Shen.

363
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:18,380
Is the girl pretty?

364
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,940
You're this close,

365
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,739
yet can't smell the Fiend's bones
in the jar?

366
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:23,448
You're disgracing the Hound Clan.

367
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,580
Come smell.

368
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,499
Can't detect it.

369
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,100
Be quiet.

370
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:27,459
Well, I'm new here.

371
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:28,620
I just want extra practice,

372
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,499
so I won't fall too far behind.

373
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,860
Understood.

374
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:35,900
Blade Clan?

375
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,739
Yes.

376
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:47,860
Impressive.

377
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:49,976
I'm from the Hound Clan.

378
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,580
I know.

379
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,180
Though my nose isn't the sharpest

380
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:00,940
and can't sniff out hidden Earth Fiends,

381
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:04,100
I'll train hard in combat

382
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,539
to beat them

383
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,299
and make them toothless.

384
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:12,340
Do they have teeth?

385
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,779
I've never seen any.

386
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:20,660
I have no idea.

387
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:23,979
Then I'll hack them

388
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,779
and make them headless.

389
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,259
I'm Xing Shen.

390
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:31,459
Nie Jiuluo.

391
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:33,739
What an unusual name.

392
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,459
Can I try that thing?

393
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:38,620
The bucket?

394
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:41,900
Sure, no problem.

395
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,620
Be careful, it's heavy.

396
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,259
(The day your mom died,)

397
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:58,299
(Ling was critically injured.)

398
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:01,499
(Though we lit the natural fire in time)

399
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,420
(to save her life,)

400
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,699
(her kidneys failed,)

401
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:10,100
(and she never fully recovered.)

402
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,340
I'll get the certificate.

403
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,979
We were late
because of the mountain patrol.

404
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:50,100
Ling

405
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:53,140
won't blame us.

406
00:31:57,459 --> 00:32:00,539
I'm always told
that patrolling is our duty.

407
00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:04,580
Now, we didn't even get to see Ling

408
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,620
one last time.

409
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:07,860
I don't understand.

410
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,620
What exactly are we protecting?

411
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,180
It went out to play.

412
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,779
It'll come back for dinner.

413
00:33:36,219 --> 00:33:36,900
Lu.

414
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:38,699
What's for dinner?

415
00:35:19,307 --> 00:35:23,032
(Now...)

416
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:32,539
(Now I'm a step closer to freedom.)

417
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,340
The next fishing boat
won't come to load ice

418
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:55,860
until the day after tomorrow.

419
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:56,900
What bad timing.

420
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,499
We only have one cotton coat here.

421
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:04,700
You'll just have to tough it out.

422
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,499
Qiang.

423
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:10,420
Enough already. Don't stir up trouble.

424
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:15,780
Mrs. Hua made some soup.

425
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:16,860
Go have a bowl.

426
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:17,700
I'll do it.

427
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:36,579
You're the one in charge?

428
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,260
Can you make decisions?

429
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:39,659
Can someone else do this?

430
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,019
I don't want to repeat the same words
too many times.

431
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:44,860
I don't want to hear too many either.

432
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,780
We invited you here

433
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:49,380
just to ask a few questions.

434
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,619
You know what?

435
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,700
Right now,
I've got more questions than you do.

436
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,459
Can you answer my questions first?

437
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,099
Ask away.

438
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,860
But I suggest you
think carefully before that.

439
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,260
What is the Earth Fiend?

440
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,780
They're sworn enemies of ours.

441
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,220
What are you people?

442
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,019
My turn.

443
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,499
About the person, or a thing,

444
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:35,380
in your trunk,

445
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:37,816
what's your relationship with it?

446
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,700
His name is Gou Ya.

447
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,536
I met him for the first time yesterday.

448
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:51,340
I already told the other guy
the same thing.

449
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:53,139
Why was he in your car?

450
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,700
My turn now.

451
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,340
You seem very interested in him.

452
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:02,420
What's so special about him?

453
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,900
If you want to leave,

454
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:07,019
don't try any tricks.

455
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,220
So that means

456
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:12,099
he's an Earth Fiend,

457
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:13,579
and your organization

458
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:15,059
is against the Earth Fiend, right?

459
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:16,780
How many more like him exist?

460
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:18,340
Where do they all come from?

461
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:18,860
Wait.

462
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,659
Where are they?

463
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,300
I think I'm starting to understand.

464
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,059
You think

465
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:25,579
I'm in league with Gou Ya?

466
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:26,740
So I'm an Earth Fiend too?

467
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,499
You're definitely working with him.

468
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,539
But you're not a Fiend.

469
00:39:32,499 --> 00:39:34,139
Then you don't
fully grasp the situation.

470
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,900
Yan Tuo, right?

471
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,420
General Manager of Roadsound Group.

472
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:48,340
No.1 Muyuan Road,
Taihang District, Xicang City.

473
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,740
Your organization

474
00:39:57,099 --> 00:39:58,860
is really despicable.

475
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,019
No wonder it lacks unity.

476
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:00,820
Shut up.

477
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,979
What is that woman's name?

478
00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:04,860
Nie...

479
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:06,659
Nie Jiuluo.

480
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:10,220
I used to think she was disloyal.

481
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,019
But now, I understand.

482
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:13,700
Breaking away from you

483
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,260
means escaping misery.

484
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:04,099
Ms. Lin, go on.

485
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,300
I deserve punishment.

486
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,420
Do you think I care about you?

487
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,860
I guarantee

488
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,780
I'll bring Yan Tuo back.

489
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:16,340
How?

490
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:19,499
I've already sent people

491
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,300
to locate Yan Tuo's car.

492
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:23,340
The toll stations
after exiting the highway

493
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:28,139
are being checked
for nearby hiding spots.

494
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,619
I estimate

495
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,380
we'll find him soon.

496
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:32,559
Very soon.

497
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,760
As for Mr. Crip,

498
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,036
his left leg was injured 20 years ago

499
00:41:49,036 --> 00:41:51,240
during the Golden Gate repairs.

500
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,760
He is well-known for being loyal.

501
00:41:54,104 --> 00:41:55,880
Mrs. Hua of the Whip Clan

502
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,096
optimized the team composition strategy

503
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:00,800
with seven Hounds,
two Whips, and one Blade.

504
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,680
She's essentially the chief strategist
of the South Mountain Hunters.

505
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,080
The one on the phone right now

506
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,280
must be Shan Qiang.

507
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,600
The current version of the Whistle Whip

508
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,160
was designed by his father.

509
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,120
It's more effective at repelling Fiends

510
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,720
and has better weight distribution.

511
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,800
Seems your father told you plenty.

512
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,080
Of course.

513
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,320
The organization was founded
thousands of years ago.

514
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,600
Its members protect people
and eliminate Fiends,

515
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,760
asking for no fame or fortune,

516
