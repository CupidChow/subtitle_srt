How do I tell if she does?

172
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:15,759
You're just so smart about everything else, but this.

173
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:19,395
How do I know?

174
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:21,473
Take her on a date.

175
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,800
And?

176
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,749
And a love guru here will see if she shows any signs of affection.

177
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,340
Your order is ready.

178
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,812
It looks great. Can you take a picture for me?

179
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:37,921
Sure.

180
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:40,173
Make sure it's good.

181
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:42,079
Smile.

182
00:11:44,957 --> 00:11:47,516
- How is it?
- Pretty.

183
00:11:47,516 --> 00:11:50,362
Pretty? But nobody is hitting on me at all.

184
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:52,244
Let's just eat.

185
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:05,830
I was away for just a second and you already stepped up your game.

186
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:11,606
Sign number one, when you two touch, the physical response will give a hint.

187
00:12:13,944 --> 00:12:15,622
Who ordered this one? Can I have a bite?

188
00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:17,941
- Go for it.
- Yep.

189
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:27,931
Sorry.

190
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:30,540
It's fine.

191
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,185
Yours is delicious.

192
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,400
Nothing at all.

193
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,163
If you're still not sure, let's move on to sign number two.

194
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:43,003
Eyes don't lie. Look into the eyes.

195
00:12:43,003 --> 00:12:44,803
Pat.

196
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:50,625
Ink.

197
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,373
What?

198
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,924
What is it?

199
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:11,496
Is there something on my face?

200
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:15,435
No. I just forgot what I wanted to say.

201
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:18,970
You're lying. There must be something on my face.

202
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:22,141
Number two is even worse.

203
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:24,041
There's nothing.

204
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:27,690
Let's eat.

205
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,130
All right.

206
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,280
Ink.

207
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,384
My brother bragged he was the class president and he was so hot in university.

208
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:37,035
Is he lying?

209
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:42,037
Three, someone who likes you will want to know if you're taken or not.

210
00:13:44,664 --> 00:13:49,455
I don't know. I think you should know more than I do.

211
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,855
- Can I try this one too?
- Of course.

212
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:56,687
Feed me.

213
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,170
Sweet.

214
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,538
Should we move on to the next one?

215
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:09,581
Do you still want to?

216
00:14:13,994 --> 00:14:15,504
Hello.

217
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,972
Okay.

218
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:21,865
I'll be right there. Thank you so much.

219
00:14:23,546 --> 00:14:24,880
What's up?

220
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,462
The music shop just told me I could pick up the drum sticks I ordered.

221
00:14:27,462 --> 00:14:30,677
I should go get them now as the shop will be closed for a while.

222
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:32,433
Oh, really?

223
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:34,810
Use a delivery service.

224
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,450
I should go get them myself.

225
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,516
I want to check if they're okay.

226
00:14:39,516 --> 00:14:42,105
You two continue.

227
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:44,051
I'll call you later.

228
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,674
I'll take that one then.

229
00:14:46,674 --> 00:14:47,940
It's yours.

230
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,699
See you later.

231
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,915
Pa, this one is a chef's kiss.

232
00:14:58,915 --> 00:15:00,681
Try it.

233
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:03,839
Good?

234
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,613
Hi. Picking up your drum sticks?

235
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,518
Just a moment.

236
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:29,417
What brings you here?

237
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:32,962
Why? Are you the only one who can come here?

238
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:43,196
Here we go. Please have a look.

239
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:13,536
Hello.

240
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,368
At the musical instrument shop.

241
00:16:16,368 --> 00:16:18,823
Do you need anything from here?

242
00:16:19,982 --> 00:16:21,501
Be serious.

243
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:25,650
Okay. I'll send you some pictures.

244
00:16:28,773 --> 00:16:30,873
You're in such a good mood.

245
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,748
Was that your date?

246
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,952
Not your business.

247
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:48,968
Sign number one, when you two touch, the physical response will give a hint.

248
00:16:57,895 --> 00:17:02,814
Sign number two, eyes don't lie. Look in the eyes.

249
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,333
Three, someone who likes you will want to know if you're taken or not.

250
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,524
You're in such a good mood.

251
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:16,361
Was that your date?

252
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:36,181
Are you trying to bug me?

253
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:39,440
If you're not sure, there's the last sign.

254
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,241
People who like you can't be themselves around you.

255
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:50,238
Damn it! Move.

256
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:52,773
- I'll transfer you the money.
- Sure.

257
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:56,697
What's the matter with him?

258
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:17,229
Pa, I gotta go.

259
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:44,758
I'll buy you a new one.

260
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,020
[I'll buy you a new one.]

261
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,101
- Do I look pretty?
- You do.

262
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:39,700
Really?

263
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,121
Yes.

264
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:43,892
Seriously? Take more.

265
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:02,427
- Can I ask you something?
- Shoot.

266
00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:05,273
Who do you think can make our hearts beat faster?

267
00:20:05,273 --> 00:20:07,136
A ghost.

268
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:09,874
What a waste of time.

269
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:12,768
Our hearts beat faster when we're with someone we like.

270
00:20:12,768 --> 00:20:15,042
But it might just be the excitement.

271
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:17,324
You also have a point.

272
00:20:17,324 --> 00:20:19,676
You can't totally tell from the heartbeat rate.

273
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,360
But there is one thing you can be certain of.

274
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,592
What?

275
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:27,326
If you're jealous, you like that person for sure.

276
00:20:53,722 --> 00:20:54,960
Pran, are you in?

277
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,523
I am. One second.

278
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:05,017
What?

279
00:21:05,677 --> 00:21:07,828
Can I come in?

280
00:21:07,828 --> 00:21:09,848
You've been here too many times already.

281
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:13,408
I'm here for the earphones I gave you.

282
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:15,179
Earphones?

283
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:20,417
I'll take a look later. I don't remember where they are.

284
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:23,317
I can do it. That's fine.

285
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,273
This man.

286
00:21:27,273 --> 00:21:29,237
You're smooth.

287
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:32,083
- Have you eaten?
- I have.

288
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:35,710
What are you up to?

289
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,013
Writing a song.

290
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:39,412
- Why aren't you in class?
- I don't have class today.

291
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:41,326
You're skipping class.

292
00:21:51,063 --> 00:21:54,810
If you're jealous, you like that person for sure.

293
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:58,193
I'm not.

294
00:22:04,285 --> 00:22:06,149
- Hey!
- Hold on.

295
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:08,573
Wai is calling. Be quiet.

296
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:11,751
Hey, dude, what's up?

297
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,976
I'm in my room writing a song.

298
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:20,003
Dude, don't put pressure on me.

299
00:22:20,003 --> 00:22:21,850
I'm writing it right now.

300
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,376
Do not rush me.

301
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:26,490
I have to be in the mood to write it.

302
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,676
I can't just do it at once. Are you crazy?

303
00:22:31,473 --> 00:22:33,750
Where are you anyway?

304
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,252
No, I am not going today.

305
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:38,831
No, I won't go.

306
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:42,496
By the way...

307
00:22:43,172 --> 00:22:45,272
Are you free this Saturday?

308
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,198
I'm going home.

309
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:51,467
My mom has been asking about you. Wanna have dinner at my place?

310
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,484
Okay.

311
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:58,688
Around 5:00-6:00 p.m.

312
00:22:58,688 --> 00:23:00,910
All right. You can meet me at my dorm first.

313
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,896
Okay. See you later.

314
00:23:02,896 --> 00:23:04,684
Bye.

315
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:11,580
You guys are very close.

316
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,780
Of course, he's my friend.

317
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:17,901
Now what? Is he going to your house?

318
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:19,616
Yeah.

319
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,950
But your mom doesn't allow people inside the house.

320
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,084
Come on.

321
00:23:27,084 --> 00:23:30,866
My mom loves Wai so much.

322
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:34,899
He compliments every dish she cooks.

323
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,901
So...

324
00:23:44,817 --> 00:23:47,226
has he ever spent the night here?

325
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:50,894
No.

326
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:59,083
Actually, he has. He slept right there where you did.

327
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,773
Why didn't you tell me?

328
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:06,873
What's wrong with you?

329
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,970
I'm leaving.

330
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:15,177
What's happened to you lately? You've been weird.

331
00:24:17,594 --> 00:24:21,174
- Pat, your earphones?
- They're yours.

332
00:24:21,174 --> 00:24:24,067
I just don't get you.

[Tinidee: Hotel @ Bangkok Golf Club]

334
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:50,423
Should we play "Never" by 25 Hours? I like the song.

335
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:54,961
Playing a hit song might not be appealing enough.

336
00:24:57,146 --> 00:25:00,830
What's your idea then?

337
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:08,734
I'd like to compose something that conveys the sense of...

338
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,915
"born to be together".

339
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:16,722
And?

340
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:21,440
Like...

341
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:26,792
growing up together, seeing each other every day.

342
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,690
Nothing happens at the beginning,

343
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:35,271
but without realizing it, their feelings...

344
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:37,555
Their feelings have changed.

345
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:40,937
And they become rivals.

346
00:25:40,937 --> 00:25:42,466
Huh?

347
00:25:42,466 --> 00:25:44,818
This is exactly our houses' situation.

348
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:47,609
We should turn it into a song.

349
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:53,358
Have you ever had a secret crush on anyone?

350
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:55,740
What?

351
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,636
It's like... when you see someone you like, if you flirt with them all the time.

352
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:02,608
I'm just curious.

353
00:26:05,506 --> 00:26:07,906
Well, not really.

354
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:13,645
Sometimes, I'm insecure and hesitant to approach...

355
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:15,945
Hold on.

356
00:26:17,396 --> 00:26:19,289
What is it?

357
00:26:21,303 --> 00:26:22,942
Insecure?

358
00:26:24,748 --> 00:26:26,365
Insecure?

359
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:28,340
I like it.

360
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:34,393
It's like you're not sure if it will turn out good or bad.

361
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:37,698
You're afraid to feel more.

362
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,145
You're hesitating.

363
00:26:42,145 --> 00:26:44,895
You want to jump in, but you're afraid to be heartbroken.

364
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:48,125
You want to step back, but also want to seize the chance.

365
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,685
The feeling of hesitation.

366
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:57,818
I don't know. I just like it.

367
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:07,003
Hey!

368
00:27:11,728 --> 00:27:14,435
I'm buying the idea. Give me half credit.
[Phat❤️]

369
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:16,077
This is our song.

370
00:27:16,077 --> 00:27:18,194
This is not half. You took the whole page.

371
00:27:18,194 --> 00:27:19,894
Half.

372
00:27:30,611 --> 00:27:32,760
Want some dumplings?

373
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,346
Is that a yes?

374
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,269
What's the matter?

375
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:43,445
What's on your mind?

376
00:27:46,342 --> 00:27:49,975
What? Are you thinking about Ink?

377
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:57,175
The way I see it, Ink isn't like any other girl.

378
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,212
Exactly.

379
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:05,422
The signs we tested, she didn't show any.

380
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:09,573
I would go on if I were you.

381
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:12,871
If it wasn't Ink, I wouldn't be this supportive.

382
00:28:13,697 --> 00:28:15,439
Want some?

383
00:28:22,627 --> 00:28:24,804
Why are you hesitating?

384
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:26,183
You've come this far.

385
00:28:26,183 --> 00:28:28,406
You've had a crush on her since high school.

386
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:30,678
She will not be available for long, you know?

387
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,017
Eat it.

388
00:28:36,618 --> 00:28:38,084
Now.

389
00:28:41,795 --> 00:28:43,361
There.

390
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,741
What now?

391
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:53,829
Do you... like someone else?

392
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:55,446
Yeah?

393
00:28:59,152 --> 00:29:00,487
No.

394
00:29:00,487 --> 00:29:02,187
What is it then?

395
00:29:08,988 --> 00:29:12,225
Architecture! Architecture!

396
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:16,809
I'm sorry I didn't finish that song.

397
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:18,348
It's fine.

398
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:21,908
This might be your old song, but it's new for us.

399
00:29:21,908 --> 00:29:23,392
At least we have a song to play.

400
00:29:23,392 --> 00:29:27,115
Okay. I'll go give them the list.

401
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:32,132
This one is from Architecture.

402
00:29:32,132 --> 00:29:33,732
Sure.

403
00:29:34,576 --> 00:29:37,020
Here are your nametags.

404
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,793
Hi. This is the song list from Engineering.

405
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:54,851
Your nametags.

406
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:58,832
How are you doing? You ready?

407
00:29:58,832 --> 00:30:01,262
I must be.

408
00:30:01,262 --> 00:30:03,168
Where is Ink?

409
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,395
Why do you ask?

410
00:30:04,395 --> 00:30:05,689
I just want to know.

411
00:30:05,689 --> 00:30:07,863
And why do you want to know?

412
00:30:07,863 --> 00:30:10,321
She should be here supporting you.

413
00:30:10,321 --> 00:30:12,126
Are you okay over here?

414
00:30:14,336 --> 00:30:16,736
I am. Let's go.

415
00:30:17,295 --> 00:30:19,098
Are we all ready?

416
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:20,704
I've been super ready.

417
00:30:20,704 --> 00:30:22,925
We have to win today.

418
00:30:27,718 --> 00:30:31,318
Do your best. I'll cast a good luck spell on you.

419

[Freshy Day 2021]

420
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:46,764
Please give it up for this band from Engineering.

421
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:56,915
For those who just came, welcome to The Freshy Day 2021.

422
00:30:56,915 --> 00:30:59,213
The Music of Love Contest.

423
00:30:59,213 --> 00:31:01,118
When you did the drum solo,

424
00:31:01,118 --> 00:31:04,941
the girls over here screamed so loud my ears almost went deaf.

425
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:07,384
Did you scream, too?

426
00:31:07,384 --> 00:31:09,122
Not telling.

427
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:18,255
Please give a big hand to the next band from Architecture called Moi.

428
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:24,342
Let's go.

429
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:29,264
Hi, guys. We are Moi.

430
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:35,992
The song we're playing is the song I co-wrote with my high school friend.

431
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,059
I hope you like it.

432

♫ It must be nothing ♫

♫ The way you look at me is the same as everyone else ♫

434
00:32:01,238 --> 00:32:04,360
Is this the song you guys played on Christmas that year?

435
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,833
♫ I'm not thinking about anything ♫

436

♫ You are overthinking it ♫

♫ How do I make sense of what you did? ♫

Are you all right?

458
00:34:17,564 --> 00:34:19,159
I...

459
00:34:21,646 --> 00:34:24,865
About us...

460
00:34:24,865 --> 00:34:29,345
What's up with you? You look like you're going to confess your love.

461
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:32,395
What if I am?

462
00:34:35,258 --> 00:34:37,943
I think I've liked you for so long.

463
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:40,022
Since high school.

464
00:34:40,022 --> 00:34:41,868
I was too afraid to tell you then.

465
00:34:41,868 --> 00:34:43,917
I didn't want to lose a friend.

466
00:34:47,147 --> 00:34:50,435
What about now? Aren't you afraid anymore?

467
00:34:52,282 --> 00:34:55,994
I don't know. I've grown up, I guess.

468
00:35:03,605 --> 00:35:07,499
Do you know what's weird?

469
00:35:07,499 --> 00:35:11,298
I don't feel like that's a love confession at all.

470
00:35:11,298 --> 00:35:14,379
It's like you're getting something off your chest.

471
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:26,459
Am I that easy to read?

472
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:31,208
Super obvious.

473
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,357
Really?

474
00:35:35,154 --> 00:35:39,115
Look at you. You seem so relieved.

475
00:35:39,896 --> 00:35:44,289
You don't seem to be afraid of heartbreak.

476
00:35:54,907 --> 00:35:56,866
I am sorry.

477
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:06,739
Even if it was a real confession, I'd still say no.

478
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:09,414
Why?

479
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:11,260
I already have tons of hot friends.

480
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,231
But I can't afford to lose the only crappy friend I have.

481
00:36:15,231 --> 00:36:17,552
You said I was hot the other day.

482
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:19,566
I was just saying that.

483
00:36:19,566 --> 00:36:24,290
I kind of knew you were trying to hit on me though.

484
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:29,779
What's that face?

485
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,358
Is there anything you don't know?

486
00:36:39,517 --> 00:36:42,847
Something that is on your mind right now.

487
00:36:45,948 --> 00:36:51,504
Fine. Just tell me whenever you're ready to share.

488
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:06,027
Welcome to the most important part of this event.

489
00:37:06,027 --> 00:37:09,359
This is the award ceremony.

490

493
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:30,475

494
00:37:30,475 --> 00:37:34,037
Moi Band from Architecture.

495
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,718
Can you believe we were just defeated by Architecture?

496
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:43,615
Look at him. What a prick!

497
00:37:59,594 --> 00:38:02,297
On the house, guys! My treat.

498
00:38:02,297 --> 00:38:04,490
For real?

499
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,690
Let's cheers.

500
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,215
Cheers!

501
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:11,810
Thanks to you guys today. It was so fun.
