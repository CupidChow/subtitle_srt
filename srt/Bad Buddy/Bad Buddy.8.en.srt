1
00:00:00,137 --> 00:00:02,137
His date, not ours.

2
00:00:02,137 --> 00:00:04,440
If you're happy to be with that person, go ahead.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,621
Please don't let it be the kids next door.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,520
Do you like curry?

5
00:00:11,448 --> 00:00:13,948
- I do.
- Do you like me?

6
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:17,069
If you're not up for it, just quit.

7
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:22,549
We'll see if he is going to replace me or a music guy.

8
00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:24,295
Just apologize to Chart and bring him back.

9
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:27,925
Riam is right here, my dear Kwan.

10
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:37,715
You asked if I still wanted us to be friends.

11
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:39,528
What if my answer is no?

12
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:41,296
What do you say?

13
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,408
A fire?

14
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,598
A fire at your house, maybe.

15
00:01:09,543 --> 00:01:12,250
If my house catches fire, it will spread to yours as well.

16
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:14,945
That was my joke.

17
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:16,634
You failed.

18
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:20,725
Here, Mr. Parakul.

19
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:22,725
Breakfast in bed.

20
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:24,982
Can you please make some room for me?

21
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:28,735
What has got into you this morning?

22
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:31,950
No occasion.

23
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,893
I just want to do it for you.

24
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:37,360
Do you like it?

25
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,857
Yuck! You're giving me chills.

26
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:42,828
Just act normally.

27
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,934
Asshole! Just freakin' eat.

28
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:47,647
Too rude.

29
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:50,116
What do you want me to do, then?

30
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:56,981
Just eat and then we'll head to the rehearsal.

31
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:03,714
How is it?

32
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:05,687
It's quite nice.

33
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,333
I'm surprised.

34
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:12,180
I didn't think someone so sucky could cook.

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,933
Was that a compliment?

36
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,496
It was. Have a bite if you don't believe me.

37
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:20,068
It's good.

38
00:02:25,456 --> 00:02:26,762
Good, right?

39
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:29,638
It is because I cooked it.

40
00:02:29,638 --> 00:02:32,253
I shouldn't have complimented you.

41
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:36,478
Can I get a reward instead?

42
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:39,167
What reward?

43
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,425
Sure.

44
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:57,473
Come here.

45
00:02:57,473 --> 00:02:58,942
Hey!

46
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:00,929
- Hey!
- Your reward.

47
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:03,001
Get your reward.

48
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:04,014
Come on.

49
00:03:04,014 --> 00:03:05,387
Why are your lips so red?

50
00:03:05,387 --> 00:03:07,220
Come on.

51
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,685
Kiss, kiss.

52
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:11,146
It's so messy.

53
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,173
Fine. I'll stop.

54
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:16,998
Stop resisting.

55
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:28,462
What?

56
00:03:28,462 --> 00:03:30,200
What's that smell?

57
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,900
Shit!

58
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,366
I forgot that I was grilling a sausage.

59
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:38,347
Damn it!

60
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:45,017
Pat, you bastard!

61
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:59,016
Will you hurry up?

62
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:01,722
We're almost late because of you.

63
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:03,910
What a nagger.

64
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,199
No more sleeping over. Just leave.

65
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,318
"I'm not leaving."

66
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:09,162
"If I go, how the hell will I live?"

67
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:10,928
You got that line from a movie, didn't you?

68
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:12,839
- Hold on.
- What?

69
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:15,875
- Are you forgetting something?
- What?

70
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:18,810
I have my earphones right here.

71
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,087
We're boyfriends now. Let's have a sweet moment.

72
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:29,327
Sorry.

73
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:32,842
I'm not used to this. Can you give me some time to adjust?

74
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:35,018
All right.

75
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:36,711
Let's go.

76
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:42,221
What now?

77
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:44,171
I'm done adjusting.

78
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:47,534
That's fast. Why did you play hard to get in the first place?

79
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,153
Do you want to hold my hand or not?

80
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:51,364
I do, sir.

81
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:56,377
I knew it was your voice, Pat.

82
00:04:56,377 --> 00:04:58,738
You lost your mind and spent all your time in Pran's room.

83
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:00,309
We're rehearsing the play.

84
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:02,382
That's why I always spend the night.

85
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:07,149
Ah! So you had to continue practicing in his room. Right?

86
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,865
Yes.

87
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:11,865
And practiced very hard.

88
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:13,625
That's why you look exhausted.

89
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,962
We're late.

90
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:17,181
Let's go. Are you coming too, Pa?

91
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:18,919
Yes, sir.

92
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,444
Let's go!

93
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:22,220
Go!

94
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:25,285
You're heavy!

95
00:05:30,988 --> 00:05:33,188

[Bad Buddy Series]

97
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,751
Have some water.

98
00:06:22,751 --> 00:06:25,215
Come and grab it.

99
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,195
Grab some water.

100
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:31,021
You can have two.

101
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:35,863
It's yours, Somcheng.

102
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,861
This is yours.

103
00:06:37,861 --> 00:06:39,302
Why do I get green tea?

104
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:42,319
No idea. You're being hit on, I guess.

106
00:06:46,345 --> 00:06:48,545
I don't think so.

107
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,397
Pran, let's do some briefing.

108
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:41,370
Sure.

109
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,875
This scene where Riam is headed home...

110
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,299
Why are you smiling?

111
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:49,868
Nothing.

112
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:51,606
Are you listening to me?

113
00:07:51,606 --> 00:07:55,350
Act 2, Scene 11.

114
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,462
I think this scene is quite sad.

115
00:07:58,462 --> 00:08:01,324
Try to design the music for it.

116
00:08:01,324 --> 00:08:04,892
- Do you get it? You don't.
- I do.

117
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:09,579
You can discuss the character's inner feelings with Pat.

118
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:15,747
Pat, you talk to Pran about the inner feelings so he can compose the music more easily.

119
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:17,419
All right.

120
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,850
What's the inner feeling of this scene?

121
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:27,582
This scene?

122
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:32,413
I think... it should be misery?

I was just playing.

128
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:45,759
Actually, Riam is upset because of what Kwan did.

129
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,095
He expresses his sadness by playing xylophone.

130
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,054
He keeps playing and playing and then...

131
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:53,788
Then?

132
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:57,749
Then he's tired.

What should we have for dinner?

135
00:09:01,071 --> 00:09:02,942
How about you eat my foot, Riam?

136

Damn it! You two stop playing already.

No.

- What answer?

What I just asked you. Dinner with me?

Guess my answer.

I'm guessing "Let's go?"

Listen carefully.

00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:51,173
Still "Let's go."

I want a 35mm lens.

174
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:06,750
This one.

175
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,112
That's 50mm.

176
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:11,243
This one then. I know I'm right.

177
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:12,951
Here.

178
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:14,530
Right.

179
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,820
Right type, but the wrong brand.

180
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,755
I can't use any lens in here.

181
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:22,691
Come on. I'm about to shoot.

182
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:24,255
You sure you can handle this?

183
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:26,533
But I worked on it all night.

184
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,842
You still got it wrong.

185
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:32,565
Go now. Come on.

186
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:35,434
Ink.

187
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:37,583
Can I ask you something?

188
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:39,835
You are...

189
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:42,564
I'm Wai, Pran's friend.

190
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:44,748
Ah! What's up?

191
00:11:44,748 --> 00:11:47,835
Who's that girl you just talked to?

192
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:50,488
A member of my club. Why?

193
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:54,378
Which faculty?

194
00:11:55,026 --> 00:11:56,688
My faculty.

195
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:58,064
Really?

196
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:00,868
What's her major? Is she staying in the on-campus or off-campus dorm?

197
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:07,592
You're asking so many questions. Why don't you just write them down?

198
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:09,623
Do you want a pen?

199
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:13,080
Just chill.

200
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,470
I was just asking. Thanks.

201
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,360
Move.

202
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,931
Just move.

203
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:20,860
You're so fierce.

204
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:27,835
Hey, I'm so hooked, man.

205
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:30,089
By who? Someone pretty?

206
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:33,619
That girl I told you about.

207
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:37,945
She helped out with the photo shoot at the theater. I got a shot of her.

208
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:39,443
Let me see.

209
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:43,439
Sure. Let me find her picture.

210
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:45,050
Here.

211
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:51,828
Promise me you won't hit on her too when you see it.

212
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:53,226
I don't want to see it.

213
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:55,689
Come on. Act like you care, all right?

214
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:58,621
Fine.

215
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:00,840
Here, take a look.

216
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,276
How's she? Cute, right?

217
00:13:08,276 --> 00:13:10,394
You're so stunned.

218
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,720
Yes, I am.

219
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,959
See?

220
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,478
She's so lovely.

221
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:19,876
I really want to hit on her.

222
00:13:21,612 --> 00:13:23,625
I don't think you should.

223
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,455
Why not?

224
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:28,843
Don't tell me you have eyes for her, too.

225
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:30,002
No.

226
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:32,655
But she's that cute.

227
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:35,639
Don't you think you have a lot of competition?

228
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:43,283
Why? Do you think I can't win?

229
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,002
I'm leaving.

230
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:48,351
What? Are you leaving me?

231
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:52,494
We are having a drink together at the bar where I work this evening. Did you forget?

232
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,472
- Yeah?
- Yes.

233
00:13:54,472 --> 00:13:57,325
Well, are you or not?

234
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,478
Have a drink. You must come.

235
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,408
How about it?

236
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,880
Sizzy

237
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:15,053
♫ Can I love you? ♫

238
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:17,253
♫ What score did I get? ♫

239
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:21,907
♫ What should I do to be with you?
I will do it all ♫

240
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:24,049
♫ I'm still new to love ♫

241
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:26,200
♫ You're my tutor ♫

242
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,603
I'm waiting in the car.

243
00:14:32,474 --> 00:14:35,288
Where are you at? Let's go and have a drink.

244
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:40,421
Rehearsing the play.

245
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,947
Rehearsing, my ass! I'm at the theater. You aren't here.

246
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:47,657
Shit!

247
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:53,896
You, bastard! Tell me or I'll squeeze the truth out of you.

248
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:03,016
Hey!

249
00:15:03,016 --> 00:15:04,680
What?

250
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:11,792
You scared me. I thought we got busted.

251
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,271
♪ I'll be good. I'll earn my score ♪

252
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:22,321
♪ Keep doing good and one day I'll win your heart ♪

253
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,453
♪ Put your hand on my cheek and do it some more ♪

254
00:15:24,453 --> 00:15:26,747
♪ Once you've won my heart, you'll be gone ♪

255
00:15:26,747 --> 00:15:28,627
Put on some other songs, will you?

256
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:33,300
You know what? Korn sent me a bunch of messages asking where I was.

257
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,433
I almost screwed up, too.

258
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:38,026
I forgot that I promised to go drink with Wai.

259
00:15:38,026 --> 00:15:39,331
What did you do?

260
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:40,929
I said I'd have dinner with my dad.

261
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:42,575
Dad?

262
00:15:43,755 --> 00:15:46,690
You used your dad. I'll use my mom then.

263
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:49,357
I'll go have dinner with mom.

264
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:51,115
Bye, Korn!

265
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:55,745
No one is looking for us now. Right?

266
00:15:56,491 --> 00:15:58,514
Help me watch our backs.

267
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:04,318
Hey.

268
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:06,738
Why do I feel like I'm your secret lover?

269
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:08,540
Secret lover, my foot!

270
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,215
I have only you.

271
00:16:10,215 --> 00:16:11,826
Yeah?

272
00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:16,986
Play some other songs!!

273
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:19,610
♪ What should I do to be with you? ♪

274
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,289
I hear this song in every cafe I go to.

275
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:24,153
I'm sick of it.

276
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:40,005
Ink, a senior from the club is joining us?

277
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:42,669
I'll sit next to you then.

278
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,710
Right. He said he would join us later.

279
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,719
This meal is on you, isn't it?

280
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:51,820
Who told you that?

281
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,465
It's a welcoming meal for me because I joined your club.

282
00:16:54,465 --> 00:16:57,184
Please, Ink, the best and the prettiest girl.

283
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,076
You're cunning.

284
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:01,606
Did it work though?

285
00:17:02,158 --> 00:17:04,918
Fine. It's my treat.

286
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:08,596
Just watch out. From now on, I'll make you work really hard.

287
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:10,629
I'm up for anything.

288
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,212
- As long as there's food?
- Right.

289
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:16,218
Thank you.

290
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:19,101
- Give it here. I'll peel them for you.
- Thank you.

291
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:20,445
You like shrimp.

292
00:17:20,445 --> 00:17:22,428
You're right.

293
00:17:22,428 --> 00:17:26,794
Wait! How did you know I like shrimp?

294
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:29,026
Pat told me.

295
00:17:29,026 --> 00:17:34,027
He said you love eating shrimp so much, you can eat a kilo of them.

296
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:36,692
He exaggerated. That's not true.

297
00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:40,243
- Two kilos then?
- Ink, no!

298
00:17:45,338 --> 00:17:47,201
Are you okay, Ink?

299
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:49,111
There's something in my eye.

300
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,323
Let me...

301
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:53,028
The tissues are right there.

302
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:58,013
Are you all right? Sorry about that.

303
00:17:58,013 --> 00:18:01,079
Damn! I'm sorry.

304
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,167
Is there anything?

305
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,729
It's little something there.

306
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:13,405
You okay?

307
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:18,191
Thank you.

308
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:21,777
Can I get new chopsticks?

309
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:22,830
Okay.

310
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,336
Excuse me. Can we have a new pair of chopsticks, please?

311
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:30,342
Just wait for a moment.

312
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,764
That was really bad.

313
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:36,443
We're both clumsy.

314
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:42,547
Let me help you with that.

315
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,482
Hi, Au.

316
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:48,299
What?

317
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,060
All right. Sure.

318
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,098
Okay. That's fine.

319
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:56,298
I'll see you later then.

320
00:18:56,871 --> 00:18:59,271
Goodbye.

321
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:04,424
Senior has something urgent to do. He can't come.

322
00:19:04,424 --> 00:19:06,275
It's just us now.

323
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:07,932
He bailed?

324
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:09,574
Is that so?

325
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:11,511
Should I go sit over there then?

326
00:19:11,511 --> 00:19:13,220
No. Just sit here.

327
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,912
You're clumsy. Don't move.

328
00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:24,156
See? I told you sitting here is a good idea.

329
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:29,259
I thought you'd take me to a nice restaurant.

330
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:32,404
We ended up eating from takeaway boxes.

331
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,918
But you get a nice view and a chance to dine with a play lead.

332
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,240
- Can I pay you to be less confident?
- Sure.

333
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,719
Here is my QR code. Transfer the money.

334
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:58,933
I want to go out and have a hotpot with you.

335
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:03,228
All we can do is eat here at the dorm. So sad.

336
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,494
Come on.

337
00:20:06,494 --> 00:20:10,532
You get a nice view and a chance to dine with me.

338
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:12,005
Copy and paste.

339
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:14,334
Thank you very much.

340
00:20:19,257 --> 00:20:20,458
What are you doing?

341
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,490
Posting an IG Story.

342
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,672
Let's make people jealous.

343
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:27,021
But they might find out.

344
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,829
They will see your fingertips only. No one can tell.

345
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:38,207
You can be mad later when I do this.

346
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:40,041
Hey!

347
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,546
I wasn't going to take a picture. I did it just to tease you.

348
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:58,896
I know.

349
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:03,934
I am sorry.

350
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:06,082
Let's just eat.

351
00:21:14,627 --> 00:21:17,867
Hey, don't be sulky.

352
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:48,986
No more snoozing. Get up now.

353
00:22:33,763 --> 00:22:36,363
Please stop sulking.

354
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:47,788
You can leave only when you stop being sulky.

355
00:23:05,858 --> 00:23:08,158
Hey, Pat is here.

356
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:13,786
Hold on!

357
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:15,455
What the heck are you guys doing?

358
00:23:15,455 --> 00:23:17,121
Investigating you.

359
00:23:17,121 --> 00:23:18,920
What is this picture on your IG?

360
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,921
What is it? Tell us.

361
00:23:22,788 --> 00:23:25,682
Do tell.

362
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:27,316
It's nothing.

363
00:23:27,316 --> 00:23:29,672
Just a photo of a door knob.

364
00:23:29,672 --> 00:23:31,248
Hey!

365
00:23:31,248 --> 00:23:32,780
- Pat!
- What?

366
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:37,386
If it's nothing, why did you share it?

367
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:44,098
So that's why you joined the volunteer camp and the Architecture play.

368
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:47,367
You are...

369
00:23:48,235 --> 00:23:51,117
You're really hitting on someone…

370
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,325
You're hitting on an Architecture girl?

371
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,224
None of your business.

372
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:07,700
You're so cool, man.

373
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,063
We didn't expect you'd be courting someone in Architecture.

374
00:24:10,063 --> 00:24:11,887
I admire that very much!

375
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:13,963
Let's cheer for him.

376
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:18,972
- Who's that?
- Would you mind if I join?

377
00:24:18,972 --> 00:24:20,427
Get back to practice.

378
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:22,330
Now!

379
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:47,562
I'm cool now.

380
00:24:48,406 --> 00:24:50,833
Why did you post a photo of my door?

381
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:53,640
It's just a door. Nobody knows.

382
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,183
How do you know? My friends come over many times.

383
00:24:57,183 --> 00:25:00,089
It can be anywhere.

384
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:11,920
Who should be sulking here exactly?

385
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,988
Guys, are you ready?

386
00:25:14,988 --> 00:25:16,735
We're rehearsing Act 1.

387
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:20,992
Who should I read the lines with? No one is here yet.

388
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,715
- Can I do it with Pran?
- Of course.

389
00:25:29,715 --> 00:25:31,033
No.

390
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:32,513
Good idea. Go ahead.

391
00:25:32,513 --> 00:25:35,193
No way. I'm the music guy.

392
00:25:35,193 --> 00:25:38,095
Whatever. Do it and help me save time.

393
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:41,077
Page 8.

394
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:47,740
In this scene, Riam will try to make up with Kwan.

395
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,976
Kwan is playing the xylophone to ease his anger and then Riam comes in to make up.

396
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:54,546
- Okay?
- Yes.

397
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:55,636
Ready?

398
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:57,179
Let's try it.

399
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,194
You can start now.

400
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:05,178
"Kwan, people in this town know about us."

401
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:09,089
"You're bringing shame to my father."

402
00:26:10,546 --> 00:26:14,826
"But you know that my heart is yours and yours only."

403
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:21,821
"Only music is genuine and never deceives me."

404
00:26:27,156 --> 00:26:30,560
"Just don't bring the xylophone into it."

405
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,416
"You can take it all on me."

406
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:34,192
Pat.

407
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:38,238
Let go. Toto is here, too.

408
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:39,778
"No."

409
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:44,123
"I won't let you go until I've been pardoned."

410
00:26:44,123 --> 00:26:47,107
"I know I made a mistake."

411
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:51,233
"But don't be cruel. Please have some mercy."

412
00:26:51,983 --> 00:26:56,145
"The story of us, everyone is aware."

413
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:02,974
"Please."

414
00:27:02,974 --> 00:27:04,979
"Please, Kwan."

415
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:11,992
"My life and my heart are solely dedicated to you."

416
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:15,720
"What are you laughing at?"

417
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,266
- Nothing.
- What are you laughing at?

418
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:18,974
I'm not laughing.

419
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,474
It ended. Let him go. Why are you still hugging him?

420
00:27:32,474 --> 00:27:33,990
It's so good.

421
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,080
This is a true BL play.

422
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,557
Good job!

423
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:43,745
Should I plan a fan meeting for you two after the play?

424
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,899
But I'm doing the music.

425
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:48,949
Whatever. I'm booking a hall.

426
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:52,282
Please stop sulking.

427
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,968
Keep rehearsing, all right?

428
00:27:59,968 --> 00:28:02,036
Tell that to yourself.

429
00:28:02,036 --> 00:28:03,765
I'm from the sound team.

430
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,734
See you.

431
00:28:07,347 --> 00:28:09,647
Pran!

432
00:28:10,434 --> 00:28:12,024
Aren't you working tonight?

433
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:16,931
Slacking off. I miss that cute little girl so much.

434
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:19,032
Have you seen her anywhere?

435
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,624
No.

436
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,750
God! Very good timing.

437
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,753
Today, I must get her chat ID.

438
00:28:37,753 --> 00:28:39,846
Watch me.

439
00:28:39,846 --> 00:28:41,723
What do you think?

440
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:44,542
I don't think you should.

441
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:47,327
Sorry. I must do it.

442
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:48,856
I'm gonna go get her chat ID.

443
00:28:48,856 --> 00:28:51,012
Easy, man.

444
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:54,616
Do you see here, Pa?

445
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:56,419
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

446
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:00,701
Mosquito bites. Let's go home.

447
00:29:00,701 --> 00:29:02,543
Holy shit!

448
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:05,755
Is she Pat's girlfriend?

449
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:12,635
Why does he always meddle with my life?

450
00:29:12,635 --> 00:29:14,421
Calm down.

451
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:17,169
It might be nothing.

452
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:23,188
I can't take it anymore.

453
00:29:23,188 --> 00:29:25,146
But you must.

454
00:29:25,146 --> 00:29:27,307
The one you're beating up is her big brother.

455
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,007
So?

456
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:33,552
- Brother?
- Yes.

457
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:37,139
So how does it feel to be heartbroken?

458
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:40,065
But you're not even heartbroken yet.

459
00:29:40,065 --> 00:29:45,183
I just want to get drunk and forget everything she left for me.

460
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,573
You talk like you've dated her for years. You're overreacting.

461
00:29:55,573 --> 00:29:57,967
It might sound unbelievable.

462
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:02,196
But for me, she's a love at first sight.

463
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:06,360
I've never fallen this hard before.

464
00:30:10,072 --> 00:30:12,472
Hey, that's love.

465
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,358
You can't choose the person or the time.

466
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:22,015
Or maybe I shouldn't give a damn about Pat.

467
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:26,011
Dude, relax.

468
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:28,162
Listen to me and think.

469
00:30:29,323 --> 00:30:31,892
Our faculties are rivals.

470
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:34,197
Every time we face, we fight.

471
00:30:34,197 --> 00:30:38,905
Let's say you're in a relationship with Pat's sister.

472
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:43,893
Do you really believe Pat will accept you?

473
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:50,357
In the end, you have to keep your relationship a secret.

474
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:53,655
You're right.

475
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:54,781
Right?

476
00:30:54,781 --> 00:30:58,893
It's an exhausting relationship.

477
00:30:58,893 --> 00:31:01,033
It's so hard just to see each other.

478
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:03,918
It's tough just to talk to each other.

479
00:31:03,918 --> 00:31:07,028
It's not important enough that it can't be reversed.

480
00:31:07,028 --> 00:31:10,002
No moving forward because it's a deadend.

481
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,839
It's a kind of relationship that I always avoid.

482
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:23,035
Pran, you seem really into it.

483
00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:28,335
I'm your friend. Right?

484
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:30,376
Of course.

485
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:33,410
Whatever you feel, I feel it too, man.

486
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,850
- Is that so?
- I support you all the way, friend.

487
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,298
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

488
00:31:57,112 --> 00:31:59,512
Hi, Pa.

489
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:02,963
Pa, grab my bag and shoes with you.

490
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:11,013
Of all the cars there, this freakin' bird just chose my car to poop on.

491
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,614
Just learn to do things yourself.

492
00:32:13,614 --> 00:32:16,771
Mom, I'm starving.

493
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,402
Pa, can I borrow that?

494
00:32:20,402 --> 00:32:22,320
Sure.

495
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,809
Can I get the bucket, too?

496
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,743
Thank you.

497
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:30,730
Wow!

498
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:33,102
You hold the water hose for me.

499
00:32:34,124 --> 00:32:37,281
Just wash the whole car.

500
00:32:37,943 --> 00:32:40,955
It's a lot. It's going to be a hard job.

501
00:32:43,411 --> 00:32:46,304
Hey, don't spray it on me.

502
00:32:47,372 --> 00:32:49,520
How's your rugby practice?

503
00:32:50,312 --> 00:32:54,037
Great. We've been practicing until late at night.

504
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,140
When did I teach you to lie?

505
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,063
You've been rehearsing the Architecture play

506
00:33:11,063 --> 00:33:14,427
and skipping rugby practice. I know it.

507
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:22,625
- A scheduling conflict.
- Why don't you just quit the play then?

508
00:33:24,216 --> 00:33:29,151
The play starts very soon. I'm just helping out.

509
00:33:29,151 --> 00:33:31,643
They can't do it without me.

510
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:38,592
Do you know why I don't intervene in your life much?

511
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:44,945
It's because I thought you knew your priorities.

512
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,120
And clearly, I was wrong.

513
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,135
I'll be right back.

514
00:34:43,135 --> 00:34:44,751
Yeah.

515
00:34:48,472 --> 00:34:51,372
- Hello, dude.
- Hello, dude.

516
00:34:51,372 --> 00:34:53,364
Are you free to talk?

517
00:34:56,624 --> 00:35:00,591
I'm out drinking. What is it?

518
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:06,584
Nothing. You go on.

519
00:35:07,316 --> 00:35:10,417
All right then. Talk to you later.

520
00:35:22,008 --> 00:35:23,761
What's up?

521
00:35:25,658 --> 00:35:27,251
My mom.

522
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:53,735
[Just a friend]

523
00:35:58,128 --> 00:36:00,383
Hello.

524
00:36:00,383 --> 00:36:02,701
Are you okay?

525
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:06,155
What do you mean? I'm fine.

526
00:36:06,796 --> 00:36:11,547
Then, who called and sounded like he wanted to talk to me so bad?

527
00:36:18,964 --> 00:36:24,513
Do you think it's cool if I quit the Kwan and Riam play?

528
00:36:24,513 --> 00:36:28,817
Don't kid about this. The play is about to start.

529
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:37,242
My dad found out about the play and me skipping rugby.

530
00:36:37,242 --> 00:36:39,442
He knows everything.

531
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:43,482
Did he tell you to quit?

532
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:48,741
He didn't exactly say so,

533
00:36:49,618 --> 00:36:52,018
but I could feel it.

534
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:57,114
He is really disappointed.

535
00:37:00,432 --> 00:37:06,572
Honestly, my dad had never said that to me before.

536
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:08,935
I feel really bad.

537
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:15,741
Come out to your balcony.

538
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,529
Balcony?

539
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:24,143
And jump?

540
00:37:24,143 --> 00:37:27,408
Stop talking and do it now.

541
00:37:27,408 --> 00:37:29,323
Now.

542
00:37:29,323 --> 00:37:31,070
Do it.

543
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:39,728
Where are you?

544
00:37:39,728 --> 00:37:41,189
I see nothing.

545
00:37:41,189 --> 00:37:44,342
Hold on. I'm in the elevator going to you.

546
00:37:44,342 --> 00:37:46,212
One second.

547
00:37:50,513 --> 00:37:51,845
Did you like that?

548
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:56,073
You didn't? I can do an escalator, too.

549
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,692
Let me go down first.

550
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,212
I'm coming up.

551
00:38:05,146 --> 00:38:07,146
Did you hurry back home?

552
00:38:07,146 --> 00:38:10,704
I hurried home after I heard your sad puppy voice.

553
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:14,526
"Hey!" you said.

554
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,785
I was worried.

555
00:38:17,764 --> 00:38:19,764
Dude...

556
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:24,126
You're being cuter and cuter every day.

557
00:38:25,057 --> 00:38:26,770
I want to hug you.

558
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:30,721
Let's do a virtual hug for now.

559
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:32,321
Let's hug.

560
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,354
I want a back hug now.

561
00:38:41,356 --> 00:38:43,456
Your turn.

562
00:38:47,198 --> 00:38:49,223
Are you feeling better?

563
00:38:49,223 --> 00:38:51,488
A lot better.

564
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:57,207
I want to do something else virtually now.

565
00:38:58,087 --> 00:38:59,419
What an ass!

566
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:02,410
Stop your dirty mind for one second, will you?

567
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,628
No, not that.

568
00:39:04,628 --> 00:39:09,118
I want your T-shirt. So I can hug you virtually in bed.

569
00:39:10,257 --> 00:39:13,903
What? Am I your Nong Nao Doll now?

570
00:39:14,778 --> 00:39:17,191
You're not Nong Nao.

571
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:18,891
But you're Nong Noo baby girl.

572
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:21,705
Yuck! I'm having goosebumps here.

573
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:23,465
One second.

574
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,842
Hold on.

575
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,214
Throw it nicely.

576
00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:33,289
Just wait.

577
00:39:35,378 --> 00:39:37,128
Catch it.

578
00:39:37,128 --> 00:39:39,802
1, 2, 3.

579
00:39:46,127 --> 00:39:48,569
Familiar scent of you.

580
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:50,969
You're a psycho.

581
00:39:52,613 --> 00:39:54,630
Thank you.

582
00:39:57,003 --> 00:40:00,029
Don't you want me close to you, too?

583
00:40:01,516 --> 00:40:05,408
No need. I usually have your voice in my ears.

584
00:40:05,408 --> 00:40:07,408
I have your earphones.

585
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:14,745
- Hold on.
- You hold on.

586
00:40:17,241 --> 00:40:18,873
Pat.

587
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:25,017
Are you sure you have them with you?

588
00:40:25,017 --> 00:40:27,617
All right. I don't have them.

589
00:40:33,354 --> 00:40:35,454
Try to catch.

590
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:41,871
I got you a new earphones bag.

591
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:44,286
Don't leave it anywhere again.

592
00:40:45,163 --> 00:40:46,930
I won't, sir.

593
00:40:47,554 --> 00:40:49,454
Keep it in a safe place.

594
00:40:49,454 --> 00:40:52,263
I'll always keep it with me.

595
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,688
What's PP though?

596
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:57,998
PP what?

597
00:40:57,998 --> 00:40:59,291
Right here.

598
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,476
There isn't any PP.

599
00:41:00,476 --> 00:41:01,741
There is.

600
00:41:01,741 --> 00:41:03,394
- I don't know.
- What does it stand for?

601
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,173
I don't know. I forgot.

602
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:07,788
- What does it mean?
- No idea.

603
00:41:07,788 --> 00:41:09,380
I completely forgot.

604
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,757
I'm wondering what it is.

605
00:41:11,757 --> 00:41:14,547
- Do you want it or not?
- I do.

606
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:21,618
Stop that.

607
00:41:21,618 --> 00:41:24,396
- Stop sniffing it.
- It feels good.

608
00:41:24,396 --> 00:41:25,906
Are you okay now?

609
00:41:25,906 --> 00:41:27,456
- What?
- Are you feeling okay now?

610
00:41:27,456 --> 00:41:29,715
Very much so.

611
00:41:29,715 --> 00:41:31,948
- Give me a big smile with small eyes.
- Huh?

612
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,275
Give me a big smile with small eyes.

613
00:41:38,418 --> 00:41:40,831
- Small enough?
- Yes.

614
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,285
Now, show me your dimples.

615
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,353
Go to bed.

616
00:41:48,353 --> 00:41:50,544
You too.

617
00:41:50,544 --> 00:41:54,185
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Right. I'll see you tomorrow.

618
00:41:54,185 --> 00:41:56,796
Goodnight.

619
00:41:56,796 --> 00:41:58,659
Bye now.

620
00:42:02,094 --> 00:42:03,426
Bye-bye.

621
00:42:03,426 --> 00:42:05,046
Goodbye, for real this time.

622
00:42:05,046 --> 00:42:09,494
If you're still there, I'll climb to your room right now.

623
00:42:11,181 --> 00:42:13,581
What's the hurry?

624
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:23,749
♫ So what if you catch me looking at you ♫

625
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:28,893
♫ Isn't it you who liked to look at me first? ♫

626
00:42:28,893 --> 00:42:33,803
♫ No need to wonder why I take care of you ♫

627
00:42:33,803 --> 00:42:38,909
♫ Well, isn't it yout? Don't you remember who liked me first ♫

628
00:42:38,909 --> 00:42:41,524
♫ Don't think that you can hide it well ♫

629
00:42:41,524 --> 00:42:44,053
♫ I can hear your thoughts by your eyes twinkling ♫

630
00:42:44,053 --> 00:42:46,488
♫ If you feel the same, just give me a signal ♫

631
00:42:46,488 --> 00:42:49,118
♫ Just come closer without saying a word ♫

632
00:42:49,118 --> 00:42:51,623
♫ If you feel it, I'm down with it ♫

633
00:42:51,623 --> 00:42:54,015
♫ Come on, don't be shy. Don't have to come close ♫

634
00:42:54,015 --> 00:42:58,333
​♫ Well, let's just say I'll keep it a secret ♫

635
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:03,300
♫ Okay, I won't tell anyone that you had feelings for me first ♫

636
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:09,044
♫ Okay, I won't tell anyone that you liked me first ♫

637
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:16,998
♫ I'll keep it just between us, it's a secret that only we'll know ♫

638
00:43:18,476 --> 00:43:23,576
♫ I won't tell anyone that you liked me first ♫

639
00:43:23,576 --> 00:43:29,230
♫ Just making eye contact like this makes it feel so good ♫

640
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:37,641
♫ This kind of thing is known to only two people,
it's a love that only you and I know ♫

641
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:41,608
♫ Just you and me ♫

642
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,295
We'll rehearse from the first to the last scene today.

643
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:50,979
Okay?

644
00:43:50,979 --> 00:43:54,339
Do the warm-up and when you guys are ready, we can start.

645
00:43:54,339 --> 00:43:57,836
Pran, is the sound okay?

646
00:44:01,674 --> 00:44:04,100
Let's warm up.

647
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:10,260
What?

648
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,317
Do you think Pat is hitting on someone?

649
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,740
I know, right?

650
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:20,255
I'm keeping an eye on him. He posts his IG Story every day.

651
00:44:20,255 --> 00:44:21,572
And he uses the hashtag...

652
00:44:21,572 --> 00:44:22,863
#JustFriends.

653
00:44:22,863 --> 00:44:24,938
Right? I knew it.

654
00:44:24,938 --> 00:44:27,193
The one in his photos,

655
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:30,092
I think it's someone from our faculty.

656
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,754
I agree.

657
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:39,128
Because I always see him hanging around our faculty.

658
00:44:39,128 --> 00:44:40,789
Right?

659
00:44:40,789 --> 00:44:44,773
Just that friend of his...

660
00:45:03,441 --> 00:45:07,463
How many times do we need to talk about this?

661
00:45:07,463 --> 00:45:08,653
About what?

662
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:11,315
Your hashtag #JustFriends.

663
00:45:11,315 --> 00:45:15,194
People know you're courting someone on this set.

664
00:45:15,194 --> 00:45:18,245
But they don't know it's you.

665
00:45:18,245 --> 00:45:20,326
There're my pens in your photo.

666
00:45:20,326 --> 00:45:22,301
Pens?

667
00:45:22,301 --> 00:45:25,422
Everyone uses pens.

668
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,363
And this t-shirt. Why are you wearing my shirt?

669
00:45:33,818 --> 00:45:35,821
I just want to have your scent with me.

670
00:45:35,821 --> 00:45:37,134
Just don't.

671
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,656
Do you really want to tell people that bad?

672
00:45:39,656 --> 00:45:42,199
You want them to find out about us that bad?

673
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:44,071
Why don't you just go out there and announce it?

674
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:46,889
Do not challenge me. I will.

675
00:45:46,889 --> 00:45:48,369
Damn it!

676
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:50,794
Don't be silly.

677
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:57,865
I won't do it because I care about you.

678
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:07,308
But if this shirt is so problematic, fine, I'll take it off.

679
00:46:26,795 --> 00:46:29,894
- How is the costume?
- Done.

680
00:46:29,894 --> 00:46:31,528
It is?

681
00:46:31,528 --> 00:46:35,898
Okay, guys, we'll start with Act 2.

682
00:46:35,898 --> 00:46:38,679
You all ready? Ready?

683
00:46:39,348 --> 00:46:41,248
I'm right here.

684
00:46:42,158 --> 00:46:44,792
Why are you topless? We're doing a run-through.

685
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:46,973
It smells bad.

686
00:46:47,777 --> 00:46:49,880
We can rehearse. I'm ready.

687
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,721
Up to you then.

688
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:54,866
We will start with the first scene of Act 2.

689
00:46:54,866 --> 00:47:00,392
Riam will play xylophone to express his upset.

690
00:47:00,392 --> 00:47:01,674
Ready?

691
00:47:01,674 --> 00:47:03,553
Sound?

692
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:05,381
Light?

693
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,980
Go!

694
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,540
Wear your tee. You're making everyone drool.

695
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:08,412
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

696
00:50:10,634 --> 00:50:13,134
I'm sorry for going off like that.

697
00:50:14,825 --> 00:50:17,683
I'm sorry for too being impulsive.

698
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:25,588
I actually just wanted people to know that I was taken.

699
00:50:27,385 --> 00:50:29,785
Social media is for bragging anyways.

700
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:34,268
Keeping it between us can be nice, too.

701
00:50:35,634 --> 00:50:37,734
Don't you feel uncomfortable hiding it?

702
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,297
Just because I'm not telling people doesn't mean I don't like you.

703
00:50:46,518 --> 00:50:48,518
You have a point.

704
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:52,491
I will stop posting anything.

705
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:55,191
It's fine. Just do it.

706
00:50:56,988 --> 00:50:59,398
Aren't you afraid people will find out?

707
00:50:59,398 --> 00:51:01,163
I am.

708
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,059
But I care about you more.

709
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,322
I'm your boyfriend.

710
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:17,633
If I can't handle this little thing, how can we make this relationship work?

711
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,410
Who is whose boyfriend again?

712
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:31,400
You got one shot there. It's gone.

713
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,835
Say it one more time. I didn't quite catch it.

714
00:51:35,835 --> 00:51:37,554
What was it?

715
00:51:40,673 --> 00:51:42,211
Fine.

716
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:45,049
I am your boyfriend.

717
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,700
Why are you so damn cute?

718
00:51:56,257 --> 00:51:58,603
Can I hug you?

719
00:51:58,603 --> 00:52:00,791
No more virtual hugs.

720
00:52:02,211 --> 00:52:03,665
Put the shirt on first.

721
00:52:03,665 --> 00:52:04,977
No. Put it on.

722
00:52:04,977 --> 00:52:07,032
You stink.

723
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:21,355
What are you doing?

724
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:22,986
Posting an IG story.

725
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:25,374
Telling the world we're not just friends.

726
00:52:32,938 --> 00:52:34,197
Now put on your shirt.

727
00:52:34,197 --> 00:52:37,109
Aren't you cold? It's freezing in here.

728
00:52:44,052 --> 00:52:46,152
Can we hug now?

729
00:52:48,722 --> 00:52:50,722
Can we?

730
00:52:50,722 --> 00:52:52,136
Are you disgusted with me?

731
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:53,969
Let's hug.

732
00:52:56,954 --> 00:52:58,288
Are you?

733
00:52:58,288 --> 00:53:00,221
- You stink.
- Do I?

734
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:03,254
- You do.
- You're my boyfriend now.

735
00:53:03,254 --> 00:53:05,820
I can tease you all I want.

736
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,407
Pat.

738
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,155
I am sorry.

739
00:54:29,155 --> 00:54:30,996
I need to forgive you, don't I?

740
00:54:30,996 --> 00:54:33,547
Otherwise, I'm an asshole.

741
00:54:34,677 --> 00:54:36,394

744
00:54:43,701 --> 00:54:46,596
I don't find anything surprising. It's just two guys seeing each other.

745
00:54:46,596 --> 00:54:49,335
Should I post a status saying we broke up?

746
00:54:49,335 --> 00:54:51,629
I can do it for you.

747
00:54:52,527 --> 00:54:55,054
If you don't want to play with me, then don't.

748
00:54:55,054 --> 00:54:57,492
- What's your problem?
- Come on!

749
00:54:57,492 --> 00:54:59,160
