00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:44,265
Do it.

171

Don't be unreasonable.

172
00:17:50,622 --> 00:17:52,155
What?

173
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:59,094
About that bus stop. Your friends started the fight. It wasn't my friends' fault.

174
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:04,690
If they hadn't posted that video, my friends wouldn't have lost their heads.

175
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,027
What video?

176
00:18:06,027 --> 00:18:11,234
The video of you guys picking on Wai in a bar. Your friends posted it online.

177
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:18,227
I didn't know about the video.

178
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,983
Playing dumb now?

179
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:30,345
But in that video, you looked so happy.

180
00:18:42,557 --> 00:18:44,340

181
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,633
That's all for today. See you next class. Goodbye.

- Anywhere.
- Curry restaurant.

I'll work on the bus stop budget. The numbers aren't finalized yet.

188
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,537
- Let me help.
- No worries.

189

You go talk to the student union. They might be able to help.

Come on.

This is going to be a super convenient bus stop.

232
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:03,792
But we still need...

233
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:07,398
a large amount of budget.

234
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:10,620
But if we get sponsorship from Loctech,

235
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,626
we will strive to move this initiative forward

236
00:25:13,626 --> 00:25:18,204
and use it as a model for the other bus stops on campus.

237
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,641
Thank you.

238
00:25:23,114 --> 00:25:26,112
I actually like your idea.

239
00:25:26,112 --> 00:25:29,960
Especially, building it with polymer.

240
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,283
That will help save the cost.

241
00:25:32,283 --> 00:25:37,743
However, we just approved a project similar to yours.

242

You're just a little too late.

Sure.

Let's hear it then.

248
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:14,213
I heard that you are interested in eco-friendly projects.

249
00:26:14,213 --> 00:26:17,597
How about we turn it into a 100% eco bus stop?

250
00:26:17,597 --> 00:26:22,319
We use recycled materials and solar power. Will that be more interesting?

251
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:28,004
Also, if this project is granted, this bus stop will be all over our institution.

252
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,590
People passing by will notice it,

253
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,473
and you will have the opportunity to advertise Loctech Company.

254

337
00:32:07,531 --> 00:32:09,731
Sorry, I'm not your friend.

338
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:12,786
You know that fact.

339
00:32:12,786 --> 00:32:14,509
Now leave.

340
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:29,326
Do you really want me to leave?

341
00:32:29,326 --> 00:32:32,383
You kept looking at it but not drawing any line.

342
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,874
Engineers just sign and approve the design.

343
00:32:35,874 --> 00:32:39,544
You have no idea how tough it is to be creative.

344
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,690
Engineers might not be creative.

345
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:51,007
But we get things done. Whatever we do, we do it for real and make it actually work.

346
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:53,267
If you don't believe me, get up.

347
00:32:53,267 --> 00:32:55,590
- What?
- Come on.

348
00:33:03,384 --> 00:33:05,897
You can't just sit and imagine it.

349
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:08,406
You must use someone who actually uses it.

350
00:33:08,406 --> 00:33:11,745
Let's do this. Let's say we're friends.

351
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:13,322
No.

352
00:33:13,322 --> 00:33:15,006
Lovers then.

353
00:33:16,725 --> 00:33:21,006
Being a boyfriend will give you a different perspective.

354
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,570
Let's say I'm an Engineering hot guy and you're an Architecture hot girl.

355
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,243
We're in a relationship. And...

356
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:34,735
seeking shelter from the rain and waiting to get on a bus.

357
00:33:35,383 --> 00:33:37,388
I'm not playing along.

358
00:33:37,388 --> 00:33:39,256
I mean business here.

359
00:33:39,256 --> 00:33:40,891
Baby.

360
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:52,090
Why am I a girl? You are.

361
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,199
Why so picky?

362
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:57,478
Let's say we're both hot guys and we're boyfriends.

363
00:34:01,304 --> 00:34:04,220
You're the husband and I'm the wife. Okay?

364
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,368
You're such a masculine wife.

365
00:34:19,044 --> 00:34:26,158
Honey, I'm all drenched. It's raining so heavily.

366
00:34:26,158 --> 00:34:27,582
Gosh!

367
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:29,741
People can see through my shirt.

368
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:32,599
What am I going to do, Honey?

369
00:34:36,202 --> 00:34:39,400
There's a bus stop. Should we use it as a shelter?

370
00:34:50,524 --> 00:34:55,261
The roof should be around this high and curved.

371
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:57,461
It will help keep the rain out.

372
00:35:00,674 --> 00:35:05,508
Honey, the rain just stopped but it's sunny now.

373
00:35:05,508 --> 00:35:08,863
My skin is going to burn.

374
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,430
We should have a solar cell, too.

375
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,243
It will generate power for use at night.

376
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:24,300
For the fans, the CCTV, and the electronic signs.

377
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,991
Honey, you only care about the bus stop. You don't care about me.

378
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,754
I'm sulky now.

379
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:40,321
The Holy Grail of Anthurium is as stunning as one beautiful person.

380
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,021
Jackass! So flowers are growing around this bus stop, too?

381
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:49,840
It's an eco bus stop.

382
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,561
Flowers are easy on the eyes and they keep people company while they wait for the bus.

383
00:35:54,561 --> 00:35:56,345
Who will take care of them?

384
00:35:56,345 --> 00:35:58,540
Well...

385
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:03,706
We will have a faucet here and the drainpipe will be directed to the flowers.

386
00:36:03,706 --> 00:36:06,017
That's how we water them.

387
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:10,340
But I'm thirsty now.

388
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,638
Drink from the drainpipe.

389
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:15,821
I'm serious. Making a woman's voice hurts my throat.

390
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,396
Here.

391
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:30,393
Can you open it for me, Honey?

392
00:36:30,393 --> 00:36:33,095
Are you still an Engineering hot girl?

393
00:36:33,095 --> 00:36:37,280
Come on. I helped you find a couple of ideas here.

394
00:36:38,756 --> 00:36:41,942
Fine. I'll open it for you, Honey.

395
00:36:41,942 --> 00:36:44,854
Let me feed you, Honey.

396
00:36:47,178 --> 00:36:49,278
Isn't it refreshing, Honey?

397
00:36:50,832 --> 00:36:52,112
More, please.

398
00:36:52,112 --> 00:36:53,958
Of course.

399
00:36:57,811 --> 00:37:00,730
Did you like that, Honey?

400
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,588
I did, Honey!

401
00:37:08,899 --> 00:37:11,134
No! It's sticky.

402
00:37:11,134 --> 00:37:12,525
Pat!

403
00:37:12,525 --> 00:37:14,449
Let go.

404
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:17,049
No!

405
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:22,384
Why running so fast, Honey?

406
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:24,589
I'm a rugby player.

407
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:26,285
Pat!

408
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,580
Pat!

409
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:48,539
What the hell are you looking at?

410
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:49,921
The hell, exactly.

411
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:52,136
You're the hell.

412
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:55,866
Do you like it? The new bus stop.

413
00:37:59,261 --> 00:38:01,034
I do.

414
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:03,779
I'm just not sure if they will, too.

415
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:07,244
They will. Because I do.

416
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,182
My honey is so smart.

417
00:38:15,182 --> 00:38:18,654
Stop already. You're giving me goosebumps.

418
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:22,049
My booboo is the best.

419
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,518
Your girly voice doesn't suit that big body.

420
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:28,338
We all agree to sponsor this project.

421
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:31,512
Prepare the document and send it to us for signing.

422
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,937
Thank you.

423
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,729
I told you I was your lucky charm.

424
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:41,745
But the bad news is the expense is a little too high.

425
00:38:41,745 --> 00:38:45,012
We can sponsor just half of what you proposed.

426
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:00,563
Hey!

427
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,055
Hey!

428
00:39:03,055 --> 00:39:04,659
What?

429
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:07,066
Should we go check out a guitar?

430
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:09,264
No. You go ahead.

431
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,939
Hold on.

432
00:39:12,238 --> 00:39:17,386
I think we can just use lower-graded materials.

433
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:18,882
They won't know.

434
00:39:18,882 --> 00:39:20,944
It's not the right time to joke around.

435
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:22,286
Why are you being so serious?

436
00:39:22,286 --> 00:39:25,311
It's no big deal. You'll find the way out soon.

437
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:27,263
No big deal?

438
00:39:27,263 --> 00:39:29,941
Of course, you can say that.

439
00:39:29,941 --> 00:39:33,845
But if we don't get the money in time, my friends will be suspended.

440
00:39:33,845 --> 00:39:36,433
They weren't even the ones starting this fight.

441
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:41,008
Who was then? Me?

442
00:39:46,643 --> 00:39:48,643
You go in the middle.

443
00:39:48,643 --> 00:39:50,637
I'm dying.

444
00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:51,605
Korn!

445
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:53,169
Let him go. I'm retreating.

446
00:39:53,169 --> 00:39:55,472
Me too.

447
00:39:57,606 --> 00:39:59,471
Let Mo fight alone.

448
00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:00,612
Don't do that.

449
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:02,081
Ouch! Who the hell?

450
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:03,855
Pat!

451
00:40:03,855 --> 00:40:05,744
I just died here!

452
00:40:05,744 --> 00:40:07,966
You guys deserve more than that.

453
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:10,272
Why are you bullying us?

454
00:40:10,272 --> 00:40:13,953
Do you need to ask? Why did you post that video?

455
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,083
So?

456
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:21,765
So trouble followed.

457
00:40:21,765 --> 00:40:25,581
The Architecture students need to pay for the bus stop rebuild expenses.

458
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:28,183
So?

459
00:40:28,183 --> 00:40:29,853
What?

460
00:40:29,853 --> 00:40:32,557
Why are you being frustrated for them?

461
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:35,042
Exactly.

462
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:38,609
You're an Engineering student, in case you forgot.

463
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,702
You're acting weird.

464
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:47,310
[ENGINEER: I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right.]

465
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:31,299
You already have a guitar.

466
00:41:31,903 --> 00:41:34,482
I had one but it's gone.

467
00:41:34,482 --> 00:41:36,808
Maybe it has been eaten by termites already.

468
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:41,397
Why don't you try to look for it?

469
00:41:41,397 --> 00:41:44,226
Maybe it's still around somewhere.

470
00:42:01,094 --> 00:42:02,997
How much more do we need?

471
00:42:02,997 --> 00:42:04,313
Around 10K.

472
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:07,565
Unless we get free construction work.

473
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,795
Can we borrow the money from the student union? I will pay the installments later.

474
00:42:13,527 --> 00:42:14,759
I asked.

475
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:17,187
They need to save it for the Senior Prom.

476
00:42:17,187 --> 00:42:19,720
Can we ask our friends to help?

477
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,143
Who would help? Nobody cares.

478
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:28,261
We need some money to pay the engineer as well.

479
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:36,782
Let's check out the bus stop first.

480
00:42:36,782 --> 00:42:40,011
There might be something left to sell.

481
00:42:45,478 --> 00:42:47,056
Look.

482
00:42:47,056 --> 00:42:51,124
Judging from what I see, it can only cover two meals.

483
00:42:51,124 --> 00:42:53,624
Not even two.

484
00:42:55,257 --> 00:42:58,960
1, 2, 3, 4.

485
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:03,952
How long is it going to take for just the four of us to build this?

486
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:08,169
We can't. We need to hire people.

487
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,671
Are you talking about us?

488
00:43:28,034 --> 00:43:31,197
You want us to help the Architecture students rebuild that bus stop?

489
00:43:31,197 --> 00:43:32,329
Yes.

490
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:34,743
Are you really an Engineering student here?

491
00:43:34,743 --> 00:43:37,268
Why should we sympathize for them?

492
00:43:38,943 --> 00:43:41,043
Listen to me.

493
00:43:41,043 --> 00:43:45,062
The seniors from both faculties built this bus stop.

494
00:43:45,062 --> 00:43:47,307
It's the asset of both faculties.

495
00:43:47,307 --> 00:43:49,218
Think about it.

496
00:43:49,218 --> 00:43:53,231
If we let the Architecture students build it...

497
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:58,905
Then it will be Architecture's asset.

498
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,700
And our right and freedom to use it will be deprived.

499
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,347
Exactly.

500
00:44:03,347 --> 00:44:06,324
It's like giving up our territory.

501
00:44:06,324 --> 00:44:10,481
The territory that our seniors sacrificed their flesh and blood to protect.

502
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:15,067
Can you really give it up to the Architecture students?

503
00:44:15,067 --> 00:44:17,453
Of course not.

504
00:44:17,453 --> 00:44:19,726
No way in hell.

505
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:26,000
So, as the class president, here is what I suggest.

[Pavilion of "Peace"]

507
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,353
If we all help each other build it, I don't think we need to hire more workers.

508
00:44:39,197 --> 00:44:42,725
We will supervise the project for you.

509
00:44:42,725 --> 00:44:47,017
We discussed this with our professors. I think we're good to get started.

510
00:44:52,663 --> 00:44:57,218
It's very nice to be working with you, Mr. Architecture Class President.

511
00:45:00,524 --> 00:45:02,419
Hey, Pran!

512
00:45:02,419 --> 00:45:05,392
Wai, do you have any other choice?

[Tinidee: Hotel @ Bangkok Golf Club]

514
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,852
What?

515
00:46:10,446 --> 00:46:12,655
You've been lurking at my door.

516
00:46:15,936 --> 00:46:18,608
About the bus stop.

517
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:20,230
Thank you.

518
00:46:23,043 --> 00:46:26,194
It's our fault too for posting that video.

519
00:46:27,392 --> 00:46:29,892
Can we call it even now?

520
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:36,803
Bye.

521
00:46:37,407 --> 00:46:39,007
Hey!

522
00:46:41,175 --> 00:46:42,789
What?

523
00:46:45,466 --> 00:46:47,124
Have you eaten?

524
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,399
I have.

525
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:54,832
Okay.

526
00:46:54,832 --> 00:46:56,724
Bye then.

527
00:46:56,724 --> 00:46:58,551
Hold on.

One second.

529
00:47:18,621 --> 00:47:20,295
Hey!

530
00:47:23,351 --> 00:47:26,917
It's your guitar. It wasn't eaten by termites.

531
00:47:27,628 --> 00:47:29,631
Holy shit!

532
00:47:29,631 --> 00:47:32,098
You've kept it for me?

533
00:47:34,006 --> 00:47:36,707
The music club room got cleaned out.

534
00:47:36,707 --> 00:47:40,589
I tried to sell it online, but no one was interested.

535
00:47:40,589 --> 00:47:43,551
It's eating up space in my room, so you should have it back.

536
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,099
Thanks.

537
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,760
What a shame!

538
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,040
We won't get to compete in the Freshy Music Contest.

539
00:48:06,964 --> 00:48:09,464
We're back in the competition.

540
00:48:12,064 --> 00:48:13,595
How come?

541
00:48:13,595 --> 00:48:14,976
I have no clue.

542
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:19,832
Can you please reconsider our punishment?

543
00:48:19,832 --> 00:48:23,707
The two faculties will help each other rebuild that bus stop.

544
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:30,416
Besides, joining the same activity might better our relationship.

Professor?

546
00:48:36,322 --> 00:48:42,657
Come on. I told my dad I would bring him the trophy.

547
00:48:42,657 --> 00:48:47,361
You know how serious he is about this.

548
00:48:47,361 --> 00:48:49,504
Please?

549
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:53,282
Fine.

550
00:48:53,282 --> 00:48:58,016
If that bus stop gets completely done, I will talk to the board again.

551
00:48:58,016 --> 00:49:03,274
But if there's any fight at all in the meantime, everything is over.

There's no excuse if you're defeated by Engineering this time.
