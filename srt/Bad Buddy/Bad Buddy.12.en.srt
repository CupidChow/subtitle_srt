00:29:23,914 --> 00:29:25,732
Go.

327
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,600
Before my mom is back.

328
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,000
- I can't. My leg is stuck.
- Just go.

329
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,410
One kiss and I'll go.

330
00:29:34,396 --> 00:29:36,671
The other cheek, too.

331
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:39,745
- Go now!
- My leg.

332
00:29:42,224 --> 00:29:45,147
But then, our happy couple life came to an end

333
00:29:45,147 --> 00:29:47,769
when he wanted to become an architect in Singapore.

334
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:49,730
It's just for two years.

335
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,514
I need to do something for a living, too.

336
00:29:51,514 --> 00:29:54,140
It was a better opportunity and better money there.

337
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,184
You got your luggage.

338
00:29:56,184 --> 00:29:57,984
What else are you forgetting?

339
00:29:57,984 --> 00:30:00,560
Nothing. I got my passport here.

340
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,421
Think again.

341
00:30:02,421 --> 00:30:04,745
Nothing. I already checked.

342
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:20,040
Well, well. You already forgot the earphones.

343
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,814
When you meet new guys with blue eyes,

344
00:30:21,814 --> 00:30:24,134
you might forget about someone with fierce eyes here.

345
00:30:26,572 --> 00:30:30,280
Here. I hope this can make up for it.

346
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,659
Do you really think it can make us cool?

347
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,820
Better?

348
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:50,244
Here.

349
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:54,023
We're cool.

350
00:30:54,023 --> 00:30:55,770
Thank you.

351
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,300
Let's go.

352
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:04,043
No matter how far we were, our worlds were still close.

353
00:31:08,303 --> 00:31:10,896
Bye. See you this evening.

354
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,440
[Low Noise]

355
00:31:25,815 --> 00:31:29,486
[I miss our love nest.]

356
00:31:29,486 --> 00:31:31,920
Just like Uncle Tong said,

357
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,880
we might not be able to change the world,
[I'm about to head to the airport.]

358
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,960
All we could do was adjust to it and live happily.

359
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,560
We might not be able to change people around us.

360
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,742
But they couldn't change the two of us either.

361
00:31:49,878 --> 00:31:53,776
Don't blink. Do not close your eyes.

362
00:31:59,026 --> 00:32:01,749
1, 2, 3.

363
00:32:20,176 --> 00:32:21,787
Hey.

364
00:32:21,787 --> 00:32:23,508
I'm hungry.

365
00:32:25,032 --> 00:32:27,732
Didn't you get enough?

366
00:32:30,565 --> 00:32:32,665
I waited for a year.

367
00:32:32,665 --> 00:32:36,852
You served me for only 5 minutes. Do you think that's enough?

368
00:32:38,352 --> 00:32:40,452
Stop with the insult.

369
00:32:41,051 --> 00:32:44,051
I just got a little excited there.

370
00:32:45,444 --> 00:32:47,398
You suck.

371
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:53,317
Come on. Let's get something to eat and calm the excitement.

372
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:57,298
It going to be a long night tonight.

373
00:33:01,364 --> 00:33:03,175
Come on.

374
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,180
Let's go, let's go.

375
00:33:07,913 --> 00:33:09,913
I'm hungry for food.

376
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:12,101
Why did you take me to a bar?

377
00:33:12,101 --> 00:33:15,662
We're here to support our friends. Their bar is so broke.

378
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:17,465
What a mouth, asshole!

379
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:19,496
No. This one is mine.

380
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:21,526
These are yours.

381
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,500
Cheers!

382
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,160
Who would imagine great enemies like you two would run a bar together?

383
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,076
Let me ask you a serious question. Did you ever really hate each other?

384
00:33:44,962 --> 00:33:46,207
Damn!

385
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:50,270
If you were both single, I'd think you're a thing.

386
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:53,744
Should we tell them? Yeah?

387
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,510
Enough with that!

388
00:33:57,231 --> 00:34:00,339
Pran, are you back for good?

389
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:03,690
No. It's just two weeks off. I still need to go back.

390
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,461
Go back? No way!

391
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:09,196
All you do is work. Korn is gonna give out his wedding invitation before us.

392
00:34:09,196 --> 00:34:10,923
- Really?
- No.

393
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:14,591
That's why your Facebook timeline seems so sweet.

394
00:34:14,591 --> 00:34:17,479
Hold on. My girlfriend wants to study for her master's degree.

395
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:21,040
We just got engaged for now, that's all. You're all making things up.

396
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,840
You're afraid you'd get dumped. Right?

397
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,609
Someone here is studying for a master's degree too and no one bothers her.

398
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:29,680
Or maybe they do and I have no idea about it.

399
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,500
Come on. I won't dare talk to anyone.

400
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,672
You make me post our photos on every occasion possible.

401
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,901
I wouldn't dare.

402
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:40,877
Here. Let me feed you.

403
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,982
Architecture lady over there, are you still available?

404
00:34:46,982 --> 00:34:49,279
My friend wants to know.

405
00:34:50,136 --> 00:34:54,378
No boyfriend. I only have a husband. It's his dad!

406
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,703
Easy, people.

407
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:03,658
Sit back down.

408
00:35:03,658 --> 00:35:05,323
Does this happen all the time?

409
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:06,854
Aren't you going to help him?

410
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,649
He's a badass.

411
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:10,224
These two faculties again.

412
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:13,689
They broke tons of the tables the last time.

413
00:35:13,689 --> 00:35:15,156
I'm so done.

414
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:18,117
It's like we bought this place just to make amends.

415
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:20,217
Right.

416
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:23,595
Guys, I don't mind if you want to fight.

417
00:35:23,595 --> 00:35:26,916
But you must get a lover out of the fight, just like me.

418
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,916
Guys, don't listen to him.

419
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,571
It isn't worth trying if you end up with a lover like him.

420
00:35:30,571 --> 00:35:31,968
Pran.

421
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,000
Yes, sir.

422
00:35:35,547 --> 00:35:37,955
They're being lovey-dovey again.

423
00:35:37,955 --> 00:35:40,358
Let's see this couple instead.

424
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:41,651
Give us the love shot.

425
00:35:41,651 --> 00:35:44,042
I'm starting to take it seriously now.

426
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:46,363
Good. I already took you seriously a long time ago.

427
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:49,172
- Did you record them?
- I did.

428
00:35:49,172 --> 00:35:52,430
- Send it to me.
- Delete it. Right now.

429
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:57,200
I'd like to go to one more place.

430
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,027
I missed this place so bad.

431
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:03,269
You always ordered three wontons.

432
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:06,092
Why four this time?

433
00:36:06,092 --> 00:36:08,395
I'll have three just the same.

434
00:36:08,395 --> 00:36:13,025
But I know there's a dog that always steals my food.

435
00:36:13,025 --> 00:36:16,636
Now, that's my all-time rival.

436
00:36:21,203 --> 00:36:22,601
Let's talk about you.

437
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:24,765
When will you stop eating so loud?

438
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:28,742
I could hear it in Singapore when you slurp the soup.

439
00:36:28,742 --> 00:36:32,269
And how many times have you lost your earphones?

440
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:34,418
Do you still have them with you?

441
00:36:35,147 --> 00:36:36,950
Shit!

442
00:36:41,363 --> 00:36:43,363
Enough with the reminders.

443
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:50,200
So, are you going home?

444
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,797
I am. My mom said she misses me so bad.

445
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:55,555
You?

446
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,200
I guess so.

447
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,500
I haven't been home in a long time.

448
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:07,300
I bought your dad a bottle of liquor. Give it to him for me.

449
00:37:08,711 --> 00:37:10,428
Sure.

450
00:37:12,587 --> 00:37:14,506
Eat.

451
00:37:31,002 --> 00:37:33,902
Let's go home.

452
00:37:35,313 --> 00:37:37,555
Good luck, buddy.

453
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:44,240
Hold on.

454
00:37:51,545 --> 00:37:54,028
- You dad might see.
- I needed it.

455
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:56,266
Don't you see the CCTV here?

456
00:37:56,266 --> 00:37:58,141
Go. Get inside.

457
00:37:58,141 --> 00:37:59,928
Go.

458
00:38:02,118 --> 00:38:04,118
Bye!

459
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:12,868
Ink, you seem to have lots of work.

460
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:15,351
A lot, Pa.

461
00:38:15,351 --> 00:38:17,449
- It's okay. I'll help.
- Promise?

462
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:18,755
That's good.

463
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,064
Work hard.

464
00:38:21,064 --> 00:38:24,542
Girls, let's have some fruit.

465
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:25,841
Thank you, Mom.

466
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:28,014
Feed me.

467
00:38:30,774 --> 00:38:35,097
- You want some, Pa?
- I will have it later.

468
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,141
That's Pran.

469
00:38:39,046 --> 00:38:41,033
He's back?

470
00:38:49,634 --> 00:38:52,227
Hi, Pops. Hi, Mom.

471
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:53,584
Hi.

472
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:55,487
Hello, Ink and Pa.

473
00:38:55,487 --> 00:38:56,863
Have you eaten anything yet?

474
00:38:56,863 --> 00:38:58,612
I haven't.

475
00:38:58,612 --> 00:39:00,452
But can I get a hug first?

476
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:02,859
- Of course.
- I missed you.

477
00:39:04,402 --> 00:39:06,103
No hugs for you.

478
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:07,538
What do you want from me? Say it.

479
00:39:07,538 --> 00:39:09,377
Nothing.

480
00:39:09,377 --> 00:39:11,944
My friend just got back from abroad.

481
00:39:11,944 --> 00:39:15,197
He bought this for you.

482
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,873
Mom.

483
00:39:23,641 --> 00:39:25,395
Let's see.

484
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:28,386
Wow! Imported liquor.

485
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:30,524
I want to try.

486
00:39:31,014 --> 00:39:32,658
If nobody wants it, it's mine then.

487
00:39:32,658 --> 00:39:34,164
I want to try it, too.

488
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,498
You got it.

489
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,066
Can I drink it, too?

490
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:37,917
- Yeah?
- Yes.

491
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,977
I want some too because I've grown up.

492
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,984
- You, take it slow.
- I'll take care of her.

493
00:39:41,984 --> 00:39:45,730
- And what else do we have?
- I think there are snacks.

494
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,341
They're mouth-watering.

495
00:39:50,694 --> 00:39:53,987
- Here, for you. Eat a little more.
- I'm full.

496
00:39:53,987 --> 00:39:57,070
- That's all you ate?
- I'm full. My plate is almost empty.

497
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,593
Pa, let me get you some eggplant.

498
00:39:59,593 --> 00:40:01,759
You should eat yours. You haven't touched what I gave you.

499
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:03,274
It's Ink's then.

500
00:40:03,274 --> 00:40:05,599
Stop giving people food. Eat what's on your plate.

501
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,756
- I've eaten a lot.
- You didn't eat the food I gave you.

502
00:40:08,756 --> 00:40:12,710
Pops, do you remember the university bus stops I told you about?

503
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,751
Yes.

504
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:16,872
The project is now approved.

505
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,422
I'm waiting for LogTech to approve the final quotation.

506
00:40:20,422 --> 00:40:22,286
That's great.

507
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,125
We need to celebrate.

508
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:26,670
Yes! Pa, go get it.

509
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,470
She's fast.

510
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,236
Who wants to have a sip?

511
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:32,383
- Here we go.
- All right.

512
00:40:33,703 --> 00:40:35,137
Can I have some, too?

513
00:40:35,137 --> 00:40:36,786
No problem. We must celebrate tonight.

514
00:40:36,786 --> 00:40:38,473
Can I get a sip, too?

515
00:40:38,473 --> 00:40:41,462
Drink your water, Pa.

516
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,832
Come on, Pops. Let's wash the food down.

517
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,609
Fine, I'll drink alone.

518
00:40:59,977 --> 00:41:01,725
Share some.

519
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:05,066
Drink your water.

520
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,950
My customer is calling.

521
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,477
I'll be back to clean the dishes. I need to take this call.

522
00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:13,825
That's okay. I'll clean them.

523
00:41:13,825 --> 00:41:16,490
Now that's my little sister!

524
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,020
Hello?

525
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,175
He's always like this. Right?

526
00:41:19,175 --> 00:41:22,080
He made me do everything when we shared the dorm.

527
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,501
He made me wash his boxers, too.

528
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:24,880
Come on!

529
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,185
Let it go, Pa.

530
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:28,907
Here, let me help.

531
00:41:28,907 --> 00:41:30,404
That's great.

532
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:34,738
It's like we have two daughters now, Pa.

533
00:41:36,491 --> 00:41:38,791
Here.

534
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,174
Mom, the tower I designed is being built right at Marina Bay.

535
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:30,986
- Really?
- It's a new landmark.

536
00:42:30,986 --> 00:42:33,047
That's wonderful.

537
00:42:33,047 --> 00:42:37,018
How cool, my son! You're now famous.

538
00:42:37,018 --> 00:42:39,420
He's going to up his pay grade now.

539
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,086
That's right.

540
00:42:41,086 --> 00:42:43,115
You're top of the list now.

541
00:42:43,115 --> 00:42:45,570
I'm not that great.

542
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,863
By the way, do you want some mango?

543
00:42:47,863 --> 00:42:51,565
Chai visited the other day and brought us some. They are so yummy.

544
00:42:51,565 --> 00:42:54,407
Sure. Mangos are expensive there.

545
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:56,857
- Coming right up.
- How is Chai anyways?

546
00:42:56,857 --> 00:42:58,693
He's doing great.

547
00:42:58,693 --> 00:43:01,789
His kid is adorable.

548
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:03,576
It's a shame you didn't get to meet them.

549
00:43:03,576 --> 00:43:06,965
Dad, do you know where my guitar is?

550
00:43:06,965 --> 00:43:09,220
Here you go.

551
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,280
It's probably in storage.

552
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,280
- What?
- Nothing.

553
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,480
- What are you two whispering about?
- Nothing.

554
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,394
Is it good? Dip it in the sauce.

555
00:43:19,394 --> 00:43:21,815
- Don't you want some?
- I'll have it later.

556
00:43:21,815 --> 00:43:25,645
Let me go make the bed for you first.

557
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,992
You two have fun.

558
00:43:27,992 --> 00:43:31,209
- Don't gossip about me.
- Of course not.

559
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:34,776
I think it's still in the same place. I haven't seen it in a while.

560
00:43:34,776 --> 00:43:36,560
She didn't throw it away, did she?

561
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,094
Don't think so. You need to check.

562
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:41,214

Let it go. You've started to have grey hair all over now.

579
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,445
I haven't done it in such a long time.

580
00:47:59,445 --> 00:48:01,332

You're saying it as if I can use this expressway all my life.

Yes, and you need to pay the fee all your life.

If not you, I won't allow anyone else to use it.

Or maybe... Wai has used it before.

Aren't you really going to let me spend the night?

608
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:10,372
Come on. My mom is here.

609
00:50:10,372 --> 00:50:12,151
I know.

610
00:50:12,151 --> 00:50:16,138
I took a detour in and I can take a detour out.

611
00:50:34,181 --> 00:50:35,705
Pat.

612
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,719

Hello, there.

00:50:51,797 --> 00:50:54,406
Hello. Who's there?

615
00:50:55,944 --> 00:50:59,760
Just a friend, buddy.

616
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,421
Are you really just a friend, buddy?

617
00:51:04,421 --> 00:51:11,057
That's right. Because you don't tell anyone I'm your boyfriend.

618
00:51:11,057 --> 00:51:14,611
What? Did you say boyfriend?

619
00:51:14,611 --> 00:51:16,560
Yes, buddy.

- My birthday.
- 23rd of April.

628
00:51:56,508 --> 00:51:57,850
My favorite drink.

629
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:00,022
Iced milk tea. It's my favorite, too.

630
00:52:00,022 --> 00:52:01,729
The first sport we competed in.

631
00:52:01,729 --> 00:52:04,490
Musical chairs in kindergarten.

632
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:06,490
The first song I learned the chords.

633
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,895
"Farewell Party" by So Cool.

634
00:52:07,895 --> 00:52:10,418
- The first song we sang together.
- "Just Friends".

635
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:14,200
Wrong. It's the national anthem, in kindergarten.

636
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,391
You count that, too?

637
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:20,736
Where was I born?

638
00:52:20,736 --> 00:52:23,411
What's my zodiac sign? What's my GPA?

639
00:52:23,411 --> 00:52:25,147
Drink up.

640
00:52:25,147 --> 00:52:27,059
Do it. More.

641
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:29,705
That's it.

642
00:52:34,911 --> 00:52:37,625
Let's stop here before we're completely wasted.

643
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:39,333
I can't anymore.

644
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:41,336
Should we change the rule?

645
00:52:41,336 --> 00:52:42,800
How?

646
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,430
You give the wrong answer, you get kissed on the cheek.

647
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:48,483
Sure. Bring it on.

648
00:52:49,746 --> 00:52:52,977
The first time I slept over in your room, what's the date?

649
00:52:53,645 --> 00:52:54,737
12th.

650
00:52:54,737 --> 00:52:56,209
What? No!

651
00:52:56,209 --> 00:52:58,136
It's the 24th of April.

652
00:53:02,589 --> 00:53:04,689
Where was I born?

653
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,660

Did you hear that?

664
00:53:46,412 --> 00:53:49,577
Hear what? Did someone knock on the door?

665
00:53:49,577 --> 00:53:52,321
No. It's a song.

666

Correct.

Punish me.

Quickly.

675
00:54:29,382 --> 00:54:32,641
I'm cruel. Sure you can handle me?

676

Please make me beg for my life.

Do it.

Legs up.

682
00:54:59,995 --> 00:55:01,780
Close your eyes.

683
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:04,089
I need to close my eyes, too?

684
00:55:04,636 --> 00:55:07,596
Ouch! Pran!

685
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:10,158
Come on. Beg for your life.

686

Call me very nicely.

692
00:55:23,251 --> 00:55:26,594
Pran, we can't let it end like this.

693
00:55:26,594 --> 00:55:30,481
What should you call me?

694
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:32,213
Do it.

695
00:55:32,213 --> 00:55:33,896
Baby.

696
00:55:33,896 --> 00:55:36,795
You can't let it end like this, Baby.

697
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,450
Is that so?

This is how you like it?

Ouch! My leg.

703
00:55:54,169 --> 00:55:57,388
Not like this. Get off me.

704
00:55:58,194 --> 00:56:00,660
Calm down.

705
00:56:09,635 --> 00:56:12,391
It's the kitchen. Pran, it's not a porn!

Pran, not like this!
