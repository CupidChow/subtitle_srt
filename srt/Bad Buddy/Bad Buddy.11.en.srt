1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:01,378
I like you!

2
00:00:01,378 --> 00:00:03,537
- Louder!
- I love only you!

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,985
I'm head over heels for you!

4
00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:10,681
What's the conflict between him and the next door?

5
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:12,943
The business, I guess.

6
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:15,597
If they were really close,

7
00:00:15,597 --> 00:00:19,753
then do you know why they fought and haven't got along up until now?

8
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:23,890
There are a few kinds of problems teenagers have. And it's mostly about love.

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,622
What's going on between you two?

10
00:00:25,622 --> 00:00:27,753
We're just playing around.

11
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:29,801
Do you think I'm so stupid?

12
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:32,346
Uncle, please calm down.

13
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:34,455
We are boyfriends.

14
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:37,078
Have you forgotten to save my reputation?

15
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,371
Is it even my job to be responsible for your feelings?

16
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,233
Let's get away from here.

17
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,580
I'm sorry for what Pa did.

18
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,423
Enough already. It isn't your fault.

19
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:09,157
Do you think your mom will ever forgive my dad?

20
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:14,751
If you were her, would you?

21
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:26,922
We can't change what happened.

22
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:29,036
We can just live with it.

23
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:34,890
If you want to, go ahead.

24
00:01:35,823 --> 00:01:38,226
I will not live with it.

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,680
What are you going to do, then?

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,151
Run away to a place where there's only us.

27
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:57,491
Do you think they will allow that?

28
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:06,345
Our parents won't.

29
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:14,167
But some people might.

30
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:40,049
Just get some sleep.

31
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,130
[Bad Buddy Series]

32
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:55,652
A zero-waste village.

33
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:00,866
Just the place for us.

34
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:17,159
Put it in the trash bin.

35
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:19,496
I will.

36
00:04:32,284 --> 00:04:35,902
I messaged Pa so she won't be worried.

37
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,613
What are you doing?

38
00:04:48,362 --> 00:04:51,562
No one can bother us now.

39
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:53,407
You should do it, too.

40
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,819
Are you serious?

41
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:57,624
Scared?

42
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:15,559
Hey!

43
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:25,827
Your turn now.

44
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,896
Don't you want to be free?

45
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,999
What are you laughing at?

46
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,872
You dummy. Did you really think that I threw it away?

47
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:01,624
Shit, Pat!

48
00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:03,554
Shit!

49
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:10,218
And did you really think I didn't know you?

50
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:16,924
Right. I spent a lot on this auspicious phone number.

51
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:24,470
Being with you...

52
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:27,844
already feels like freedom.

53
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:36,958
Screw them!

54
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:41,429
Screw them!

55
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:46,565
I like you!

56
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:51,801
Yes! I like you, too!

57
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,277
We just like each other. Does anyone have a problem?

58
00:06:58,107 --> 00:07:03,007
Right. We like each other. Why does it bother anyone?

59
00:07:12,623 --> 00:07:14,230
Hey!

60
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:25,225
Should we tell Uncle Tong we ran away from home?

61
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,466
If you were him,

62
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:32,200
would you want to get involved with other people's family issues?

63
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:35,240
But we shouldn't lie to him.

64
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,436
- I'm not going.
- Junior.

65
00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:39,602
I don't want to leave. Can't you just talk to her for me?

66
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:43,154
Are we going over this again? You can visit again later.

67
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:44,862
Junior!

68
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,047
Hello.

69
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:51,007
Who are you guys?

70
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:53,205
Do you remember us?

71
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:56,091
Hold on. I've welcomed so many students here.

72
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,783
Ah!

73
00:07:58,783 --> 00:08:02,172
You two with the Architecture camp last year. Right?

74
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:04,628
That's right.

75
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:06,987
And what brought you here again?

76
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:12,707
We're on vacation. Just finished with the exams.

77
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:14,957
So you're traveling.

78
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:19,420
That's all you have on this trip? Don't you have a backpack at all?

79
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,976
We left it on the bus by accident.

80
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:30,159
Come on. Stop lying to him.

81
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,000
Actually, we have a problem. That's why...

82
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,981
All right.

83
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:42,413
Teenagers come to the beach to get hot or get healed.

84
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:44,273
Mostly for these two reasons.

85
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:49,159
Do you have a place to stay yet?

86
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,309
Not yet, Uncle. Do you have any recommendations?

87
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:56,000
A place with food.

88
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,460
- And it would be nice if we had air-con, too.
- With air-con?

89
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,193
- But don't suggest anywhere expensive.
- Not expensive?

90
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:04,912
Anything else?

91
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:07,228
That's all.

92
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:10,898
I know a place. They even serve you beers.

93
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:13,546
Interested?

94
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:15,294
Where is that?

95
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:16,833
My place.

96
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:20,107
Are you okay with that?

97
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:22,261
- We are.
- Follow me then.

98
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:26,503
Junior, are you coming?

99
00:09:27,261 --> 00:09:28,303
Junior.

100
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:30,500
Let's go, Junior.

101
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,070
Does he even remember us?

102
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,970
Never mind him.

103
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,580
Uncle, do you play guitar too?

104
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,054
You can play.

105
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,013
Come and eat.

106
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:49,583
It's okay. I just didn't see it the last time I was here.

107
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,037
People from a volunteer camp forgot to take it back.

108
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:56,808
So I just leave it there in case someone wants to play.

109
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:58,257
Where is Junior?

110
00:09:58,257 --> 00:10:01,347
Junior, time to eat.

111
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:05,289
Mr. Junior.

112
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,198
Time to eat.

113
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:11,425
Junior, come on.

114
00:10:11,425 --> 00:10:13,934
Long time no see.

115
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:17,667
Have a seat.

116
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:20,437
Don't you want to sit down?

117
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:27,003
What's the matter with him?

118
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:30,259
He's mad at me.

119
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:32,257
His mother is taking him back to Bangkok.

120
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,493
Doesn't he live here?

121
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:36,280
No.

122
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,489
His mom usually leaves him with me on school breaks.

123
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:45,740
This time, she'll fetch him sooner as she's transferring him to a new school.

124
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,128
But he said he could just stay and study online.

125
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:53,603
So he's sulking because he wants to stay longer. Right?

126
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:59,740
He's been mad at me for a week already.

127
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,260
- A week?
- Yes.

128
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,060
Give him time. He's a kid. He'll be over it soon.

129
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,670
I get him. I was like this all the time as a kid.

130
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:13,365
Does he really think I want him to leave?

131
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:15,956
He's so dramatic.

132
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,217
Now what?

133
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:21,098
He's sulking. I'm sorry!

134
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,460
You can always come visit.

135
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,709
Don't make such a big deal out of it, Junior.

136
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,988
Come and sit with us.

137
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:36,647
Come on in.

138
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:44,406
So? Do you like it?

139
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:47,958
Totally. Thank you so much, Uncle.

140
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,408
Make yourself at home.

141
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:55,253
Nobody uses this room. You guys can have it.

142
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:56,421
Sure.

143
00:11:56,421 --> 00:11:59,894
If you need our help with anything, please let us know.

144
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:02,997
You're so kind to give us a place to stay for free.

145
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:05,435
Don't be ridiculous. Nothing in this world comes for free.

146
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:07,557
I never said I'd let you stay rent-free.

147
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:13,076
Get up at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. You two will help my pals fish.

148
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:14,974
They need extra hands.

149
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:17,474
- No problem.
- Of course.

150
00:12:17,474 --> 00:12:19,297
Okay. Take it.

151
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:20,807
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

152
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:25,615
Clean yourselves up and go to bed. I'll see you tomorrow.

153
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:30,730
I'll make you work your asses off for the rent.

154
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,482
- There's no such thing that comes for free.
- That's right. Good night.

155
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:36,278
Good night.

156
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:38,778
Good night, Uncle.

157
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:46,670
Can I just go home now?

158
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:54,103
I'm exhausted.

159
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,386
But...

160
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,310
I still have the energy to do something else.

161
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,540
To do what?

162
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:17,369
To be clingy.

163
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:31,986
It's like we're on our honeymoon.

164
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,572
Don't be silly.

165
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:43,327
Well, we have the sun, the breeze, the sea,

166
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:45,880
you, and me.

167
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
What more could we ask for?

168
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:57,045
Do you think they are looking for us?

169
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,765
Can we not talk about this?

170
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:07,565
I am sorry.

171
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:13,042
How about this?

172
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,076
We play a game.

173
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:19,609
Whoever talks about our parents first loses.

174
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:23,033
Are you crazy?

175
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:26,040
You can't sleep at night if you don't get to compete. Right?

176
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,347
Why? Are you afraid to lose?

177
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:31,484
I am not.

178
00:14:32,258 --> 00:14:33,945
Deal?

179
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,411
Deal.

180
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:41,144
Get your head off me. It's such a heavy head.

181
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:44,751
Of course, because you're always in my head.

182
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:51,160
Go take a shower.

183
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,107
It really is heavy.

184
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:58,395
Uncle Pian.

185
00:14:58,395 --> 00:15:00,265
Hey, Junior.

186
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,912
I'm bringing you extra hands.

187
00:15:03,912 --> 00:15:06,405
Come on in.

188
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,335
- I am Pran and this is Pat.
- Step in, young men.

189
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:12,818
You can let them do it.

190
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:13,976
Try this.

191
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:16,445
- Please teach me how to do it.
- Of course.

192
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:18,832
Try to hold it like this.

193
00:15:18,832 --> 00:15:20,159
Then we fold it.

194
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,323
Then, we do it again.

195
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:27,212
Do not let them get tangled. Try to maintain the length.

196
00:15:27,212 --> 00:15:29,786
Like this?

197
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,428
Please excuse a newbie.

198
00:15:36,428 --> 00:15:39,922
It's okay. You'll be a pro in no time.

199
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,302
Here, this is your wage.

200
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:46,410
Thank you.

201
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,840
I'll get going now. See you around.

202
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,390
- Sure.
- Thank you, Uncle.

203
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,226
See you.

204
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:58,938
Hey, we don't get paid with money.

205
00:16:58,938 --> 00:17:01,482
- What are we going to do?
- Cook it, of course.

206
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:03,929
Or do you want to eat raw fish?

207
00:17:05,294 --> 00:17:07,501
Our biggest achievement.

208
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:11,060
We caught it ourselves. Then we'll cook and eat it ourselves.

209
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:15,117
Come on, let's go.

210
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,680
- You hold it.
- No.

211
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,846
- It's heavy.
- No.

212
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:24,215
How is it going?

213
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:27,524
Scaling a fish isn't that hard.

214
00:17:27,524 --> 00:17:31,790
I don't trust you. Go help him.

215
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:34,771
Put it down.

216
00:17:36,949 --> 00:17:38,731
How do I start?

217
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:39,988
Ask him. He will tell you.

218
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:41,937
Where to start, Junior?

219
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,863
- Put these chilies in the mortar.
- What chilies?

220
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:48,183
These. Add the whole thing.

221
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:55,992
Can you cook at all?

222
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,566
No, I can't.

223
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:03,176
My lover always cooks for me.

224
00:18:03,176 --> 00:18:06,822
All I do is eat.

225
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:08,980
I feel sorry for your lover.

226
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,884
Don't.

227
00:18:10,884 --> 00:18:14,050
Because I do many things for my lover, too.

228
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,872
Like what?

229
00:18:15,872 --> 00:18:19,767
Wait until you're older. I'll tell you then.

230
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:22,063
Why can't you tell me now?

231
00:18:22,063 --> 00:18:24,891
Why so many questions? Here. Slice a cucumber.

232
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:26,891
Do you know?

233
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:28,782
I do.

234
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:30,957
But it's a secret.

235
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,147
I'm sorry.

236
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:34,934
Junior!

237
00:18:34,934 --> 00:18:37,095
I'm just kidding.

238
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:46,735
You don't have to pound it so hard. Cover it with your hand.

239
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:48,638
It's spattering.

240
00:18:48,638 --> 00:18:52,178
Here we go. It's ready.

241
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:58,203
And that is this week's main ingredient, Uncle Pian's fish!

242
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,606
Give it here. Let me scale it for you.

243
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:11,362
You're not so good yourself.

244
00:19:17,248 --> 00:19:20,784
Wow! I'm awesome.

245
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:25,847
Hold the pan.

246
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:28,841
Okay. You hold the shield. I'll hold the sword.

247
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:30,698
Flip it over.

248
00:19:33,436 --> 00:19:35,439
Can you eat spicy food, Junior?

249
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:38,454
I can. My mom always makes spicy salads.

250
00:19:38,454 --> 00:19:41,194
You'll like this then.

251
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:44,890
Madam Dissaya's special sauce. It's the chef's kiss.

252
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,347
You're a good cook, too.

253
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,171
My mom is the best. I was always her kitchen assistant.

254
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:53,771
Yes?

255
00:19:57,277 --> 00:20:00,288
Is the sauce finished?

256
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,192
It is.

257
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:05,717
Can I taste it?

258
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:11,260
- Feed me.
 - (Junior is here.)

259
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,434
Junior, take the weapons.

260
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,480
Feed me.

261
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:30,127
- Is it spicy?
- I know you don't like spicy food.

262
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:36,492
Damn! It's spicy.

263
00:20:36,492 --> 00:20:38,234
Water!

264
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,400
Is it that hot?

265
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,739
I didn't add that many chilies.

266
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:51,762
But you just fed me a whole chili.

267
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,124
Ah! I'm so stuffed.

268
00:20:57,124 --> 00:21:00,355
How did you like Madam Dissaya's sauce, Junior?

269
00:21:00,355 --> 00:21:01,627
It was pretty hot.

270
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,331
- Was it too hot?
- No.

271
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:06,378
You could handle it?

272
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:08,710
Hey, dude!

273
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,431
Play me a song.

274
00:21:10,431 --> 00:21:11,694
No.

275
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:13,065
Why not?

276
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:15,589
I told you I quit playing.

277
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:17,176
What did we agree on?

278
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:20,235
We can do anything we want here.

279
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,782
- Please. For me.
- Let's do it.

280
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:26,913
One song.

281
00:21:26,913 --> 00:21:28,713
All right.

282
00:21:30,684 --> 00:21:33,252
Wait and see.

283
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:35,152
He seems great.

284
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:43,926
♪ If our love was a song ♪

285
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:47,836
♪ If our story... ♪

286
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:52,175
The landlord is renting it out. You can even have another bar out here.

287
00:21:52,175 --> 00:21:53,995
You will also get this boat for free.

288
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:58,877
So these are the kids that are staying at your house?

289
00:21:58,877 --> 00:22:00,475
They are.

290
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:02,317
Why?

291
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:04,776
He's pretty good.

292
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:09,692
♪ Is love a beautiful world? ♪

293
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:15,196
♪ Something of grandeur... ♪

294
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,024
That's all I can play. I haven't finished the song yet.

295
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:22,942
It's time to go.

296
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,763
Where are you going?

297
00:22:24,763 --> 00:22:27,365
To see people fish at the port.

298
00:22:27,365 --> 00:22:28,986
Do you want to come?

299
00:22:28,986 --> 00:22:30,309
Do you?

300
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:31,947
Sure. Let's go.

301
00:22:31,947 --> 00:22:33,815
Let me put it back.

302
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:39,901
I forgot how to do it. I can't remember.

303
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,716
You suck.

304
00:22:41,716 --> 00:22:43,926
Look at Junior. He's handling it so well.

305
00:22:43,926 --> 00:22:48,492
Uncle Tong said if I wanted to be the leader here like him, I must do it well.

306
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,811
That's why you want to stay?

307
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:55,569
Yes. But my mom doesn't want me to be like him.

308
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:57,906
She said it's tiring.

309
00:22:58,534 --> 00:23:03,370
Don't believe everything she says. Adults aren't always right.

310
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,662
Right?

311
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,882
Ask for his help.

312
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:11,901
I don't know how to do this. Please help.

313
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:16,059
Junior! Junior!

314
00:23:17,324 --> 00:23:19,268
Junior!

315
00:23:19,268 --> 00:23:22,066
Junior! He's running away again.

316
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:23,772
Junior!

317
00:23:27,484 --> 00:23:29,218
Hello, Auntie.

318
00:23:29,218 --> 00:23:31,011
Hello.

319
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:32,905
Auntie.

320
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:39,943
Are you Junior's mom?

321
00:23:39,943 --> 00:23:41,669
Yes.

322
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,303
Hold on. Are you the ones that are staying at Tong's place?

323
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:49,884
We are.

324
00:23:49,884 --> 00:23:54,391
And he also told us about Junior.

325
00:23:56,548 --> 00:24:00,641
Every time I pick him up, he runs away just like this.

326
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:03,788
This time is even worse. He said he wanted to transfer to school here.

327
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:05,705
Look at him.

328
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:08,557
People say stubborn kids are smart kids.

329
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,483
My brother said you two and Junior are pretty close.

330
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:19,983
Can you help me?

331
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:22,930
Can you talk to him?

332
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,144
Please. Help.

333
00:24:26,782 --> 00:24:29,608
We can try.

334
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:32,298
- Thanks a lot.
- Sure.

335
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:36,027
I'm so done.

336
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:39,458
Pat, I'll go check up on him.

337
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,103
It's okay.

338
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:44,176
It's on me. I'll do it.

339
00:24:44,176 --> 00:24:45,940
I'll go get him for you.

340
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,637
- Please.
- Junior

341
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:56,318
- Every single time.
- It's pretty fun here.

342
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:59,475
There are new things to try all the time.

343
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:02,963
No wonder why Junior doesn't want to go home.

344
00:25:02,963 --> 00:25:05,187
It's always fun when he's young.

345
00:25:05,187 --> 00:25:08,294
But it's not easy to get a job here when he grows up.

346
00:25:08,294 --> 00:25:10,620
I barely see his future here.

347
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,518
I grew up here. That's why I know.

348
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:17,501
What if he chooses to stay?

349
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:19,199
We can't take kids his age seriously.

350
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:24,519
And let me tell you, when I was Junior's age, I even wanted to be a pirate.

351
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,916
Luckily, my mom didn't allow it.

352
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:31,966
Otherwise, I'd be throwing a net for a living like that.

353
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:36,799
Or you'd become a famous pirate.

354
00:25:40,186 --> 00:25:44,909
Or maybe I wouldn't have had Junior at all.

355
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:48,432
Thanks to my mom for not spoiling me.

356
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,944
Auntie, when Junior stays here, do you feel lonely?

357
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:03,506
Sometimes.

358
00:26:03,506 --> 00:26:10,972
But I'm more concerned about how well he eats and sleeps at night.

359
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,590
It's a mother thing.

360
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:45,447
How was it?

361
00:26:52,428 --> 00:26:54,160
And Junior?

362
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:57,607
He insists on staying.

363
00:26:57,607 --> 00:27:00,198
What did she say?

364
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,560
She wants to take him back as planned.

365
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:07,506
She's his mom after all.

366
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:28,545
Come on. That's someone else's business.

367
00:27:28,562 --> 00:27:30,881
Let's talk about our business.

368
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:32,594
What?

369
00:27:33,228 --> 00:27:37,655
It's our honeymoon trip. We can't miss a party.

370
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:42,093
There's a bar around here. Uncle Tong told me.

371
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,065
I'll take you out for a ride.

372
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:49,075
All right.

373
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:50,599
You're heavy.

374
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:54,469
It isn't about my weight. You just can't ride.

375
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:56,355
- Are we going to survive?
- Of course, we are.

376
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:57,863
You sure?

377
00:27:57,863 --> 00:28:01,170
Watch the potholes.

378
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:04,034
Hey! The grass!

379
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:07,597
Ride smartly.

380
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,565
It's right here.

381
00:28:14,565 --> 00:28:16,040
Are you sure?

382
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,744
- Trust me.
- There's nothing at all.

383
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:20,763
There is!

384
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:28,345
- Are you positive?
- Just trust me.

385
00:28:28,345 --> 00:28:31,041
Lead the way then.

386
00:28:37,955 --> 00:28:40,155
[We're hiring servers]

387
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:44,641
Hey. Do you want a free beer?

388
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:47,589
Uncle.

389
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,350
We're applying for the server position.

390
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,933
Pat!

391
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:56,183
Are you the guys who are staying with Tong?

392
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:59,042
We are.

393
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:01,469
Can we meet halfway?

394
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:04,985
We work for half an hour, and you treat us beer in the second half.

395
00:29:04,985 --> 00:29:06,836
Let's go half-half.

396
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:10,619
Are you interested?

397
00:29:13,397 --> 00:29:16,080
Your order is ready.

398
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:19,199
This is yours, sir.

399
00:29:20,604 --> 00:29:22,715
Do you want to sell craft beer?

400
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:26,398
You make beer yourself.

401
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:29,928
The job is done!

402
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:33,793
Nicely done.

403
00:29:33,793 --> 00:29:38,550
You just earned yourselves two glasses of beer.

404
00:29:39,303 --> 00:29:41,903
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Thank you, Uncle.

405
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:46,038
Cheers!

406
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:47,283
What are you doing?

407
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:49,987
When the sun is normal, the world doesn't remember.

408
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,051
He can see.

409
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:56,129
Embarrassed? So you're not going to do it?

410
00:29:56,942 --> 00:29:58,529
I am.

411
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,969
That's disgusting. Aren't you ashamed at all?

412
00:30:10,969 --> 00:30:12,851
Let's do it.

413
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:15,560
We're so sorry.

414
00:30:18,387 --> 00:30:19,932
The beer is out.

415
00:30:19,932 --> 00:30:22,723
Get back to work then.

416
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:26,270
They say people come to the beach to get hot or get healed.

417
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,918
I hope this song can comfort you all.

418
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:35,139
Want to join him?

419
00:30:37,113 --> 00:30:40,831
No. He's great.

423
00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:46,058
I have very good news.

424
00:32:46,058 --> 00:32:47,196
What?

425
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:51,534
Uncle Yod is offering us a permanent job.

426
00:32:52,241 --> 00:32:54,559
Really?

427
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,976
Aren't you happy about that?

428
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,576
I am.

429
00:33:00,576 --> 00:33:01,664
Right?

430
00:33:01,664 --> 00:33:06,796
It's good. We can quit bothering Uncle Tong. We've bothered him so much.

431
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,167
Do you want to stay for a long time?

432
00:33:11,112 --> 00:33:12,915
Don't you?

433
00:33:29,415 --> 00:33:35,772
Hey, I just wanted to call my mom.

434
00:33:40,178 --> 00:33:42,181
Listen to me.

435
00:33:42,181 --> 00:33:43,939
I didn't...

436

No.

437
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:48,994
If you want to go back,

438
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,850
why won't you tell me honestly?

439
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,713
It's not that.

440
00:33:53,713 --> 00:33:56,153
I don't want to go back now.

441
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,701
I just... I don't want her to get worried.

442
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:07,775
And I didn't think we'd seriously live here.

443
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:17,557
It's my fault to take it too seriously.

444
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,720

Damn you!

What makes you think you can throw garbage around in a zero-waste village?

448
00:35:21,461 --> 00:35:24,261
We don't have any curry dishes here.

449
00:35:25,622 --> 00:35:29,441
We only have this. It tastes good, too.

450
00:35:31,848 --> 00:35:34,248
Isn't it mouth-watering?

451
00:35:36,713 --> 00:35:38,813
Don't you want it?

452
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:51,206
So crispy.

453

You sure you don't want it?

454

- No.
- Come on.

Don't be silly.

You're lucky I'm even here at all.

If that's what you want to say, just leave.

458

Now you're asking me to leave.

459
00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:33,602
But back then, there was someone who followed me all the way here.

00:36:42,972 --> 00:36:44,875
Well, well.

461

Look! You're messy.

Let's drink our troubles away.

- Are you trying to get me drunk?
- It's good if you are.

485
00:38:52,602 --> 00:38:57,140
I simply want to have a drink with you. That's all.

486
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,053
That's all?

487
00:39:00,053 --> 00:39:05,071
Yes, that's all. But it required so much work just to have this drink.

It's true.

How about we compete just for fun?

00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,810
Speedy quizzes. If you're slow, you drink.

501
00:40:03,094 --> 00:40:06,241
And I want to listen to your music.

502
00:40:06,241 --> 00:40:08,644
I didn't ask about that latter part.

503
00:40:13,088 --> 00:40:15,518
Next question.

504
00:40:15,518 --> 00:40:17,773
Why do you like me?

505
00:40:22,405 --> 00:40:24,232
You suck.

506
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:27,133
You always act like a gangster.

507
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,620
You're answering or picking at me exactly?

508
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:37,151
But a gangster like you always butts in people's business and helps them.

509
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:39,298
I think that's pretty cool.

510
00:40:41,261 --> 00:40:43,176
What about you?

511
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,493
Why do you like me?

512
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:49,565
'Cause you're "a lot" to handle.

513
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:51,436
Now you're picking at me.

514
00:40:51,436 --> 00:40:55,868
You're super picky when it comes to eating, sleeping, even peeing.

515
00:40:56,772 --> 00:41:00,093
And together, we've been through a lot.

516
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:03,728
We've experienced a lot of wonderful times.

517
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:07,552
We've had a lot of awful times.

518
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:12,575
We've looked out a lot for each other.

519
00:41:12,575 --> 00:41:15,182
We've been concerned a lot about each other.

520
00:41:17,512 --> 00:41:20,012
We've been thinking a lot about each other.

521
00:41:23,473 --> 00:41:26,111
And we've been a lot happier.

522
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:33,244
Damn! What a crown-worthy answer.

523
00:41:33,244 --> 00:41:36,286
If other people heard that, they'd be squealing.

524
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,377
Aren't you squealing?

525
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:41,598
I'm fine.

526
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:44,007
Fine.

527
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:48,376
Fine. Here comes the last question.

528
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:54,399
Can I kiss you?

529
00:41:55,702 --> 00:41:58,119
Isn't it my turn?

530
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:00,079
I know.

531
00:42:03,216 --> 00:42:05,616
I just wanted to ask you that.

532
00:42:07,848 --> 00:42:09,524
No.

533
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,288
It's my turn.

534
00:43:40,198 --> 00:43:42,913
I think we've had enough, youngster.

535
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:50,935
Hey.

536
00:43:50,935 --> 00:43:52,961
Was I good?

537
00:43:57,445 --> 00:43:59,181
Yes.

538
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,248
How much do I get, out of ten?

539
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,214
Are you happy now?

540
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,633
So, Junior? Are you coming or not?

541
00:47:04,004 --> 00:47:05,606
So?

542
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,078
If you aren't, I'll just go then.

543
00:47:09,753 --> 00:47:12,880
- Goodbye, Tong.
- Drive safe.

544
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:17,434
What's your decision? Your mom is leaving.

545
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:19,698
Mom.

546
00:47:19,698 --> 00:47:21,719
Fine. I'll go.

547
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,558
Finally.

548
00:47:26,489 --> 00:47:28,840
All right. Let's go.

549
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,680
Let's go.

550
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:34,410
Aw! Come here.

551
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,520
- I'll see you again.
- See you later.

552
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,463
- Of course.
- See you in Bangkok.

553
00:47:39,463 --> 00:47:42,273
When I see you next time, you must be better fishermen than me.

554
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:46,776
Uncle Tong.

555
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:48,183
I am sorry.

556
00:47:48,183 --> 00:47:49,783
Sorry?

557
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,534
What a drama king.

558
00:47:52,534 --> 00:47:54,181
Take it as a souvenir.

559
00:47:54,181 --> 00:47:57,413
Give me a high five.

560
00:47:57,413 --> 00:48:00,290
Go.

561
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:03,560
Let's go, go, go!

562
00:48:03,566 --> 00:48:06,757
- I'll get going now. Bye.
- Have a safe trip home. Bye.

563
00:48:06,757 --> 00:48:08,537
Goodbye, Junior.

564
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,480
Ta-da.

565
00:48:40,673 --> 00:48:43,111
Where did you get it?

566
00:48:43,111 --> 00:48:47,587
I borrowed it. It's for work at Uncle Yod's bar.

567
00:48:47,587 --> 00:48:49,269
Try it on.

568
00:49:01,727 --> 00:49:04,330
Look at you. It fits perfectly.

569
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,544
I'm so good. I knew it'd fit you well.

570
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:09,330
Come here.

571
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,650
Thank you.

572
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:31,372
For what?

573
00:49:33,147 --> 00:49:36,582
For trying to make a silly guy like me happy.

574
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:50,908
I know that... sooner or later,

575
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:53,486
we will need to go back.

576
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:58,429
I know too well.

577
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:05,740
But I just want to stay as long as we can.

578
00:50:09,061 --> 00:50:11,061
To be with you...

579
00:50:12,391 --> 00:50:14,791
for at least one more day.

580
00:50:18,084 --> 00:50:20,580
What are you talking about?

581
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,555
Get dressed.

582
00:50:23,248 --> 00:50:25,415
The bar is opening soon.

583
00:50:29,672 --> 00:50:32,472
Nobody works on their honeymoon.

584
00:50:39,859 --> 00:50:42,359
You never leave me.

585
00:50:44,414 --> 00:50:46,614
You fight alongside me.

586
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:52,091
That makes me feel very happy.

587
00:51:10,921 --> 00:51:16,087
I will let Uncle Yod know that we quit.

588
00:51:19,924 --> 00:51:21,924
Wait for me here.

589
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:25,935
No.

590
00:51:29,265 --> 00:51:32,214
It's our last night on this honeymoon.

591
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,640
I will not just stay in and be lonely.

592
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,382
If we aren't going to work, then let's get drunk.

593
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:44,240
Let's go.

594
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,000
Let's do it!

595
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:53,270
[Uncle Yod's Cafe]

596
00:51:54,014 --> 00:51:55,760
Let me ask you a serious question.

597
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,760
You invited me here because you wanted free drinks. Right?

598
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,274
Of course not, Uncle.

599
00:52:01,274 --> 00:52:04,334
We just wanted to thank you.

600
00:52:04,334 --> 00:52:07,183
Thank you for taking good care of us.

601
00:52:07,183 --> 00:52:08,563
No need to thank me.

602
00:52:08,563 --> 00:52:13,126
You are talking as if you are leaving.

603
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:19,512
What's the hurry? Why don't you stay and help me out here?

604
00:52:20,252 --> 00:52:22,355
Let me make you a drink.

605
00:52:22,355 --> 00:52:23,816
Nope!

606
00:52:23,816 --> 00:52:26,213
That's not my concept.

607
00:52:26,213 --> 00:52:30,021
I use this tumbler for drinks.

608
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,028
Let's go eco-friendly.

609
00:52:32,028 --> 00:52:34,225
He's absolutely a green man.

610
00:52:34,225 --> 00:52:35,488
Of course.

611
00:52:35,488 --> 00:52:37,571
More liquor and less soda.

612
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,691
Coming right up.

613
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,193
Uncle, I have a question.

614
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:46,054
How long have you been doing this zero waste project?

615
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:52,102
This doesn't help.

616
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:55,902
I can't really remember. It's been many years now.

617
00:52:55,902 --> 00:52:58,148
Aren't you tired?

618
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,894
I am, but... I can't help it.

619
00:53:03,894 --> 00:53:09,058
Think about it. People always use delivery service.

620
00:53:09,823 --> 00:53:13,296
For example, you order boba tea online.

621
00:53:13,296 --> 00:53:19,607
You get a plastic bag for the tea, for the boba, for the milk.

622
00:53:19,607 --> 00:53:23,021
And a big one for the whole thing.

623
00:53:23,021 --> 00:53:25,640
You get 4-5 plastic bags for one order.

624
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,203
And what if 100 people order the same. Those plastic bags will be all over the beach.

625
00:53:29,203 --> 00:53:31,321
Why don't you quit?

626
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:36,559
Exactly. You work your ass off here, but people still don't care.

627
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,973
I don't think one man can change the world.

628
00:53:41,698 --> 00:53:43,361
Hey.

629
00:53:43,361 --> 00:53:45,570
- Hey, Yod.
- Uncle Yod.

630
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:50,099
Do you want free beer again?

631
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:54,656
He just won't let us quit.

632
00:53:54,656 --> 00:53:59,025
Uncle, we are so sorry.

633
00:53:59,025 --> 00:54:01,231
We really need to go home.

634
00:54:02,449 --> 00:54:05,346
I'm not asking you to be servers.

635
00:54:05,346 --> 00:54:07,250
Look.

636
00:54:08,463 --> 00:54:10,680
My singer bailed on me again.

637
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,201
Again?

638
00:54:12,201 --> 00:54:15,675
Hey. How about you take on his job?

639
00:54:16,892 --> 00:54:20,195
It's time to shine. Come on.

640
00:54:20,195 --> 00:54:21,788
Go.

641
00:54:21,788 --> 00:54:24,328
They want to hear you sing.

642
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:26,103
Sure.

643
00:54:26,103 --> 00:54:29,173
Let's root for him.

644
00:54:30,952 --> 00:54:33,452
What a sweet night.

645
00:54:55,683 --> 00:54:57,983
Hello there, everyone.

646
00:54:59,605 --> 00:55:03,821
This is the first bar where I've ever performed.

647
00:55:04,488 --> 00:55:09,421
May I please play the song I wrote?

648
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:15,450
So no one will know if I sing it wrong.

649
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,840
Is anyone here without friends?

650
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,021
All my life,

651
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:36,692
I've always been told not to be friends with this one guy.

652
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:43,659
But we all know that forbidden fruit is always sweeter.

653
00:55:43,659 --> 00:55:46,607
From two people who can't be friends,

654
00:55:47,381 --> 00:55:49,581
without knowing it,

655
00:55:50,491 --> 00:55:53,526
we become two people who couldn't be just friends.

656
00:55:57,517 --> 00:55:59,817
I wrote this song for him.

657
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:07,757
♫ If our love was a song ♫

658
00:56:07,757 --> 00:56:12,001
♫ If our story was written into a song ♫

659
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:19,046
♫ What kind of song do you think our couple's love song should be? ♫

660
00:56:20,766 --> 00:56:25,065
♫ Is love a beautiful world ♫

661
00:56:25,065 --> 00:56:29,198
♫ or is it something that seems as grand ♫

662
00:56:29,198 --> 00:56:36,156
♫ as the sky, as the mountains, as the sea, or how much does it have to be? ♫

663
00:56:38,418 --> 00:56:47,098
♫ I think I just found out what the answer to my love is ♫

664
00:56:47,098 --> 00:56:53,450
♫ It's just a small matter that cannot be missed ♫

665
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:59,625

00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:26,436
You asked why I didn't quit what I was doing.

678
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:31,399
What I do might not be able to change the whole world.

679
00:58:31,399 --> 00:58:36,216
But it surely changes my attitude towards this world.

680
00:58:36,216 --> 00:58:41,134
You might think one man can't change the world.

681

But I want you to know that this world can't change someone like me either.

Have you ever pictured what it'd be like if our families weren't enemies?

683
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:06,161
If our families weren't enemies,

684
00:59:12,725 --> 00:59:17,093
they'd be cool if we were friends.

685
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:24,261
They wouldn't have to ask me how well you did in school.

686
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:30,738
I'd be able to enter your house without having to climb through the window.

687
00:59:31,414 --> 00:59:37,260
My mother would welcome you with Madam Dissaya's seafood sauce.

688
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:42,382
Yes. Your mom's food smells so damn great. Do you know that?

689
00:59:42,382 --> 00:59:46,928
You must try her Tom Yum Soup. I'm sure you wouldn't want to go home again.

Pat and I broke up.

702
01:01:00,234 --> 01:01:01,288
Shit!

703
01:01:01,288 --> 01:01:03,397
We broke up.

704
01:01:03,397 --> 01:01:05,540
I'm sorry, Pa and Mom.

705
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:06,820
You did the right thing.

706
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:11,106
Come back to your family. I'm sure you'll meet lots of great people.

707
01:01:11,106 --> 01:01:15,957
We fought so hard back then, but we ended up working together.

708

I really miss the old days.
