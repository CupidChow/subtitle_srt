When did I teach you to lie?

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,920
You've been rehearsing the Architecture play

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,830
and skipping rugby practice. I know it.

Do you think Pat is hitting on someone?

9

How many times do we need to talk about this?

10

About what?

11
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:25,555
Your hashtag #JustFriends.

12
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:28,344
People know you're courting someone on this set.

13
00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:29,905
I'm your boyfriend.

14

If I can't handle this little thing, how can we make this relationship work?

Who is whose boyfriend again?

You're my boyfriend now.

17
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,433
I can tease you all I want.

18
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:42,026
Pat.

19
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:12,238
Wear your tee. You're making everyone drool.

20

Hey.

21
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,730
Where is Pran?

22
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,720
I haven't seen him since we're done.

23
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,679
I'm sorry for going off like that.

24
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:46,302
I'm sorry too for being impulsive.

25
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:54,062
I actually just wanted people to know that I was taken.

26
00:01:55,922 --> 00:01:58,366
Social media is for bragging anyways.

27
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:00,021
- Listen to this.
- What?

28
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:02,101
Is it Pran's voice?

29
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,520
Keeping it between us can be nice, too.

30
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,215
Don't you feel uncomfortable hiding it?

31
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:16,794
Just because I'm not telling people doesn't mean I don't like you.

32
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:18,865
You have a point.

33
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:22,900
I will stop posting anything.

34
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,345
It's fine. Just do it.

35
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:29,814
Aren't you afraid people would find out?

36
00:02:29,814 --> 00:02:31,600
I am.

37
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,452
But I care about you more.

40
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,610
how can we make this relationship work?

Who is whose boyfriend again?

43

You got one shot there. It's gone.

44
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,105
Say it one more time.

45
00:02:57,105 --> 00:02:59,094
I didn't quite catch it.

Fine.

Why are you so damn cute?

50
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:16,952
Are you sure there's nothing going on here?

51
00:03:16,952 --> 00:03:18,750
Nothing means nothing.

52

What the heck are you doing?

Why are you protecting him?

No.

56
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:35,145
Can I hug you? No more virtual hugs.

57
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:36,563

I am sorry.

I need to forgive you, don't I?

00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:10,822
Otherwise, I'm an asshole.

82
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:17,776
It's nice to be someone who makes a mistake. You just apologize and it's all good.

00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:21,934
I didn't mean it that way.

84

I really want to say I'm sorry.

85

I never wanted to hide it from you.

I couldn't say I am dating someone you hate.

Would you be okay with that?

90

Okay or not, I should've been the one to decide.

91

But if I were you, I would tell.

111
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:50,190
I'm not mad at you, but I might avoid coming to the faculty for a while.

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,764
Avoid?

There! See?

133
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:16,906
You did it again.

I can say you dumped me

141
00:12:13,644 --> 00:12:15,776

00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:19,267
I'm starting to get jealous here.

170
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:22,982
Should I be pouty too? So your boyfriend will get jealous, too.

171
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:26,800
- Pat!
- You're nasty. Go away.

172
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,859
Just tell your boyfriend to ignore him.

173
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:32,588
Time will heal eventually.

174
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:41,060
I am so tired.

175
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,297
Stop pretending.

176
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:45,530
Here.

177
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,205
You look like you're dying.

178
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:50,393
Why are you giving me a lip balm?

179
00:15:50,393 --> 00:15:54,436
It isn't a lip balm. It's an inhaler. Don't you know?

180
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:56,675
Here.

181
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:02,950
Who would want to use it after you now?

182
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,130
Very refreshing.

183
00:16:12,426 --> 00:16:14,626
You're cute.

184
00:16:24,055 --> 00:16:27,455
He's been like this all day.

185
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:29,928
When will he stop sulking?

186
00:16:30,884 --> 00:16:33,565
Just let him be. Can I get one more sniff?

187
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,060
[Tinidee: Hotel @ Bangkok Golf Club]

188
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,698
I'll open it now.

189
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:47,565
It might burn my legs. I can't open it.

190
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:48,838
Let me do it.

191
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:50,920
No. I should be the one taking care of you.

192
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,968
You confused the hell out of me. Two people who always fought ended up dating.

193
00:16:56,844 --> 00:16:59,042
He seduced me.

194
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:02,238
Who seduced who exactly? Don't fool yourself.

195
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:07,708
You once said you liked me. Was that true or you were lying?

196
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:11,194
I wasn't lying. I did like you then.

197
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:13,522
It's true. You can ask Pran.

198
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:15,906
- I told him as well.
- Right, he did.

199
00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:18,605
But I liked you, too.

200
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:19,982
For real?

201
00:17:19,982 --> 00:17:22,321
I'm feeling so pretty.

202
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:23,625
As a friend.

203
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,384
What? That was cruel.

204
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:29,033
So when did you two change your minds?

205
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:32,882
I can't say exactly when.

206
00:17:32,882 --> 00:17:35,482
I don't even know for sure when I changed.

207
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:42,185
Maybe I've liked men for so long, but I just realized it.

208
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,756
What?

209
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:48,373
Nothing. You said it right. I haven't said anything.

210
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:50,796
But who knows? One day I might like girls.

211
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:54,242
That's good. Can we call it that I profit?

212
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:55,510
Right?

213
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,139
You're smart.

214
00:17:57,139 --> 00:18:01,309
Me too. I don't mind genders. I like them all.

215
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:03,845
But you can't.

216
00:18:03,845 --> 00:18:06,390
Because you're so whipped for me already.

217
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:14,890
I thought you'd be like, "I'm straight... but Pran is the only guy I like."

218
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:19,449
Now, I do like Pran only.

219
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:21,572
Only now?

220
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:24,865
- Stop it. Who is whipped here exactly?
- He is.

221
00:18:24,865 --> 00:18:26,395
- You are.
- You are.

222
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:28,556
- You were whipped first.
- You were first.

223
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:31,067
- You lost.
- You seduced me first.

224
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:32,683
- You did first.
- You did.

225
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:35,141
No more curry for you.

226
00:18:35,141 --> 00:18:38,052
- Look at them.
- The soup is too sweet here.

227
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,941
To be honest, I'm not used to this yet, Ink.

228
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:44,367
Why? I don't find anything surprising.

229
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:46,285
Just two guys seeing each other.

230
00:18:46,285 --> 00:18:49,674
I don't mind Pat being gay at all.

231
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:54,383
But they'd been fighting ever since I could remember. I can't help being surprised.

232
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,110
Actually, I have never seen them fight.

233
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,405
I even thought they might end up together.

234
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:03,832
I'm happy it's Pran though.

235
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:07,545
But I feel sorry for him for ending up with my brother.

236
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:09,201
No more talk about other people.

237
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:11,839
Are you being hit on by anyone?

238
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,164
Come on. Who said freshmen are popular?

239
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:18,107
My chat app is deserted.

240
00:19:18,107 --> 00:19:20,766
It's just my brother and you that I talk to.

241
00:19:22,268 --> 00:19:26,841
Or maybe your expectations are a little too high.

242
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:34,105
Anyone taller than me is fine.

243
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:37,534
I just like someone I feel comfortable with.

244
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:40,323
And with me?

245
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:44,543
- Do you feel comfortable?
- Of course.

246
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,394
Why?

247
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,183
Can't I hit on you?

248
00:19:56,183 --> 00:20:00,158
Should I get Pat's permission first? Fine.

249
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,010
Hey, Ink!

250
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,884
What a hard brake there.

251
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:06,942
What?

252
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:11,347
Shocked? Are you so shocked?

253
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:14,214
What are you playing?

254
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,242
I was kidding.

255
00:20:16,242 --> 00:20:17,772
Look at you.

256
00:20:17,772 --> 00:20:19,610
Aw!

257
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,490
I'm taking off.

258
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:24,890
Bye now.

259
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,719
Bye.

260
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:42,001
Washing the dishes?

261
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:43,982
Doing the laundry, I guess.

262
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:45,782
I was going to help.

263
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:47,791
Then help.

264
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,620
What are you doing?

265
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,454
Can you stop being a big, clingy dog for one second?

266
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:55,982
Sure.

267
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:57,682
One second.

268
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,843
What's wrong with you?

269
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,614
I'm washing the dishes.

270
00:21:03,614 --> 00:21:04,980
And I'm helping you.

271
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,233
- Your sister might see.
- So?

272
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,664
Does it mean I can do anything if she isn't around?

273
00:21:09,664 --> 00:21:11,660
Let me wash the dishes.

274
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:18,853
What is this?

275
00:21:18,853 --> 00:21:21,401
No more hiding and no more caring about your sister here, huh?

276
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:23,773
Right. Care about her.

277
00:21:23,773 --> 00:21:25,522
Why?

278
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,153
So? Whose room is this?

279
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:31,153
It's mine.

280
00:21:31,153 --> 00:21:33,326
I can do anything.

281
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:38,998
Hey! Your sister is here. Are you out of your mind?

282
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:41,368
- I didn't mean to.
- Bullshit.

283
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:46,150
She's gone.

284
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,259
Let's continue.

285
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:51,112
- Continue washing.
- Your sister is here.

286
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:53,134
Just go.

287
00:21:53,134 --> 00:21:55,732
Go.

288
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:06,536
What are you doing?

289
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:10,283
I just wanted to give you a drink.

290
00:22:19,093 --> 00:22:21,193
Do your best.

291
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,531
Poor baby!

292
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:33,360
Did you accidentally break his pencil?

293
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,420
That's why he's pouting like a baby.

294
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,514
Don't be so loud. He can hear you.

295
00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:38,756
He might never stop being mad.

296
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:43,103
Can't he see? You're trying to make up with him here.

297
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:45,734
That's okay.

298
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:47,866
I will drink it, baby.

299
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:49,837
No.

300
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:52,749
You might whine that I give you a second-handed drink.

301
00:22:52,749 --> 00:22:54,106
No way.

302
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,804
It's good stuff with vitamins.

303
00:22:56,804 --> 00:22:59,311
He's dumb not to want it.

304
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:15,079
What happened to my body?

305
00:23:16,752 --> 00:23:19,052
It's become super energetic.

306
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:22,919
I can't hide it anymore. Take this.

307
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,293
You're exaggerating.

308
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:37,018
It's true. What a great booster.

309
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:38,508
Try it.

310
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:39,911
No.

311
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:41,728
Do it.

312
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:43,924
- Drink it.
- No.

313
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,879
Come on.

314
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:55,097
I feel nothing.

315
00:24:04,648 --> 00:24:06,782
What's happening to my body?

316
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:22,205
Let me have more.

317
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:24,750
That's enough. It's mine.

318
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,683
Fine.

319
00:24:26,683 --> 00:24:29,257
Drink it and you must win the game.

320
00:24:30,551 --> 00:24:34,905
If I win, will I get more than that?

321
00:24:34,905 --> 00:24:39,614
All I know is if you lose, you won't get anything.

322
00:24:42,563 --> 00:24:45,135
- I'll leave it with you.
- I'll drink it all.

323
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:47,090
It matches you.

324
00:27:11,508 --> 00:27:13,674
- What were you looking at?
- What?

325
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,917
- Didn't you see that?
- What?

326
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:18,910
- What a shitty player!
- So what?

327
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,592
- What a shitty player!
- So?

328
00:27:21,592 --> 00:27:22,987
Enough.

329
00:27:22,987 --> 00:27:25,041
Easy there.

330
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:27,306
You're a shitty defender.

331
00:27:27,306 --> 00:27:29,370
And you just stood there doing nothing, asshole.

332
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,245
You suck!

333
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,222
- Enough.
- You got a problem?

334

00:40:38,378 --> 00:40:40,878
Did you just say I was a dog?

505
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,897
Relax, man.

506
00:40:46,255 --> 00:40:50,359
How is this, huh? Keep on badmouthing.

507
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,619
Sorry. He's drunk.

508
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:07,050
Cheers for Pat, our hero.

509
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:11,060
- That's right!
- Lucky bastard!

510
00:41:14,796 --> 00:41:16,897
This thing tastes so good.

511
00:41:16,897 --> 00:41:18,093
So refreshing.

512
00:41:18,093 --> 00:41:22,404
Yes, I am a hero. You guys are supporting actors.

513
00:41:23,925 --> 00:41:25,920
What an ass!

514
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,089
Whoever gets drunk first

515
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:31,367
will have to run around this table and howl like a dog.

516
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:33,711
Bring it on!

517
00:41:36,224 --> 00:41:38,124
Screw the tradition.

518
00:41:38,124 --> 00:41:42,188
Do you think Pat is the first one to have fallen in love with an Architecture student?

519
00:41:42,188 --> 00:41:43,597
Wait a minute.

520
00:41:43,597 --> 00:41:47,396
Don't tell me you have eyes for someone from that faculty, too.

521
00:41:48,748 --> 00:41:51,199
I have a crush on a guy from Architecture.

522
00:41:53,715 --> 00:41:55,416
I'm just kidding.

523
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:57,523
What the hell, man?

524
00:41:57,523 --> 00:41:59,715
Horrible joke.

525
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:02,124
I was shocked for a second.

526
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:12,196
Waiter. I just spilled some beer here.

527
00:42:12,892 --> 00:42:14,929
- Let me clean it for you.
- No.

528
00:42:14,929 --> 00:42:16,323
I want him to do it.

529
00:42:16,323 --> 00:42:18,445
Come here and clean.

530
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:25,090
Let me handle it. Where is it?

531
00:42:29,386 --> 00:42:33,373
You can't smoke here. Go to the designated area outside.

532
00:42:43,365 --> 00:42:45,102
Don't butt in, Pat.

533
00:42:45,102 --> 00:42:48,092
When you got tackled on the field, he didn't give a shit.

534
00:42:48,092 --> 00:42:50,064
Don't poke your nose in his business.

535
00:42:52,175 --> 00:42:53,973
Easy there.

536
00:42:56,705 --> 00:42:59,922
Sorry. Didn't mean to.

537
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,230
Damn it, Pat!

538
00:43:13,681 --> 00:43:15,774
Sorry.

539
00:43:15,774 --> 00:43:17,915
I didn't mean to either.

540
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:21,973
Look who it is.

541
00:43:21,973 --> 00:43:23,768
You don't have the referee to help you here.

542
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,308
That's good.

543
00:43:25,308 --> 00:43:27,917
I can do whatever I want now.

544
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:29,638
Pat.

545
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,543
Pat, go back to your table.

546
00:43:39,815 --> 00:43:41,492
Pat.

547
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,290
That's right.

548
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:13,472
Going home?

549
00:44:13,472 --> 00:44:15,792
You're not gonna get over it, are you?

550
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:17,786
I am so not.

551
00:44:24,502 --> 00:44:27,350

554
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:15,943
Call an ambulance.

555
00:45:15,943 --> 00:45:19,328
- Pat!
- Are you all right? Hang in there.

556
00:45:19,328 --> 00:45:21,776
Breathe slowly.

557
00:45:21,776 --> 00:45:23,636
Pat, hang in there.

558
00:45:23,636 --> 00:45:26,170
Press the wound.

00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,763
Hey, asshole.

560
00:45:48,763 --> 00:45:51,200
Don't panic. Okay?

561
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,104
Stay calm.

562
00:45:53,923 --> 00:45:56,827
Why? Is it that bad?

563
00:46:01,078 --> 00:46:03,278
He was shot.

564
00:46:05,365 --> 00:46:07,765
Go inside and see it for yourself.

565
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,227

566
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:20,297

It was my idea!

00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,384
Jackass! Give them privacy.

What the hell are you playing?

573
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:49,631
I just had a great medicine. I'm fully recovered now.

574
00:46:49,631 --> 00:46:51,045
You are?

575
00:46:51,045 --> 00:46:52,707
How about you get hurt again?

576

Ouch! It's real this time.

577
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:57,562
You deserved that.

578
00:46:57,562 --> 00:46:59,984
You're just fooled.

579
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,584
Korn and Chang said you were shot.

580
00:47:03,994 --> 00:47:08,287
Just a graze wound. A bandage is enough.

581
00:47:08,846 --> 00:47:11,036
Are you worried about me?

582
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,338
Yes, I am.

583
00:47:14,755 --> 00:47:17,196
I wonder why it's just a graze gunshot.

584
00:47:17,196 --> 00:47:19,968
He should have put the bullet in your skull.

585
00:47:19,968 --> 00:47:22,230
You think you're a badass, huh?

586
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,906
You're lucky it's nothing serious.

587
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,486
Hi.

588
00:47:31,486 --> 00:47:34,171
Are you Mr. Napat?

589
00:47:34,171 --> 00:47:38,881
We found a gun on the scene. We presume it belongs to you.

590
00:47:38,881 --> 00:47:43,306
You've been charged with altercation and possession of a firearm.

592

I told everyone that Pat helped me last night.

593
00:48:26,106 --> 00:48:28,006
I heard he's in the hospital.

594
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:29,970
How is he?

595
00:48:30,645 --> 00:48:33,194
His condition is not to worry about.

596
00:48:33,194 --> 00:48:35,194
But he is being charged.

597
00:48:35,194 --> 00:48:37,416
Charged? With what?

598
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:38,919
Altercation?

599
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:40,421
Gun possession.

600
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:43,160
- Gun possession?
- Pat carried a gun?

601
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,756
It wasn't his.

602
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:48,423
They fought over it, and his fingerprints are all over it.

603
00:48:48,423 --> 00:48:53,485
Without any proof to confirm it isn't his, he's over.

Hey! There are CCTVs in the bar.

605
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,021
The police checked.

606
00:49:07,021 --> 00:49:11,453
There are cameras inside the bar only. They have none in the parking lot.

607
00:49:13,672 --> 00:49:18,011
The only thing we can do now is bring those guys in.

608
00:49:18,885 --> 00:49:22,843
They can be anywhere by now.

609

I have a friend who works at the bar.

How are you feeling?

658

You don't need to call us husband and wife.

659
00:54:29,868 --> 00:54:34,305
I'm sorry. I thought it would show that we've become closer.

I am not mad.
