1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,000
Stop!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,120
Don't run!

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,820
Quit running!

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,520
Damn it!

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,900
We're gonna get you, bastard!

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,240
Let's fight fair if you dare.

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,200
What a classic line.

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,929
No. We won't hurt you.

9
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:45,460
But my friend might.

10
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,760
When he gets mad, he just can't control himself.

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,609
We're actually here to stop him.

12
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,780
You should know that I'm helping you.

13
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,340
Oh...

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,440
Bullshit.

15
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:00,333
I'll be outnumbered when I let my guard down.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,880
How about this?

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll give you two minutes.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,370
Call your friends here.

19
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,195
I'll wait.

20
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:43,500
Hey, Pran!

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,300
What?

22
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,450
Sorry.

23
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,962
We've got a situation. Louis is headed there now.

24
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:51,700
He gets himself into a fight every day.

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,768
But Wai is getting beaten up.

26
00:01:56,547 --> 00:01:58,467
Come on.

27
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:00,060
Let's go.

28
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,060
Oh.

29
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,113
Damn it, Pran.

30
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:40,547
This is Pran.

31
00:03:40,547 --> 00:03:41,860
He lives next door.

32
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,340
You're dead!

33
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,300
- No!
- Hey!

34
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:10,268
My dad told me that his family has always been jealous of ours.

35
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:12,899
Our business was a success.

36
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:14,739
So they followed in our footsteps.

37
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:17,707
Good morning.

38
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:22,719
Not just that. They were jealous because my dad had good employees.

39
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:25,245
His dad bought all the employees from us.

40
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,821
Our old customers followed the former employees to the new shop.

41
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:30,600
We almost went out of business.

42
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,860
Luckily, my dad had connections.

43
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,680
Lots of people wanted to help him get back to business.

44
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,840
So, all they could do was continue being jealous of us.

45
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,420
Yes, sir.

46
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,963
This guy with the fierce eyes is Pat.

47
00:04:43,963 --> 00:04:47,932
Doesn't he look like a cheater like my mom said?

48
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,600
We didn't cross over. See.

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,240
There's a utility pole right here.

50
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,020
Yes, you did. It's more than half.

51
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,020
How about we draw a line to solve this problem?

52
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,760
- You want to do that?
- Yes.

53
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,719
Fine! Let me measure it first.

54
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:02,100
All right! See you in a bit.

55
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,320
Look at... that.
- Wait

56
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,125
No one could endure someone like that.

57
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,760
His dad didn't realize his flaws and blamed it all on my dad.

58
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,520
He was involved in bid-rigging to kick my dad out of the competition.

59
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,000
That's why we've been enemies since before we were born.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,920
Please bless me with a handsome son.

61
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,560
Please bless me with a more handsome son.

62
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,680
Please also bless my son with a pretty girlfriend.

63
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,780
Please bless my son with a prettier girlfriend,

64
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,060
someone nice and lacking in jealousy.

65
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,760
We were destined to be rivals since we were born.

66
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,160
Baby, call me ommy.

67
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,272
Mommy.

68
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:41,640
Mom.

69
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,500
- Mommy.
- Mom.

70
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,620
Mom.

71
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,581
Mommy.

72
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:49,729
Up until now, I've lost count of what we've been competing for.

73
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,060
Pran and Pat, don't fight. Stop it.

74
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,460
One by one.

75
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,710
[Bad Buddy Series]

76
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,600
The professor.

77
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,440
These two faculties never stop fighting.

78
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:34,600
Keep an eye on them.

79
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,096
The new chancellor said if they can't live together in peace,

80
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:39,451
they will all be kicked out.

81
00:07:39,451 --> 00:07:41,031
Yes, sir.

82
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,198
I almost got them before the professor showed up.

83
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,260
What did you do to them this time?

84
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,820
I didn't. They started it.

85
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,020
Here's the story.

86
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,720
We were at a bar last night, watching a football game.

87
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,180
They were also there.

88
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,220
We were rooting for different teams.

89
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,898
So, we were mocking each other a little.

90
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:10,960
But our team lost in the end.

91
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Their team played so well.

92
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,721
So I gave them a thumbs up.

93
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:17,221
Hey! What did you just do?

94
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,100
I dragged Wai back to his dormitory.

95
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,860
I thought they wouldn't hold a grudge.

96
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,680
He got beaten up anyways.

97
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,920
Served you right.

98
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,720
I just don't get it, Wai.

99
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,180
Why did you have to mess with that guy?

100
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,120
I heard he was the boss of his faculty.

101
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,940
Even our seniors don't want to have problems with him. Who are you to do that?

102
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,740
I'm not scared a bit.

103
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,900
How about we take revenge in their territory this evening?

104
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,145
Look at the bruises on your face first.

105
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:47,480
You forgot something.

106
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,320
We have Pran, the warrior right here.

107
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,420
Wait a minute.

108
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,160
I have nothing to do with this. Leave me out of it.

109
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,464
I've got work to do.

110
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:58,840
And you, be cautious.

111
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,901
Let your guard down, and they'll finish you.

112
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,073
Pat.

113
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,280
Iced tea for someone icy. Right?

114
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,740
You can serve the girls first.

115
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,960
But I have made the drink for you already.

116
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,480
Thank you.

117
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,827
Drink now, pay later again.

118
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:26,480
As always.

119
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,740
Okay.

120
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,780
I've got bruises all over.

121
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,725
Pat, who was that guy that showed up last?

122
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,725
Do you know him?

123
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:40,160
Just some guy who caught me off guard.

124
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,700
Let's do this.

125
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,120
Let's catch him off guard too, right at his faculty.

126
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,860
Done.

127
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,320
Good idea.

128
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm going home this evening.

129
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,345
But we beat him up pretty well already.

130
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,080
No way! Look at what he did to your friend here.

131
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,957
Can you see my face?

132
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:02,480
Holy shit.

133
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,028
Pat, this cannot end easily. Look.

134
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:06,477
Look.

135
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,112
People are sharing this video.

136
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:14,380
It's the way they are.

137
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,812
My place has just opened after the lockdown.

138
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:17,940
Go fight somewhere else.

139
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,240
Damn. People keep hitting "Like".

140
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,025
Sit down.

141
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:28,167
Hey.

142
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,615
You record a video for me.

143
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:35,095
I'm going to break all their fingers.

144
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:37,919
That's my man.

145
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,520
- Should we do it?
- Yes.

146
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,940
Let's go.

147
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:50,891
Pran, pass me your plate.

148
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:52,200
Smells so great.

149
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,561
Yeah.

150
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:56,907
- Both of you, I did my best.
- Here you go.

151
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:00,820
Hold on.

152
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,197
This meal is perfect for this song.

153
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,940
Right. We can eat now.

154
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,061
I'm going to start now.

155
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:13,761
Hold it, Dad.

156
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:21,457
Good boy.

157
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,660
Why don't you eat that spoon, too?

158
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,118
Brother.

159
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:31,753
Grab yourself a new piece.

160
00:11:31,753 --> 00:11:34,444
Let him have that one. He's hungry.

161
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,257
Chew quietly.

162
00:11:38,186 --> 00:11:39,530
Pat,

163
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,175
your mom told me you were chosen to be the class president.

164
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:44,316
The seniors chose me.

165
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:46,240
It wasn't as difficult as you thought.

166
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,340
Hey, Tiger.

167
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,722
Get your gold medal from the rugby game first and I'll let you brag.

168
00:11:51,722 --> 00:11:53,517
The class president.

169
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,612
Can you handle it since Architecture students have loads of work to do?

170
00:11:57,612 --> 00:11:58,760
That's what I'm afraid of.

171
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,140
But my friends voted for me. I guess I'll have to manage.

172
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,520
Have you paid for the dorm?

173
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,605
I have. I got the keys already.

174
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,233
Bring it.

175
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,253
What for?

176
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:19,100
You can drop by and clean my room when you have time.

177
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,720
It's your room. You do it.

178
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,620
I'm generous enough to do your laundry.

179
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,341
And what happened to your shirt?

180
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:29,132
Ask the guy next door.

181
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,980
I met Pran. We go to the same university.

182
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,381
He's back.

183
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:42,860
So the guy on a motorbike I saw the other day was him then.

184
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,327
Hot, as always.

185
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:47,280
What did you just say?

186
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Do you even know him?

187
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,460
I don't.

188
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,246
What faculty is he in?

189
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,542
Engineering.

190
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:58,222
And he had a fight with Wai today.

191
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,331
Did he hurt you, Pran?

192
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:03,180
Don't tell me he kicked your ass.

193
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,364
Impossible.

194
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:06,465
Who would dare hurt me?

195
00:13:06,465 --> 00:13:07,500
Good.

196
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
People from this faculty are foul-mouthed.

197
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,901
Back then, they always hit on girls from my faculty.

198
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:16,019
I was the one who chased those guys away.

199
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,840
You seem so proud.

200
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,627
Of course.

201
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:23,968
If we get hurt, they get hurt too.

202
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:25,240
Awesome, Dad.

203
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,796
Those punks, the dad and the son. They're of the same kind.

204
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,594
Stay away from him.

205
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:34,616
It's not worth it.

206
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:37,918
If he tries to pick on you, report him to the teacher.

207
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:47,521
I wouldn't have transferred you here if I knew you two would meet again.

208
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,420
Hey! Your trash bin is over the line.

209
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:19,399
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

210
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:22,438
What?

211
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:25,020
There are a bunch of universities to choose from.

212
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:27,860
You think I followed you there?

213
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,360
Huh?

214
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:36,291
Is there anything we do that your family doesn't repeat?

215
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:55,648
Put it back up.

216
00:14:57,928 --> 00:14:59,753
What a mess.

217
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,260
Why don't you put them in a basket?

218
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,248
Hey!

219
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:35,660
Can't you wash your own boxers?

220
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,480
Washing your socks is disgusting enough.

221
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,141
Good.

222
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:41,889
Wash this for me, too.

223
00:15:45,802 --> 00:15:47,800
I hope it wasn't too bad.

224
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,160
Can't you see that footprint on my shirt? So many footprints.

225
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,676
I wasn't talking about you.

226
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:55,047
I meant Pran.

227
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:58,297
Are you my sister or his?

228
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,500
Pran...

229
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,161
I wanted to ask you the same question that day. Am I really your sister?

230
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:06,880
Watch your words. This is why no one cares about you.

231
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,460
Well, we better talk about you.

232
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,920
You guys have been apart for three years, but were brought back to meet eventually.

233
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,139
I call this soulmates.

234
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,018
More like enemies.

235
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,939
Pat.

236
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,700
Promise me that you won't hurt Pran.

237
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,640
Why do I need to?

238
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,240
You know why.

239
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:48,028
I promise.

240
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,096
You can go now.

241
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:51,840
- You gave me your word.
- Okay.

242
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,861
Don't break your promise.

243
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,480
Damn it.

244
00:18:17,482 --> 00:18:18,962
I'm hungry.

245
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,660
Hey.

246
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,760
Have you turned in your model?

247
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,159
He has friends escorting him everywhere.

248
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:37,960
A wise man says true friendship is always staying by your friends' sides.

249
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:42,600
It's not the time for a good quote.

250
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,740
But they're separating into two groups this afternoon.

251
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,520
No one is around where they're going.

252
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,310
We can finish them there.

253
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:54,112
Let's not do it. I don't want anyone else to get involved.

254
00:18:54,112 --> 00:18:55,927
Since when were you this noble?

255
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,760
Are you bullying your friend?

256
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,700
Don't go off-topic. Discuss the plan first.

257
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,950
How about we wait for him at his dorm this evening?

258
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,130
My sister is picking me up this evening.

259
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:08,240
Let's just continue following him.

260
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,100
If we're lucky, we can get him today.

261
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,360
See you.

262
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,860
- Wait until I finish mine.
- Okay.

263
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,337
You two can go to the canteen. Wai and I are headed to the workshop studio.

264
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:21,081
Okay.

265
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,174
Let's go.

266
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:26,240
Hey, Pran.

267
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,940
What?

268
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:33,265
I've seen it.

269
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:35,873
The layout isn't so great.

270
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:39,710
Some characters are floating too high.

271
00:19:40,803 --> 00:19:43,917
That's not what I want you to look at.

272
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:46,517
Look here.

273
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:48,746
"Freshy Day 2021."

274
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:51,546
"The Music of Love."

275
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:55,101
You know I quit playing a long time ago.

276
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,323
Come on. Just one last time.

277
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,970
I know you want to do this.

278
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,886
Ask someone else.

279
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:07,660
A lot of people can play the guitar.

280
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:11,402
I'll go get you an application form.

281
00:20:11,402 --> 00:20:14,202
You can decide later. Okay?

282
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,316
- I'll get going now.
- Hey.

283
00:20:19,413 --> 00:20:22,760
Don't make an excuse not to work.

284
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,071
I can go get it myself. You go to the studio now.

285
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:30,360
Last time, we went to get a coffee we didn't get any work done.

286
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,681
Go wait for me at the studio.

287
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:36,017
Go now. Don't slack off.

288
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:38,150
- Get that application form.
- I will.

289
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,949
Okay.

290
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,170
[Freshy Day 2021]

291
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,488
You guys follow him. I'll track this guy.

292
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:52,068
Okay.

293
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,468
- Don't forget to record it.
- Okay.

294
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,180
Hey. Are you here for the form?

295
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,260
Come inside.

296
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:03,780
Come on.

297
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,800
- Hi.
- Hello.

298
00:22:08,363 --> 00:22:11,717
I'm here for the Freshy Music contest application.

299
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:13,820
Which faculty are you in?

300
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,517
- Architecture.
- Engineering.

301
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:22,179
What genre do you play?

302
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:25,672
Pop and nothing complicated.

303
00:22:25,672 --> 00:22:28,260
It depends on my mood.

304
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,886
I'll get you guys the form to fill in.

305
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:36,977
I've got just one left.

306
00:22:36,977 --> 00:22:40,080
- Wait here. I'll go make some copies.
- Okay.

307
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,260
- Don't leave yet.
- Okay.

308
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:46,677
Easy, guys.

309
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,719
Sorry. They ran out of ink.

310
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:52,380
You two make your own copy. Okay?

311
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,080
Okay.

312
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,180
- Thank you.
- See you.

313
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,907
See you.

314
00:23:56,907 --> 00:23:58,055
Thank you.

315
00:23:58,055 --> 00:23:59,751
You're leaving, too?

316
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,760
Excuse me.

317
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,640
I need a copy of this, please.

318
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,840
Hello, how's it going over there?

319
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,650
Okay.

320
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,180
What are you waiting for?

321
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,735
Calm down. He disappeared into thin air.

322
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:33,936
I'm in front of his workshop studio now.

323
00:24:33,936 --> 00:24:37,154
What are we going to do? My sister is about to get here.

324
00:24:37,154 --> 00:24:40,290
Let's call it off today. Continue tomorrow.

325
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,040
Wait. Someone is walking into the studio.

326
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,661
I think it's him.

327
00:24:43,661 --> 00:24:45,631
Then beat him up for me, will you?

328
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:48,561
- I can stall this guy for five more minutes.
- Okay.

329
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,657
Hey, you.

330
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,225
What?

331
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:59,963
Excuse me. Where did that guy with the form go?

332
00:24:59,963 --> 00:25:02,172
He left a while ago. He told me to charge you.

333
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:03,887
What?

334
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,100
So who did Korn see?

335
00:25:17,704 --> 00:25:20,000
Smile for the camera.

336
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Get up.

337
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:29,640
What the hell is this?

338
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,539
Screw it. They are friends anyway. Beat him.

339
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,628
Don't run!

340
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:03,930
Follow him.

341
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,590
Shit! He went that way!

342
00:26:17,598 --> 00:26:19,642
That way.

343
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,878
What the hell?

344
00:26:43,449 --> 00:26:45,067
Come on.

345
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,960
- What is this shit?
- Come with me.

346
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,720
Pat, get in.

347
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,237
- Quickly.
- What?

348
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,650
- Get in the car.
- Quickly.

349
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,220
Go!

350
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:09,225
Pa, pull over. Drop me off here.

351
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,840
You, get out.

352
00:27:16,362 --> 00:27:18,002
Hold on.

353
00:27:20,048 --> 00:27:21,440
Take it.

354
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,538
Change first so you don't have to tell your mom what happened.

355
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:26,738
Otherwise, she's going to blame it on me.

356
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,320
How about a thank you, jackass?

357
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,680
Did I ask for your help?

358
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:33,720
Look at him.

359
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,040
Don't even start it.

360
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,358
Let's talk about our deal first. You gave me a promise.

361
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,220
So?

362
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,820
I tried, but my friends went for the wrong guy.

363
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,124
What the heck?

364
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:51,924
I don't care. You promised me.

365
00:27:51,924 --> 00:27:55,265
Whatever. Things between your group and his should be over by now.

366
00:27:55,265 --> 00:27:58,812
They're the ones that don't want to get over it. They posted that video on social media.

367
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:01,240
I have to do something. Otherwise, no one will respect me.

368
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,857
Who would respect you?

369
00:28:02,857 --> 00:28:05,157
Are you a student or a gangster?

370
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:09,958
A kid like you won't understand anything about this.

371
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,880
I don't care and I don't want to understand.

372
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,167
But if you still care about me, leave Pran alone.

373
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:21,220
I'm really asking you here.

374
00:28:23,783 --> 00:28:26,080
Tidy it up.

375
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,968
- Where are you going?
- Home, returning the car to Dad.

376
00:28:30,907 --> 00:28:32,567
Do it now.

377
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,802
Brother.

378
00:28:44,802 --> 00:28:46,423
Brother, wait for me.

379
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:48,184
Who gets there first doesn't have to wash the dishes.

380
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,285
I'm the only one who does it every day.

381
00:28:50,285 --> 00:28:52,400
Go faster then.

382
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:57,213
We're here.

383
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,281
You wash the dishes today.

384
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:18,100
This is my territory. I got here first.

385
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:20,160
Brother.

386
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,640
Brother, help me!

387
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,273
Hey!

388
00:29:24,273 --> 00:29:26,157
Pa!

389
00:29:26,157 --> 00:29:28,162
Brother! Brother, help me!

390
00:29:28,162 --> 00:29:30,001
Be still!

391
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,280
Pa, stay calm.

392
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,580
Don't panic. I'm here to help you.

393
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,580
Easy there.

394
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,747
- I'm scared.
- Pa!

395
00:29:40,455 --> 00:29:42,697
Brother.

396
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,320
- Are you okay?
- Brother.

397
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,360
- I'm scared.
- Don't be. I'm right here.

398
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,333
- Don't tell Mom.
- I won't.

399
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:58,080
I'm scared.

400
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,450
I'm scared.

401
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:04,972
It's all right. I'm with you now.

402
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:07,508
I'm not telling Mom.

403
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,460
I come in peace.

404
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,148
Pran, what's that noise?

405
00:31:14,148 --> 00:31:16,328
Nothing, Mom.

406
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,438
I dropped something.

407
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,773
I came to talk about that friend of yours.

408
00:31:33,773 --> 00:31:36,300
Can you just stop protecting him?

409
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,179
Can you stop chasing him?

410
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:40,080
Is it so hard to understand?

411
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,120
Yes, it is.

412
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,398
And I don't want to talk to you. Get out of my room.

413
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,240
Pran,

414
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,080
I came because I don't want to fight you.

415
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,972
Don't you get it?

416
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,471
Not just me, actually.

417
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:04,609
It's Pa who is asking.

418
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,076
But I have to finish this conflict, no matter what.

419
00:32:14,076 --> 00:32:16,092
Can you just back off?

420
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,165
I can't do that.

421
00:32:21,165 --> 00:32:22,866
They are friends from my faculty.

422
00:32:22,866 --> 00:32:25,563
And Wai has been my close friend since before I transferred here.

423
00:32:26,232 --> 00:32:28,652
I can't just back off for you.

424
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,270
Send him over. No one else gets hurt.

425
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,705
I can't.

426
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:55,920
He insulted me. I won't leave until I get what I want.

427
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:04,053
As the class president, I'll take responsibility.

428
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,681
I can't do that.

429
00:33:12,681 --> 00:33:14,082
They are friends from my faculty.

430
00:33:14,082 --> 00:33:16,831
And Wai has been my close friend since before I transferred here.

431
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,900
I can't just back off for you.

432
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,540
Unless...

433
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,320
you back off, too.

434
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,841
How?

435
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,392
You want to save your reputation. Right?

436
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,091
And I want to save Wai from getting beaten up.

437
00:33:34,091 --> 00:33:36,831
If Wai apologizes to you in front of everyone,

438
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,541
will you leave him alone?

439
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:43,256
If he wanted to do that, he would have done so a long time ago.

440
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,180
What if I can make him do it?

441
00:33:53,482 --> 00:33:55,082
Deal.

442
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:09,134
We, Architecture students, take responsibility for what we do.

443
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,098
I am sorry.

444
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:15,951
I'm sorry he gave you the finger.

445
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:17,302
Hey.

446
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:19,303
Don't apologize for me.

447
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:21,803
I was wrong and I'll apologize to him myself.

448
00:34:29,856 --> 00:34:31,569
I am sorry.

449
00:34:37,468 --> 00:34:39,840
If you think you can end this with a sorry, you're wrong.

450
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,516
Get them.

451
00:34:47,122 --> 00:34:49,068
I'm the only one who can hit him.

452
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,840
What's wrong with your friends?

453
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,240
They're as bad as yours.

454
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,100
Things don't end well whenever I'm close to you.

455
00:35:48,653 --> 00:35:51,853
At least, no one will get transferred somewhere else this time.

456
00:36:04,648 --> 00:36:08,128
So, it's over now.

457
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,220
Yes.

458
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,810
He apologized, we threw some punches.

459
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,610
I call it even now.

460
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:21,451
This is not over.

461
00:36:38,724 --> 00:36:40,904
Can I get a bruise remedy cream, please?

462
00:36:40,904 --> 00:36:44,336
I'm sorry. I just sold the last one.

463
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,980
Where are you going?

464
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,333
To get some medicine.

465
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,440
Or are you going to sell that to me?

466
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:32,228
I offered you this cheek,

467
00:37:32,228 --> 00:37:34,986
but you punched me on this cheek.

468
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,360
In your dreams.

469
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:55,182
I just want you to point where the bruise is.

470
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,920
Ouch.

471
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,720
Shit.

472
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,060
What are we going to do about what the professor said?

473
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,741
You're lucky no one got hurt badly this time.

474
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:20,829
So I won't report this to the university board.

475
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:24,694
But I hope this is the last time you fight.

476
00:38:24,694 --> 00:38:27,860
If I see any more quarrels from you,

477
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:33,000
I'll ban both faculties from joining any university activity together.

478
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:39,665
Will our friends ever live together in peace?

479
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:41,340
They will.

480
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,415
But after some drinks, they will fight again anyway.

481
00:38:49,814 --> 00:38:53,895
If we're banned, I won't get to join the Freshy music contest with you.

482
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:57,643
It'll be such a shame if I don't get to compete against you.

483
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,001
How about we avoid confrontations for now?

484
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:07,781
You're talking like I know where you go each day.

485
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,114
- Take my chat ID.
- What?

486
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:15,087
So you can stop sneaking into my room.

487
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,420
What now?

488
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,450
It's like I'm adding you to my friend list.

489
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:39,162
So?

490
00:39:39,162 --> 00:39:42,553
So why do I have to be the one doing it?

491
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:45,013
Don't be silly.

492
00:39:45,013 --> 00:39:47,253
You add my ID then.

493
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,244
Search for each other's IDs and add them at the same time.

494
00:40:04,244 --> 00:40:05,984
Okay?

495
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,800
Okay.

496
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:16,028
"por.Pran".

497
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,539
"PatInwza55+".

498
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,923
What are you laughing at?

499
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:24,768
You're such a kid.

500
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:31,178
Ready?

501
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,030
1, 2, 3.

502
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,052
Someone just added me to his friend list.

503
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:49,805
