150
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,360
Right.

151
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,560
Maybe we can.

Stop teasing me already.

158
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,738
You wouldn't say this if you were the one being hit on.

159
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,090
I got to go. Talk to you later.

160

Don't forget to have some desserts after your meal.

If you were me, wouldn't you want to find out?

169
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,670
Got a point.

170
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,900
Maybe it's a girl.

171
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,980
A girl using a male particle just to test you.

172
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:16,260
Does it have to be that complicated?

173
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,600
You want to meet that person or not?

174
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:26,220
Is he going to think I like him if I show up?

175
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,960
Of course.

176
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,540
You must go anyway even though you don't like him.

177
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,167
What do you mean?

178
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:35,900
If you don't like him, tell him in person.

179
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,460
End it right there.

180
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:43,095
Unless you're starting to fall for his sweet words.

181
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:48,000
Sweetie!

182
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,812
He's being possessive now.

183
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:51,500
Possessive, my ass!

184
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,917
He wants it all for himself.

185
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:56,924
- Eat and shut up.
- Are you sure?

186
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:59,983
I'm going to eat it now.

187
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,158
It's extra sweet.

188
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,347
I'm not sure it's because of the sugar or the love.

189
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:24,030
[Rooftop Exit]

190
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,540
You!

191
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:46,000
Do you live here?

192
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,540
Yes. Don't tell me you're...

193
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,963
Right.

194
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:51,866
This is my dorm, too.

195
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,740
What are you doing up here?

196
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,760
Why can't I? Do you own the place?

197
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,229
You just ruined my good mood.

198
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,300
So... was there anyone here before you came?

199
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,780
No one.

200
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,363
I was doing fine by myself up here until you showed up.

201
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,377
The moon is looking so beautiful tonight.

202
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:31,954
Yes?

203
00:18:31,954 --> 00:18:33,560
Excuse me.

204
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,127
Are you the girl in room 439?

205
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,760
No, I am not.

206
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:43,640
Hi, Honey.

207
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,880
Nothing. He mistook me for someone else.

208
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:55,520
If you don't like him, tell him in person.

209
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
End it right there.

210
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,840
Hey!

211
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,540
What?

212
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,046
The one you're waiting for is...

213
00:19:16,415 --> 00:19:18,015
me.

214
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:22,845
Here.

215
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:29,800
My love story with the Green Tea Girl is ruined.

216
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,146
I knew it. The handwriting looked familiar. I must have seen it before.

217
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,980
I should have realized it, too.

218
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:42,020
Not a lot of people in this world can have handwriting that horrible.

219
00:19:42,857 --> 00:19:47,670
What now? Do you still want to see the moon with me?

220
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:53,609
For that, you're on your own.

221
00:19:55,155 --> 00:19:57,238
What are you laughing at?

222
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:07,279
So does this mean...

223
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,320
I just broke your heart?

224
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,317
Mr. Dumpling.

225
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:14,085
Thank you so much for the dumplings.

226
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,560
You're welcome. Your green tea drinks were very nice, too.

227
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,460
Asshole.

228
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,361
What the heck are you laughing at?

229
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Fine, I'm the heartbroken one.

230
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,944
But why are you here exactly, Mr. Pran?

231
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,367
Damn it!

232
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:04,237
It's all yours.

233
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:11,529
Honey,

234
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:14,428
that guy just gave me snacks.

235
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:17,608
I don't think he's hitting on me. He's a little weird.

236
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,860
Cheers!

237
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,340
Our drinks are out.

238
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:33,347
Aren't you going to tell us what happened?

239
00:21:34,577 --> 00:21:38,612
Your duty here is to drink with me.

240
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:41,420
Is this about the girl across the hall?

241
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:45,634
He's not in the mood.

242
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,100
We need more drinks.

243
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:53,880
I found someone who can entertain our friend here.

244
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,183
Who?

245
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:56,883
Look over there.

246
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,873
Are you bullying him?

247
00:22:01,873 --> 00:22:04,040
And are you going to stop him?

248
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,736
No. I'm supporting him all the way.

249
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:12,480
Wait until that guy walks here.

250
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,120
He's smiling now.

251
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,660
I can tell you're happy.

252
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,520
Wai, will you help me?

253
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
Take this to table 4 for me.

254
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,960
Thanks a lot.

255
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,880
Okay.

256
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:28,453
He's here.

257
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:34,082
Four beers for you.

258
00:22:35,295 --> 00:22:39,435
Thank you, Wai.

259
00:22:40,596 --> 00:22:44,496
Wise men say, "A smile is always better than a grumpy face."

260
00:22:46,873 --> 00:22:48,171
Do you need anything else?

261
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:50,131
Can we have more ice?

262
00:22:53,977 --> 00:22:55,740
I'm sorry.

263
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,540
Slippery hands.

264
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,230
Is it okay?

265
00:22:59,234 --> 00:23:01,214
It's okay.

266
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,380
Clean it up.

267
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,766
Can you handle it?

268
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:06,640
Clean it up nicely.

269
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,940
There.

270
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,840
Right here.

271
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,540
Take that cube, too.

272
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,000
He doesn't seem very happy.

273
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,000
I was just stretching.

274
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,820
What's the matter, waiter?

275
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,920
Hit me.

276
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,920
Hit him right here.

277
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,723
Hit me if you want to.

278
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:29,530
I know it. I know it.

279
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,600
Did you see his face? He was so mad.

280
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,480
They picked on me all night long.

281
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,300
If I see them again, I'll beat them up one by one.

282
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,960
I know you're angry and I feel angry for you, man.

283
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,700
But you can't just repeat that 10 times over.

284
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,780
I need to get it off my chest.

285
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,980
- All right.
- You must listen.

286
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,380
Louis, listen to him.

287
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,967
Help him.

288
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:02,896
I'm having my friends over. Almost there now.

289
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,780
You can't! I'm at my dorm with my friends.

290
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,657
Too late.

291
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,716
What?

292
00:24:12,716 --> 00:24:14,851
Something's up?

293
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,640
Nothing. It was my mom.

294
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,820
When do we need to send the demo again?

295
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,240
Guys!

296
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,880
Should we go to that curry place?

297
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,060
Let's discuss work over a meal.

298
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:31,083
Why don't you just ask tomorrow? Your room is just right there.

299
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:34,343
I feel hungry all of a sudden.

300
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,740
My treat.

301
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,900
Keep your word.

302
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,300
- Yes.
- Deal!

303
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,580
That's my man.

304
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,680
But since we're here,

305
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,423
we should just ask the girl across the hall to come with us.

306
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:54,800
No. I don't want to bother her.

307
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,264
Look, guys.

308
00:24:56,264 --> 00:24:58,463
He's a real chicken.

309
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,241
Damn it!

310
00:25:01,805 --> 00:25:04,305
Hi, girl. Are you in there?

311
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:06,380
Are you expecting someone?

312
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,580
What the hell are you guys doing?

313
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,900
We're helping you here.

314
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,200
It's nothing.

315
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,420
Come here!

316
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,100
Are they calling a puppy?

317
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,500
Something doesn't feel right.

318
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,400
Exactly. We should get it.

319
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,680
Wai, I said no.

320
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,420
What's the matter with you?

321
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,360
Come out here.

322
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,663
Damn it!!

323
00:25:41,663 --> 00:25:43,663
It's a guy!

324
00:25:46,497 --> 00:25:47,860
What?

325
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,160
Damn you, assholes! He's a guy.

326
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,400
Are we done here?

327
00:25:59,045 --> 00:26:01,200
Stop that toxic behavior of yours.

328
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,436
You must learn how to respect people's privacy.

329
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,782
You piece of crap!

330
00:26:04,782 --> 00:26:07,802
But you did that, too.

331
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,100
Let's move already.

332
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,160
Go!

333
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,640
Don't touch me.

334
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,160
Well, hello gorgeous.

335
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,393
Gorgeous what?

336
00:26:27,393 --> 00:26:29,480
Was he the one that hit on you?

337
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,420
Was he?

338
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,469
Yes.

339
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:35,569
He's turning red.

340
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,700
And you met him already?

341
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,000
Why didn't you tell us anything?

342
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,600
How was he?

343
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,960
Is he as hot as me?

344
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,820
Do you want to discuss the song or leave?

345
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:03,135
My friends left.

346
00:27:08,474 --> 00:27:10,494
I think we need to talk.

347
00:27:10,494 --> 00:27:12,240
Same here.

348
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,660
Come on in.

349
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,140
No.

350
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:26,604
Your room then.

351
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:29,383
No!

352
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:31,520
Your room is fine.

353
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,500
What the heck is wrong with your friends?

354
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,360
Sorry about that.

355
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,600
And your friends, do they have to come every day?

356
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,916
Can't you guys just go somewhere else?

357
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:53,856
At least they're not like your friends who knock on people's doors unmannerly.

358
00:27:53,856 --> 00:27:55,850
What do you want to do?

359
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:03,160
This is hard to handle.

360
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,180
We're going to get caught someday.

361
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,240
Things don't end well whenever I'm close to you.

362
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,720
You're right. It was so peaceful when it was just me.

363
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,420
Are you saying I brought bad luck?

364
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,740
When did I say that?

365
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,652
You said I was the cause of difficulties.

366
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:19,160
There was no '"difficulties" out of my mouth.

367
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,600
- You said it was peaceful on your own.
- Yes, I said "peaceful". I didn't say "difficulties".

368
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,340
But you meant it. You said you were doing fine without me.

369
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,900
- I said it was peaceful.
- That's right.

370
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,320
- You're trying to start a fight.
- A fight?

371
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,860
- So?
- You're starting a fight.

372
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,940
- Oh, yes!
- Because your friends are crap.

373
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,123
How could you say that?

374
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:33,343
Damn it! It's not the time!

375
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,240
Pat!

376
00:28:36,941 --> 00:28:40,063
Holy shit! My dad is here.

377
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,451
What do I do?

378
00:28:42,451 --> 00:28:45,160
Go hide.

379
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,303
Where?

380
00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:48,203
Pat.

381
00:28:48,203 --> 00:28:50,140
- Pat!
- Just hide anywhere.

382
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,740
- But this is your room.
- Choose one place.

383
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,740
Coming.

384
00:28:57,295 --> 00:28:59,295
Hi, Papa.

385
00:28:59,295 --> 00:29:02,140
Why are you fidgeting? What took you so long?

386
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,640
I was in the bathroom.

387
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,800
You were in the bathroom for a long time.

388
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,340
Don't be so obsessive. Go play some sports sometimes.

389
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,040
I'm not that obsessive.

390
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,321
Why is it so dark in here? Am I in a cave?

391
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:16,940
As bright as it can get.

392
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,339
It's roomy. Very good.

393
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:20,642
Have you eaten?

394
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:22,107
Thank you.

395
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:24,100
It's a Fish Maw Soup.

396
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,440
I stopped by Chinatown before I came.

397
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,560
Are you taking a Materials Engineering Class with Professor Pichai?

398
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,260
The professor?

399
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,460
Is he your friend?

400
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,460
Not exactly. He's my senior.

401
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:45,220
We met earlier and he told me you will join a Freshy Music Contest.

402
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,816
Good. That's great.

403
00:29:49,816 --> 00:29:51,847
Just safeguard my reputation. Okay?

404
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:54,680
I got the popular vote back in my time.

405
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,460
We're in two different generations.

406
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,760
I know, but you must keep it that way.

407
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,220
The next generation means the better generation.

408
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,336
All right. I don't feel the pressure at all.

409
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,800
I'm not putting pressure on you here.

410
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,820
- But I'm serious.
- Okay.

411
00:30:12,496 --> 00:30:16,420
Nice decoration.

412
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:19,887
What are you looking for?

413
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:21,540
I'm wondering if you're hiding something.

414
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,840
No.

415
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,720
You're looking dodgy here.

416
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,860
You're kidding, I know.

417
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,700
By the way, is the kid next door joining the contest, too?

418
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,320
I have no idea.

419
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,640
I'm sure he will.

420
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,840
Remember when you were a drummer?

421
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,220
He followed you around everywhere carrying his guitar.

422
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,620
What a jealous kid.

423
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,120
They're all jealous of us.

424
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,580
Don't talk about them like that, Pa.

425
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,860
My friend visited the other day and his car was just inches over the line.

426
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,460
His parents were looking at us with green eyes.

427
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,860
I don't know why they need to be so serious.

428
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,060
They're not that bad.

429
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,360
They should have moved away too when their son was transferred.

430
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,600
They're driving me crazy. I'm so done with them.

431
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,580
Please stop.

432
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:14,180
Guess who?

433
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,560
Who else are you talking to?

434
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,617
No, just your mom.

435
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:20,935
She wants me back now. I'll get going.

436
00:31:20,935 --> 00:31:23,035
Don't bring too many girls over.

437
00:31:23,035 --> 00:31:25,080
There's no one. You should go.

438
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,740
- If you do, use protection.
- Go now.

439
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,800
You use protection, too.

440
00:31:40,113 --> 00:31:42,040
- It's...
- That's fine.

441
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,015
- My dad just...
- Forget it.

442
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:49,072
Don't apologize. Your dad was right.

443
00:31:50,915 --> 00:31:55,540
I am sorry if I caused you trouble.

444
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,740
I'm moving out.

445
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,840
Hey!

446
00:32:20,743 --> 00:32:22,296
Wait a minute!

447
00:32:22,296 --> 00:32:25,376
That healthy girl is Pran?

448
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,400
The life of you two should be made into a movie.

449
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,500
Yes, a very dramatic one.

450
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:37,520
He put on a sad puppy face and said I was the reason why he needed to move out.

451
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,736
I'm actually the one who lived there first.

452
00:32:39,736 --> 00:32:42,423
So you think you did nothing wrong?

453
00:32:42,423 --> 00:32:44,723
That's right.

454
00:32:44,723 --> 00:32:47,140
Why are you here then?

455
00:32:49,783 --> 00:32:52,823
You came to see me because you feel guilty.

456
00:32:52,823 --> 00:32:56,263
You feel bad about what Korn and Papa did.

457
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,308
If you ask me, I think you should clear the air with Pran.

458
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:08,768
So things won't end up badly like last time.

459
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,560
There's a music contest on Christmas Day this year.

460
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:41,500
So I'm assigning Parakul to be the vocalist of our class's band.

461
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,280
Okay?

462
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,420
Merry Christmas, everyone.

463
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,860
[Merry Christmas]

464
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,921
This is our new song.

465
00:33:56,921 --> 00:34:00,121
I hope you like it.

466
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,480
Merry Christmas once again.

467
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:18,480
♫ It must be nothing ♫

468
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,260
♫ The way you look at me is the same as everyone else ♫

469
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,480
♫ You worry about me like a normal friend ♫

470
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,380
♫ I'm not thinking about anything ♫

471
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,480
♫ The way you say it like that ♫

472
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,320
♫ Why do you have to be so nervous? ♫

473
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,620
♫ You are overthinking it ♫

474
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:45,900
♫ How do I make sense of what you did? ♫

475
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,660
♫ It's a question that still lingers in my mind ♫

476
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:52,400
♫ Are we just friends or are we more? ♫

477
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,620
♫ What you do to me, and the way you are ♫

478
00:35:34,618 --> 00:35:36,954
Have you heard?

479
00:35:36,954 --> 00:35:38,543
Pran's mom was so furious.

480
00:35:38,543 --> 00:35:41,243
She transferred him somewhere else.

481
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,120
Where is he being transferred to?

482
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,118
Pat?

483
00:35:46,118 --> 00:35:51,240
I don't know. Some boarding school, I heard.

484
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,120
- But where?
- No idea.

485
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,493
He's in this situation because of you.

486
00:35:56,493 --> 00:35:59,680
Right. It must be you. What else can the reason be he got transferred?

487
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,300
What? It's not my fault. It's his mom's decision.

488
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,340
My dad also yelled at me because of this.

489
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,703
Whatever. You're his bad luck.

490
00:36:07,703 --> 00:36:11,023
If it wasn't for you, he wouldn't have to move.

491
00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:26,448
Thank you.

492
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:06,660
Come on in.

493
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,800
Take your time.

494
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,280
I'll be taking care of the contract for a customer next door.

495
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,180
- I'll be right back.
- Of course.

496
00:37:38,275 --> 00:37:39,924
Why are you here?

497
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,360
Because you didn't answer my calls. Why are you playing hard to get?

498
00:37:43,936 --> 00:37:46,398
I don't take your calls because I don't want to talk to you.

499
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,462
I came to say that you don't have to move.

500
00:37:55,462 --> 00:37:57,864
I'll be the one doing it.

501
00:37:57,864 --> 00:37:59,507
Why?

502
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,043
I have my reasons.

503
00:38:02,043 --> 00:38:04,163
I have my reasons to move, too.

504
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:10,071
I don't want to owe you anything.

505
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:12,713
I owe you for saving Pa's life.

506
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:15,733
And that time when you got transferred because of me.

507
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:20,500
Just let me move out this time. Let's call it even.

508
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,720
I insist on moving out.

509
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,584
Because I want you to continue being guilty.

510
00:38:35,584 --> 00:38:38,244
Continue owing me.

511
00:38:38,244 --> 00:38:39,919
Why don't you just get things easily?

512
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:42,823
I'm saying I am moving out.

513
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,980
Get out of my room.

514
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,300
The bed is very soft.

515
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,160
Get out of here.

516
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,961
I'm moving out for you. You go.

517
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:57,840
- Don't make it so hard. Just go.
- No.

518
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,173
- I'll be the one doing it.
- No.

519
00:39:00,173 --> 00:39:01,340
Go!

520
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,900
- I'm staying here.
- Go!

521
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,220
No!

522
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,020
You know I'm stronger.

523
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,280
Oh, yeah?

524
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,760
Fight me if you think you can.

525
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,760
Okay! I tap out!

526
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,380
Pran! Don't do this.

527
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,361
No!

528
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:28,040
It's ticklish.

529
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,940
Don't tickle me.

530
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,804
Pran! Pran! Don't tickle me.

531
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,940
Excuse me... Oh my lord!

532
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,540
I'm sorry.

533
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:57,620
The customer who inspected this room this morning has already paid the deposit.

534
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,580
That means this room isn't available now.

535
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,180
Is there any other room available?

536
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,840
We're full. Sorry about that.

537
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,440
May I please have your cooperation?

538
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,580
Please do it somewhere else.

539
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,620
No, we're not...

540
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,460
Miss...

541
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,620
Damn it!

542
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:41,279
Things are clear between us now.

543
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,104
What?

544
00:40:43,104 --> 00:40:46,140
All the things I owed you.

545
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,300
I did offer to move out.

546
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,385
Though it wasn't a success in the end.

547
00:40:50,385 --> 00:40:52,540
I took responsibility.

548
00:40:53,628 --> 00:40:55,928
What a bizarre logic there!

549
00:40:56,646 --> 00:41:00,866
You still owe me until you move out.

550
00:41:00,866 --> 00:41:03,400
Find a new dorm in the meantime.

551
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,820
I won't.

552
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,740
If I move out, you'll be the one that owes me now.

553
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,906
What? You make no sense.

554
00:41:09,906 --> 00:41:12,540
- You make no sense.
- You make no sense.

555
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,404
I told you I already offered my way out.

556
00:41:15,404 --> 00:41:17,720
Your logic doesn't work here.

557
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,160
- Why don't you just listen?
- You don't make any sense.

558
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,960
- You're the one that doesn't make sense.
- It's you who don't make sense.

559
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,140
Because you didn't listen to what I said.

560
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,700
- Wrong logic!
- Stop saying logic already and listen up.

561
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,703
Your way out doesn't work.

562
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:30,783
Can we end this or not?

563
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,880
You deserved that, asshole.

564
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,780
How dare you to close the doors, jackass?

565
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,720
- Or what?
- This is how you want it?

566
00:41:42,721 --> 00:41:45,201
Fine! Bring it on.

567
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:48,880
- You asked for it.
- Damn it! No! No! Pat!

568
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,460
No!

569
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,180
Yes!

570
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,220
Get up, asshole!

571
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:23,600
Don't you know that we can't fight here?

572
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,040
The seniors told me that

573
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,757
Architecture and Engineering students helped each other build this pavilion a while back.

574
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,620
They all agreed that this place was the place for a truce.

575
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,240
Whoever fights here will be banned by seniors.

576
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,560
We're screwed!

577
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:13,570
[Bad Buddy Series]

578
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,120
You need to compensate the expenses for the pavilion rebuild.

579
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,530
The Architecture guys need to make money to repair that pavilion.

580
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,940
You can't just assume.

581
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,710
You must use someone who knows it well. Let's say we're friends.

582
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,470
- No.
- Boyfriends, then.
- What?

583
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,280
- You like it?
- Kind of.

584
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,310
Of course, you do. I do, too.

585
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:34,040
Knock on my door anytime. If you miss me,

586
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,940
don't knock. Just come in.
