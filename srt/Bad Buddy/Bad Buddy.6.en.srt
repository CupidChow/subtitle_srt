Or maybe he came because he can't stand you anymore.

00:14:28,544 --> 00:14:34,841
Now I'm going to show you how to make a biofertilizer.

170
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:41,419
What you do here is separate your food waste in these bins.

171
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:46,218
Food waste only, don't add your rubbish friends in those bins.

172
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,920
Watery or liquid waste is in this green bin.

173
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,533
In that bin right there is the compost we already did.

174
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:55,040
Open it.

175
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,635
Smells good, right?

176
00:14:58,635 --> 00:15:00,838
Welcome to a word-guessing game.

177
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:02,996
1, 2, 3. Go!

178
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:04,822
Hurry up.

179
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,270
What an exciting game.

180
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,570
The time is running.

181
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:13,731
And he's gone.

182
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:40,775
Our next activity will be a matching game to find pairs.

183
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:47,528
Turn your name tag over, you'll see the name of a vegetable.

184
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:52,940
You must find your friend who has the same vegetable on his or her name tag.

185
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,312
And then you two will pair up.

186
00:15:55,312 --> 00:15:57,232
I'm going to start the time now.

187
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:59,947
Let's go.

188
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,580
Who has Ivy Gourd Leave and who has Kale?

189
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:12,183
Have you found your partner?

190
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:16,923
[Sweet Basil]

191
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:20,911
[Sweet Basil]

192
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:23,908
Once you found your teammate, sit down.

193
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:31,990
For this activity, we will think of these papers as our natural resources.

194
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,884
I'm giving you the newspapers.

195
00:16:33,884 --> 00:16:37,590
Let's suppose they're natural resources.

196
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:41,307
Each time we use them, we will see how much they decrease.

197
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:46,648
The rule is each pair stands on the paper for one minute.

198
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:49,017
Then we will fold it in half.

199
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:53,290
The last pair standing will be the winner of this game.

200
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:58,472
Fold it in half, everyone.

201
00:16:59,444 --> 00:17:01,453
Stand on one leg.

202
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:05,865
Hey, that's clever!

203
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:14,418
One team out.

204
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:20,046
Fold it again. Make it smaller.

205
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:29,880
Avoiding eye contact also means you lose.

206
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,290
You're good.

207
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,553
Just give in if you can't do it anymore.

208
00:17:39,553 --> 00:17:41,174
Talk to me.

209
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:45,784
Fold it yourself. How much is left?

210
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:27,699
Hey!

211
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:37,224
What the hell are you doing?

212
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:38,948
Playing a game.

213
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:42,370
Easy. It was me. I fell. It's nothing.

214
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,596
- Easy there, young man.
- Wai.

215
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:50,079
Please take it easy there.

216
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,887
- Stay calm, please.
- Damn it!

217
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:56,883
We're all friends and doing good things together here.

218
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,197
What the hell does he want from us?

219
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:10,909
I'm at the end of my rope!

220
00:19:11,923 --> 00:19:17,111
I heard from the seniors that Engineering students never joined our camp before.

221
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:18,910
He has crossed the line.

222
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,124
Right, Toto?

223
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:25,220
Damn it! Can we just freaking ignore him?

224
00:19:32,627 --> 00:19:38,069
Someone like that will quit bothering us when he has had enough.

225
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:39,993
Just ignore him.

226
00:19:55,798 --> 00:20:00,355
I saw an available spot here. Can I join?

227
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:12,708
Don't you want that meatball?

228
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:15,669
Can I have it?

229
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,753
It's so good.

230
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:28,838
Do you want my feet, too?

231
00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:30,721
Guys.

232
00:20:33,493 --> 00:20:35,593
I'll talk to him.

233
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,784
This is our faculty project.

234
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:42,757
Cool yourself down.

235
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:02,355
You, asshole. Don't you get what I said?

236
00:21:07,272 --> 00:21:09,272
We're talking now?

237
00:21:13,392 --> 00:21:15,392
What is it?

238
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,700
Tell me what's running through your mind.

239
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:33,943
What game are you playing?

240
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:36,526
You're making me feel so uncomfortable here.

241
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:39,672
You're not the only one feeling uncomfortable.

242
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:52,861
Don't make it more complicated than it already is.

243
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:57,927
Please.

244
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,810
Just leave me alone.

245
00:22:05,831 --> 00:22:07,531
Hey!

246
00:22:23,757 --> 00:22:25,231
Junior.

247
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:27,771
Have you seen Pran?

248
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,497
Uncle Tong, Pat asked if we could give him a lift to the market.

249
00:22:35,497 --> 00:22:36,898
Of course.

250
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,987
Gentlemen, just hop on.

251
00:22:38,987 --> 00:22:41,456
Can you scoot over?

252
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:46,240
Hold on tight. I'm fast and furious.

253
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,375
Good news. I forgot the key.

254
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,818
Again?

255
00:22:53,818 --> 00:22:55,224
As always.

256
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:57,134
Always?

257
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,877
What grade are you in, Junior?

258
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:03,499
Fourth Grade. Next semester starts soon.

259
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:05,050
Is that so?

260
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,764
Do you have loads of friends?

261
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:08,405
I do.

262
00:23:08,405 --> 00:23:10,643
I have...

263
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,791
- seven members in my group.
- Seven?

264
00:23:16,454 --> 00:23:19,960
And do you have a friend that won't talk to you?

265
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,944
Whatever you say, he answers with silence.

266
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:26,528
He ignores your questions. You don't know what happened to him.

267
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:30,040
He suddenly becomes quiet. Something like that.

268
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,471
I don't. There's no such a guy like that. Right?

269
00:23:33,471 --> 00:23:35,071
There is one.

270
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:38,307
What would you do if you had this type of friend?

271
00:23:39,348 --> 00:23:41,248
End your friendship with him.

272
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:44,877
End the friendship? Isn't it a little too mean?

273
00:23:45,643 --> 00:23:48,619
I want to, but I feel sorry for him.

274
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:52,977
He doesn't have lots of friends.

275
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,699
He's that kind of guy.

276
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:02,645
Do you have lots of friends?

277
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:04,611
I do.

278
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:08,997
What would you do if your friend refused to talk to you?

279
00:24:10,697 --> 00:24:12,174
I don't know.

280
00:24:12,174 --> 00:24:14,531
I only have talkative friends.

281
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:19,041
How talkative?

282
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,001
Annoyingly talkative.

283
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,451
Super annoying.

284
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:24,136
I'm here.

285
00:24:24,136 --> 00:24:25,538
Did I keep you guys waiting?

286
00:24:25,538 --> 00:24:27,399
I've got the key.

287
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:30,162
I'm old and forgetful.

288
00:24:30,162 --> 00:24:31,695
You're still young.

289
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:33,804
It's good you're coming along.

290
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:36,610
I'll drop you off at the market.

291
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,057
Can you grab something for me there? I need to run some errands.

292
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:42,219
Of course.

293
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:43,546
- Yeah?
- Sure.

294
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:45,891
Take care of these guys. Don't let them fall off.

295
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:47,491
Got it.

296
00:24:50,468 --> 00:24:52,470
Are we really going to the market?

297
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,976
Yes.

298
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:56,576
You've never been to a market before or what?

299
00:24:58,912 --> 00:25:00,915
Hang tight.

300
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:03,074
Uncle!

301
00:25:04,073 --> 00:25:06,073
What are you smiling at?

302
00:25:07,354 --> 00:25:10,450
- Why are you smiling, Junior?
- Nothing.

303
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,810
Stop smiling.

304
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,810
♫ ...who liked to look at me first? ♫

305
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,100
Do we need this, too?

306
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,900
♫ ...why I take care of you ♫

307

♫ It's not you, right? ♫

308
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:25,356
Hurry up.

309
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:27,740
I want mango and sticky rice.

310
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,373
Just buy what's on the list.

311

♫ ...just give me a signal ♫

312
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:36,956
Stop playing.

313
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:40,599
Give me that. I'll make sure we get everything.

314
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,508
- Are you guys friends?
- Yes, we are.

315
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:50,303
- All right. Just take it.
- You're talking to me now?

316
00:25:50,303 --> 00:25:53,225
Can I have some garlic, too?

317
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:55,989
I need only 100 grams.

318
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:58,107
You guys are so cute together.

319
00:25:58,107 --> 00:25:59,999
Thank you.

320
00:26:06,305 --> 00:26:07,892
What?

321
00:26:08,752 --> 00:26:11,838
- Are we okay here?
- We're stuck. We're screwed.

322
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:14,870
1, 2, 3!

323
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,461
- It's not going anywhere.
- Was that all you got?

324
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:24,131
Uncle, let's try again.

325
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:25,994
Okay. Keep pushing.

326
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:28,433
1, 2, 3!

Stop it.

♫ I won't tell anyone that you liked me first ♫

335
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:18,030
♫ Just making eye contact like this makes it feel so good ♫

336
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:26,280
♫ This kind of thing is known to only two people,
it's a love that only you and I know ♫

337
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,440
♫ Just you and me ♫

338
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,560
Will you tell me now what's been going on since that night?

339
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,688
Can we not talk about that?

340
00:27:40,186 --> 00:27:41,653
Fine.

341
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,167
Do you hate me?

342
00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:59,082
I used to ask myself...

343
00:27:59,684 --> 00:28:02,510
if you ever did anything to make me hate you.

344
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:06,766
Did I?

345
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:12,868
Ever since I knew you, my life has been a lot tougher.

346
00:28:12,868 --> 00:28:16,879
Whatever I do, I need to compare it to you.

347
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:21,645
You must hate me a lot for that, don't you?

348
00:28:23,598 --> 00:28:25,285
I should.

349
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:34,065
But then I tried to think it through.

350
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:36,660
You were put in the same situation, too.

351
00:28:37,343 --> 00:28:40,386
That's why I couldn't force myself to hate you.

352
00:28:47,487 --> 00:28:49,487
What about you?

353
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:03,005
When you were the reason I got transferred,

354
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:07,871
I was so angry at you and my mom.

355
00:29:20,935 --> 00:29:23,335
I am sorry.

356
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:25,884
It's fine.

357
00:29:25,884 --> 00:29:28,290
It was just anger,

358
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,848
not hatred.

359
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:47,307
Without people around, I can sit next to you just fine.

360
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,553
But when there're other people,

361
00:29:51,553 --> 00:29:57,178
talking to you feels like a matter of life and death.

362
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:04,354
What can we do?

363
00:30:04,354 --> 00:30:06,821
We were just born this way.

364
00:30:17,226 --> 00:30:20,326
Want to try it for a while?

365
00:30:20,326 --> 00:30:24,845
Just sit here and care about nothing.

366
00:30:58,198 --> 00:30:59,969
Why are you quiet now?

367
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:08,744
Speaking with you nicely, I just don't know how.

368
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:10,714
Same here.

369
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:19,692
Thanks...

370
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,422
for saving Pa.

371
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:37,150
If I drown, will you help me?

372
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,285
I'll let the fish eat you.

373
00:31:53,282 --> 00:31:55,382
Help.

374
00:31:56,194 --> 00:31:58,394
Please help.

375
00:31:58,394 --> 00:32:00,530
Pran, help.

376
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:04,461
Pat is drowning over here.

377
00:32:05,762 --> 00:32:09,905
You literally didn't help me. Pran, you're so mean.

378
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:19,086
You seriously let me play alone.

379
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:33,127
Have you ever pictured what it'd be like if our parents didn't fight?

380
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:39,058
If our families weren't enemies...

381
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,831
Uncle.

382
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:01,508
Uncle.

383
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,975
Where is Uncle Tong?

384
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:08,474
He's out. I guess he went out to pick up some waste.

385
00:33:08,474 --> 00:33:10,186
Pick up some waste?

386
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:12,139
He asked me to buy printer ink.

387
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:13,697
Hey, hands off it.

388
00:33:13,697 --> 00:33:16,290
I'll just refill it for him then.

389
00:33:17,303 --> 00:33:19,620
Do you even know how to?

390
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,733
Are you sure you're not going to ruin his printer?

391
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:26,558
For this model, I can even do it with my eyes closed.

392
00:33:34,603 --> 00:33:38,160
I was just playing. It won't leak.

393
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,024
Junior, you might get your hands dirty.

394
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:41,924
Of course not.

395
00:33:54,494 --> 00:33:57,094
Let me test it.

396
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,475
And we're done.

397
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,203
Great quality.

398
00:34:17,203 --> 00:34:18,756
Pat.

399
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:21,707
Can I see?

400
00:34:21,707 --> 00:34:23,254
No, you can't.

401
00:34:23,254 --> 00:34:27,118
Hello, young men. What are you guys doing?

402
00:34:27,118 --> 00:34:29,644
Nothing. I just refilled your ink cartridge.

403
00:34:29,644 --> 00:34:32,084
Excellent, Pat.

404
00:34:32,084 --> 00:34:35,502
Since you know how to, can you print this out for me?

405
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:41,658
My assistant isn't here and I'm not good at this kind of stuff.

406
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,420
What am I printing?

407
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,159
Papers for tonight's lucky draw.

408
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:52,932
You guys will be put in pairs and spend the night at the villagers' houses.

409
00:34:52,932 --> 00:34:54,597
It's a change of atmosphere.

410
00:34:54,597 --> 00:34:57,083
What did you just print out?

411
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:59,372
- Wanna see?
- Show him.

412
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:02,422
Show him the ink quality.

413
00:35:02,422 --> 00:35:05,411
Just do what he asked you.

414
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:11,556
And the last one to draw.

415
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:15,599
All right.

416
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:22,020
All right. Two people with the same vegetable will pair up.

417
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,839
Who has Kale?

418
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,929
So you two are the first pair.

419
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:32,718
Who has Water Mimosa?

420
00:35:32,718 --> 00:35:35,186
Two girls.

421
00:35:35,186 --> 00:35:39,508
Who has Hemp? You'll be sleeping at my house.

422
00:35:42,254 --> 00:35:45,986
Who else has Hemp?

423
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:49,375
All right.

424
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:54,302
You two will make a good team.

425
00:35:54,302 --> 00:35:58,875
Who has Coriander?

426
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:02,423
Two ladies right here.

427
00:36:02,423 --> 00:36:04,758
And who got Acacia Pennata?

428
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,620
Hey, excuse me.

429
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,500
Chompoo, can I go first?

430
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,470
I have a—

431
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,670
What the heck?

432
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,810
He's bugging me big time.

433
00:36:43,475 --> 00:36:47,147
I think I have had enough.

434
00:36:47,844 --> 00:36:49,844
What are you going to do?

435
00:36:49,844 --> 00:36:54,069
Tonight, he's going to have the sweetest dream ever.

436
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:36,243
We will go get some rest now.

437
00:37:36,243 --> 00:37:37,953
Hey, Louis.

438
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:41,207
You and I sleep in the same house.

439
00:37:43,023 --> 00:37:46,050
Toto, you have paired up with Bie.

440
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,150
Why are you going with Wai?

441
00:37:50,578 --> 00:37:52,678
You guys are beating up Pat, aren't you?

442
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:03,233
Pran, look what he's done.

443
00:38:03,233 --> 00:38:05,896
We should teach him a lesson.

444
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:07,940
Come on, guys.

445
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,155
We're in a volunteer camp.

446
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:13,783
We will do it quietly. No one needs to know.

447
00:38:13,783 --> 00:38:17,644
Wait until we get back. You can deal with him then.

448
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:20,718
Pran, can I ask you one question?

449
00:38:20,718 --> 00:38:23,233
Which faculty are you in exactly?

450
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:26,133
Why are you protecting him?

451
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:28,142
I am not.

452
00:38:28,142 --> 00:38:31,336
It's not just Wai who can feel it.

453
00:38:31,336 --> 00:38:34,991
We all think you're taking his side.

454
00:38:47,852 --> 00:38:51,930
Is there anything going on between you and Pat we don't know about?

455
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,896
Guys, I have a confession to make.

456
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:24,407
It's you, Junior?

457
00:39:24,407 --> 00:39:26,767
Just chill.

458
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:29,627
Uncle Tong asked me to bring you a mosquito repellent.

459
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:32,296
Thanks.

460
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:34,501
It's time for bed. Good night.

461
00:39:47,582 --> 00:39:49,485
Really, Pran?

462
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:53,035
Your first love is now in a new relationship?

463
00:39:54,753 --> 00:39:58,533
That's why you don't seem to enjoy this trip.

464
00:39:59,922 --> 00:40:04,787
You have to move on.

465
00:40:06,658 --> 00:40:09,280
We're on a trip.

466
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,440
I just don't want to make you worried and spoil the fun.

467
00:40:15,196 --> 00:40:17,632
Now that I have confessed,

468
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:23,752
you all must stay with me all night.

469
00:40:23,752 --> 00:40:25,110
Cheers!

470
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:28,567
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

471
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:41,333
No worries, Pran.

472
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:45,242
Someone so perfect like you won't stay available for long.

473
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:48,133
Just tell me your type.

474
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:50,437
I know lots of people.

475
00:40:54,644 --> 00:40:57,212
I should take a break.

476
00:40:57,212 --> 00:40:59,712
It still hurts.

477
00:42:39,693 --> 00:42:43,533
You don't allow me to talk about it, so I'm not talking.

478
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,340
[Kiss?]

479
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:03,731
It was nothing.

480
00:43:06,237 --> 00:43:08,237
What do you mean?

481
00:43:09,263 --> 00:43:11,563
I'm not trying to mean anything.

482
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,579
If you don't say it, how will I figure it out?

483
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:20,031
How can I possibly understand you?

484
00:43:21,467 --> 00:43:23,467
You don't need to understand.

485
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:26,606
Because I don't want you to understand me either.

486
00:43:39,387 --> 00:43:41,887
Just mind your business.

487
00:43:47,435 --> 00:43:49,850
I talked to Ink.

488
00:43:50,535 --> 00:43:55,445
I don't think... I like her like that.

489
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,331
How do you like her then?

490
00:44:08,516 --> 00:44:10,991
You don't need to understand.

491
00:44:10,991 --> 00:44:14,505
Because I don't want you to understand me, either.

492
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:23,323
I knew it.

493
00:44:23,323 --> 00:44:27,111
You're terrible at flirting. No one likes you back.

494
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:29,413
Like you are so good.

495
00:44:29,413 --> 00:44:32,572
I've never seen you succeed at using your charm, either.

496
00:44:33,657 --> 00:44:35,211
Yeah?

497
00:44:35,211 --> 00:44:39,467
But there's one guy who followed me here all the way from Bangkok,

498
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:41,848
wanting to make up with me.

499
00:44:41,848 --> 00:44:46,064
And there's one guy who refused to talk to me all day.

500
00:44:46,064 --> 00:44:48,210
What does that mean?

501
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,890
Oh! I've got him confused about his feelings for me.

502
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:03,833
Why can't you just admit it?

503
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,383
You like me already. Just say it.

504
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,441
- I don't like you.
- You do.

505
00:45:15,441 --> 00:45:18,357
You're the one that likes me.

506
00:45:18,357 --> 00:45:23,432
It is so obvious that you like me.

507
00:45:26,426 --> 00:45:28,503
Fine.

508
00:45:28,503 --> 00:45:31,004
Let's compete then.

509
00:45:31,004 --> 00:45:33,272
I'll show you how I flirt.

510
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,002
I'll go after you and sweep you off your feet.

511
00:45:38,984 --> 00:45:40,734
Game on.

512
00:45:41,484 --> 00:45:45,900
And I'll make you get down on your knees, declaring your love for me.

513
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:52,462
Someone like you is gonna fall for me in no time.

514
00:45:52,462 --> 00:45:54,754
You're all talk.

515
00:45:54,754 --> 00:45:58,319
Make it happen first and you can brag later.

516
00:46:02,347 --> 00:46:04,350
- Whoever falls in love first loses.
- Whoever falls in love first loses.

517
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:05,977
- Deal!
- Deal!

518
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,100
People are preparing to get on the bus.

519
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,648
Too many people there.

520
00:46:27,648 --> 00:46:33,271
When the bus is here, my boyfriend will come and get me anyway.

521
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,877
Who's your boyfriend?

522
00:46:44,826 --> 00:46:48,419
There's the bus. We will leave in 15 minutes.

523
00:46:48,419 --> 00:46:50,505
That means...

524
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:54,891
I have some time to hit on you here.

525
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:05,799
I'm not hungry.

526
00:47:12,545 --> 00:47:15,994
It's good. Are you sure you don't want it?

527
00:47:26,794 --> 00:47:29,059
I know you want it.

528
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:31,461
Be my boyfriend first.

529
00:47:33,193 --> 00:47:35,187
So that's your move?

530
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,170
It's good like you said.

531
00:47:59,022 --> 00:48:02,069
See you later, friend.

532

533
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:37,953
- Pran.
- Yes.

534
00:48:37,953 --> 00:48:39,457
Who are you messaging?

535
00:48:39,457 --> 00:48:40,867
Why are you smiling?

536
00:48:40,867 --> 00:48:43,253
Just a friend.

537
00:48:43,852 --> 00:48:46,150
Cute Dimples.

538
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:51,134
I've always wanted to cook a special dish for someone I like.

539
00:48:51,134 --> 00:48:53,077
You and I are both tight-lipped.

540
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:56,425
We will never reveal our feelings if nothing pushes us to do so.

541
00:48:56,425 --> 00:48:58,353
Do you still want us to be friends?

542
00:48:58,353 --> 00:48:59,595
Do you?

543
00:48:59,595 --> 00:49:04,410
♫ Okay, I won't tell anyone that you had feelings for me first ♫
