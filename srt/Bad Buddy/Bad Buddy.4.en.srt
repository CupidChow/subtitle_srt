You must take responsibility for the bus stop rebuild expenses.

Where are they going to get the money from?

4
00:00:08,044 --> 00:00:10,602
You can't just sit and imagine it.

5
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:12,604
You must use someone who actually uses it.

6
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:17,391
If we all help each other build it, I don't think we need to hire more workers.

7
00:00:17,391 --> 00:00:20,309
We will supervise the project for you.

8
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:22,736
You seem so happy when you get to compete against me.

9

You do, too.

Also, I just like to see your face.

11
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:37,580
We made an order on materials for the roof.

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,585
They have a timeline in place for delivery. Are you okay with that?

13
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:42,080
No problem.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,570
I talked to the professor who supervises the project.

15
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,477
He will check in on us two times a week.

16
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:49,429
Are you all okay with that?

17
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:55,514
We're all set then. Let's assign the work.

18
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,857
We should set up teams consisting of Architecture and Engineering guys.

- To make sure there's no mistake.
- What do you mean "mistake"?

You don't trust us, do you?

Why don't you just do it yourself if you're so smart?

22
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,196
I didn't ask for your help. You just meddled in our business.

23
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:08,108
All right. Calm down.

24
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:10,027
Easy.

25
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:13,052
Are you seriously asking us to work with them?

26
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:22,802
No. Architecture and Engineering won't be put on the same team.

Who would know they'd lose their heads today?

30
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,468
What are we going to do now?

31
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:49,258
We work on even calendar dates. They work on odd calendar dates.

32

We won't see them. You guys can breathe now.

33
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:56,180
We can live with that.

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,011
But I don't think they will really work. Can we trust them?

35
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:03,729
What is it now? I think you're overthinking it.

36
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:07,220
They might slack off and never get anything done.

37
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,969
I don't trust them whatsoever. Especially, him!

38

Why didn't you stop them?

I was busy dancing in front of the stage.

44
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:31,046
I told you we should have mixed teams so that we can stop each other from slacking off.

45
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:33,809
If we do so, we need to stop them from fighting, too.

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,085
No.

167
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:20,120
Take it.

168
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,630
You can't say you lost because you didn't have earphones.

169
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:30,326
Hey, Pat!

170
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:33,281
Pat, I didn't let you in.

171
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:34,926
Pat!

172
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:36,781
Your room is spacious.

173
00:12:36,781 --> 00:12:41,888
Pat, you're not allowed in here.

174
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:45,606
Have some manners. I didn't ask you in.

175
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:48,913
- You read comic books, too?
- Pat.

176
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:51,978
You have this one, too? Can I borrow it?

177
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:53,312
No, you can't.

178
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:56,014
- I'll sit and read it right here then.
- Pat!

179
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,427
Pat. Okay, you can have it. Go back to your room.

180
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:04,080
What made you change your mind?

181
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,471
Do you need to ask?

182
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:08,404
You stink. Go back and take a shower.

183
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:09,618
I do?

184
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:11,085
You just finished practice.

185
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:14,989
You're sitting on my couch and leaving your sweat on it.

186
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:16,390
I don't smell that bad.

187
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,560
I can smell it from here. Go!

188
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,003
- You're exaggerating.
- Get up.

189
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:26,455
- Can't I sit for a bit?
- Go back and read in your room.

190
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:29,547
What? It isn't that bad.

191
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:32,450
Were you out in the rain? You're all wet.

192
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,937
I'm a sports player.

193
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:36,924
Go. Don't mess up my couch.

194
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:39,849
- Just for a bit.
- No. Go!

195
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:42,295
Take that comic book to your room. Take that book with you.

196
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:45,176
- It's just sweat after playing a sport.
- Leave.

197
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:47,321
- It isn't that bad.
- It's bad.
- It's not.

198
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:49,224
- It's bad.
- It's not.

199
00:13:49,224 --> 00:13:50,980
- No.
- Yes.

200
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,570
I smell that bad, huh?

201
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,840
Sniff it. Sniff my scent.

202
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,880
Pat, you asshole! You stink!

203
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,267
Get up. Go back to your room.

204
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:04,154
Take that with you. Go!

205
00:14:04,154 --> 00:14:05,692
Leave my room!

206
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:08,259
Hold on.

207
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:10,664
Let me put on my shoes first.

208
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:14,027
Open the door. Leave!

209
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:24,517
Hi. I know you want to let me in.

210
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,810
All right, everyone... Why is it called the Cold War? Does anyone know?

211
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,846
New earphones?

212
00:14:56,846 --> 00:15:00,667
Yes. I lost my old ones.

213
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,652
You made it to class just in time.

214
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:30,698
But don't be late for the bus stop project this evening.

215
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:52,252
Parakul.

216
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:55,871
The classroom is not a room for you to sit and use your phone!

217
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:58,630
Let's continue.

218
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,382
Turn to page five.

219
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:07,243
Wai, can you make a copy of this checklist for me?

220
00:16:07,243 --> 00:16:08,716
I'm getting a coffee.

221
00:16:08,716 --> 00:16:12,100
- Okay. See you downstairs.
- See you.

222
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,877
Here. Less sweet.

223
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:18,970
Less sweet?

224
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:23,077
How was your day?

225
00:16:23,077 --> 00:16:25,266
It's still sweet.

226
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,850
Can I have one iced milk tea, please?

227
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:44,374
See you in the club room.

228
00:16:44,374 --> 00:16:46,008
See you.

229
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,276
Can you make that two, please?

230
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,614
- Should we go eat BBQ pork?
- That will make you fat.

231
00:17:00,614 --> 00:17:02,865
- I will never get fat.
- I can see your double chin.

232
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:05,407
Double chin? I have no double chin.

233
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:06,907
No.

234
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,099
But you do.

235
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,776
I don't.

236
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,828
Hey!

237
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:16,355
- What?
- Thirsty?

238
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:24,049
What's up with him?

239
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:35,615
I wouldn't come here if you didn't ask me to.

240
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:39,996
Don't use me as an excuse. I know you want to skip class.

241
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:42,864
For this subject, I can just study it myself.

242
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:47,373
Do you remember what I asked you?

243
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:50,733
I do. What do you need?

244
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:53,027
Do you have some time tomorrow evening?

245
00:17:58,513 --> 00:18:01,891
So, the faucet will be right here? Like in the floor plan?

246
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:03,591
Okay.

247
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,619
Professor Pichai wants to see the progress.

248
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,362
Hello, Professor.

249
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:12,462
This is the final design.

250
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,433
Let me explain it to you.

251
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:17,465
Please.

252
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:20,275
- This way, please.
- Lead the way.

253
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:25,361
Where is your friend?

254
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:29,727
Are you blind? Right here.

255
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:32,729
I'm his friend. So is that guy right there.

256
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:34,619
I meant Pat.

257
00:18:36,263 --> 00:18:37,979
Pat?

258
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:43,056
His family called. He has to deal with some family stuff.

259
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:50,215
Let's go eat.

260
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:52,660
Chang!

261
00:18:56,158 --> 00:18:58,658
Move to your right a little.

262
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:01,302
Is it okay, Jam?

263
00:19:01,302 --> 00:19:03,087
Do you want to change anything else?

264
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:05,911
We're all set, except our model is a little stiff.

265
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,961
Just relax.

266
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:10,961
Face down a bit more.

267
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:14,208
Wow! Looking so hot here.

268
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,271
What a great model!

269
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:17,989
What do you think, Jam?

270
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:21,305
I think this is great.

271
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:23,789
Okay. Let's change the outfit.

272
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:27,723
Come here. I'll give you a new look.

273
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:32,613
This one.

274
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:35,368
Does it look okay?

275
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:37,271
It does.

276
00:19:37,271 --> 00:19:38,464
Let me see your hair.

277
00:19:38,464 --> 00:19:40,427
You got something in your hair.

278
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:42,217
Allow me.

279
00:19:57,885 --> 00:19:59,365
Am I too late?

280
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,358
- Hi, Pa. What brings you here?
- Hi, Ink.

281
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:05,518
Pat forgot his contacts. I had to deliver them to him.

282
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:08,675
That's why our model couldn't see where the camera was.

283
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:11,627
I tried my best. My eyes hurt.

284
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,186
I'm sorry.

285
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:14,905
I'm going to wear my contacts in the restroom.

286
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:16,702
Sure.

287
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:22,485
- You're okay there?
- I have a little sore throat.

288
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:26,213
Ink.

289
00:20:27,022 --> 00:20:32,073
Your work looks professional. You're like those crew behind YouTube videos.

290
00:20:32,073 --> 00:20:34,753
Enroll in the Faculty of Communication Arts. You'll get to work with these things all the time.

291
00:20:34,753 --> 00:20:35,938
Really?

292
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:40,790
I want to, but I'm not as talented as you are.

293
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,339
I can teach you.

294
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:47,503
- How about we do some photoshoots?
- No. I can't.

295
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,514
Let's try it first. Come on.

296
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:54,644
- Show me your best pose.
- How?

297
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:56,797
The best you've got.

298
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,151
And you said you couldn't.

299
00:20:58,151 --> 00:20:59,484
I can't, really.

300
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:01,584
Great. Give me more.

301
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:05,595
- Right there.
- I know, all right?

302
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:08,617
Chang, can you store the wire?

303
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:10,102
Why don't you just do it yourself?

304
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,089
Hurry up.

305
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:17,830
Like that.

306
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:22,806
[Ink: Don't forget to shop with us.]
[Thanks to this hot guy from Engineering.]

307
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:24,861
Are you sure? Try it again.

308
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:26,855
You're so fussy.

309
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:29,870
So we won't have to do it again.

310
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:36,605
Rugby is something you play with passion.

311
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:40,000
Don't take it as a sport. It's war.

312
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,048
The person in front of you is your enemy, an asshole who does shit to you.

313
00:21:45,048 --> 00:21:46,564
Express your rage.

314
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:47,765
Pran!

315
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,665
What?

316
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:52,897
What's the matter with you?

317
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:55,645
Pran, are you all right?

318
00:21:55,645 --> 00:21:57,522
I'm okay.

319
00:21:57,522 --> 00:22:00,149
Back to practice.

320
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:02,383
What's up with you?

321
00:22:08,714 --> 00:22:11,460
1, 2, 3.

322
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,571
And the job is done!

323
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:20,883
Thanks so much, Pat.

324
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,179
I'll tag you on the IG post once the product is launched.

325
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:24,655
Please don't.

326
00:22:24,655 --> 00:22:26,691
People should only see good pictures of him.

327
00:22:26,691 --> 00:22:29,081
That's harsh.

328
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,389
Thanks, Pat.

329
00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:35,936
I should go back, too.

330
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:37,227
Bye.

331
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:39,327
Wait! Why don't you come to eat with us?

332
00:22:39,327 --> 00:22:41,766
It's my treat.

333
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:43,309
Come with us.

334
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:45,800
I better not. I have homework.

335
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,923
And Pa needs to use the car.

336
00:22:47,923 --> 00:22:51,990
I'll give you some shirts then. Tag my friend's shop when you post it online.

337
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,965
- Of course.
- One second.

338
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:55,418
Jam!

339
00:22:57,163 --> 00:22:59,063
I'm clearing the way for you.

340
00:22:59,063 --> 00:23:02,137
What? Don't act like you know things.

341
00:23:02,137 --> 00:23:05,956
You can't be more obvious. Anyone can tell.

342
00:23:08,122 --> 00:23:09,782
Are you two gossiping about me?

343
00:23:09,782 --> 00:23:12,504
- What? No.
- Nothing.

344
00:23:13,098 --> 00:23:14,798
- I should get going.
- Get home safe.

345
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,120
- Be safe.
- Enjoy your dinner.

346
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,504
- What's the matter with your sister?
- I have no idea. She's in a good mood.

347
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:27,083
Pran, why did you become aggressive all of a sudden there?

348
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,712
It was normal.

349
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:33,698
Are you sure you're okay?

350
00:23:33,698 --> 00:23:37,707
Yes. I will not be okay if you ask me one more time.

351
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,894
Fine. I'll stop worrying.

352
00:23:39,894 --> 00:23:41,334
Let's talk about work then.

353
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:44,653
When are you going to finish the song for the demo round?

354
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:46,612
Ouch!

355
00:23:46,612 --> 00:23:48,634
It hurts.

356
00:23:49,835 --> 00:23:52,899
Spare us some time to rehearse, will you?

357
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,756
Damn you!

358
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:14,317
By the way, I've never seen you play.

359
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:16,586
When did you quit playing?

360
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,762
In 10th grade, I guess. Never played again since.

361
00:24:25,762 --> 00:24:28,000
How about one song?

362
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:31,253
Let's do it.

363
00:24:40,426 --> 00:24:42,949
- Should we sit here?
- Sure.

364
00:24:45,428 --> 00:24:47,428
I'm so hungry.

365
00:24:47,428 --> 00:24:48,672
Go ahead and order.

366
00:24:48,672 --> 00:24:50,307
Hey!

367
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:51,915
I'm leaving.

368
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:54,998
Okay. I'll go check the supply room.

369
00:24:54,998 --> 00:24:56,404
I should get going, too.

370
00:24:56,404 --> 00:24:57,907
See you later.

371
00:24:57,907 --> 00:24:59,613
Bye.

372
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:07,268
Pran!

373
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,799
What brings you here?

374
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:16,596
My friend works here. I just stopped by to hang out with him.

375
00:25:16,596 --> 00:25:18,237
But I'm leaving now.

376
00:25:18,237 --> 00:25:21,937
What? Why don't you join us?

377
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,169
We didn't get to talk last time.

378
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:26,900
Come on.

379
00:25:44,564 --> 00:25:47,264
Are you afraid to be seen with him?

380
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:50,806
You can just tell people we're discussing the bus stop.

381
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,676
Did you just finish rugby practice?

382
00:25:57,676 --> 00:25:59,228
Yes.

383
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,402
For the upcoming match between Engineering and Architecture.

384
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:05,852
So you're competing against Pat?

385
00:26:08,894 --> 00:26:14,106
Who should I be cheering for between you two?

386
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:28,907
- What do you want to eat?
- Hey!

387
00:26:28,907 --> 00:26:31,056
Do you still have it?

388
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,689
I've had it on since this morning. Why don't you just ask tomorrow?

389
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:36,186
Wow! I'm thankful.

390
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:38,844
Didn't think you still had it.

391
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:41,301
It's rare. Only you can make crooked-pattern bracelets like this.

392
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:44,804
- Give it back then.
- No.

393
00:26:46,195 --> 00:26:47,342
Ta-da!

394
00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:50,299
Woah! Did you make it yourself?

395
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:52,163
Are you sure you didn't buy it?

396
00:26:52,163 --> 00:26:56,042
Of course. Look! It has your initial P on it.

397
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:57,180
Right.

398
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,212
Let's try it on.

399
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:03,366
- Do you like it? Does it look nice?
- It does.

400
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:05,175
Very nice.

401
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:07,375
Can we take a picture?

402
00:27:10,392 --> 00:27:11,736
Pran.

403
00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:13,760
What are you going to order?

404
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,235
Ink, I just realized I have something going on. I should go.

405
00:27:19,235 --> 00:27:21,913
- See you later.
- Bye.

406
00:27:21,913 --> 00:27:23,765
- Bye.
- See you.

407
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,650
[Tinidee: Hotel @ Bangkok Golf Club]

408
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:48,448
Your fried chicken.

409
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:50,672
You left before it was served.

410
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:54,761
You can have it.

411
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:00,216
What's wrong?

412
00:28:00,891 --> 00:28:02,905
None of your business.

413
00:28:02,905 --> 00:28:05,209
I'm asking nicely.

414
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:07,778
What happened?

415
00:28:09,015 --> 00:28:11,815
A little injury from rugby practice.

416
00:28:12,699 --> 00:28:14,702
Did you apply some liniment to it?

417
00:28:14,702 --> 00:28:17,101
Does it hurt badly?

418
00:28:17,101 --> 00:28:19,437
I didn't.

419
00:28:19,437 --> 00:28:21,932
That's what liniment is for, you know?

420
00:28:22,658 --> 00:28:24,503
Wait here.

421
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:30,631
Let me see.

422
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:33,149
I can do it myself.

423
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,149
Roll up your sleeve.

424
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:40,237
Do it.

425
00:29:01,688 --> 00:29:03,691
Be careful.

426
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:06,027
We have a game in two days.

427
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:10,651
It's beneficial to you. You can win more easily.

428
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:12,773
Without you in the game?

429
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:14,971
There's no fun.

430
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:18,909
Do it more gently.

431
00:29:30,194 --> 00:29:31,951
I'm good now.

432
00:29:33,662 --> 00:29:35,860
You can leave.

433
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:40,836
Are you asking me to leave after I just helped you?

434
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:42,936
Always.

435
00:29:43,868 --> 00:29:45,459
Go.

436
00:29:51,585 --> 00:29:54,385
Do you have some makeup remover?

437
00:29:54,385 --> 00:29:56,631
Why do you ask?

438
00:29:56,631 --> 00:29:58,541
I did a photo shoot today.

439
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:00,696
With Ink?

440
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:08,357
You added it to your IG Story. I think everyone saw it.

441
00:30:09,878 --> 00:30:12,023
Did you want to tell the world or what?

442
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:19,632
Thanks.

443
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:28,414
- Hey!
- What?

444
00:30:28,414 --> 00:30:30,214
You don't need that much.

445
00:30:30,214 --> 00:30:32,894
Do you really think I know how to use it?

446
00:30:32,894 --> 00:30:36,112
What a waste! Give me the cotton sheets. I'll do it for you.

447
00:30:38,198 --> 00:30:40,698
This is all you need.

448
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:47,688
Forehead up.

449
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:51,027
I mean slick your hair back.

450
00:30:56,742 --> 00:30:58,857
Come closer.

451
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,703
Too close.

452
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,444
This is so relaxing.

453
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:10,843
Be still, will you?

454
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:14,563
Hey!

455
00:31:14,563 --> 00:31:16,321
You almost wiped it in my eye.

456
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:19,082
I told you to be still.

457
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:21,231
Did it hurt?

458
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:24,196
Actually, no.

459
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,903
You're wearing heavy makeup.

460
00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:35,215
Because I'm so handsome.

461
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:37,344
You're misunderstanding something here.

462
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:39,562
If you're handsome, you won't need heavy makeup.

463
00:31:39,562 --> 00:31:42,245
What a cake face!

464
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:43,977
- It doesn't make sense.
- It does.

465
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:46,183
It means your skin is horrible.

466
00:31:46,183 --> 00:31:49,228
But I was asked to be a model.

467
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:50,858
Please. You're full of yourself.

468
00:31:50,858 --> 00:31:53,237
I am hot.

469
00:31:53,237 --> 00:31:56,835
Can I pay you to be less confident?

470
00:31:56,835 --> 00:31:58,859
What an ass!

471
00:32:05,553 --> 00:32:06,690
What?

472
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,572
Cute dimples you have there.

473
00:32:14,582 --> 00:32:19,779
If I had those dimples, would I be as cute as you?

474
00:32:28,443 --> 00:32:30,443
You want to have dimples?

475
00:32:31,213 --> 00:32:33,671
Yes, so I can be cute like you are.

476
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:35,509
These dimples?

477
00:32:37,368 --> 00:32:38,806
Sorry to disappoint.

478
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:43,063
Only I can have these super-cute dimples.

479
00:32:44,615 --> 00:32:46,037
Done.

480
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:47,537
You can go now.

481
00:32:47,537 --> 00:32:50,142
- You're shooing me away again.
- Yes.

482
00:32:50,858 --> 00:32:52,684
But I smell great today.

483
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:55,675
That's the door.

484
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:01,005
Go. The door is right there.

485
00:33:05,015 --> 00:33:06,633
Hey!

486
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:08,836
Can I spend the night here?

487
00:33:09,523 --> 00:33:12,253
I left my keys inside my room.

488
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:13,985
Really.

489
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,310
In your dreams.

490
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,725
I'm being serious.

491
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:23,999
I'm telling the truth. Come on. Don't be stingy.

492
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:27,618
Your room is spacious. Can I please share?

493
00:33:27,618 --> 00:33:29,767
Can I crash here tonight?

494
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:32,385
I don't have my keys.

495
00:34:07,068 --> 00:34:09,038
Are you sure you're fit to play?

496
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:11,690
Why don't you just sit next to me?

497
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,440

00:53:08,588 --> 00:53:11,462
What we have right now, what should we call it?

669
00:53:11,462 --> 00:53:14,296
We grew up together. We see each other every day.

670
00:53:14,296 --> 00:53:18,240
And without realizing it, our feelings have changed.

671
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,449
If we're not enemies,

672
00:53:21,554 --> 00:53:23,709
do you think we can be friends?

673
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:49,710
♫ It must be nothing ♫

674
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:55,450
♫ The way you look at me is the same as everyone else ♫

675
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:57,800
♫ You worry about me like a normal friend ♫

676
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,570
♫ I'm not thinking about anything ♫

677
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:03,750
♫ The way you say it like that ♫

678
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:07,580
♫ Why do you have to be so nervous? ♫

679
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:11,090
♫ You are overthinking it ♫

680
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:17,270
♫ How do I make sense of what you did? ♫

681
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:20,130
♫ It's a question that still lingers in my mind ♫

682
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:23,690
♫ Are we just friends or are we more? ♫

683
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:28,550
♫ What you do to me, and the way you are ♫

684
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:33,960
♫ You know, it makes my heart flutter.
You know, I'm starting to get nervous ♫

685
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,690
♫ Because of you, if you don't think like me ♫

686
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:43,100
♫ Don't do anything that makes me think like that ♫

687
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:49,550
♫ Is this what a friend would say or do? ♫
