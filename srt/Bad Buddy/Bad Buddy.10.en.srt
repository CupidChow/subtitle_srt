Why? Can't I hit on you?

- So?

We just met Pran.

Hi, Ma. Hi, Papa.

I've been waiting for you guys. I finally get to go home.

Why was he here?

We met Pran as he was leaving.

So?

22
00:01:57,641 --> 00:02:02,927
Papa, this hospital is close to the university. And he might have got into the wrong room.

00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:04,255
Not likely.

He could have made a mistake...

It's okay, Pa.

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,093
When we were fighting, there was an unlicensed gun left at the scene.

28

The police thought it was mine.

Luckily, Pran's friend had CCTV footage as proof.

That's the only couple allowed.

00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:32,299
I have no hard feelings for Pat anymore.

171
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:34,608
I wasn't talking about Pat.

172
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,568
Do I really need to sit with him? Really?

173
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:55,764
Damn you!

174
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:57,736
What?

175
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,509
It's good he's gone.

176
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:02,072
I lost my appetite after seeing his face.

177
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:04,240
Can you share that?

178
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,496
How about a drink then?

179
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:10,240
What are you doing?

180
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,628
My treat.

181
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:28,540
Thanks.

182
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:33,662
Let me open it for you, friend.

183
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, asshole!

184
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,378
- We're back to being enemies.
- Don't run.

185
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:42,735
Don't you want a refreshing drink?

186
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:47,286
I'll do it now.

187
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:51,700
Were you scared?

188
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,343
We need to shake it before drinking. It'll taste better.

189
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,484
- Is that so, my friend?
- That's right.

190
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,738
Pat, help.

191
00:15:02,738 --> 00:15:05,002
- Pat!
- Don't drag me into this.

192
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:07,701
Pat, why don't you help?

193
00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:12,815
Cheers!

194
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:25,386
You already have my friend.

195
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:28,639
Would you mind if I ask for your...

196
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,698
Please don't tell me.

197
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:35,382
Jackass!

198
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:37,191
Not you.

199
00:15:39,974 --> 00:15:42,068
I meant Pat's sister.

200
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:43,779
I like her.

201
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:45,360
I won't allow it.

202
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,325
Hey, she's my sister. Let me deal with him.

203
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,974
But Wai is being serious.

204
00:15:52,974 --> 00:15:57,805
When he found out Pa was your sister, he couldn't even get over her.

205
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:02,885
I'll leave it to her decision.

206
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:04,979
If you want to hit on her, just hurry.

207
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:08,410
I think she's been talking to someone lately.

208
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,420
Who is it? Her faculty friend?

209
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,979
I have no idea. She keeps smiling when messaging that person.

210
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:18,690
That's okay. You still have me.

211
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:27,622
Guys, my peer mentor gave me a snack again.

212
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:30,658
It's my favorite.

213
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:33,359
Can we skip to the day they reveal the peer mentors?

214
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,525
What's the matter, Noey? Are you jealous?

215
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:39,044
No. I got snacks from my peer mentor, too.

216
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:41,904
But I just found out who my peer mentor is.

217
00:16:41,904 --> 00:16:43,556
Who?

218
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:44,847
Best.

219
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:47,957
The faculty's hot guy, Best?

220
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:49,777
Why do you seem disappointed then?

221
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:51,126
That's good.

222
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:57,206
He always gave me smiles. I thought he was going to hit on me.

223
00:16:57,206 --> 00:16:59,754
But they were just smiles for his peer mentee.

224
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:01,807
What are you laughing at?

225
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,647
Sorry. We didn't order this.

226
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:13,307
Somebody ordered it for you. But I'm not allowed to say who it is.

227
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:18,151
Someone ordered it.

228
00:17:18,151 --> 00:17:21,755
Stop imagining things. Just heal your broken heart.

229
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:24,628
Nice mouth.

230
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:29,798
Guys, eat.

231
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,633
- You can start.
- You go first.

232
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:36,030
- No. I'm on a diet.
- So you gave it to me?

233
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:50,594
What did the doctor say?

234
00:17:50,594 --> 00:17:53,600
Nothing to worry about. It's healed.

235
00:17:55,823 --> 00:18:00,190
But he said I needed someone to support me closely when I walk.

236
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,625
I need a boyfriend to help.

237
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,983
Was he being that specific?

238
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:12,200
It's like my wound just popped open.

239
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,560
Faculty of engineering, but majoring in performing arts, huh?

240
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,140
- Stop with the act.
- That hurts.

241
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,356
There, there.

242
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:21,400
I'll pretend I believe you then. I'll help.

243
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,110
[X-Ray]

244
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,828
As you can see, we are...

245
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:38,918
dating.

246
00:18:46,482 --> 00:18:48,482
Aren't you surprised at all?

247
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,978
I kind of took the hint.

248
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:57,776
Since the day I saw you two in that musical instrument shop.

249
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,996
Wait. You saw us?

250
00:19:01,995 --> 00:19:06,058
The day you two were in front of the house and poking his dimple, I saw that too.

251
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:08,343
I told you someone could see.

252
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:11,998
But your parents don't know, do they?

253
00:19:11,998 --> 00:19:13,907
If they did, things would have gone down in flames by now.

254
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:16,840
And you're the cause of their conflict, right?

255
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:20,446
Wait a minute. How could I be the cause?

256
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:23,176
You moved to work with his family.

257
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,463
That's what your dad told you?

258
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:29,460
Isn't it true?

259
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,047
Okay.

260
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:38,093
I did have a small problem with your dad, but I was the one that resigned.

261
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,548
I wasn't being bought by anyone.

262
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:46,566
How come you ended up working with my family?

263
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,532
It was during an economic downturn.

264
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:52,643
It was so hard for me to get a new job.

265
00:19:52,643 --> 00:19:55,065
Your dad stepped in and helped me.

266
00:19:57,776 --> 00:20:00,136
Can I ask you one more thing then?

267
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:04,989
Have you heard about the bid-rigging Pat's dad did?

268
00:20:06,518 --> 00:20:08,964
Where did you even get that from?

269
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:12,914
Pat's dad made a very good deal with a supplier from China.

270
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:16,084
That's how he could offer a better price. That's all.

271
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:19,039
I took care of that account. I know.

272
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:27,405
So we've been misunderstanding each other all along?

273
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:29,436
No.

274
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:33,470
Your parents, they both know; they know everything.

275
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,823
They do?

276
00:20:35,823 --> 00:20:38,870
Why are they so mad at each other then?

277
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,360
I don't really know the reason.

278
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,103
But they hate each other's guts. I don't think it's just business.

279
00:20:57,836 --> 00:21:01,357
I'm glad though.

280
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:06,180
Thinking about your parents' generation and how much they fight each other,

281
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,315
but when it comes to the children's generation, they get along.

282
00:21:11,698 --> 00:21:16,187
I think one day, things will get better.

283
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:18,191
I hope so too.

284
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:20,995
Right?

285
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:27,157
And your wife?

286
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:30,564
Right. Let me call her.

287
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,351
My phone is with her.

288
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:45,079
Pat, how can we tell if someone really likes us, not just because it's their duty?

289
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:49,124
Who are you talking about? Someone hitting on you?

290
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:54,528
I don't even know if I'm being hit on or not.

291
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,877
Then use your four signs to test just like you told me.

292
00:21:59,877 --> 00:22:02,610
The four signs we tested with Ink.

293
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,334
Four signs?

294
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,975
You're right.

295
00:22:08,975 --> 00:22:11,880
Ink didn't show any.

296
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,305
And Ink doesn't like you that way.

297
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:16,545
The signs actually work.

298
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:19,724
I should just go test them.

299
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:22,245
Wait! What about my story?

300
00:22:22,245 --> 00:22:24,466
It's about your parents.

301
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,325
Sorry, I called you out on such short notice.

302
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:33,449
It's fine.

303
00:22:33,449 --> 00:22:37,050
I always wanted to train you on how to use film cameras but never got a chance.

304
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,097
Right?

305
00:22:38,097 --> 00:22:39,597
Okay.

306
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:44,062
First, we open it.

307
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:48,990
Press it to open and take this off.

308
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,469
Can you grab me the roll film?

309
00:22:56,635 --> 00:23:01,222
Sign number one, when you two touch, the physical response will give a hint.

310
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:05,079
When you finish taking a photo, you must turn it right here.

311
00:23:05,662 --> 00:23:08,156
Then you can continue.

312
00:23:08,156 --> 00:23:09,748
Okay.

313
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:13,419
- Should we start?
- Sure.

314
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,349
I want to do some portraits.

315
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:20,632
Can you be my model?

316
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:23,039
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Come on.

317
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,154
Fine.

318
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,097
You stand right here.

319
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:38,340
If you're still not sure, move on to sign number two.

320
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,016
Eyes don't lie. Look into the eyes.

321
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:48,992
Okay.

322
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:53,376
Step back a bit.

323
00:23:55,122 --> 00:23:56,902
Where is Pa?

324
00:23:56,902 --> 00:24:00,416
- Are you sure she will be here?
- Pat told me she's here.

325
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,871
If you don't believe me, we can just leave.

326
00:24:04,188 --> 00:24:06,988
1, 2, 3.

327
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:11,171
Hey! She's right there taking photos like Pat said.

328
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,719
- Can I leave now?
- Hold on!

329
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,619
Stay with me.

330
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,569
You're too much.

331
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:27,864
I'm ready.

332
00:24:27,864 --> 00:24:29,635
Pa.

333
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:34,080
Hi. What are you guys doing here?

334
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,683
We're out jogging.

335
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,902
And you?

336
00:24:38,902 --> 00:24:41,711
I'm taking a photography lesson with Ink.

337
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:47,123
I can lend you a hand if you want.

338
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:48,674
Do you need a model?

339
00:24:48,674 --> 00:24:51,909
- We're good.
- Should I stand here?

340
00:24:52,687 --> 00:24:54,296
Okay then.

341
00:24:58,662 --> 00:25:00,293
It's good.

342
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:02,794
So I can teach you more conveniently.

343
00:25:04,037 --> 00:25:06,563
Let's get started.

344
00:25:06,563 --> 00:25:10,262
Set up the model like I told you.

345
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:16,321
When you two touch, the physical response will give a hint.

346
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:27,959
Are we ready?

347
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,443
Sure.

348
00:25:29,443 --> 00:25:31,419
Step forward, please.

349
00:25:32,255 --> 00:25:35,773
1, 2, 3.

350
00:25:38,315 --> 00:25:41,015
1, 2, 3.

351
00:25:41,015 --> 00:25:43,080
Okay. Thank you.

352
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,080
- Let's go take photos over there.
- Sure.

353
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,323
Eyes don't lie. Look into the eyes.

354
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,240
You're very expressive.

355
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:01,309
I want to know if she's dating someone.

356
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:05,586
- Ask her.
- Isn't it too much?

357
00:26:05,586 --> 00:26:08,175
Pa, why don't you ask your date to be your model?

358
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:13,849
Why? Is your friend hitting on my sister, Pran?

359
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:18,123
No.

360
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:20,170
We were just asking.

361
00:26:21,877 --> 00:26:25,691
We have something else to do. We'll leave now.

362
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:29,956
Let me know once you developed the film. I want to see it.

363
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:31,697
Of course.

364
00:26:31,697 --> 00:26:33,877
- Thank you and goodbye.
- See you.

365
00:26:33,877 --> 00:26:35,789
See you, Pran.

366
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:39,549
Why did you give up so easily?

367
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,753
Do you remember when Pat said Pa was talking to someone?

368
00:26:44,753 --> 00:26:46,767
I think it's Ink.

369
00:26:49,384 --> 00:26:51,384
How do you know?

370
00:26:52,297 --> 00:26:55,181
Look at those murderous eyes she was giving me.

371
00:26:55,181 --> 00:27:00,266
Pat used to give me the same look every time I was with you.

372
00:27:11,981 --> 00:27:15,796
I think my heart just broke. Treat me to some drinks.

373
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,343
That's okay, man.

374
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:21,984
No sobbing.

375
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,930
Get over the girl.

376
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:26,823
Don't die just yet.

377
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:28,683
You're overreacting.

378
00:27:28,683 --> 00:27:30,710
So what's your answer?

379
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,790
Yes?

380
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,183
Your date.

381
00:27:35,183 --> 00:27:37,180
Are you dating someone?

382
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,120
I'm not. But I do have someone I like.

383
00:27:48,344 --> 00:27:51,178
I wonder who that would be.

384
00:27:55,072 --> 00:27:57,072
Who is it?

385
00:27:58,454 --> 00:28:01,299
Should we go check out over there?

386
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,888
Sure. Let's go.

387
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,900
You've known my dad since university, haven't you?

388
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,301
Can I ask you something?

389
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:20,243
What's the conflict between him and the next door?

390
00:28:20,243 --> 00:28:23,113
The business, I guess.

391
00:28:24,397 --> 00:28:26,311
The business?

392
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:28,646
That's it? Are you sure there's nothing else?

393
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:32,966
I don't think so.

394
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:35,761
They didn't even fight back in school.

395
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:37,656
School?

396
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:42,255
My dad and Pran's parent used to go to the same school?

397
00:28:44,048 --> 00:28:45,748
Yes.

398
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,415
He never told me anything about this.

399
00:28:50,415 --> 00:28:53,007
I won't poke my nose in anyone's business.

400
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:54,919
You can leave now.

401
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:57,884
Please, tell me more.

402
00:28:57,884 --> 00:28:59,295
What's the story?

403
00:28:59,295 --> 00:29:02,550
If you want to know, go ask your dad.

404
00:29:06,073 --> 00:29:08,010
Come on.

405
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,704
Give me your phone. I'll call him for you.

406
00:29:11,481 --> 00:29:13,211
Thank you.

407
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:21,971
Did you hear him right?

408
00:29:21,971 --> 00:29:25,394
Your dad and my dad used to be friends?

409
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:28,632
I did. The professor said it himself.

410
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:30,769
It seemed like he was hiding something.

411
00:29:31,648 --> 00:29:36,084
As far as I can recall, my dad went to an international school.

412
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:40,760
And my mom went to school nearby.

413
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:45,639
That might be a lie. They didn't want you to know they knew each other.

414
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:48,356
Don't you think your dad was the one that lied to you?

415
00:29:48,356 --> 00:29:50,357
My dad really graduated from our high school.

416
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:53,831
I saw his graduation paper. You find your dad's.

417
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:56,289
I know.

418
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:58,561
I'm looking for it right now.

419
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:02,609
Why don't you come to help me if you want it fast? My parents aren't home.

420
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:06,293
Don't challenge me. We might end up doing something else instead.

421
00:30:06,293 --> 00:30:08,102
Doing what?

422
00:30:10,512 --> 00:30:11,988
Hello.

423
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,449
Pat.

424
00:30:18,095 --> 00:30:19,574
Pat.

425
00:30:20,614 --> 00:30:21,508
Hello.

426
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:24,006
Doing this!

427
00:30:24,006 --> 00:30:25,821
What are you doing?

428
00:30:25,821 --> 00:30:30,405
I told you not to challenge me.

429
00:30:33,847 --> 00:30:36,875
Help me find it before my parents get back.

430
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,641
Where should I look?

431
00:30:38,641 --> 00:30:40,120
Right there.

432
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,721
Can you see?

433
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:52,733
If we can find this evidence, we will know what the quarrel is all about.

434
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,560
- What are you up to?
- Found it.

435
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,194
"Parakul's Student Book."

436
00:31:21,194 --> 00:31:24,400
"He is a serious and hard-working child. But he doesn't have many friends."

437
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,725
Give it back. Or you can just go home.

438
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:27,864
Keep looking.

439
00:31:27,864 --> 00:31:30,233
Okay. I'll quit playing.

440
00:32:02,543 --> 00:32:05,509
[Prasertsilp High School]
[Certificate For Beauty Queen Contestant, 1994]

441
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:07,377
Did you ever attend a beauty queen contest?

442
00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:10,536
- Aren't you going to stop playing?
- I am not playing.

443
00:32:10,536 --> 00:32:12,695
This is our high school.

444
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:15,171
If not yours, then whose is it?

445
00:32:17,998 --> 00:32:22,901
"A Beauty Queen Contestant, 1994."

446
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,969
Maybe it's my mom's.

447
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:35,500
So your mom and my dad went to the same school?

448
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:43,798
Shit!

449
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:45,684
My dad is here.

450
00:32:45,684 --> 00:32:48,648
- What are we gonna do?
- Put them all back.

451
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,860
Where did you find this?

452
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,730
Quickly.

453
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,370
Asshole, leave!

454
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:05,777
Why are you just standing there?

455
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,383
Hush up!

456
00:33:09,592 --> 00:33:11,609
We were almost busted.

457
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:13,583
What are we going to do now?

458
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,349
Should we just ask them frankly?

459
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:18,363
If they wanted to tell us, they would have done so years ago.

460
00:33:23,736 --> 00:33:27,849
If we really want to find out, there's only one way.

461
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:33,767
But you should go back to your house for now.

462
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:37,680
- Come with me.
- No. Just go already.

463
00:33:52,681 --> 00:33:55,388
Damn! I missed this place.

464
00:33:55,388 --> 00:33:57,322
That's too much.

465
00:33:57,322 --> 00:33:59,905
You just graduated less than two years ago.

466
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,649
Take it seriously. It's your punishment for being late.

467
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:11,049
You guys are undisciplined.

468
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,168
How can you manage to be late every day?

469
00:34:18,128 --> 00:34:20,028
Why are you smiling?

470
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:22,525
Are you thinking of when I was being punished?

471
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:23,798
How did you know that?

472
00:34:23,798 --> 00:34:28,604
Because you always made this face when I got punished.

473
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:31,652
I was just looking.

474
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:36,246
You're confessing that you always looked at me.

475
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:42,918
This place has changed a lot in just two years.

476
00:34:45,773 --> 00:34:48,998
You're avoiding the topic.

477
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,006
Why didn't you say goodbye before you left?

478
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,155
I was broken-hearted.

479
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,260
Because of me or your mom?

480
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:18,057
Hello, Teacher.

481
00:35:18,057 --> 00:35:19,780
Who are you?

482
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,231
It's me, Pat. Don't you remember?

483
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:24,981
Of course, I do.

484
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:28,400
You two were the legendary rivals.

485
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,697
How come you showed up together though?

486
00:35:33,523 --> 00:35:37,608
It's a long story. If I tell you now, it would be like a romantic movie.

487
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:46,065
We just learned that my mom and his dad attended this school.

488
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:49,200
We want to know if that's true.

489
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,818
That was a long time ago.

490
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:55,251
I think I was preparing to get a teaching certificate then.

491
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:57,656
You must ask Ms. Payao about this.

492
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,590
She's been here since the school was established.

493
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:06,582
But she's out right now. She should be back in the afternoon.

494
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:07,855
All right.

495
00:36:07,855 --> 00:36:10,306
We will wait for Ms. Payao.

496
00:36:10,306 --> 00:36:12,586
Are we bothering your time?

497
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:13,677
It's fine.

663
00:47:49,893 --> 00:47:51,855
Let's start again.

664
00:47:51,855 --> 00:47:54,788
- That's the developer.
- Developer.

665
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,112
- Stopper.
- Stopper.

666
00:47:57,112 --> 00:47:59,212
- Fixer.
- Fixer.

667
00:48:11,586 --> 00:48:13,486
What's bothering you?

668
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:18,740
Did I do something wrong?

669
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,674
No.

670
00:48:20,674 --> 00:48:23,105
You didn't do anything wrong.

671
00:48:24,662 --> 00:48:27,162
You did great, actually.

672
00:48:28,066 --> 00:48:30,466
You've been very nice to me.

673
00:48:31,157 --> 00:48:36,239
But you don't need to be this nice to me anymore.

674
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:44,795
Why? Don't you like it?

675
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:49,407
I do.

676
00:48:51,532 --> 00:48:53,932
I like it very much.

677
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:56,360
I like it so much that...

678
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,740
I thought I was special to you.

679
00:48:59,744 --> 00:49:03,169
But I just found out that...

680
00:49:03,963 --> 00:49:06,172
I'm your peer mentee.

681
00:49:06,172 --> 00:49:07,770
Yes,

682
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,150
I'm your peer mentor.

683
00:49:20,144 --> 00:49:25,204
It's my fault to think of you more than just a peer mentor.

684
00:49:30,647 --> 00:49:32,270
It's true...

685
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,710
that I'm your peer mentor.

686
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:45,865
But I had to fight everyone in our faculty to get you to be my peer mentee.

687
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:50,475
The whole faculty.

688
00:49:58,087 --> 00:50:00,587
I have always had eyes for you.

689
00:50:04,223 --> 00:50:07,164
I just wasn't sure what you thought of me.

690
00:50:10,203 --> 00:50:12,303
Since when?

691
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,835
High school.

692
00:50:14,835 --> 00:50:16,643
You're lying.

693
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,670
Look at this and tell me if I'm lying.

694
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,819
I looked funny.

695
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:24,968
No, you're cute.

696
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:30,529
You were never just a peer mentee to me.

697
00:50:32,427 --> 00:50:34,427
What am I to you then?

698
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:38,936
A little sister.

699
00:50:38,936 --> 00:50:41,272
Seriously.

700
00:50:43,843 --> 00:50:45,843
You are...

701
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:53,017
someone with the smiles I want to keep to myself only.

702
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:54,930
Can I do that?

703
00:50:55,978 --> 00:50:57,895
Can I?

704
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:07,290
Ink.

705
00:51:08,414 --> 00:51:10,325
Can I?

706
00:51:11,244 --> 00:51:13,023
Can I?

707
00:51:20,183 --> 00:51:22,086
Are you blushing?

708
00:51:22,086 --> 00:51:25,060
Look here. Why were you making that face?

709
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:28,920
[Fashionisland]

710
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,189
- Here.
- What?

711
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:33,935
- Let's share it.
- You can have it.

712
00:51:33,935 --> 00:51:38,338
I mentioned your guitar once and now you want to play it again?

713
00:51:38,338 --> 00:51:41,812
I brought it here to do the action setting.

714
00:51:41,812 --> 00:51:45,177
It's old. It needs extra care.

715
00:51:45,177 --> 00:51:47,711
Have you heard about Pa?

716
00:51:50,901 --> 00:51:53,284
Have you heard about Pa?

717
00:51:53,284 --> 00:51:55,284
I have.

718
00:51:55,284 --> 00:51:57,784
Wai actually found out right then.

719
00:51:57,784 --> 00:52:00,234
The day Ink and Pa went out to take photos.

720
00:52:01,045 --> 00:52:04,137
Poor Wai. He made a really sad face that day.

721
00:52:04,137 --> 00:52:05,920
Poor us.

722
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,941
Our parents broke up and now we're caught in the middle.

723
00:52:08,941 --> 00:52:10,804
What should we do now?

724
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:18,898
They are enraged at each other. I don't think their relationship ended well.

725
00:52:22,676 --> 00:52:27,623
Or maybe we are siblings like in those TV dramas.

726
00:52:27,623 --> 00:52:29,202
You're crazy.

727
00:52:29,202 --> 00:52:31,104
- You are.
- Why?

728
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:35,342
Don't you want me as a sibling? I take care of my younger siblings really well.

729
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:37,937
Call me big bro.

730
00:52:38,893 --> 00:52:40,576
A big brother like you?

731
00:52:40,576 --> 00:52:43,015
You can't even eat without making a mess.

732
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:50,210
Hurry up. We need to hit the supermarket after this.

733
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,486
Here. Have a bite.

734
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:57,779
- Just eat.
- This piece isn't cooked yet.

735
00:52:57,779 --> 00:53:00,211
Wait until it's cooked.

736
00:53:00,211 --> 00:53:02,256
They say if you buy a ring, you get a gemstone for free.

737
00:53:02,256 --> 00:53:05,351
But if you call me big bro, you get both a ring and me.

738
00:53:05,351 --> 00:53:08,268
Can't you just call me big bro once?

739
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,850
Why would I want you as a big brother?

740
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:13,092
Why wouldn't you want that?

741
00:53:13,092 --> 00:53:14,581
I'm a good caretaker.

742
00:53:14,581 --> 00:53:16,267
Call me big bro.

743
00:53:16,267 --> 00:53:17,999
Big bro.

744
00:53:18,819 --> 00:53:20,371
Big bro.

745
00:53:20,371 --> 00:53:23,232
- Call me big bro.
- Your dad is here.

746
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,705
- Are you having fun?
- What?

747
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,507
Don't play like that, little bro.

748
00:53:31,507 --> 00:53:33,838
That wasn't funny at all.

749
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:35,363
Pat!

750
00:53:42,227 --> 00:53:44,485
What's going on between you two?

751
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,625
We're friends. We're just playing.

752
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:54,591
What kind of friend plays like that?

753
00:53:55,698 --> 00:53:58,498
When will you stop lying to me?

754
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:02,491
I am not lying, Papa.

755
00:54:02,491 --> 00:54:04,148
It's...

756
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:09,620
We're just playing around.

757
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,947
- Do you think I'm so stupid?
- Uncle, please calm...

758
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:12,108
Uncle, please calm...

759
00:54:12,108 --> 00:54:14,232
Papa, stop.

760
00:54:14,232 --> 00:54:16,533
Let's talk about this at home.

761
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:20,134
Calm down. Let's go.

762
00:54:20,134 --> 00:54:21,853
Papa.

763
00:54:21,853 --> 00:54:23,489
What?

764
00:54:25,925 --> 00:54:28,025
You want to know the truth?

765
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:35,190
We are boyfriends.

766
00:54:41,026 --> 00:54:42,298
Pat.

767
00:54:42,298 --> 00:54:44,857
We are boyfriends. Hear that?

768
00:54:44,857 --> 00:54:47,899
You know the story between his house and ours, Pat.

769
00:54:47,899 --> 00:54:50,029
I do.

770
00:54:50,029 --> 00:54:52,548
And I know more than you let on.

771
00:54:52,548 --> 00:54:54,776
What do you know?

772
00:54:54,776 --> 00:54:56,776
You want me to say it?

773
00:54:58,588 --> 00:54:59,687
About you and his mom?

774
00:54:59,687 --> 00:55:01,800
What are you saying, Pat?

775
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:05,060
Papa. Go home!

776
00:55:06,151 --> 00:55:08,351
Pat, you too.

777
00:55:15,301 --> 00:55:18,145
No. Go talk to your dad.

778
00:55:19,053 --> 00:55:20,174
Are you okay?

779
00:55:20,174 --> 00:55:22,540
You should clear things up with your dad.

780
00:55:24,476 --> 00:55:27,106
- No, I'm okay.
- I said go talk to him.

781
00:55:27,106 --> 00:55:30,203
- It's okay.
- I said talk to him!

782
00:55:31,091 --> 00:55:32,794
Go!

783
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:23,810
Pat.

784
00:56:25,084 --> 00:56:26,212
Say sorry to Papa.

785
00:56:26,212 --> 00:56:27,831
He should be the one to say sorry.

786
00:56:27,831 --> 00:56:29,156
What did you just say?

787
00:56:29,156 --> 00:56:32,073
I know all about the lies you told us.

788
00:56:32,073 --> 00:56:34,345
When did I ever lie to you, Pat?

789
00:56:34,345 --> 00:56:37,981
You and Pran's mom used to be friends.

790
00:56:37,981 --> 00:56:39,541
Who told you about this?

791
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:41,136
It doesn't matter.

792
00:56:41,136 --> 00:56:43,540
You can't take it out on me.

793
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,253
She and you didn't end well.

794
00:56:45,253 --> 00:56:47,731
But you can't stop me from seeing Pran.

795
00:56:47,731 --> 00:56:50,270
Pat, what are you saying?

796
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:54,058
You and Pran's mom used to go out, didn't you?

797
00:56:56,173 --> 00:56:58,073
Your mom is inside.

798
00:56:59,335 --> 00:57:01,535
Do you want me to stay with you?

799
00:57:06,575 --> 00:57:08,298
It's okay.

800
00:57:10,462 --> 00:57:13,471
Stay calm, okay?

801
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,404
Try to be nice to her.

802
00:57:18,805 --> 00:57:20,250
Yes.

803
00:57:57,435 --> 00:57:58,961
Pran.

804
00:57:59,936 --> 00:58:02,240
What happened between you and the next door?

805
00:58:06,894 --> 00:58:08,794
Nothing.

806
00:58:08,794 --> 00:58:10,910
Pran.

807
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:13,679
You become close to them, didn't you?

808
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,100
You already knew. Why are you even asking?

809
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:25,263
Pran, I'm asking because I want to hear it from you.

810
00:58:26,374 --> 00:58:29,234
You're back to being friends with the kid next door, aren't you?

811
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:33,193
We're not friends.

812
00:58:33,193 --> 00:58:36,608
Pran, don't walk away from me.

813
00:58:36,608 --> 00:58:38,790
We must talk things out.

814
00:58:54,187 --> 00:58:56,290
We are boyfriends.

815
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:58,326
Pran!

816
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,307
- How did it happen?
- Why?

817
00:59:02,307 --> 00:59:05,112
Everyone wants the truth.

818
00:59:05,112 --> 00:59:08,229
Now that you all know, why can't you take it?

819
00:59:08,229 --> 00:59:10,714
But you're aware that our house and that house...

820
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,628
I am.

821
00:59:13,335 --> 00:59:15,012
I know they are disgusting.

822
00:59:15,012 --> 00:59:18,962
They are cheaters. They did this and that to us.

823
00:59:18,962 --> 00:59:20,965
I know all of that.

824
00:59:20,965 --> 00:59:23,578
You've implanted that in my head since I could remember.

825
00:59:23,578 --> 00:59:25,632
Why did you do it if you're aware?

826
00:59:25,632 --> 00:59:27,450
Have you forgotten to save my reputation?

827
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,121
Mom.

828
00:59:30,263 --> 00:59:32,266
It isn't my duty to do so.

829
00:59:32,266 --> 00:59:34,624
You two used to date and you ended it.

830
00:59:34,624 --> 00:59:39,242
Is it even my job to be responsible for your feelings?

831
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:43,055
Pran, what are you talking about?

832
00:59:43,055 --> 00:59:45,886
Where did you hear all that from?

833
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,245
At least, I spoke out the truth.

834
00:59:52,245 --> 00:59:54,006
Unlike you.

835
00:59:55,361 --> 01:00:01,695
Pran, I didn't raise you to talk to me like this.

836
01:00:07,234 --> 01:00:09,334
Because you raised me this way,

837
01:00:10,712 --> 01:00:13,112
that's why I'm not like other kids.

838
01:00:16,497 --> 01:00:18,497
Pran.

839
01:00:34,077 --> 01:00:35,558
I...

840
01:00:36,693 --> 01:00:38,193
Pran.

841
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,015
Pran! I...

842
01:00:41,015 --> 01:00:42,856
Pran.

843
01:00:53,788 --> 01:00:55,452
Ming!

844
01:01:04,721 --> 01:01:06,724
Ming!

845
01:01:06,724 --> 01:01:08,054
What did you say to Pran?

846
01:01:08,054 --> 01:01:09,233
Why are you here?

847
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:14,187
Why can't I be here when you dared brainwash my son?

848
01:01:14,187 --> 01:01:19,107
If you want to say, how about you say all the evil things you did?

849
01:01:19,107 --> 01:01:21,078
What did he do?

850
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,801
Your dad stole my scholarship.

851
01:01:32,801 --> 01:01:34,948
He's the reason why I didn't get to go to university.

852
01:01:34,948 --> 01:01:36,789
Hey!

853
01:01:36,789 --> 01:01:38,849
Do you really think I don't know that?

854
01:01:38,849 --> 01:01:43,853
Teacher Dang told me that you said I didn't want to go to university.

855
01:01:43,853 --> 01:01:46,564
So you could be the one to take it.

856
01:01:47,687 --> 01:01:51,087
I don't even want to recall this.

857
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:54,004
But you meddled with my son first.

858
01:01:54,004 --> 01:01:57,365
No more hiding and saving anyone's face then.

859
01:02:00,167 --> 01:02:04,451
Pa, is that true?

860
01:02:04,451 --> 01:02:05,693
Pat.

861
01:02:05,693 --> 01:02:07,348
Pa.

862
01:02:08,296 --> 01:02:11,529
You're not the only person who wants to make his dad proud.

863
01:02:11,529 --> 01:02:16,180
Are you so proud to ruin someone's life?

864
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,148
But I let you run the business and take my employee. Can't we call it even?

865
01:02:20,148 --> 01:02:24,975
Even? Do you really think it can compensate for what you did?

866
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:27,805
It was my whole future.

867
01:02:38,609 --> 01:02:43,566
Do you know what hurt me the most?

868
01:02:45,867 --> 01:02:50,310
You took on the business after your father.

869
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:54,824
If you only wished to run a family business, why did you take my scholarship?

870
01:03:04,031 --> 01:03:10,512
From now on, don't tell your children to hate the people next door.

871
01:03:15,251 --> 01:03:21,467
Because the most disgusting person here is your father.

872
01:03:38,321 --> 01:03:39,815
Pa.

873
01:03:43,613 --> 01:03:48,982
I had to hate Pran, to compete against him,

874
01:03:51,504 --> 01:03:53,504
because of you?

875
01:03:56,314 --> 01:03:58,314
That's the reason?

876
01:04:06,046 --> 01:04:08,146
Pa.

877
01:04:12,496 --> 01:04:14,393
Pat.

878
01:04:21,392 --> 01:04:23,118
Pat.

879
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:30,906
Back then, your grandfather put so much pressure on him.

880
01:04:30,906 --> 01:04:33,393
And he was very young.

881
01:04:39,146 --> 01:04:42,813
We all have something we want to go back and fix.

882
01:04:42,813 --> 01:04:47,573
But he can't fix his past, and I must be the one who has to take it. Right?

883
01:04:47,573 --> 01:04:49,480
Mom!

884
01:04:50,874 --> 01:04:52,548
Pat.

885
01:06:57,158 --> 01:06:59,297
I can't take it anymore.

886
01:07:02,205 --> 01:07:04,405
Let's get away from here.

887
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:54,250
[Bad Buddy Series]

888
01:07:54,256 --> 01:07:57,615
Do you think they are looking for us?

889
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,746
Can we not talk about it?

890
01:07:59,746 --> 01:08:06,962
We have the sun, the breeze, the sea, you, and me.

891
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:10,380
Being with you feels like I have freedom.

892
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:16,034
I know that sooner or later, we need to go home.

893
01:08:16,034 --> 01:08:19,184
I just want to be here as long as we can.

894
01:08:19,184 --> 01:08:21,283
Can I kiss you?

895
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:28,290
