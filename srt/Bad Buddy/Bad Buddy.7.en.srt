00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:17,277
Come back and have a meal with us when you have time.

168
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,271
You've been gone.

169
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:20,547
Sure.

170
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,973
- Did you hear what Pa said?
- What?

171
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:26,278
- He told us to eat at home sometimes.
- Sure.

172
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:28,127
I'll take Pa with me.

173
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,552
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

174
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:33,056
- Say goodbye to Pa.
- Bye, Pa.

175
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:34,531
Bye.

176
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,994
Brother, why didn't you tell Pa that you don't want to play rugby anymore?

177
00:11:38,994 --> 00:11:43,097
It's not like I don't want to. I'm just lazy.

178
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:50,442
By the way, the peer mentors in my faculty gave snacks to us peer mentees.

179
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:52,924
Now I have to guess who my peer mentor is.

180
00:11:52,924 --> 00:11:55,104
The problem is I have no idea.

181
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:57,459
I can't tell from the handwriting if it's a girl or a boy.

182
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,347
Help me figure it out.

183
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:06,521
"Enjoy the snack."

184
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:08,942
It's a guy for sure.

185
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:10,977
How do you know?

186
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:13,592
It's nice quality notepaper.

187
00:12:14,664 --> 00:12:16,764
It smells good, too.

188
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:20,022
What did you get?

189
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,658
A cupcake.

190
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:27,884
- You've got some diamonds too.
- Ridiculous.

191
00:12:27,884 --> 00:12:30,926
- Fake diamonds.
- Right.

192
00:12:30,926 --> 00:12:35,220
I have had cakes from this shop before. They're expensive.

193
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,800
You're being hit on for sure.

194
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,557
Excuse me. How dare you give any advice about flirting?

195
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:44,921
I've never seen you succeed.

196
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,139
Nan, a cheerleader from 8th grade.

197
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:54,820
The one that tricked you into buying her items in online games?

198
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,060
Okay, I guess that counts.

199
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:05,691
- That hurt.
- Just go back to your zone.

200
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,609
Who sent you messages?

201
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:14,811
Just a friend.

202
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:16,549
I'll be right back.

203
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:19,880
Where are you going?

204
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,925
Kids aren't allowed to know.

205
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,552
Did someone in this room send me a message saying, "I'm so lonely. Can you come over?"

206
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:41,434
You must have come to the wrong room.

207
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:44,305
I just asked if you were available.

208
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:46,835
Depends on what you're asking me to do.

209
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:53,717
Do you know how to change the printhead?

210
00:13:53,717 --> 00:13:57,794
The ink doesn't come out nicely. I'm too lazy to go to the shop.

211
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,497
You asked me here for this thing? You don't need me for this.

212
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:13,030
But I want you to do it for me.

213
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,938
Can you?

214
00:14:19,512 --> 00:14:21,081
Of course.

215
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,588
You're lucky the printhead for this model can be changed so easily.

216
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:33,730
You don't need to bring it to the shop.

217
00:14:58,361 --> 00:14:59,922
Done.

218
00:15:01,242 --> 00:15:03,635
I'm the legendary mechanic.

219
00:15:04,507 --> 00:15:06,620
I'm a big boy.

220
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,735
All right, big boy. You're good.

221
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:18,610
What's that?

222
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,823
Wow! You're making me hungry.

223
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:26,049
A curry dish. Does it smell good?

224
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:27,688
It does.

225
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:35,494
I've always wanted to cook a favorite dish for someone I like.

226
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:40,021
Do you like curry?

227
00:15:40,902 --> 00:15:42,403
I do.

228
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:53,521
Do you like me?

229
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,672
No.

230
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,161
I just ate.

231
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:09,092
Sorry about that.

232
00:16:16,403 --> 00:16:18,020
Good.

233
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:38,479
So this is how you're gonna play, huh?

234
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:45,112
Have you lost it?

235
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:48,494
Boxing practice.

236
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:51,670
You're insane.

237
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,940
Hi, senior.

238
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,933
Can you please sign these for us?

239
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,369
You can't just ask.

240
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,490
You guys must give me something in return.

241
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,950
What is it?

242
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,519
We can dance to "Roasted Chicken" for you.

243
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,799
Wait!

244
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,715
Please don't. Just give me your chat IDs.

245
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:28,733
You're good.

246
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,881
Hi, Bas.

247
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:33,787
How about I give you my chat ID instead?

248
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:41,726
You know the rules. Don't harass the freshmen.

249
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:43,456
What are you doing?

250
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:45,593
I know. I was just teasing them.

251
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:48,264
Give it here. I'll sign it for you.

252
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:50,898
Do it quickly.

253
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,820
Give it to me.

254
00:17:56,915 --> 00:17:58,038
Are you done?

255
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:00,332
Go get something to eat.

256
00:18:00,332 --> 00:18:03,770
Let's go, guys.

257
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,983
Enjoy your meal.

258
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,533
Show me the Roasted Chicken dance first.

259
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:18,760
Ink.

260
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,606
Just kidding. Let me sign it for you.

261
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,282
- Here.
- Thank you.

262
00:18:25,282 --> 00:18:27,425
Do you want it, too?

263
00:18:27,425 --> 00:18:29,645
Thank you.

264
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:32,390
Let me know if something like this happens again.

265
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,650
- I'll deal with them for you.
- Thank you.

266
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,194
Bye now. Take care.

267
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:38,774
Bye-bye.

268
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:44,267
Your sophomore friend is husband material.

269
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:46,767
She's so cool.

270
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,547
I'm taking care of backdrops.

271
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:56,538
Why am I helping the sound team make the music?

272
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:59,194
Teamwork, you know?

273
00:18:59,194 --> 00:19:02,064
You might get some ideas for your backdrops.

274
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,536
All right. Tell me.

275
00:19:05,536 --> 00:19:07,402
Toto told me the synopsis.

276
00:19:07,402 --> 00:19:15,090
It's about love in the midst of the conflict between two families.

277
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,876
The story of two guys who were born next door to each other,

278
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:24,029
yet their families do not get along.

279
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:37,745
They need to stop their hearts from falling for each other.

280
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:45,816
But fate always brings them to meet.

281
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:53,845
In the end, they just can't resist their feelings.

282
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:59,358
Therefore, all they can do is keep their relationship hidden from other people.

283
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:02,618
- Excuse me. Who is Mr. Pran?
- That's me

284
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,516
Your order has arrived.

285
00:20:04,516 --> 00:20:06,560
What did you order?

286
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:09,319
I didn't.

287
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:11,198
What's that?

288
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,616
A snack?

289
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,191
Who ordered this for you?

290
00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:19,665
From P?

291
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:23,547
- Who are you here for?
- I have an order for Mr. Pat.

292
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:25,161
Pat.

293
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,113
Are you hungry, Professor?

294
00:20:36,113 --> 00:20:38,698
Turn to page 8.

295
00:20:38,698 --> 00:20:40,901
From two people who can't be friends,

296
00:20:40,901 --> 00:20:44,947
to two people who can't be just friends.

297
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:49,771
Why are you smiling?

298
00:20:52,997 --> 00:20:54,900
I'm just imagining it.

299
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,533
It's a dramatic story.

300
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:05,098
You're a good storyteller. I could see every scene clearly.

301
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,739
I got it now. I'll go find more information on it.

302
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,931
You go ahead and get started.

303
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:13,410
Fine.

304
00:21:21,953 --> 00:21:23,853
Excuse me.

305
00:21:23,853 --> 00:21:26,212
Which one are you looking for?

306
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:27,894
This one?

307
00:21:32,372 --> 00:21:36,283
I'm looking for a guide on how to make someone reveal his true feelings.

308
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,388
I only have "How to read people's minds in 7 seconds."

309
00:21:44,393 --> 00:21:48,520
But now I need "How to get rid of a stalker."

310
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:58,771
Who's a stalker?

311
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:02,172
I just came to ask you about the Architecture play.

312
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:04,609
I heard there's an audition for the male lead. Right?

313
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:06,540
Can someone outside your faculty join?

314
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,414
Yes, but only good-looking guys are qualified.

315
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,080
You shouldn't sign up.

316
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,369
I didn't say I would.

317
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:23,454
Can you return the Nong Nao Doll to me tonight?

318
00:22:23,454 --> 00:22:25,673
I left it in your room.

319
00:22:26,223 --> 00:22:28,223
Nong Nao?

320
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:29,502
The oldish doll you have?

321
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:35,056
Yes. I can't sleep if I don't have Nong Nao in my arms.

322
00:22:37,028 --> 00:22:39,628
Why don't you just come get it yourself?

323
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,428
My door isn't locked.

324
00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:48,917
I'm too lazy.

325
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,483
Forget it.

326
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:53,770
Fine.

327
00:22:57,106 --> 00:23:02,290
Tonight, I'll bring it... to your room.

328
00:23:42,284 --> 00:23:43,725
Here.

329
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:48,055
Your Nong Nao Doll as promised.

330
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:51,610
Thanks.

331
00:23:55,771 --> 00:23:57,774
Are you sick?

332
00:23:57,774 --> 00:23:59,750
Have you taken any medicine?

333
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,619
Not yet.

334
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:03,446
Pa isn't here.

335
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,775
Come and sit here.

336
00:24:07,775 --> 00:24:11,371
- Are you okay?
- I am.

337
00:24:11,371 --> 00:24:13,480
Good timing.

338
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,762
I brought you a dinner box.

339
00:24:15,762 --> 00:24:18,354
Eat and take your medicines.

340
00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:21,818
There's more.

341
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,100
For you.

342
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:42,528
So fresh.

343
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:46,404
It's tasty and beneficial.

344
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:57,758
Take a break from that freshness.

345
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,374
Can you give me a sponge bath first? I'm burning hot here.

346
00:25:04,613 --> 00:25:06,383
Where's the towel?

347
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,767
You can use this instead. It's still cold.

348
00:25:14,936 --> 00:25:17,231
Tell me where you feel hot.

349
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:19,019
Here.

350
00:25:20,455 --> 00:25:23,012
- Where else?
- Here.

351
00:25:30,525 --> 00:25:32,425
Where else?

352
00:25:32,425 --> 00:25:35,957
Actually, I feel hot all over my body. In the middle.

353
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,579
All over your body?

354
00:25:44,136 --> 00:25:46,436
Why are you turning red, my friend?

355
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:49,256
Who is sick exactly?

356
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:52,674
Hey!

357
00:25:52,674 --> 00:25:54,615
What are you doing?

358
00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:58,182
You're sick. Don't be stubborn, my friend.

359
00:26:00,573 --> 00:26:04,404
Or what? What if I want to be stubborn?

360
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:09,902
If you're stubborn, my friend,

361
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,700
you will get this!

362
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,816
How do you like it?

363
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:24,563
Do you like it?

364
00:26:24,563 --> 00:26:27,620
Okay. I surrender!

365
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,868
All right! I tap out!

366
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,679
Do you still want us to be friends?

367
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,045
Do you?

368
00:27:12,624 --> 00:27:14,275
You go first.

369
00:27:15,357 --> 00:27:16,945
You go first.

370
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:19,170
You're just not brave enough.

371
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:22,896
Don't force me to.

372
00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:25,243
Well, bring it on.

373
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,740
You first.

374
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,646
- Before—
- Bring it on!

375
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:31,302
- Come on.
- You first.

376
00:27:31,302 --> 00:27:35,958
I need to pee!

377
00:27:38,794 --> 00:27:40,497
Pat, why are you shirtless?

378
00:27:40,497 --> 00:27:42,765
I'm doing my side pack workout.

379
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,190
I made you guys dinner.

380
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,104
I'll see you later, Pa.

381
00:28:01,218 --> 00:28:04,466
Congratulations! You're a member of the university team now.

382
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:06,296
Well, of course...

383
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,718
That's my friend!

384
00:28:12,473 --> 00:28:14,191
Does it mean you just got the scholarship?

385
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:15,767
Yep!

386
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:18,919
But I can't miss the practice more than twice.

387
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:20,283
Twice a month?

388
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:21,731
No.

389
00:28:21,731 --> 00:28:23,689
For this upcoming match.

390
00:28:23,689 --> 00:28:26,496
That's why I'm asking you a favor now.

391
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,118
Again?

392
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:29,971
What's up?

393
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:34,845
Can you take care of the audition for me tomorrow? I have practice.

394
00:28:34,845 --> 00:28:37,042
Ask someone else in the sound team.

395
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:38,909
Pran, come on.

396
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:42,578
Toto trusts no one else but you.

397
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:47,067
He will chew me out if I send someone else instead.

398
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:54,248
Please.

399
00:28:58,023 --> 00:28:59,518
Please.

400
00:29:00,227 --> 00:29:02,227
You're so troublesome.

401
00:29:02,227 --> 00:29:05,291
Fine. I'll do the job for you.

402
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:06,918
I'll bother you only once.

403
00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:08,878
Thank you, Sweetie.

404
00:29:10,227 --> 00:29:13,140
Oops! Sorry about that.

405
00:29:14,146 --> 00:29:15,829
What did you just do?

406
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:17,695
Muscle twitching.

407
00:29:19,415 --> 00:29:21,110
He just never quits bugging me.

408
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,069
Calm down.

409
00:29:27,116 --> 00:29:29,119
What do you need me to do again?

410
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,232
Cover the audition for me.

411
00:29:30,232 --> 00:29:33,816
How do you picture someone for the role?

412
00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:36,814
It's up to you. Toto trusts you on this.

413
00:29:36,814 --> 00:29:40,658
Fine. I can always do it for you, man. No problem.

414
00:29:40,658 --> 00:29:43,740
- Because you're so important to me.
- Of course

415
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,871
- Let's go have some beer.
- My treat.

416
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:49,039
That ball is important, too.

417
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,695
- It's the second time you did that.
- Easy, man.

418
00:29:51,695 --> 00:29:54,162
Left leg twitching.

419
00:29:54,856 --> 00:29:57,518
Just let the jinx go. We should go drink some beer.

420
00:29:57,518 --> 00:30:02,271
You just got enlisted on the university team.

421
00:30:02,271 --> 00:30:05,171
I just need to get away from him.

422
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:12,295
All right.

423
00:30:12,295 --> 00:30:14,875
The first one, please show us some xylophone skills.

424
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:25,961
Let's see your improvisation.

425
00:30:25,961 --> 00:30:30,562
Riam, I love you with all my heart.

426
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,531
I must say the last farewell now.

427
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,574
Enough.

428
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:38,409
Enough. Farewell to you.

429
00:30:42,918 --> 00:30:44,430
Okay.

430
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,998
Riam, I love you with all my heart.

431
00:30:46,998 --> 00:30:49,856
But our love must have come to an end.

432
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,562
I...

433
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,200
Goodbye, my love.

434
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,268
I just want to die.

435
00:30:57,317 --> 00:30:59,317
Next, please.

436
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:01,976
Riam, I love you with all my heart.

437
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:06,128
But our love must have come to an end.

438
00:31:06,128 --> 00:31:11,653
Please tell my father I have to say farewell to him.

439
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:17,718
He's all right.

440
00:31:17,718 --> 00:31:21,430
Can you play the xylophone for us?

441
00:31:31,404 --> 00:31:33,404
Okay. Enough.

442
00:31:33,404 --> 00:31:34,936
I like this guy.

443
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:36,956
Let's wrap up the casting. I choose this one.

444
00:31:36,956 --> 00:31:38,558
- Come on.
- Why?

445
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:42,014
There are more candidates.

446
00:31:42,014 --> 00:31:44,455
The last one, please come in.

447
00:31:44,455 --> 00:31:46,194
Thank you.

448
00:32:02,396 --> 00:32:04,996
Just freaking watch where you...

449
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,352
I am sorry.

450
00:32:10,022 --> 00:32:11,510
Did I hurt you?

451
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,574
I'm fine.

452
00:32:12,574 --> 00:32:16,524
Do you know where the audition for the Architecture play takes place?

453
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:18,620
Architecture play?

454
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:23,431
Go straight to the end of the hall and turn left.

455
00:32:23,431 --> 00:32:29,016
Would you mind giving me your chat ID...

456
00:32:31,672 --> 00:32:33,880
Damn! She's so cute.

457
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:37,691
What the hell are you doing?

458
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,759
Can I start now?

459
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:57,844
Hey, he's an Engineering student.

460
00:32:57,844 --> 00:33:01,443
And he messed with us at the camp last year.

461
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:05,258
But Engineering is allowed to apply, too.

462
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:07,169
He's right.

463
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:11,199
But this role requires someone who can play the Thai xylophone.

464
00:33:11,817 --> 00:33:13,909
Show us a song.

465
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:16,580
Where are your sticks?

466
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,970
Am I too late?

467
00:34:23,486 --> 00:34:24,852
Thanks a lot, Pa.

468
00:34:24,852 --> 00:34:28,753
If I get the role, I'll treat you a big hotpot.

469
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,766
Sure.

470
00:34:30,766 --> 00:34:32,182
Since when could you play xylophone?

471
00:34:32,182 --> 00:34:34,649
There are things about me you don't know.

472
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:38,367
If I become a protagonist in this play, you might get to know me better.

473
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,509
I don't have time for that.

474
00:34:40,509 --> 00:34:44,262
I just convinced them to choose Chart from BBA.

475
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:46,562
You just missed it.

476
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:48,039
How sad.

477
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:52,835
I just wanted to hit on you in front of people. That's all.

478
00:34:54,688 --> 00:34:57,633
Hi, there. Did you get to play Kwan or Riam?

479
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,735
I did my best, but I don't think I got the role.

480
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:05,649
- Why not?
- Because I'm an Engineering student.

481
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,320
It's okay.

482
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,400
Tell me what you want to eat. The big sister right here will pay for you.

483
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,576
- How about the noodle place out front?
- Sure.

484
00:35:13,576 --> 00:35:16,234
But I want the front row table.

485
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:18,040
The best one.

486
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,922
Of course.

487
00:35:19,922 --> 00:35:22,865
- Come with us?
- That's fine. I have a meeting later.

488
00:35:22,865 --> 00:35:25,577
Let's go have some noodles at the best table.

489
00:35:25,577 --> 00:35:27,323
See you.

490
00:35:27,323 --> 00:35:29,157
- When did you rehearse the xylophone?
- It's a secret.

491
00:35:29,157 --> 00:35:30,369
- When did you rehearse the xylophone?
- It's a secret.

492
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:39,672
Thank you.

493
00:35:48,097 --> 00:35:53,606
Here you go, the perfectly matching chopsticks.

494
00:35:53,606 --> 00:35:54,767
Thanks.

495
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:55,766
Excuse me. Can I have a noodle soup with three wontons, please?

496
00:35:55,766 --> 00:35:57,972
Excuse me. Can I have a noodle soup with three wontons, please?

497
00:35:57,972 --> 00:36:01,418
And one noodle with less soup, extra fried garlic for him, please.

498
00:36:01,418 --> 00:36:03,885
You remember how I like it?

499
00:36:03,885 --> 00:36:05,695
Because I care.

500
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:12,041
You don't have water yet? Let me pour it for you.

501
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:13,992
Drink up.

502
00:36:13,992 --> 00:36:15,254
Thanks.

503
00:36:15,254 --> 00:36:18,958
Can you unscrew the bottle cap for me? I can't do it.

504
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,334
Really?

505
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:22,315
It's so easy.

506
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:25,020
- Here.
- Thank you, my friend.

507
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,085
Try this. The meatballs here are the best.

508
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:31,679
Eat as much as you like. Let me feed you.

509
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,066
You have yours. Why did you take mine?

510
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:39,670
The meatballs here are so good.

511
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,761
Are you sulking?

512
00:36:40,761 --> 00:36:42,339
I was just playing.

513
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:45,226
Here. You can have it back. Let me feed you.

514
00:36:48,012 --> 00:36:50,612
One more bite.

515
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,135
What are you doing?

516
00:36:55,135 --> 00:36:58,234
You said you'd stop flirting. My mouth is already full. Stop feeding me.

517
00:36:58,234 --> 00:36:59,573
Take it back.

518
00:36:59,573 --> 00:37:02,056
There. Eat your food. Go on.

519
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,905
Since the big sister is paying, can I get a picture?

520
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:15,057
It's just a meal. Do you need to post an IG Story?

521
00:37:15,057 --> 00:37:17,007
Come on.

522
00:37:25,302 --> 00:37:27,402
Be careful when eating.

523
00:37:27,402 --> 00:37:29,589
Here. Let me clean your mouth for you.

524
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:32,766
- What?
- Right here.

525
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:36,505
Eat slowly.

526
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:39,397
What's wrong with you?

527
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,877
It's just so good. That's how I tell how good it is.

528
00:37:44,877 --> 00:37:46,650
Is it that good?

529
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:58,695
So the guys can start with... the chest notes.

530
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:00,520
Where is our Riam?

531
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:05,743
He hasn't shown up yet. He isn't responding to my calls or messages.

532
00:38:11,278 --> 00:38:13,209
Sorry. My class was running late.

533
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,163
That's all right. Let's start now.

534
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:18,640
Hurry. Everyone is waiting for you.

535
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:27,828
Okay. The guys rehearse... the chest notes.

536
00:38:27,828 --> 00:38:30,385
- And the girls...
- What did you just say?

537
00:38:31,746 --> 00:38:35,740
We will start from the first scene.

538
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,541
Hold on one second.

539
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:40,704
Hello.

540
00:38:40,704 --> 00:38:42,342
It's the scene...

541
00:38:42,342 --> 00:38:43,730
Shh!

542
00:38:45,037 --> 00:38:46,450
Okay.

543
00:38:47,162 --> 00:38:49,008
Fine.

544
00:38:49,008 --> 00:38:51,425
You guys continue. I'll be right back.

545
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:53,386
Sure.

546
00:38:59,468 --> 00:39:03,564
All right. Let's divide into two groups.

547
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:31,333
What? I'm not in the mood to play.

548
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:34,320
I don't always come to play.

549
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,215
Why are you here then?

550
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:49,137
What is it?

551
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:52,784
I thought I'd ask you to clean my face for me.

552
00:39:52,784 --> 00:39:56,574
Then I saw you here looking so glum and I changed my mind.

553
00:39:57,705 --> 00:39:58,847
Stop it.

554
00:39:58,847 --> 00:40:01,080
There's nothing on my face.

555
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,840
Damn it, Pat!

556
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,735
What are you playing?

557
00:40:16,735 --> 00:40:19,304
There is now. Can I clean it now?

558
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,143
Do you really need to do this?

559
00:40:22,143 --> 00:40:24,649
I want to clean it for you.

560
00:40:24,649 --> 00:40:25,949
I can do it myself.

561
00:40:25,949 --> 00:40:28,014
But I want to do it for you.

562
00:40:28,014 --> 00:40:29,917
Put it down.

563
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:42,408
Bring your face closer to me.

564
00:40:44,923 --> 00:40:47,023
Come here.

565
00:40:47,867 --> 00:40:49,695
That's it.

566
00:40:55,545 --> 00:40:57,351
You're good now.

567
00:40:57,351 --> 00:40:59,867
My teacher taught me well.

568
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,528
Get closer.

569
00:41:11,528 --> 00:41:13,677
You get closer.

570
00:41:13,677 --> 00:41:15,039
Fine.

571
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,694
- Do it.
- You do it.

572
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,611
Hold on.

573
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:30,134
What was that?

574
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,284
A triangle.

575
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:35,885
Oh yeah? I thought it was a heart shape.

576
00:41:35,885 --> 00:41:38,951
Which one do you prefer?

577
00:41:40,914 --> 00:41:42,914
What about you?

578
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:46,436
Just give up.

579
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:49,115
- You say it first.
- No. You say it first.

580
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:51,084
You say it first.

581
00:41:51,084 --> 00:41:52,630
You do it, Babe.

582
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,513
I introduced you to facial cleaning. You must give in.

583
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,423
It's me, Pran.

584
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:00,648
Nice plan.

585
00:42:00,648 --> 00:42:03,270
There was no plan. It's the truth!

586
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,999
- You're too much.
- No.

587
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:09,990
Go hide. Just hide. That's Wai and he didn't say he'd come.

588
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:14,200
Just hide. Hide, hide, hide...

589
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,351
Pran, are you sleeping?

590
00:42:28,052 --> 00:42:30,052
I was in the bathroom.

591
00:42:30,052 --> 00:42:31,841
May I come in?

592
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,914
What's wrong?

593
00:42:40,914 --> 00:42:42,329
Nothing.

594
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:44,513
What's up?

595
00:42:44,513 --> 00:42:49,102
I talked to Toto and decided to quit the play.

596
00:42:49,971 --> 00:42:53,421
Like you said, I can't handle two tasks at once.

597
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:55,794
Did he yell at you?

598
00:42:55,794 --> 00:42:59,429
Of course, he did.

599
00:42:59,429 --> 00:43:03,518
I understand him though. It affects everyone.

600
00:43:03,518 --> 00:43:08,051
And now he wants someone who knows the work to take my place.

601
00:43:08,051 --> 00:43:09,740
There's the only one I can think of. You.

602
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,524
There's the only one I can think of. And that's you.

603
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,303
But if you can't help,

604
00:43:22,215 --> 00:43:24,340
I may have to forfeit my scholarship.

605
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,789
I need to stop playing rugby and focus on the play.

606
00:43:29,552 --> 00:43:33,176
And I need to work to pay for the tuition.

607
00:43:33,176 --> 00:43:36,592
For that reason, I might need to sleep in class.

608
00:43:36,592 --> 00:43:38,326
I won't be able to complete the assignment.

609
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:40,766
I might not be able to graduate with you guys.

610
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:44,167
But I get you, man. You already have a lot on your hands.

611
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:48,493
- I don't want to bother...
- Fine, fine! Stop being so dramatic.

612
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:50,787
I will take on your work.

613
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:53,524
Are you serious? Let me give you a kiss.

614
00:43:53,524 --> 00:43:56,847
Please don't.

615
00:43:56,847 --> 00:44:01,460
Okay. I knew you would help me.

616
00:44:03,191 --> 00:44:05,691
I'm returning your guitar.

617
00:44:06,254 --> 00:44:07,762
Take it back.

618
00:44:07,762 --> 00:44:11,442
It's your guitar. It wasn't eaten by termites.

619
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,979
Holy shit!

620
00:44:13,979 --> 00:44:16,372
You've kept it for me?

621
00:44:17,082 --> 00:44:18,982
I took the best care of it.

622
00:44:18,982 --> 00:44:21,510
It's my best friend's guitar.

623
00:44:22,741 --> 00:44:24,541
Thanks.

624
00:44:25,694 --> 00:44:28,662
Are we all clear? Let me take you to your dorm.

625
00:44:28,662 --> 00:44:30,979
I was about to go get something to eat.

626
00:44:30,979 --> 00:44:33,846
- Let's go get some beers.
- Sure.

627
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,684
Wait!

628
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:43,924
I forgot my wallet. I'll go get it.

629
00:44:43,924 --> 00:44:46,643
- You wait for me downstairs.
- Yes.

630
00:44:54,423 --> 00:44:56,682
Hey. I just...

631
00:44:58,047 --> 00:44:59,671
Pat.

632
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:24,846
Pran.

633
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:26,880
Pran.

634
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:28,564
Pran!

635
00:45:28,564 --> 00:45:29,928
Yes?

636
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:34,371
You can start rehearsing with the songs now.

637
00:45:34,371 --> 00:45:36,255
Of course.

638
00:45:38,028 --> 00:45:43,149
Let's have a 5-minute break. Then we will do the vocal warm-up.

639
00:45:48,103 --> 00:45:51,335
Can I just leave for today?

640
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:52,883
Where are you going?

641
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:56,170
I have an event to attend. I get paid there.

642
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,693
If you're not up for it, just quit.

643
00:45:58,693 --> 00:46:00,697
No one is stopping you.

644
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:05,686
Do you think your director is willing to find a new actor on such short notice?

645
00:46:05,686 --> 00:46:10,035
And do you think we can't find someone more responsible than you in this university?

646
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:16,711
We'll see if he is going to replace me or a music guy.

647
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:21,107
Pran, what are you doing?

648
00:46:21,837 --> 00:46:23,930
Easy there.

649
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,143
What are you gonna do, Toto?

650
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,980
Calm down. It's okay.

651
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,360
You tricked me here for what now?

652
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,978
Come on. I'm not always playing games with you.

653
00:46:44,978 --> 00:46:47,146
I just want to see you.

654
00:46:47,146 --> 00:46:48,565
Yeah?

655
00:46:49,268 --> 00:46:53,497
If that guy didn't quit the play, would you still want to see me?

656
00:46:58,046 --> 00:46:59,587
Fine.

657
00:47:00,222 --> 00:47:04,480
Toto wanted me to ask you if you still want the role.

658
00:47:06,193 --> 00:47:08,193
Why would I want that?

659
00:47:09,684 --> 00:47:12,030
Don't you want to beat me anymore?

660
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:19,022
Are you saying if I take the role, you will confess your feelings for me?

661
00:47:19,678 --> 00:47:22,686
Do you agree to that? Then you'll win.

662
00:47:22,686 --> 00:47:24,440
Simple as that?

663
00:47:25,623 --> 00:47:27,623
You are thinking too much.

664
00:47:27,623 --> 00:47:30,349
You and I are both tight-lipped.

665
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:35,011
We will never reveal our feelings if nothing forces us to do so.

666
00:47:35,011 --> 00:47:38,849
You just... happen to win the lottery this time.

667
00:47:44,249 --> 00:47:45,761
That's right.

668
00:47:46,707 --> 00:47:51,292
In the end, one of us will win and the other one will lose.

669
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:53,392
I don't need to overthink it.

670
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:58,075
Well... I will say it just once then.

671
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,247
- I like...
- Wait!

672
00:48:04,487 --> 00:48:06,987
Did you just say I won the lottery?

673
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:09,819
Can I get the jackpot?

674
00:48:12,048 --> 00:48:14,215
Meaning?

675
00:48:14,215 --> 00:48:20,620
Meaning you must say you like me on the big class's projector screen.

676
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,364
Then I'll take the role.

677
00:48:22,364 --> 00:48:24,109
Pat!

678
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,309
I told you.

679
00:48:27,757 --> 00:48:31,665
I love to see your face when you lose.

680
00:48:32,649 --> 00:48:35,349
I feel like a true winner.

681
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:43,640
Fine. I'm going to find a better actor than you.

682
00:48:45,438 --> 00:48:47,438
I'm done asking you.

683
00:48:55,536 --> 00:48:58,666
You said Pat would agree to help.

684
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:02,697
It was my bad.

685
00:49:02,697 --> 00:49:04,849
I'm sorry.

686
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:06,178
Can we postpone it?

687
00:49:06,178 --> 00:49:08,906
Postpone? What the hell are you saying?

688
00:49:08,906 --> 00:49:10,685
Everything is settled.

689
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:12,811
The tickets were sold.

690
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:16,880
Whatever. Just apologize to Chart and bring him back.

691
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,703
You see that he isn't responsible.

692
00:49:18,703 --> 00:49:20,654
Just go!

693
00:49:20,654 --> 00:49:24,855
Riam is right here, my dear Kwan.

694
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,363
But he's an Engineering student.

695
00:49:46,363 --> 00:49:50,002
He also messed with us at the camp last year.

696
00:49:50,002 --> 00:49:53,761
But Engineering students are allowed to apply, too.

697
00:49:54,415 --> 00:49:56,196
He's right.

698
00:49:56,196 --> 00:49:57,961
Fine.

699
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,147
Say some lines.

700
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,585
Kwan,

701
00:50:06,209 --> 00:50:07,970
why are you quiet?

702
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:09,832
Answer me.

703
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,556
Answer him.

704
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:20,196
What?

705
00:50:20,781 --> 00:50:22,692
I'm tired.

706
00:50:22,692 --> 00:50:29,963
Tired of pretending to hate you while your face has taken over my heart.

707
00:50:30,675 --> 00:50:32,478
Aren't you tired, too?

708
00:50:32,478 --> 00:50:34,542
Hey, Riam!

709
00:50:34,542 --> 00:50:36,828
Let's stop it.

710
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:39,149
I don't want to play this game anymore.

711
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,000
I don't want to lie to people anymore.

712
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:50,309
You asked if I still wanted us to be friends.

713
00:50:52,222 --> 00:50:54,822
What if my answer is no?

714
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,650
What do you say?

715
00:51:14,496 --> 00:51:18,043
I just survived this! I just did.

716
00:51:18,043 --> 00:51:20,373
I've been saved.

717
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:34,423
In the end, one of us will win and the other one will lose.

718
00:51:34,423 --> 00:51:36,317
You know that.

719
00:51:37,745 --> 00:51:39,371
Why did you come?

720
00:51:39,371 --> 00:51:41,340
Don't you want to win?

721
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:46,317
If my victory puts my boyfriend in trouble, I'd rather lose.

722
00:51:46,317 --> 00:51:51,964
You said your wish is to cook a favorite dish for someone you like.

723
00:51:51,964 --> 00:51:58,892
As for me, when I have a lover, I'll always let my lover win.

724
00:51:59,664 --> 00:52:01,864
When was I ever your lover?

725
00:52:04,003 --> 00:52:09,171
You might not be now, but you'll be soon.

726
00:52:43,955 --> 00:52:46,158
Brother, I need to pee.

727
00:52:46,158 --> 00:52:49,921
I forgot my key. Can you open the door?

728
00:52:49,921 --> 00:52:51,819
Brother!

729
00:52:53,467 --> 00:52:54,840
Open the door.

730
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,069
- You open it.
- Brother, open the door.

731
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:58,671
- She's your sister.
- But you're my boyfriend.

732
00:52:58,671 --> 00:53:02,933
You just said you would yield if I was your boyfriend.

733
00:53:03,803 --> 00:53:06,730
But I didn't say I would do everything for you.

734
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:10,510
- What bullshit!
- Pat, are you not hearing me?

735
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:14,539
- She's your sister. Get the door.
- You do it.
- Brother!

736
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:15,821
- You do it.
- You go.

737
00:53:15,821 --> 00:53:18,434
- You go.
- You.
- Brother! Open the door!

738
00:53:19,089 --> 00:53:20,666
Go.

739
00:53:20,666 --> 00:53:23,066
No, I won't.

740
00:53:23,602 --> 00:53:25,709
You go.

741
00:53:25,709 --> 00:53:27,458
Go.

742
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:28,603
You go.

743
00:53:28,603 --> 00:53:30,468
I'm eating.

744
00:53:30,468 --> 00:53:32,879
It's your room.

745
00:53:55,140 --> 00:54:01,420
[Bad Buddy Series]

746
00:54:01,426 --> 00:54:02,777
We're boyfriends now.

747
00:54:02,777 --> 00:54:05,013
Let's show some sweet moments.

748
00:54:05,013 --> 00:54:06,975
Can you give me a reward?

749
00:54:06,975 --> 00:54:08,306
What are you doing?

750
00:54:08,306 --> 00:54:10,387
Posting an IG Story.

751
00:54:10,387 --> 00:54:11,734
Let's make people jealous.

752
00:54:11,734 --> 00:54:13,250
They might find out.

753
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,902
I just want people to know that I'm taken.

754
00:54:16,902 --> 00:54:18,194
You know what?

755
00:54:18,194 --> 00:54:20,337
You are getting cuter and cuter every day.

756
00:54:20,337 --> 00:54:21,430
I want to hug you.

757
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:24,840
- Let's do a virtual for now.
- Hug me!

758
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,706
You joined the volunteer camp.

759
00:54:26,706 --> 00:54:28,610
You also joined the Architecture play.

760
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:30,683
Are you really hitting on someone in Architecture?

761
00:54:30,683 --> 00:54:33,372
When did I teach you to lie?
