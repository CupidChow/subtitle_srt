1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,460
I'm really sorry...

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,460
There has been a change with the place you signed for.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,460
The landlord suddenly decided to move back in.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,180
In cases like this...

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,620
There's really nothing we can do...

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,460
So unfortunately...

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,100
You'll need to vacate the room by the end of this month.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,180
What are you doing?

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,260
Sitting in the dark?

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,980
Ah... nothing

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,340
Just had something on my mind.

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,820
What exactly?

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,460
About me?

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,620
But hey... why do you look so down?

15
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,980
Something happen?

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,740
Not exactly...

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,900
Then what is it?

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,500
What would you do if I moved out?

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,460
Huh?

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,140
Where's that coming from?

21
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,660
It's just that...

22
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,820
Were you expecting someone?

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,340
No?

24
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,140
What are you doing here...?

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,660
Wait, what?

26
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,500
You're that guy from the bar bathroom!

27
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,580
Baek Namjoon?

28
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,100
Wait... You live here?

29
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,860
Wow, small world.

30
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,900
Can't believe we ran into each other again.

31
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,500
If I'd known you were our tenant,

32
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,260
I would've been nicer back then.

33
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,940
Are you okay after that fall?

34
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,660
So... what brings you here?

35
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,220
You got a call from the real estate office this morning, right?

36
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,900
I'm afraid you'll have to move out by the end of the month.

37
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,500
As you can see

38
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,140
There's someone moving in with me.

39
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,980
Use this to help with your moving expenses.

40
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,780
And get yourself checked out at a hospital.

41
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,740
You hit the ground pretty hard that day.

42
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,540
Get lost before I call the cops.

43
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,700
You have until the end of the month.

44
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,620
See you~

45
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,300
What was that?

46
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,820
You said you'd never met him.

47
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,900
You said you couldn't find him.

48
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,140
Then who the hell was that next to him?

49
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,380
What happened between you two?

50
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,020
Well... actually...

51
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,700
Don't hide it, just tell me the truth.

52
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,420
When I finally found him a few days ago,

53
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,380
I asked him about you.

54
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,940
And...

55
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,380
And?

56
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,380
It didn't seem like he loved you anymore.

57
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,700
He said you were just a fuck buddy, nothing more.

58
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,940
That you were clingy and annoying, always chasing after him.

59
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,780
That's why I couldn't tell you.

60
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,500
I just didn't want to hurt you.

61
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,980
No... no, no... that's not true... no!

62
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,940
Hey, Seunghoon!

63
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,940
Seunghoon, are you okay?
