1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,740
Are you okay?

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,100
I'm sorry

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,700
for lying to you.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,780
I need to ask you something.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,220
Can you do it for me?

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,020
What is it?

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,660
Do a Cheondojae (Buddhism rite) for me.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,300
What are you saying?

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,580
You're just leaving?

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,260
I don't have much time left.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,940
It's already been three years since I died.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,620
If nothing's done, I'll up wandering forever.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,980
You don't want me stuck here either, right?

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,340
Then please...

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,540
I want you to help me move on.

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,100
I can't...

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,380
How could I do that...

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,340
Seriously?

19
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,220
When we first met,

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,460
you said you'd exorcise me and send me away.

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,140
Guess it was all bluff.

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,660
Dongmin...

23
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,500
Please, just hear me out.

24
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,980
It hurts so much right now...

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,300
But thanks to you,

26
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,460
I have a lot of good memories too

27
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,340
and that's enough for me.

28
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,220
I think I can finally leave in peace now.

29
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,340
Just like you found me...

30
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,780
I'll come find you next time.

31
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,460
Will you still like me then?

32
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,780
Please take this one outside.

33
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,020
And I'll carry this one myself.

34
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,220
Okay

35
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,740
Oh?

36
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,940
Are you okay?

37
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,460
Huh?

38
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,780
Lee Seung-hoon?

39
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,860
Sorry?

40
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,580
Nothing, never mind.

41
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,380
Thanks for helping me.

42
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,780
You just moved in?

43
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,540
Ah, unit 301.

44
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,740
Oh? I'm in 302.

45
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,020
So we're neighbors.

46
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,020
Ah...

47
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,740
Do you have a lot of stuff?

48
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,020
Need a hand?

49
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,700
Oh no, it's okay. You don't have to.

50
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,460
Come on, you're new here.

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,700
Least I can do is help.

52
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,020
Here, give it to me.

53
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,940
That's heavy. I'll carry it.

54
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,060
Thank you.

55
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,540
Take care!

56
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,740
Man, I'm starving.

57
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,860
No way...

58
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,060
You're not just gonna ditch me

59
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,460
after putting me through all this?

60
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,180
Wow...

61
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,500
I told you I was fine.

62
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,140
You helped me without asking.

63
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,260
Seriously? This is how it's gonna be?

64
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,500
Fine then.

65
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,380
What do you want to eat?

66
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,500
You just moved in, so... black bean noodles?

67
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,100
Can I get the seafood version?

68
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,900
And sweet & sour chicken too?

69
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,420
Sure sure, let's go.

70
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,140
I know this amazing Chinese place nearby.

71
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,100
If it's bad, I'm not paying for it.

72
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,820
Since you are going to be paying,

73
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,580
Can I add fried lemon chicken and creamy shrimp too?

74
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,300
Wanna get some Kaoliang liquor while we're at it?

75
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,900
Should've kept my mouth shut...

76
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,380
So... how old are you?

77
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,900
27

78
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,220
No way, same here!

79
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,100
Really?

80
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,220
You don't look it.

81
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,820
Yeah, I get that a lot, I look young, right?

82
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,660
Huh? Not really.

83
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,340
- I thought you're older than me. - Wow...

84
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,500
Watch you mouth!

85
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,260
So we're friends now, huh?
