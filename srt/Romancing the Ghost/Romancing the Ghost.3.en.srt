1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,460
Handsome, huh...

2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,980
Hi, this is Flying Realty.

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,980
I live in unit 205 at Penguin Villa.

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,260
Could I get the landlord's number?

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,900
The landlord's number?

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,660
Can I ask what it's about?

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,300
Well, I was cleaning up

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,860
and found something

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,100
wasn't sure if I should toss it

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,420
or try to return it.

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,140
Ah, I can give you the number, but...

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,580
I don't think he'll answer.

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,820
Even we barely hear from them.

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,620
Oh, really?

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,140
Well, I'll send it anyway.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,460
Okay, thank you.

17
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,220
Baek Namjoon?

18
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,180
Yes?

19
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,940
Do you know who I am?

20
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,540
You know who this is, right?

21
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,580
Huh? Yeah, of course.

22
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,180
That's Lee Seunghoon.

23
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,060
But he's dead.

24
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,140
He had one last request before he passed

25
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,580
said you two were close or something.

26
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,540
Close? Nah, not really.

27
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,580
We were just... fuck buddy.

28
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,460
Well, I guess...

29
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,140
He was kinda one-sidedly into me.

30
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,580
Kept going on about getting married and stuff.

31
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,820
It was honestly a pain in the ass.

32
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,460
And then one day he just dies on his own?

33
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,340
You know what's really fucking hilarious?

34
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,740
He even got us a house, said it was our newlywed place.

35
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,620
And put it under both our names.

36
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,140
But now that he's gone...

37
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,820
It's all mine, right?

38
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,660
Shit, what a goddamn windfall for me, huh?

39
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,740
Fucking psycho.

40
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,340
What the fuck... are you crazy?

41
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,460
Who the fuck are you?!

42
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,420
Fucking hell...

43
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,540
How am I supposed to tell him...

44
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,300
So? What happened?

45
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,300
Did you find him? Did you talk to him?

46
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,740
Is he coming?

47
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,100
Uh, well...

48
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,460
I couldn't find him.

49
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,460
Oh... really?

50
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,820
Well... it is what it is.

51
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,020
Still...

52
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,380
I think I'll find him soon.

53
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,380
Just give me a little more time.

54
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,740
No, it's okay now.

55
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,620
You've waited almost three years.

56
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,020
Another day or two won't hurt, right?

57
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,260
Have you heard of the three-year rite?

58
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,140
Uh...

59
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,580
When someone dies. they hold memorials for three years.

60
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,340
It's almost been three years since I died.

61
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,020
Which means...

62
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,900
I don't have much time left to stay here either.

63
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,220
So what?

64
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,700
I just wanted to see the face of the one I loved one last time.

65
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,300
Guess I won't get to do that.

66
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,020
What happened to your hand?

67
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,740
Oh, this?

68
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,060
I tripped on the way here.

69
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,140
Be more careful, will you

70
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,500
That must've hurt.

71
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,260
I should get to bed.

72
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,900
Where'd you go?

73
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,580
Never here when I need you.

74
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,300
Why should I be the one hiding?

75
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,140
He's the one who started it.

76
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,900
And I was here first, living in this house!

77
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,220
What? Got a problem?

78
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,780
You started it, remember? Last time.

79
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,900
Wanna have a drink?

80
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,220
Drink?
