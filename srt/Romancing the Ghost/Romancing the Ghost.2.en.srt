1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,150
I said get out...!

2
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,310
What the hell is this?

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,580
Hey! Open the door!

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,450
I'm telling you nicely, open it!

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,780
I told you I'm not living with you!

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,180
I warned you already!

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,350
Keep this up and I can't promise what I'll do.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,250
Skinny but got a temper, huh.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,280
Hey!

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,950
Ugh... I'm going to sleep.

11
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,310
Are you serious...?

12
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,980
Huh? You cleaned it all up?

13
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,980
Didn't think you'd finish in a day.

14
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,980
Guess you wren't that tired last night?

15
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,480
Spectrophilia?

16
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,910
You sure looked like you enjoyed it.

17
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,950
Why? I liked it though.

18
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,750
So... if I live here, do I get that every time?

19
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,980
Are you insane?

20
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,450
Get out.

21
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,450
I said get out.

22
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,210
Get out.

23
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,550
Cut it out already.

24
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,680
Oh

25
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,380
Oh, wait... this photo...

26
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,610
What's this?

27
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,150
Where'd you get this photo?

28
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,980
Found it while cleaning.

29
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,210
Is it... an ex or something?

30
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,680
You look good here.

31
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,450
I love it!

32
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,350
Let's keep it here in the house.

33
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,010
Yeah, forever.

34
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,780
Yeah.

35
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,680
I'll be back.

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,350
Don't skip meals while I'm gone.

37
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,780
Eat well, okay?

38
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,380
Yeah, go on.

39
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,910
And no crying.

40
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,480
I'm going to cry every night.

41
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,880
You'll miss your flight.

42
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,850
Get going.

43
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,210
Yeah.

44
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,750
[Obituary: Lee Seunghoon
In loving memory of the late Lee Seunghoon]

45
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,580
Namjoon.

46
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,950
Where are you?

47
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,750
Namjoon...

48
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,810
We promised we'd live happily together in this house.

49
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,410
But not long after I died,

50
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,580
he left this house too.

51
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,250
Since then, I've just...

52
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,910
stayed here all alone.

53
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,480
For about... three years.

54
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,680
You said he left... so why?

55
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,250
Because he might come back.

56
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,680
So I'm really sorry, but

57
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
I have to stay in this house.

58
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,010
Until I meet him again.

59
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,750
I can't leave this place.

60
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,410
Then let's do this.

61
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,150
I'll find him for you.

62
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,250
I'll help you meet him again.

63
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,010
But let me keep living here.

64
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,710
And how will you do that?

65
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,780
I'm not sure yet.

66
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,850
We'll only know if we try.

67
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,450
But I bet you'll see him soon.

68
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,010
Alright then.

69
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,350
If you help me meet him again,

70
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,350
I'll let you keep living here.

71
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,450
But,

72
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,110
You have to find him within a month.

73
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,480
A week is enough.
