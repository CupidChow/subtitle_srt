1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,580
Why should I be the one hiding?

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,280
He's the one who started it.

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,040
And I was here first, living in this house!

4
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,020
What? Got a problem?

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,920
You started it, remember? Last time.

6
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,260
Wanna have a drink?

7
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,360
Drink?

8
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,620
Wow... can't remember the last time I drank.

9
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,860
Don't you still drink once a year?

10
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,100
Like during holidays or memorials.

11
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,860
I don't have a family.

12
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,700
Huh?

13
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,820
Well, I cut ties with them.

14
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,740
Or maybe "they cut me off" is more accurate?

15
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,540
They couldn't accept the fact that I like men.

16
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,940
So the only one I could open my heart to

17
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,740
was Namjoon.

18
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,660
Pretty sure my family doesn't know I'm dead.

19
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,940
So... why'd you kiss me last time?

20
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,900
Was it the spirit bonding thing?

21
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,020
Did that make you fall for me?

22
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,180
What? What are you talking about?

23
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,980
Or was it just pity or something?

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,340
Pity?

25
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,180
You think I'm that kind of guy?

26
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,220
Then what was it?

27
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,060
I just...

28
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,420
wanted you to feel a little better.

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,900
Ah...

30
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,260
You tired?

31
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,060
When did you get here?

32
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,380
Just now.

33
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,460
You okay though?

34
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,340
Isn't it more tiring

35
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,060
to sleep with a ghost than a human?

36
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,740
Aww, are you worried about me?

37
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,420
Ugh... I'm tired.

38
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,820
Didn't you just say you're tired!

39
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,420
Thanks.

40
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,700
I really thought...

41
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,700
I'd never feel

42
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,260
this kind of love again.

43
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,740
Hello?

44
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,380
Is this the tenant of Penguin Villa #205?

45
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,940
This is Flying Realty.

46
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,420
Yes, how can I help you?

47
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,020
Well, the thing is...

48
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,660
You need to move out of the room by the end of this month.
