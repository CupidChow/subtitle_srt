[Hello, this is Flying Real Estate. We have an insanely cheap listing right now. Come to 301, 20-1 Itaewon-ro right away. If you're late, it might be gone.]

2
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,900
It's facing southeast.

3
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,260
So it gets lots of sun in the morning.

4
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,100
And there aren't many nightlife spots nearby.

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,540
So it's perfect if you want peace and quiet.

6
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,500
There's a convenience store about 2 minutes away.

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,540
Roughly that close.

8
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,980
And the bus stop is right in front of the building.

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,940
How much did you say this place was?

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,220
$70K deposit and $200 rent.

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,500
Utilities like electricity, water, and gas are separate.

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,660
This place isn't haunted, right?

13
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,900
No!!

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,580
What are you talking about! Ghosts?!

15
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,060
And look at this.

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,260
Even the washing machine's so nice.

17
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,340
And check out the sink here.

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,340
There's not even a spot of mold~

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,940
The water pressure is amazing too.

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,700
I'll take it.

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,940
Wait, really?

22
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,300
- Yes. - You're signing the lease?

23
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,780
Yes.

24
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,020
You're pretty decisive~

25
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,020
Alright then, I;ll explain everything as we head out.

26
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,700
Looks like you're thinking early August for the move-in...

27
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,340
(Fresh chopped green onions)

28
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,940
Ugh, when an I gonna finish all this?

29
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,620
Get out...

30
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,580
Get.. get out...

31
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,580
Get out of my house...

32
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,740
Leave this house right now!

33
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,500
What the hell?

34
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,340
I said get out!

35
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,780
What, you can't see me?

36
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,300
I can see you.

37
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,900
Ugh... what the hell?

38
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,300
Why do you look more freaked out?

39
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,900
No but... why aren't you scared?

40
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,460
I've seen ghosts since I was a kid.

41
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,860
Even the day you came to see the place?

42
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,740
Of course, I saw you in the room.

43
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,860
You moved in knowing there's a ghost?

44
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,420
Doesn't bother me.

45
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,940
Doesn't bother you?

46
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,380
You're fine living with me?

47
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,380
Why not?

48
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,340
You're only active at night, right?

49
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,620
I sleep at night anyway...

50
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,260
I don't want to live with you, get out.

51
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,180
Look, it says the tenant is Lee Dong-min.

52
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,860
This isn't your place, it's mine now.

53
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,580
How is this your place?

54
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,940
The landlord owns it and ou're just a tenant.

55
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,020
The landlord told me to live here, so it's mine.

56
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,780
What? I'm the landlord here.

57
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,740
And I never told you to stay.

58
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,140
This is going nowhere.

59
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,060
What do I need to do to stay here?

60
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,820
There's only one thing I want.

61
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,420
For you to leave this place.

62
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,740
Now that's just mean.

63
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,100
Perfect, then leave if it bothers you.

64
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,220
Didn't I say I've seen ghosts all my life.

65
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,220
So what if you have...

66
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,980
If I really wanted to

67
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,700
I could hold an exorcism or a spiritual ritual,

68
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,860
and drive you out of here for good.

69
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,660
Go ahead and try then

70
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,300
Oh, it's on now, huh?

71
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,380
Where do you think you're going? I said get out.
