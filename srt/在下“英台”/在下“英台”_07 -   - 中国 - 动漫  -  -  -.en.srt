1
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,080
I've had my fun.

2
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Let's pretend this never happened.

3
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,720
I'm willing to see this through. How do you want to play?

4
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,440
Just now, you two questioned why I wouldn't go to the archery range.

5
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Alright, this is the first time in years anyone has doubted my archery skills.

6
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,480
Alright, alright.

7
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,160
Then let's go to the range and compete.

8
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Where does your confidence come from?

9
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,040
It's just archery.

10
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,320
You set the rules.

11
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Fine, but don't regret it.

12
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
Best two out of three.

13
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,720
First round: stationary target.

14
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,680
All three arrows must hit the bullseye.

15
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,680
That's easy.

16
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Alright, you truly are a master archer.

17
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,960
No problem, right?

18
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,120
Don't worry.

19
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,200
Wow, you actually shot through the first arrow. Impressive.

20
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,320
First round: Young Master Ma wins.

21
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,760
What?

22
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,160
What I said just now was

23
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,920
all three arrows must hit the bullseye.

24
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,880
There's only one arrow on your target.

25
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,400
You...

26
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,040
You didn't listen to the rules. Who's to blame?

27
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,920
Fine, I'll count the first round as my loss.

28
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,800
It's alright, there are still two rounds left.

29
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,200
Second round: moving target.

30
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,080
Ji Sa will hold your target.

31
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,800
Situ Qing will hold my target.

32
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,400
It's best to cover your whole body.

33
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,760
Right, safety is important.

34
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,240
Run from the east end to the west end.

35
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,600
At a distance of ten zhang, shoot three arrows.

36
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,360
All must hit the target. Let's see who's more accurate.

37
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:47,840
Alright.

38
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,200
You're really playing dirty.

39
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,560
Your target is twice as big.

40
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,480
I just said it's best to protect your whole body.

41
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,960
One of them is tall, the other is short.

42
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,600
There's nothing I can do about it.

43
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,880
You agreed too.

44
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,720
Why are you backing out now?

45
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,040
I really can't do anything about you.

46
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,800
You have so many tricks. Come on.

47
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
You better run as fast as you can.

48
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Or I'll finish you off.

49
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,360
How can you run so fast?

50
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,840
Nice, all of them hit.

51
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,560
You, walk more steadily.

52
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,880
Or I'll stab you with the arrowhead.

53
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,720
Yes, Young Master Ma.

54
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,720
This is way too slow.

55
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,880
Young Master Ma has great archery skills.

56
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,320
That's too much.

57
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:27,840
So shameless.

58
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,040
Does this even count as a moving target?

59
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,240
It's not moving at all.

60
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,080
You're so annoying, you just can't stand losing.

61
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,720
The last arrow will decide everything.

62
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,960
Watch closely.

63
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,400
Situ Qing, what are you doing?

64
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,000
I-I-I didn't do it on purpose.

65
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,600
There was something on the ground.

66
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,280
There was a stone.

67
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,800
Come to my dorm after class.

68
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,720
Get ready for a beating.

69
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,520
Yes, yes.

70
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
You’ll have to come up with your own tuition for the next semester.

71
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,800
Second round, Zhu wins.

72
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,560
There’s still a third round.

73
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
You’re all doomed.

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,520
Third round: shoot the pear on top of the head.

75
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,520
Whoever hits it is the winner.

76
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,280
What if someone accidentally gets shot?

77
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,720
If someone dies, you won’t be held responsible.

78
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,440
Killing someone means you have to pay with your life.

79
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,040
I’ve already had both of them sign a life-and-death contract.

80
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,160
Even the authorities can’t interfere.

81
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,480
Isn’t this treating lives like they’re worthless?

82
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,360
Don’t dawdle, I’m having fun here.

83
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,840
I give up.

84
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,880
Don’t! That’s such a buzzkill.

85
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,240
I came to the academy to learn.

86
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,080
I hope to one day serve the country and protect the people.

87
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,760
Not to treat my classmates’ lives as nothing.

88
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,360
Zhu is right.

89
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,720
Young Master Ma, sorry, we can’t play along.

90
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,800
Liang, let’s go.

91
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,280
How can you just leave like that?

92
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,800
So what if someone dies?

93
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,520
You guys are such killjoys.

94
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,400
I-I’m really going to report this!

95
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,360
Report to whom?

96
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,760
Those two I just chased off.

97
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,360
And also Dean Sun.

98
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,640
You two will regret this.

99
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,840
So arrogant, just relying on your family.

100
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,400
If you’re capable, do it on your own.

101
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,640
Go make a name for yourself on the frontier battlefield.

102
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,880
Only then will I be convinced.

103
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,800
Zhu, you really are something.

104
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,840
Tsk, you really are quite special.

105
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,960
Even your neck is special—so fair.

106
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,520
Shut up, you lecher.

107
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,280
Wow, you’ve got quite a temper.

108
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,040
Oh, just started at the academy?

109
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,040
Zhu, you haven’t been assigned a room yet, have you?

110
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,320
Share a room with me.

111
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,160
The student who used to room with me had something happen at home.

112
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,480
He withdrew from school yesterday.

113
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,600
So the room is just available.

114
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,080
No need to trouble you, Ma.

115
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,120
I never agreed to room with you.

116
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,760
That’s right, I’ll stay with Liang instead.

117
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,000
After all, I’m just a country boy.

118
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,960
I’m not worthy to be Young Master Ma’s roommate.

119
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,000
Hurry and show me the room.

120
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,280
What I say,

121
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,360
I always mean it.

122
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,880
Besides, you two just lost to me.

123
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,880
How could I let you off so easily?

124
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,040
Don’t get so close to me.

125
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,600
Are you into men or something?

126
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,400
With all my experience with women,

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,960
you’re not that simple.

128
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,800
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

129
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
I’ll keep your secret.

130
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,400
Student Ma

131
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,480
Why make things difficult for a new student?

132
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
In this academy,

133
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,440
it's the first time anyone has dared to disrespect me.

134
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,520
How unusual, how unusual.

135
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,080
Then let me find more amusement, ah.

136
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,560
Looks like you've set your sights on Student Zhu.

137
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,080
Hmph, that's right.

138
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,960
Young Master Ma has always said he regrets not being born thirty years earlier.

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,520
Yes, do you know why?

140
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,720
Because the chaotic times ended too soon.

141
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,400
Otherwise, Young Master Ma would have competed for supremacy in the Central Plains.

142
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,720
And vied for the throne.

143
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,920
Student Liang understands me.

144
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,880
Now the Luobei army

145
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,200
is approaching our Jiangdong.

146
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,960
The world will be in chaos again.

147
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,400
You must know, only in troubled times do heroes emerge.

148
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,320
For one general's success, countless soldiers perish.

149
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,880
Be my strategist and let's bring peace to the world together.

150
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
Thank you for your trust, Young Master Ma.

151
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,040
If I become your strategist,

152
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,840
can you grant me one condition?

153
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,760
Salary is negotiable.

154
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,200
My condition is to live with Student Zhu.

155
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,960
You... why would you...

156
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,680
So you also...

157
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,480
Also what?

158
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,320
My ambition is for the world.

159
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,080
Gaining a strategist is even more important.

160
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,200
Then... then she’s yours.

161
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,200
I'll wait for you at court tomorrow, Strategist.

162
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,720
This bed has been broken for a long time.

163
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,320
No one has come to fix it.

164
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,400
I had to share it with the previous student.

165
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,960
You mean

166
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,520
we have to sleep together?

167
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes, that's the only way.

168
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,520
Isn't this ridiculous?

169
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,880
What are these?

170
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,440
These,

171
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,360
Did you make all of these?

172
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,080
Yes, my family's tradition is making wooden mechanical devices.

173
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,400
This little thing that looks like a cow but isn't is so intricate.

174
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,880
This is a wooden ox and flowing horse.

175
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,280
Oh, the wooden ox and flowing horse invented by that chancellor from Jingxi?

176
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,880
Yes, but he wasn't the one who invented it.

177
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,760
Oh, is there some inside story?

178
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,320
Wow, can this wooden kite fly?

179
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,560
This is just a model.

180
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
If you enlarge it to three zhang,

181
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,040
and wrap the wings with oiled paper,

182
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,280
it can actually fly.

183
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,040
Oh, that's amazing, really amazing!

184
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,280
Who did you learn this from?

185
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,840
Huang Jiyan, the famous scholar from Miannan, is my maternal grandfather.

186
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,280
The founder's grandson.

187
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,240
We're both from the Liujia school, just different branches.

188
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,280
Why didn't you say so?

189
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,560
You never asked.

190
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,280
We're of the same generation.

191
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,680
And then?

192
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,280
Did he give you some secret manual?

193
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,520
You guessed right. Besides the Liujia techniques,

194
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,360
my grandfather also passed down the Gongshu Manual to our branch.

195
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,480
It contains records of mechanical calculations.

196
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,600
I've studied it for ten years.

197
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,000
Liujia techniques have spirit but no form.

198
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,360
The Gongshu Manual has form but no spirit.

199
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,600
The founder even taught them separately?

200
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,560
If you combined them, wouldn't that be even more incredible?

201
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,640
I can't guess my grandfather's intentions.

202
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,920
But your idea is insightful, maybe it's worth a try.

203
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,080
Here, this is my genuine Liujia item.

204
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,600
Hold it carefully, don't drop it.

205
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,080
My mother lives here.

206
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,560
Please help improve my mother's living conditions.

207
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,040
Why are you staring at me?

208
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,920
Ah, it's nothing.

209
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,800
I'm thinking about how to modify this hairpin.

210
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,520
Hey, don't.

211
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,560
This is...

212
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,440
I...

213
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,200
When we first met at the Zhu family stronghold,

214
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,920
You left a deep impression with your heroic and spirited presence.

215
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,400
Was I really that impressive?

216
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,720
I was also moved by your determination to uphold justice and your courageous spirit.

217
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,120
So, I made this statue to show...

218
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,280
to show my admiration.

219
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,640
It's the first time someone has praised me like this.

220
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,800
It's a bit embarrassing.

221
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,400
This statue is for you.

222
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,560
Liang, how long did it take you to carve this?

223
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,600
About three nights.

224
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,160
W-why are you taking off your clothes?

225
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,040
To sleep.

226
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,680
Oh, to sleep.

227
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,800
Just because you gave me something, you think you can do whatever you want?

228
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,160
What are you talking about?

229
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,920
Didn't you agree to this yourself?

230
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,560
I... I...

231
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,280
What should I do? What should I do?

232
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,680
Dad, what should I do?

233
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Mom is watching too.
