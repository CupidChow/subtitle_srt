1
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,200
His martial arts are exceptional, and he has the strength of an army.

2
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,160
This young man is no ordinary person.

3
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,960
Left Headmaster, your sword.

4
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,360
Cut him down! Cut him down!

5
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,840
Princess

6
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,360
Princess

7
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,240
No, don't!

8
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,880
Left Palm Court

9
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,440
The Master said

10
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,880
A benevolent person loves others.

11
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,200
So the county princess can just cheat as she pleases?

12
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,080
And carry out punishment at will?

13
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,320
Who said anything about punishment?

14
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,200
I just can't bear to part with the Ancient Sabre that's been with me for six years.

15
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,920
Can't bear to part with it?

16
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,120
If I lose, the sword is yours.

17
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,080
Ah, I...

18
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,440
We never said we were betting anything!

19
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,040
Strictly speaking,

20
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,680
you've beaten me twice in a row.

21
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,760
If there was no wager,

22
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,600
do you think I don't care about my dignity?

23
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,600
Take it.

24
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,680
If anyone dares to bully you in the future,

25
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,800
just use my name, Princess Yuanhe.

26
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,120
No one in Jiangdong would dare touch you.

27
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,280
Also, I'll grant you one more request.

28
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,040
After all, you won twice.

29
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,880
Princess Yuanhe.

30
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,160
I've heard stories about your sister, Sun Shangxiang.

31
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,440
How dare a commoner like you call her by the title Lady Warrior?

32
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,160
The Ancient Sabre belonged to His Majesty's elder brother,

33
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,600
the King of Changsha, Huan.

34
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,040
His Majesty personally gave it to you on your coming-of-age ceremony.

35
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,080
It's a royal treasure.

36
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,200
How can you just give it to this villager so easily?

37
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,440
If you shameless people hadn't tripped me twice,

38
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,600
would I have lost face like this?

39
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,480
Remember this:

40
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,120
I'm looking out for this guy.

41
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,400
Don't you dare try to settle scores later.

42
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,760
Let's head to class.

43
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,640
After class in the evening,

44
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,160
let's spar and practice our inner strength.

45
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:19,840
Alright.

46
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,080
Then I'll keep this ancient sword for you for a while, Your Highness.

47
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,320
Don't call me "Your Highness."

48
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,400
Call me "Teacher."

49
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,040
Alright, Teacher Sun.

50
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,920
After we finish practicing,

51
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,120
come eat with me.

52
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,240
Take your time thinking of another request.

53
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,080
Okay!

54
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,400
This is so delicious.

55
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
The academy's food

56
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,680
is it always this good?

57
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,960
The headmaster is giving us special meals.

58
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:49,920
It's delicious.

59
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,280
Zhu,

60
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,360
your martial arts are impressive.

61
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,280
Why not join the army and serve the country?

62
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,360
Why come here to study instead?

63
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,200
I want to go too,

64
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,880
but I have to find that monster first to save my mother.

65
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,680
What did you say?

66
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,040
Nothing.

67
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,000
I-I just want to learn some important principles at the academy.

68
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:06,960
That's good too.

69
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,320
One must be skilled in both literature and martial arts to be a good general.

70
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,120
Is your second request for my father to make you a general?

71
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Oh, I wouldn't dare.

72
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,200
I still lack experience.

73
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,120
At least you know your own limits.

74
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,440
Alright, when you're ready,

75
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,400
I'll mention it to my father.

76
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,560
Becoming a deputy general shouldn't be a problem.

77
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,680
Uh...

78
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,400
Zhu, you don't want to be the Grand Cavalry General, do you?

79
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,280
What?

80
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,880
You're not satisfied with your second wish?

81
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,440
It's understandable that the army doesn't accept women.

82
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,280
But why doesn't the academy accept women?

83
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,400
Hmph, men only care about competing for power.

84
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,320
They use women for political marriages and alliances.

85
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,400
As tools for bearing children.

86
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,720
They never consider how women feel.

87
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,440
So how would they ever let women into the academy?

88
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,360
But how is it that Mr. Sun can?

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,360
My sister was married off to that old man in Jingxi for a political alliance, and that was bad enough.

90
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,240
But because of a war,

91
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,960
Father wouldn't let them see each other again.

92
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,760
My sister died of grief.

93
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,280
Father felt deeply guilty.

94
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,080
That's why, to his only daughter,

95
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,080
he is so indulgent and accommodating.

96
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,560
Women are always treated as appendages.

97
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,200
All the problems are solved by men.

98
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,120
Is that fair?

99
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,680
I didn't expect a young man like you

100
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,800
to be so empathetic toward women.

101
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,040
Men and women should be equal.

102
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,720
Both should be able to rely on their hard work and intelligence

103
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,840
to achieve great things.

104
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,880
My second wish

105
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,280
is to ask Mr. Sun to mediate

106
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,800
and let the academy accept ambitious women.

107
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,400
Otherwise, half of the world's talent will be lost.

108
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,840
Well said, young man!

109
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Just for what you said,

110
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,640
let's become sworn brothers, the three of us.

111
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,280
Heavenly Emperor above,

112
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,680
I, Sun Buli,

113
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,280
together with Zhu Die'er and Liang Sanbai,

114
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,800
though of different surnames, share the same ideals and consider each other kindred spirits.

115
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,040
Hereby swear brotherhood today.

116
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,320
From this day forward, we live and die together.

117
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,360
First, whether man or woman, all can become outstanding talents.

118
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,800
Second, may all people under heaven enjoy peace.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,520
To serve the nation above and bring peace to the common people below.

120
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,960
If we break this oath, let heaven and man punish us together.

121
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,840
You are not from a noble family.

122
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,640
Entering the academy, you may be looked down upon.

123
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,200
Change into fine clothes.

124
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,960
Now that we are sworn brothers,

125
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,480
I will also give you a golden crown.

126
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,280
From now on, you are part of the Sun family.

127
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,120
It's not easy to keep those spoiled young men in line.

128
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,240
At the academy, you should still call me "teacher."

129
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,360
Alright, boss.

130
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,440
Oh, alright, teacher.

131
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,840
Yes, teacher.

132
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,320
Then tell me,

133
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,640
What?

134
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,080
Classmate Liang recommended you for admission.

135
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,520
What's your relationship with each other?

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,280
Uh, relationship?

137
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,640
What happened?

138
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,480
No, no, no.

139
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,760
It's nothing, really.

140
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,760
You've already sworn brotherhood and you're still hiding things from me?

141
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,120
If there's something interesting, hurry up and tell me.

142
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,240
It's not interesting.

143
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,200
Let's go back to the Left Dean's office.

144
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,120
A few days ago, Sanbai heard there was a miracle doctor in the mountains.

145
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,360
So he took his uncle to the Zhu family clinic for treatment of a back sore.

146
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
He happened to run into classmate Zhu.

147
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,320
That old man doesn't keep his word.

148
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,680
Give me back my piglet!

149
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,760
You old geezer

150
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,840
Why won't you keep teaching me the true Six Jia techniques?

151
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,400
Die'er

152
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,440
You've already learned quite a bit of the Six Jia secrets.

153
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,200
Being able to turn beans into soldiers is enough for self-defense.

154
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,120
There's no need to learn the true Six Jia techniques.

155
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,800
You must understand, the greater your power, the greater your responsibility.

156
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,680
Responsibility is right.

157
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,800
Upholding justice and helping the weak,

158
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,760
or dying bravely on the battlefield,

159
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,120
these are our responsibilities.

160
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,840
All you care about is protecting yourself.

161
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,240
Hiding away in this rural place.

162
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,400
Children should respect their elders and care for the young.

163
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,600
None of your business.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,520
This young man is like a blooming summer lotus.

165
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,280
If not for his heroic aura,

166
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,160
he'd probably look even prettier than a girl.

167
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,760
What are you looking at?

168
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,880
Never seen a handsome and charming man before?

169
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,960
Give me back my piggy bank!

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,520
My money!

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,440
Give it to me!

172
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,600
Ah!

173
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,280
You—

174
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,280
Give me back my piggy bank!

175
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,600
I've saved up two years' worth of pocket money!

176
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,560
Hand it over!

177
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,360
If you won't teach me, I'll go down the mountain and find a master myself!

178
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,560
Don't run!

179
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,800
If you go down the mountain now,

180
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,920
how will I explain it to your mother if something happens to you?

181
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
Mother definitely left because you made her angry.

182
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,040
Paper can turn into a horse.

183
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,400
Are you trying to get your old man killed?

184
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,600
No, no, don't come any closer!

185
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,080
They really are all monsters, ahhh!

186
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,360
That was terrifying.

187
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,840
Sanbai, let's hurry and go.

188
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,400
Oh no!

189
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,760
Young Master Liang, don't be afraid.

190
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,400
My master is Huang Jiyan of the Liu Jia Sect.

191
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,680
He just knows a few mystical arts.

192
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,440
Ah, the renowned Mr. Huang from Jingxiang.

193
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,240
Yes, but by the time it reached me, Zhu Gongyuan,

194
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,120
my talent was lacking.

195
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,880
I couldn't bring glory to our sect.

196
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,840
I'm ashamed.

197
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,960
Doctor Zhu is the head of the Liu Jia Sect.

198
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,160
My apologies for the disrespect.

199
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,440
Since you have already come of age,

200
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
why aren't you allowed to leave the mountain?

201
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,800
Die'er is kind but naturally reckless.

202
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,440
She's been getting into trouble since childhood.

203
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,440
Now she keeps talking about dying on the battlefield.

204
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
How can I not worry?

205
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,560
Let me leave the mountain.

206
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,760
Dying in battle is better than being bored to death here.

207
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,920
Is dying on the battlefield really a noble cause?

208
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,800
How is fighting for the country and the people not noble?

209
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,640
If you want to die in battle, that's easy enough.

210
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,520
But it won't necessarily bring peace and prosperity.

211
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,520
That's twisted logic.

212
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,440
Your son is quite talented.

213
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,080
Why not let him attend the academy to learn more about etiquette and music?

214
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,960
It could also help him cultivate his character.

215
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,200
Which academy?

216
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,080
Which teacher could possibly keep her in line?

217
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,720
If Divine Doctor Zhu doesn't mind,

218
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,240
I'm willing to accept him as my junior.

219
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,640
I recommend your son enroll in the Four Families Academy in Jianye City.

220
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,960
The Four Families Academy is a royal academy!

221
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,920
Yes, yes, my nephew is really outstanding.

222
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,160
He's a student representative at the Four Families Academy.

223
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,800
He ranked first in all five subjects.

224
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,200
The five subjects: loyalty, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust.

225
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,400
No, that's not right.

226
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,920
The five subjects are poetry, classics, rites, changes, and chronicles.

227
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,240
Poetry, classics, rites, changes, chronicles.

228
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,000
That's six words—doesn't that mean six subjects?

229
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,680
"Chronicles" is just one subject.

230
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,120
Oh.

231
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,440
Divine Doctor Zhu, do you have any instructions?

232
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,400
The young man looks handsome.

233
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,800
Oh, I mean, he looks upright.

234
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,920
He must be trustworthy.

235
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,520
If he can guide this unruly child,

236
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,920
it would be her good fortune.

237
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,080
But after three months, Die'er must be sent back.

238
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,520
There are some family matters I can't disclose.

239
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Tomorrow, I'll bring Die'er to the city.

240
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,240
What? I have to study?

241
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,840
So that's why you came to the academy?

242
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,120
No, I snuck out that very night.

243
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,600
Heaven is helping me.

244
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,480
That old geezer snatched the clay pig.

245
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,200
But I picked up a purse.

246
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,680
There's quite a bit of money in it.

247
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
No, no, it's ill-gotten money.

248
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,920
Tsk, I'm just borrowing it.

249
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,400
If I find out whose it is,

250
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
I'll pay them back double.

251
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,880
Yes, yes, I'll definitely return it.

252
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,040
Why bother studying?

253
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,200
Why learn medicine?

254
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,760
Can money really stump me?

255
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
If I want to be a hero, should I be afraid of being broke?

256
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,960
I'll go down the mountain to rob the rich and help the poor.

257
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Just keep a little for myself, that's all.

258
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:58,960
No, no.

259
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,600
How is that any different from being a bandit?

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,800
Or maybe...

261
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,080
I could just take on more labor jobs to earn money.

262
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,040
All this strength I trained isn't for nothing.

263
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,520
Little bunny, run!

264
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,520
You nasty little yellow thing!

265
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
How dare you try to catch and eat such a cute little bunny?

266
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,040
Watch me deal with you!

267
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,320
Where's the bunny?

268
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,000
Ah, be careful!

269
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:28,960
Oh no!

270
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,200
Bunny, are you okay? Where is this place?

271
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,840
Bunny, don't run! Where are you going?

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,400
Are you trying to take me somewhere?

273
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,600
Hey, got you!

274
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,280
Huh, what's that sparkling thing?

275
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,600
Could there be treasure hidden in this cave?

276
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,800
Otherwise, what else could that shiny thing be?

277
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,920
Scared? What is there to be scared of?

278
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,160
If I find treasure, I...

279
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,440
Can't I use it to help the poor?

280
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,920
And just keep a little for travel expenses.

281
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,120
I need to eat if I'm going to roam the world.

282
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,480
Now's the time for my strength to come in handy!

283
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,560
What the heck?

284
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,760
The entrance looks really mysterious.

285
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,920
But after a few steps inside, it's a dead end.

286
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,480
That's it? Seriously?

287
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,720
Hey, hey, hey, what's this?

288
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,520
Could there be something hidden here?
