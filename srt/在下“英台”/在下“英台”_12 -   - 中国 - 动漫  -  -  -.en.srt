1
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,560
The kids have been sneaking into Zhu Ke's lair for almost two hours.

2
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,400
We've stalled long enough.

3
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,080
We can't sacrifice any more brothers.

4
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,440
Retreat.

5
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,200
You're leaving already?

6
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,920
I haven't had enough of the fight yet!

7
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,600
Uncle Chilin, it's me, Suo'er.

8
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,320
Suo'er, you've grown so much.

9
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,720
Suo'er used the stratagem of driving a tiger to swallow a wolf.

10
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,280
Father's great vengeance will soon be avenged.

11
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,360
Ah.

12
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,920
Now only the Sun Emperor remains to be killed.

13
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,920
To avenge my brother and Uncle Chilin.

14
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,520
Good child.

15
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,240
Don't go.

16
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,400
Uncle Chilin.

17
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,800
I've been trapped under the boulder for twenty years.

18
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,560
Today, I have only one day of life left.

19
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,120
Tomorrow, I'll try breaking into Jianchu Palace again.

20
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,840
What if I succeed?

21
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,280
I'll go with Ma Cheng.

22
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,720
No need for such small acts of loyalty.

23
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,480
Reach out to allies and destroy Jiangdong together.

24
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,360
Only when you and Uncle Chilin are safe can I rest in peace.

25
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,480
I will follow Uncle Chilin's orders.

26
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
Wipe out your entire clan.

27
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,960
Chase them! Don't let them escape, you useless fools!

28
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
W-what should we do?

29
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,480
We've been fighting for almost an hour.

30
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm running out of strength. I don't know how much longer the Six Jia magic can hold.

31
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,400
Do you think you can escape?

32
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,160
You break out with the letter.

33
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
I'll hold them off.

34
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,880
They wouldn't dare harm me.

35
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,960
After all, I'm a princess.

36
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,160
It worked just now, but maybe not anymore.

37
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,080
The soldiers are all Zhu family loyalists. They only obey Zhu Ke.

38
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,360
They wouldn't dare.

39
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,400
You break out, I...

40
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,840
Take the letter and go quickly.

41
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,120
Why are you just standing there, you useless fool?

42
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,480
You're as useless as a quail!

43
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,480
Don't you get what's going on?

44
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,480
Think carefully about what you need to do.

45
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,520
Eliminate internal threats.

46
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,080
Protect Jiangdong.

47
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,800
Then take the letter and go quickly.

48
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,560
No, stop her! Everyone, go!

49
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,480
Don't you dare.

50
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,480
Ah! No, no!

51
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,000
Eliminate internal threats.

52
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,720
Protect Jiangdong.

53
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,640
Eliminate internal threats.

54
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Protect Jiangdong.

55
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,440
Protect Jiangdong.

56
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,840
Move aside.

57
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Are you alright?

58
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,160
Give Zhu Ke's traitorous letter to His Majesty. Hurry and save Mr. Sun!

59
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,280
Yingtai.

60
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,560
Master, did we succeed?

61
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,400
What is success?

62
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,920
Ascending the platform to confer a generalship.

63
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,680
Ascending the platform is both an honor and the beginning of hardship.

64
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,040
Hardship.

65
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,440
The goal is noble, but nobility alone won't achieve it. To reach the goal,

66
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,440
one must use any means necessary. For the greater good, even if it means descending into Avici Hell, I would not hesitate.

67
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,760
Even if it means descending into Avici Hell, I would not hesitate.

68
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,560
You're awake.

69
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,400
Where's Mr. Sun?

70
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,600
Mr. Sun is slightly injured, but he's fine. He's resting in his room.

71
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,920
That's good.

72
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,800
What about that villain Zhu Ke?

73
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,040
He's been captured.

74
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,560
And His Majesty?

75
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,360
His Majesty was worried about Prime Minister Lu and took troops to his residence.

76
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,520
Alright, then I'm relieved. Let me sleep a bit more.

77
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,680
Um...

78
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,240
Hmm.

79
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,280
Zhu, you look great in women's clothes.

80
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,480
Oh, really?

81
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,080
I'll take that as a compliment.

82
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,960
I usually talk about everything with Liang, but today I don't know what to say.

83
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,520
Because now I can't pretend not to know.

84
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,480
You mean you knew all along?

85
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,160
Both men and women can achieve greatness. Zhu has always opposed the idea of gender differences.

86
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,280
So I...

87
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,280
That's a good reason.

88
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,000
Brother Liang.

89
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,960
Twin carps swimming together will eventually meet the rain, unless it's for entering the academy.

90
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,480
The cocooned clothes from the other day were like a silkworm binding itself.

91
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,480
Alas, I can't seek your guidance in poetry and literature anymore, Brother Liang.

92
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,680
Die'er, the wind through bamboo always hides a touch of clarity.

93
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,480
I've long known that the world has its own rules.

94
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,720
From now on, through a thousand cold mountains and mist, your light will be my home.

95
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,000
The Zhu family has been eliminated, and the Ma family has long since submitted.

96
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,360
But Lu Boyan remains a major threat.

97
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
It's time.

98
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,600
Today, it's my turn.

99
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,560
Emperors truly are all the same.

100
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,160
When they need you, everything goes smoothly.

101
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,240
Once they're done with you, they kill the hounds after the hares are bagged.

102
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,360
Brother Lu, your son will be released tomorrow.

103
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,360
Is it time for me to face judgment?

104
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,840
Chancellor Lu Boyan has indulged his rebellious son.

105
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,920
His crime is unforgivable.

106
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,400
Proceed.

107
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,600
Strip him of his title.

108
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,080
Imperially bestowed white silk.

109
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,120
I thought Your Majesty wanted me to help eliminate Zhu Ke.

110
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,920
I didn't expect Zhu Ke wasn't the only one Your Majesty wanted gone.

111
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,440
Your Majesty's plans are tightly linked and masterful at every step.

112
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,720
I am impressed.

113
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,160
By the way,

114
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,560
His Majesty must have given you white silk.

115
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,960
Don't hide it.

116
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,520
His Majesty threatened my family.

117
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,000
With Zhu Ke gone,

118
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,720
the Lu family is no longer needed.

119
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,920
If I don't die,

120
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Hang'er will never return.

121
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,840
Brother Ma, please leave.

122
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,520
I will bathe and change.

123
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,760
His Majesty says, "Since ancient times, heroes have emerged from the young."

124
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,840
For Jiangdong, they rid the land of evil.

125
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,520
They were wounded and nearly died, which moved me deeply.

126
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,200
Therefore, I grant Liang the title of General of Illustrious Culture.

127
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,120
Bestow the title Earl of Changzhou.

128
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,880
Grant Zhu Die'er the title General of Illustrious Martiality.

129
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,920
Bestow the title Earl of Yuanhe.

130
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,960
Promote Sun Buli to Marquis of Wu.

131
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,160
Grant a fief of twenty thousand households.

132
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

133
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,440
But I don't know why

134
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,720
The Earl of Yuanhe entered the hall dressed as a woman.

135
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,200
Early this morning, Han Jue hurriedly summoned us to the hall for the conferral.

136
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,600
Perhaps the Earl of Yuanhe didn't have time to change.

137
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,960
Your Majesty, forgive me.

138
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,160
Zhu Die'er is a woman.

139
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,600
Ah!

140
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,200
See, I knew it.

141
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,360
You do look quite nice when you dress up.

142
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,240
But there's no need to boast here.

143
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
Sorry, Mr. Sun.

144
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,720
If you joke like that again,

145
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,320
I'll hit you.

146
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
You little trickster.

147
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,760
Yesterday I was thinking of sacrificing myself to save you.

148
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,640
And you tricked me like this.

149
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,960
Die'er only disguised herself to study at the academy.

150
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,480
Your Majesty.

151
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,080
After all, these children

152
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,600
deceived the emperor and lied for titles. How should they be punished?

153
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,680
After all,

154
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,520
they have

155
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,240
made great contributions.

156
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,760
So it's acceptable to deceive the emperor?

157
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,880
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

158
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,560
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

159
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,480
I'll give you one more chance.

160
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,000
Zhu Die'er, speak for yourself.

161
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,560
Are you a man?

162
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,960
Everyone present will keep your secret.

163
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,720
Die'er is truly a woman; I cannot call a deer a horse.

164
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,080
I wish to accept the title as a woman.

165
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,000
You...

166
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,880
Don't know what's good for you.

167
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,640
Your Majesty must not break your word.

168
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,680
I promised to reward Zhu Die'er as a man.

169
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,640
Men and women

170
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,920
can both achieve great things.

171
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,360
What matters to me is that you deceived me.

172
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,080
Your Majesty,

173
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,840
News has come from the Chancellor's residence.

174
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,400
At dawn,

175
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,320
Chancellor Lu hanged himself with white silk.

176
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,880
His Majesty said he was worried about the Chancellor's safety.

177
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,240
He led troops to the Chancellor's residence.

178
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,400
You, all of you,

179
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,800
have good intentions.

180
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,560
But good intentions alone won't achieve your goals.

181
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,040
To achieve your goals, you must use any means necessary.

182
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,520
For righteousness, even descending into Avici Hell is worth it.

183
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,160
Even if it means falling into Avici Hell, I would not hesitate.

184
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,520
Why are you standing there? Take them away.

185
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,200
Your Majesty, I am willing to go north for a political marriage.

186
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,600
Oh?

187
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,600
I beg you to pardon Zhu Die'er.

188
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,920
And allow her to escort me to Luobei as a general.

189
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,760
Otherwise, I will not hesitate to become a nun.

190
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,200
All of you want to negotiate with me.

191
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,280
Isn't this what you've always wanted?

192
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,520
Fine.

193
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,920
Zhu Die'er is pardoned for deceiving the emperor.

194
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,440
What's that noise? What's happening outside?

195
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,960
There are assassins!

196
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,280
As soon as I arrived, I heard the good news—Lu Boyan has taken his own life.

197
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,640
Then you're next, old man of the Sun family.

198
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,000
All of you, attack!

199
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,400
Drive the assassins back!

200
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,320
I will ascend the platform and confer the generalship immediately. I will not break my word.

201
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,200
Jiangdong must not fall into chaos now.

202
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,880
I act not to save you, but to protect the people of Jiangdong.

203
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,720
To fulfill my master's unfinished mission.

204
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,920
I will teach you the Water Six Jia incantation.

205
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,040
Water has no fixed form, and troops have no constant tactics.

206
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,880
The weak overcome the strong, the gentle defeat the rigid.

207
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:58,280
Even if I have only one day left to live, I will avenge my master. Uncle Chilin will not rest until death.

208
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,320
Once vengeance is fulfilled, I can finally reunite with my master.

209
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,240
Six Jia of the Water Element

210
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,280
Your skills have greatly improved, benefactor.

211
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,400
That's truly worth celebrating.

212
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,120
Vengeance is endless. Return to Jingxi.

213
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,560
It's a pity I didn't kill Lu Boyan myself.

214
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,600
The Sun Emperor must die by the crescent-moon blade today, to honor my master.

215
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,320
Hold him back. Don't let him approach His Majesty.

216
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,200
The hour of Chen is almost over. Get out of my way!

217
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,040
The hour of Chen... The hour of Chen...

218
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,640
Die'er, the ancient ingot sword is on the ground.

219
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,520
The hour of Chen has already passed.

220
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,840
Then my fate has come as well.

221
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,720
We're still alive.

222
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,160
I'm fine.

223
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,320
Destiny... the final hour.

224
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,120
The time has come.

225
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,920
Master, please don't blame me.

226
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,440
Uncle Chilin has come to see you.

227
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,680
Mother, the horse demon has been subdued, and the Water and Fire elements have been united.

228
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,160
The Wind and Wood elements are in North Luo and West Jing. Die'er ascends the platform as general to avenge her master.

229
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,120
She also seeks to unite all four elements and rescue you.

230
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,360
Master, I will inherit your legacy.

231
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,640
I am Ying Tai.
