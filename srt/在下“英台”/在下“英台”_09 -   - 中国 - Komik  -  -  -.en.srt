Don't throw your lives away.

25
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Go on, attack! All of you!

26
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,440
The hairpin is much more powerful after being modified.

27
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,120
So cool!

28
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,080
Try using the Giant Butterfly Reverse Scale.

29
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,480
It won't take their lives.

30
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,520
Do you admit defeat or not?

31
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,640
I admit, I admit, I admit!

32
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,120
I admit, I admit, I admit!

33
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,840
Zhu, you’re a genius!

34
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,080
I wasn’t asking you.

35
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,080
Hero, please take me as your disciple!

36
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,480
Wancai is willing to join the Liujia Sect and sweep the floors for Master.

37
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,240
Teach me the Liujia techniques!

38
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,320
No, no, no, don’t pull me!

39
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,000
Has the spear squad arrived yet?

40
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,520
They should be here soon.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,640
They’re here!

42
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,240
Whoa, so many people!

43
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,960
No sense of honor—are they here for a battle?

44
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,360
It’s them! They tried to assassinate our officer—kill them!

45
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,080
Looks like I went too easy on them earlier.

46
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,720
This time, we need to teach them a real lesson.

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,560
Strategist, run!

48
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,600
Master, run!

49
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,280
Stop shouting!

50
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,640
These troops are heavy infantry and cavalry.

51
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,280
They’re not like Zhu Fei’s group.

52
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,600
If we offend them, we’ll be in real trouble.

53
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,120
Let’s just run for now.

54
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,360
Chase them!

55
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,960
Don’t let them get away!

56
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,200
Hurry, hurry, get on the carriage!

57
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,720
Ow, ow, run!

58
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,840
Where are we running to?

59
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,520
Let’s hurry back to the Ma residence.

60
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,880
My father has a thousand personal guards stationed at the Court of Justice.

61
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,680
Why should we fear their mere hundred men?

62
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,760
The General’s guards and the Court of Justice’s guards fighting each other—

63
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,080
That’s way too intense!

64
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,000
Then what do you suggest we do?

65
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,240
There’s nothing we can do.

66
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,440
One horse pulling four people—

67
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,400
How fast can it even go?

68
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,440
How dare you!

69
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,360
I am from the Ma family of the Court of Justice.

70
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,080
Noted. Soon, I'll send your corpses to the Ma family.

71
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,240
You must not fight in the street.

72
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,160
Officer Zhu, what happened?

73
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,840
Someone is trying to kill me.

74
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,480
General Lu.

75
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,840
The city’s security is the responsibility of my Jinwu Guard.

76
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,400
Officer Zhu need not worry about it.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,440
You—you’re opposing the Grand General’s residence.

78
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,480
Brother Lu, you arrived just in time.

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,400
Senior.

80
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,080
You two know each other?

81
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,400
Grand General.

82
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,880
It’s good that you’re here.

83
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,280
Zhu Fei is chatting with General Lu.

84
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,120
Grand General.

85
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,000
The Jinwu Guard was patrolling here.

86
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,280
We happened to run into Officer Zhu.

87
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,320
I am just a humble official.

88
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,040
I am investigating a case.

89
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,480
I caught three suspects who tried to assassinate His Majesty.

90
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,680
But the Jinwu Guard stopped me.

91
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,040
Oh.

92
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,920
Perhaps General Lu is eager to earn merit as well.

93
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,560
Then let him have it.

94
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,440
Yes.

95
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,400
I will take them back to the office for a thorough interrogation.

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,480
That day, I heard it with my own ears.

97
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,120
The assassin called this young man his benefactor.

98
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
If you fail to get any results from the interrogation,

99
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,480
you won’t be able to justify yourself.

100
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,080
After all, these young men are close to you like brothers.

101
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,680
Don’t let yourself be accused of forming factions.

102
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,920
His Majesty hates that the most.

103
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,720
I’ve given you a chance.

104
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,760
Don’t let your father down.

105
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,680
Prime Minister Lu’s reputation is legendary.

106
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
Interesting, let's see what he chooses.

107
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,080
What does the Grand General want Lu Hang to do?

108
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,560
I wouldn't dare.

109
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,800
I, Zhu Ke, am still hoping for Chancellor Lu's support.

110
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,040
Today, one of you must come with me.

111
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,440
Even if there's an arrest, it should be the Jinwu Guards in charge of city security who do it.

112
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,440
Assassins from enemy states have already infiltrated the capital.

113
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,640
As Grand General, I can declare martial law at any time.

114
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,120
The military will immediately take over the entire city.

115
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,960
Even your Jinwu Guards must follow my orders.

116
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,560
Is what he said true?

117
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,560
Yes.

118
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,000
If you want to fight, call in the archers.

119
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,000
Brother Lu, both of us have the real Six Jia; let's fight them to the end.

120
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,720
Zhu Ke's personal guards are not to be trifled with.

121
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Grand General, I'll go with you.

122
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,760
So you admit defeat just like that?

123
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,680
Tie him up.

124
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,160
No wonder the Lu family has thrived in Jiangdong for so long.

125
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,320
So you really know how to adapt to the times.

126
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:48,960
You—

127
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
Listen to me, go ask Mr. Sun for help.

128
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,000
Opportunity.

129
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,520
Yes.

130
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,120
Take him away.

131
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,880
Father was right, Zhu Ke is getting more and more arrogant.

132
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,640
Since they framed Brother Lu with an assassin,

133
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,080
then we'll turn their scheme against them and use the assassin incident to strike back.

134
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,880
How do you plan to do that?

135
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,880
There's someone outside who can help.

136
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,400
Ma Wancai.

137
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,280
What can that spoiled brat do?

138
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,320
I understand now.

139
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,173
Ma Wancai's father, Ma Wenzhong, is the Court Justice.

140
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:38,520
He oversees criminal law related to the palace and the aristocracy.

141
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,480
They actually refused to let me in.

142
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,120
I'm so angry!

143
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,480
When have I, Young Master Ma, ever been treated like this?

144
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,160
Hey, Dean Sun.

145
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,840
Master Zhu.

146
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,360
Why do you call him Master?

147
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,720
He saw the Liu Jia Technique and wants to learn it.

148
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,840
Master, what secrets are you discussing? Can I listen?

149
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,600
Don't call me that. You never have good intentions, always thinking about playing around.

150
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,040
No, Wancai wants to learn the Liu Jia Technique not for fun, but to wield a sword and save the world.

151
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,080
I mean it.

152
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,840
Yes, absolutely sincere.

153
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,080
You heard what Zhu Ke said just now.

154
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,680
Next, either Senior Lu will be arrested, or I will.

155
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,040
What do you think we should do?

156
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,680
Oh, that's easy.

157
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,320
If you're arrested, you'll be sent to the Court Justice for questioning.

158
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,320
Isn't the Court Justice my father?

159
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,920
No problem, leave it to me.

160
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
No matter who gets arrested,

161
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,120
he'll release them immediately.

162
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,640
No, no, that's not the plan.

163
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,720
We need to convict General Lu.

164
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,840
Sentenced to death.

165
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,920
No, not you.

166
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,480
Do you two have a grudge against each other?

167
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,040
And you’re still laughing.

168
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Be good, and I’ll teach you the art of turning beans into soldiers later.

169
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,920
Okay, leave it to me.

170
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,400
Just to learn the bean-soldier technique,

171
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,520
you’re willing to trade someone else’s life?

172
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,680
Hey.

173
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,960
The laws of Jiangdong are being toyed with by people like you.

174
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,000
Dean, stop making jokes.

175
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,940
Lu Hang has been convicted of colluding with the enemy.

176
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,780
His father, Prime Minister Lu, will surely be implicated and held accountable.

177
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,660
The balance between generals and ministers will be broken, and Zhu Ke will definitely show his true colors.

178
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,340
He might even let his guard down.

179
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,940
Only by disrupting the current stability can we find a way to break the deadlock.

180
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,340
The only uncontrollable factor is the horse demon.

181
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,620
No one knows when it will reappear.

182
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,320
Father.

183
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,040
If anything happens to the Grand Commander,

184
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,160
your entire family, all nine generations, wouldn’t be enough to pay for it.

185
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,680
Shameless old dog.

186
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,920
You look filthy and still call yourself a general.

187
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,240
You’re just a corpse chopped up by the generals.

188
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,440
Dad.

189
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,160
Why did you come to the Prime Minister’s residence to fight?

190
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,320
(Prime Minister’s Residence)
You’re lecturing me? You left without a word and didn’t come home all night.

191
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,960
No, it’s not what you think.

192
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,600
What do I think it is, then?

193
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
No, it’s nothing like that.

194
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,200
Are you General Zhu Gongyuan?

195
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,000
It's been over twenty years since we last met.

196
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,400
Who are you?

197
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,560
I'm Lu Nan.

198
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,000
Nan, how did you get so old?

199
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,000
It really is the General.

200
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,320
That's right, I've killed a lot of people.

201
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,320
Every time something happens in the residence,

202
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,880
you're always the one leading the charge.

203
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,680
Manager Nan.

204
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,520
I'm just looking out for the safety of the residence.

205
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,640
General Zhu, please come inside and catch up.

206
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,320
Ah, Princess Yuanhe is here as well.

207
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,480
Hello, Uncle Nan.

208
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,640
That monster was guided by a master.

209
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,000
It chased us all the way from Sucheng Valley to General's Ridge.

210
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,360
If Elder Huang hadn't sent Brother Zhu and the others to help,

211
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,400
and break that strange stone formation,

212
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,880
tens of thousands of Jiangdong soldiers and the commander would have died on the spot.

213
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,080
Are you really that powerful?

214
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,920
Back then, your mother, Sixth Uncle, Thirteenth Uncle, Twenty-First Uncle, and I

215
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,760
were all villagers from Jingxiang.

216
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,160
During the off-season, we studied under the local scholar, Elder Huang.

217
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,320
We learned quite a bit of Liu Jia techniques.

218
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,480
We were considered the third generation of the Liu Jia sect.

219
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,400
The burning of Yiling.

220
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,240
Commander Lu defeated Jingxi.

221
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,840
On the way back, the army passed through Sucheng Valley.

222
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,040
We met Elder Huang.

223
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,960
That year, I went on campaign with Commander Lu.

224
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,640
That day was very strange.

225
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,680
Commander.

226
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,200
The river to the north was swift.

227
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,720
To the south were high mountains and steep ridges.

228
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,280
Sucheng Valley to the southeast was the only way through.

229
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
There wasn't a single soldier in the valley.

230
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,240
But there was an intense murderous aura.

231
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,080
We have thoroughly investigated.

232
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,880
Yes, there are only scattered rocks and withered trees in the valley.

233
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,760
Take a few more men and investigate again.

234
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,440
Yes, sir.

235
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,680
(Ma Wenzhong, Deputy General to Lu Boyan)

236
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,600
Th-this is where Xie Ling was ambushed and killed over a year ago.

237
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,960
Could it be that someone has come to claim a life?

238
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,040
Ma Wenzhong.

239
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,880
You and I have led troops and killed countless enemies over the years.

240
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,560
If ghosts could really claim lives,

241
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,040
would we still be alive today?

242
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,920
Commander, that's not what I meant.

243
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,440
But there's a murderous aura even though no one's here.

244
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,520
Isn't that a vengeful spirit?

245
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,720
Enough, enough.

246
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,840
Let's keep looking.

247
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,480
Just handle it with caution.

248
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,640
Commander, we've investigated again.

249
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,520
Not a single soldier was found.

250
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
We only saw an old man passing by on a donkey.

251
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,560
We brought him here.

252
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,760
Awaiting your orders, Commander.

253
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,080
Is this what you call an invitation?

254
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,040
Sorry to have startled you, sir.

255
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,800
I, Lu, have not managed my troops strictly enough.

256
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,000
I am ashamed.

257
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,180
(Huang Jiyan, founder of the Liu Jia Sect, also known as Old Huang)
No need to be startled.

258
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,280
The world has been in chaos for decades.

259
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,320
Being dragged around like this has happened to me more than once or twice.

260
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,160
It's fine, it's fine.

261
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,520
May I ask your name, sir?

262
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,840
Are you a local?

263
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,800
Why are you passing through such a desolate place?

264
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,480
The villagers call me Old Huang.

265
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,680
My family has lived in Xinye for generations.

266
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,640
My name is Huang Jiyan.

267
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,240
Commander, what's going on?

268
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,800
Who is this old man?

269
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,960
He's the Prime Minister of Jingxi's father-in-law.

270
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,200
Ah, arrest him! Arrest him!

271
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,160
Just an old man nearing the end of his days,

272
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,800
and yet he frightens the entire Jiangdong army.

273
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Mr. Huang, why did you risk entering our military's restricted area?

274
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,040
Are you really here to spy for Jingxi?

275
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,120
Jingxi has no one else?

276
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,680
They send the Prime Minister's elderly father-in-law as a scout?

277
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,680
He's an old man in his eighties, what are you afraid of?

278
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,240
So, Mr. Huang,

279
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,760
Today is the Ghost Festival. I planned to visit my old friend Situ Hui's grave and pour a jug of wine for him.

280
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,160
Then chat for an hour and head back.

281
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,440
Oh, both of you are renowned figures from Jingxiang.

282
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,520
I am Lu Boyan, Commander of Jiangdong's forces. Greetings.

283
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,080
No need, no need.

284
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,040
Jingxiang now belongs to Jiangdong.

285
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,080
I am now a citizen of Jiangdong.

286
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,800
Since fate brought me here today,

287
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,520
I suppose I have a duty to offer the Commander some advice.

288
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:35,880
Advice?

289
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,240
The Valley of Sucheng may seem easy to march through,

290
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,360
but you'll surely fall into an ambush there.

291
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,960
It's best not to enter.

292
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,920
The southeastern mountains may be tall,

293
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,480
but they're not dangerous.

294
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,040
March for twelve or thirteen more days and you can circle around to Wuling.

295
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,520
Commander, don't trust him so easily. Jingxi is pretending to be weak on purpose.

296
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,960
They're using an old man to lull us into a trap and lead our army into an ambush.

297
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,360
I've given my advice.

298
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,080
Commander, just think it over.

299
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,720
I'll head home now.

300
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,720
No, tie him up and bring him along.

301
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,840
If we run into an ambush, the Jingxi army might hesitate because of him.

302
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,200
That's enough.

303
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,920
It doesn't hurt to try.

304
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,000
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

305
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,360
The governor is wise.

306
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,040
Crossing mountains and valleys is very dangerous.

307
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,200
How can we trust the words of that crazy old man?

308
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,560
Honestly...

309
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,920
Look, we've walked through this valley and haven't seen a single person.

310
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,760
We haven't even seen a rabbit.

311
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,520
We must not let our guard down.

312
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,400
Yes, the valley is flat after all.

313
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,160
There's no cover.

314
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,040
We can see nearly a hundred meters ahead.

315
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,280
Even if there's an ambush, we have time to organize a defense.

316
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,800
Hmm.

317
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,360
After all, we've scouted twice.

318
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,720
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

319
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,600
Why is there such a chilling wind?

320
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,200
Where did all these rocks come from?

321
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,680
And these bones—are they from a horse or a person?

322
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,680
Could these be the remains of the Jingxi soldiers from back then?

323
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,600
What is there to fear? Everyone just serves their own master.

324
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,320
No one owes anyone anything.

325
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,200
Ah, I feel terrible all over.

326
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,560
Stop. Wait for the sandstorm to pass, then move on when we can see ahead.

327
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,000
Not good, it's an ambush!

328
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,840
The whole army, form units of five and take defensive positions!

329
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,000
I've been waiting here in hardship for over a year.

330
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,760
Who goes there?

331
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,040
I've finally waited for you.

332
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,720
Lu Boyan.

333
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,200
O phoenix, O phoenix, return to your homeland.

334
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,880
Roaming the four seas in search of your mate.

335
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,600
The time has not come, and I have nowhere to go.

336
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,880
How could I have known I would ascend this hall today?

337
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,440
A beautiful lady resides in her chamber.

338
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,600
Though her room is near, she is far away, tormenting my heart.

339
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,920
What fate would let us entwine our necks like mandarin ducks?

340
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,560
Soaring together.

341
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,600
The phoenix soars and flies.

342
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,880
Searching the four seas for a mate.

343
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,880
Alas, my beloved,

344
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,120
is not by the eastern wall.

345
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,040
Let the zither speak for me.

346
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,440
To express my heartfelt feelings.

347
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,520
I wish to match your virtue.

348
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,520
And walk hand in hand together.
