W-what are you doing taking off your clothes?

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,240
- Going to sleep.
- Oh, going to sleep.

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,960
Just because you gave me something, does that mean you can do whatever you want?

26
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,900
What are you talking about?

27
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,500
Didn't you agree to it yourself?

28
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,460
I... I...

29
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,420
What should I do? What should I do?

30
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,740
Father, what should I do?

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,440
Mom is watching.

32
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,500
Ahhh!

33
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,280
It's safer to stick it on.

34
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,280
When did you start growing your beard again?

35
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,760
It grows fast.

36
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,680
It's really a headache.

37
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,400
Oh, that's way too fast.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,320
You go to sleep first.

39
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,120
I'm not sleepy yet.

40
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, then rest early.

41
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,960
Tomorrow I'll go to the street to buy some wood.

42
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,880
I'll fix up the bed.

43
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,240
Well, it's a bit slanted, but still pretty sturdy.

44
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,680
Ouch.

45
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,200
Ah, ear piercings.

46
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,800
Oh, so you also...

47
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,080
Also? Also what?

48
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,240
Then she’s letting you off easy.

49
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,780
(One, two, three, four) Hello, Auntie.

50
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,260
I...

51
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,720
I didn’t mean to.

52
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,280
Why do you have pierced ears?

53
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Uh, I...

54
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,360
When I was a child, I was often sick, so during village rituals,

55
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,440
my father had me play the role of Guanyin.

56
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,200
He said it would help me grow up safely.

57
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,200
Oh, I see. I thought you were a woman.

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,640
Yeah, right.

59
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,480
What are you talking about? How could I be a woman?

60
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,800
I even used to have a beard—it was pretty annoying.

61
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,720
It grew fast, so I had to shave often.

62
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,560
It was such a hassle.

63
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,200
Let's go to the market to buy some wood first.

64
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,400
We need to fix up the bed.

65
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,160
Then we can sleep separately tonight.

66
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,440
As if I actually want to sleep with you.

67
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,560
Then we'll go to Yuanhe Residence to discuss things with Director Sun.

68
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,800
About how to fulfill our promise to His Majesty.

69
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,920
Assist His Majesty in investigating Zhu Ke.

70
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,400
Exactly.

71
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,360
Time is running out.

72
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,400
Zhu, you also need to...

73
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,480
What? Need what?

74
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,560
You also need to maintain...

75
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,480
your masculinity.

76
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,440
The academy doesn't allow girls to enroll.

77
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,200
You can't act like a girl.

78
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,480
Got it.

79
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,400
Otherwise, you'll keep running into trouble with people like Young Master Ma.

80
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,760
It'll only get worse.

81
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,640
Why do you have so many instructions?

82
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,680
Let's go already.

83
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,960
Hey, where's my hairpin?

84
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,720
I took the liberty of making some changes to the hairpin.

85
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,920
Oh, it's so fancy.

86
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,760
I've also enhanced its self-defense capabilities.

87
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,360
Twist the butterfly's head.

88
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,160
The mechanism follows your movement.

89
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,680
The real Liujia can be used to cultivate qi.

90
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,840
It can also be modified.

91
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,840
That's amazing.

92
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,880
This won't stab my head, will it?

93
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
There are safety measures.

94
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,920
There won't be any problems.

95
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,280
Safety measures.

96
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,640
Young Master Ma.

97
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,000
Why are you squatting here?

98
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,560
I don't want another war to break out.

99
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,400
But after all, I'm under the orders of the Chief Historian of the Prime Minister's Office.

100
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm monitoring the political situation in Jiangdong.

101
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,640
After Sun Mou stripped Grand Commander Lu Boyan of his military power,

102
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,520
he himself suffered heavy losses at Xiaoyao Ford.

103
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,000
(At the Grand General's Mansion) This led to no one being able to check Grand General Zhu Ke.

104
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,200
Commander of the Jinwu Guard, Lu Hang, has submitted a memorial. Please report it.

105
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,320
Now, the powerful minister He Yan from the north is pressing in with his army.

106
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,600
But Sun Mou and Zhu Ke are wary of each other.

107
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,600
Neither dares to use their own troops to resist.

108
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,040
Instead, the emperor wants to form a marriage alliance with He Yan.

109
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,360
You are Prime Minister Zhuge's disciple.

110
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,320
I can't control you.

111
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,920
But please don't disturb the balance among the three powers.

112
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,520
Teaming up with Zhu Ke to destroy the Lu family would throw Jiangdong into chaos.

113
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,760
Such a situation is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

114
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,840
We should unite against the north.

115
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,040
Who do you think you are?

116
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,400
Zhuge Long.

117
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,760
Tiny Jingxi can barely protect itself.

118
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,280
And yet you dream of profiting by using Jiangdong.

119
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,640
If it weren't for giving Lu Hang some respect,

120
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,320
you would have been executed long ago.

121
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,560
The Grand General has already reached the highest rank among officials.

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,720
And after that?

123
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,520
What do you mean?

124
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,760
If he doesn't achieve even greater feats,

125
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,440
someone else will seize the opportunity.

126
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,360
If you don't advance, you fall behind.

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,360
Advance? How can you go further after reaching the highest rank?

128
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,520
Are you suggesting treason?

129
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,680
Does General Zhu only want to be a general his whole life?

130
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,840
How dare you! Where are the guards?

131
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,000
Your words don't match your true intentions.

132
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,640
How can one accomplish great things?

133
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,840
Monster! Someone help!

134
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,920
I've always heard that the Rokkaku's mystical arts are unfathomable.

135
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,120
Now that I have the fortune to witness them, they truly are extraordinary.

136
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,360
Taking the head of an officer among a hundred men is as easy as turning your hand.

137
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
But in an army of ten thousand, you would surely be overwhelmed.

138
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,880
You can protect yourself, but it's not enough for greater purposes.

139
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,800
Young Master Suo, are you making fun of what I just said?

140
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,400
I wouldn't dare.

141
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,360
Young Master Suo, you are truly talented and accomplished.

142
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,720
The Grand General is the real role model for the world.

143
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,760
Why are you always so tense with others?

144
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,520
In just a moment,

145
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,320
The General's words are not wrong.

146
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,320
Jingxi is still not strong enough to protect itself.

147
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,080
As for the so-called alliance against Luobei,

148
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,880
it's actually just the Xie and Ma families

149
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,280
seeking a wise leader to rely on.

150
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,040
Together, we aim to create a new order in the world.

151
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
Young Master Suo, you're not here to test me, are you?

152
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,240
The Sun Emperor wouldn't dare test you, sir.

153
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,720
Who else would dare?

154
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,880
If the Sun clan's main forces and the four clans of Jiangdong were all under the wise leader's command,

155
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,160
would there be any need to fear Luobei or He Yan?

156
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,840
Or the arrogant troops of that powdered-faced man?

157
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,800
Young Master Suo, every word you say speaks to my heart.

158
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,680
It's just that we're missing an opportunity.

159
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,440
If there's no opportunity, then create one.

160
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,960
The Sun clan has already made the first move.

161
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,000
Shouldn't the wise leader act quickly as well?

162
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,240
What happened to His Majesty?

163
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,400
The purpose behind Sun's daughter marrying He Yan's adopted son—

164
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,640
Doesn't Your Excellency understand yet?

165
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,280
It's to free up their hands to deal with me.

166
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,400
That's probably what Sun Mou is thinking.

167
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,360
And that's exactly He Yan's goal as well.

168
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Drive the tiger to swallow the wolf.

169
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,680
That's right.

170
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,360
But whichever way you look at it, He Yan is the one reaping the rewards.

171
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,120
Sun Mou is getting senile.

172
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,680
Shortsighted as a mouse.

173
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,640
Sigh, why must Your Excellency be a pawn on someone else's chessboard?

174
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,840
I must break this game.

175
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,880
Shao, please enlighten me.

176
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,560
For the past twenty years,

177
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,960
What the Sun family has held

178
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,480
is only the Lu family of Wu County.

179
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,160
But the Lu family's achievements have overshadowed their lord.

180
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,040
Sun Mou promoted them openly but demoted them in secret.

181
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,440
He stripped them of their military power.

182
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,160
Yes, the position of Chancellor is just a title.

183
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,920
His son, Lu Hang, is only the commander of the Jinwu Guard.

184
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,600
He commands fewer than three thousand men.

185
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,320
But Lu Boyan is still vigorous.

186
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,080
His disciples are spread across six counties.

187
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,360
And he remains loyal to the Sun family.

188
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,920
If Your Excellency makes a move,

189
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,440
it's possible Sun Mou will reinstate the Lu family.

190
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,840
That old man really knows how to fight.

191
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,960
Back then, he played dumb to outsmart the strong.

192
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,840
The first step—

193
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,240
While he has no troops or generals,

194
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,880
find an excuse to wipe out his entire family.

195
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,760
Cut off the Sun family's wings.

196
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,160
Then make things difficult for Sun.

197
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,760
Your Majesty,

198
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,720
there's no need to use your own troops.

199
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,400
They'll use the tactic of driving the tiger to swallow the wolf.

200
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,440
Can't we profit as the fisherman in the end?

201
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,040
Princess Yuanhe is heading north for a political marriage.

202
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,720
If something happens when the escorting party arrives at Luobei,

203
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,920
Sun Bulin is Sun Mou's only daughter.

204
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,200
If Luobei is framed, conflict will surely arise.

205
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,160
He Yan's scheme will fall apart.

206
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,840
My lord, you are wise.

207
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,200
Then this "accident"...

208
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,920
Leave it to me.

209
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,360
My lord can safely remain in the command tent.

210
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,560
Just wait for He Yan and Sun Mou to weaken each other.

211
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,480
It will be much easier for you to deal with the weakened Sun clan.

212
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Then you'll gain the six counties of Jiangdong.

213
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,720
Such a vast base of operations.

214
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,520
Exactly, six counties with a million households.

215
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,960
If you conscript one soldier from each household,

216
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,680
you'll have a million-strong army to sweep across the land.

217
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,880
Congratulations, my lord, on unifying the realm.

218
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,160
At that time, you two will be made marquises of ten thousand households.

219
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,200
Thank you for your grace, my lord.

220
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,520
Zhu, walking is so tiring.

221
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,760
Why not ride in my carriage?

222
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,680
Strategist, you should come up too.

223
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,880
No need to trouble you, Ma.

224
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,480
I just think you're quite interesting.

225
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,280
That's why I let you off yesterday.

226
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,920
Don't fail to appreciate my kindness.

227
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,960
We came to the academy to study.

228
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,200
Not to play with you.

229
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,200
Oh, now that you're a royal student,

230
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,080
your attitude sure has changed.

231
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,040
Let go of me!

232
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,520
I've already apologized!

233
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,360
You stepped on me—do you think an apology is enough?

234
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,920
I didn't do it on purpose.

235
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,600
I'm just in a bad mood today.

236
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,960
Come with me.

237
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,280
Help!

238
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,320
Yinzhu, help me!

239
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,280
That's Buchan's voice.

240
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,240
Who—who dares touch my...

241
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,960
Are you looking for trouble?

242
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,040
Ah, it's you.

243
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,240
It's you.

244
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,680
It's you.

245
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,840
It's you.

246
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,760
Ordinary folks, stay out of this.

247
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,480
Why are you bullying a young girl?

248
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,560
You didn't bring that sword today, did you?

249
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,920
Ha, you should've said so earlier.

250
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,440
I'm not someone you want to mess with either.

251
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,600
Strategist, should we help?

252
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Let's wait and see for now.

253
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,040
These small fry...

254
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,360
Watch out!

255
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,280
My teeth! My teeth!

256
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,440
If you have the guts, stay right there. I'll get someone.

257
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,120
I'll wait for you. Go ahead and call them.

258
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,600
I have other things to do.

259
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,680
Don't waste my time.

260
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,720
Hurry up, hurry up.

261
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,360
Young Master Zhu, you've saved me a second time.

262
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,640
This time, I definitely won't let you go.

263
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,120
I can't repay you for saving me again.

264
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,200
I can only offer myself in gratitude.

265
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,600
Young Master Zhu, save me!

266
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,360
Madam Yinzhu, we meet again. How have you been lately?

267
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,600
Young Master Zhu, it's best to be careful and leave this place.

268
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,660
Officer Zhu is the cousin of Grand General Zhu Ke.

269
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,060
He always throws his weight around in Jianye.

270
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,740
He won't let this go easily.

271
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,580
Thank you for the warning, Madam Yinzhu.

272
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,260
Don't be late for your appointment with Mr. Sun.

273
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,020
If we don't deal with these bullies, they'll keep picking on the weak.

274
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,260
I want to meet him.

275
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,300
It's still early for the meeting with Mr. Sun this afternoon.

276
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,980
At worst, we just won't fix the bed today.

277
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,460
What? You broke the bed?

278
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,940
You guys...

279
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,460
You...

280
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,380
One of the beds has been broken for a long time.

281
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,580
Oh, uh...

282
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,580
So you two shared a bed?

283
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,380
Uh...

284
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,060
Ah!

285
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,340
