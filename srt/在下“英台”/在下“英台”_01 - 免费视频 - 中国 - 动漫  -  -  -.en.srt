1
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,000
The world was divided into three kingdoms for sixty years of chaos, until the rise of the three great masters of the Liujia Sect.

2
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,960
They were Situ Yi, Zhuge Long, and Lu Boyan.

3
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,720
In the regions of Northern Luo, Western Jing, and Eastern Jiang.

4
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,680
They held real power in the courts of the three kingdoms.

5
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,280
These few seemed to share a certain tacit understanding.

6
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,240
Their balance of power maintained a delicate peace in the land.

7
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
To the emperors, it was a way to keep their own power by fostering rivals.

8
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,120
But to the common people, it was a rare period of peace.

9
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,040
General Xie Ling of Western Jing broke this balance.

10
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,520
He started a war and shook the Central Plains.

11
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,480
Lu Boyan turned the tide, and Xie Ling died in battle.

12
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,560
Xie Ling's divine steed, the red Qilin, sought revenge and hunted Lu Boyan.

13
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,600
The Liujia Sect's founder, Huang Jiyan, sent the Hundred Illusion Butterfly Clan to subdue the beast under a giant stone.

14
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,320
Twenty years later, Zhuge died of illness and Situ retired from office.

15
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,240
Lu Boyan lost his military power.

16
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,880
The balance of the world began to waver.

17
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,760
Zhu Die'er, a descendant of the Liujia Sect and the Butterfly Clan, had heroic ambitions.

18
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,720
She disguised herself as a man and entered the royal academy.

19
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,160
She wished to join the army, fight the enemy, and earn merit as a general.

20
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,880
Brother Zhu, is this your first time in Jianye?

21
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,560
Yes, it's my first time.

22
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,280
So this is the village where the Emperor of Eastern Jiang lives.

23
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,520
Find the emperor and tell him,

24
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,600
I want to join the army, fight for my country, and bring peace to the people.

25
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,240
That's an admirable ambition.

26
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,240
But it's not so easy to meet His Majesty.

27
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,760
Hey, Brother Liang.

28
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,360
Is the emperor sitting in that beautiful carriage?

29
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,080
One driver, one passenger—probably a scholar.

30
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,360
The Son of Heaven rides in a jade carriage drawn by six horses.

31
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,440
With a driver, a right-hand guard, and two maidservants.

32
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,920
Six horses and four attendants.

33
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,920
If only I could ride in one someday...

34
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,760
Don't speak such presumptuous words.

35
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,320
What's that colorful thing up ahead?

36
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,960
What a beautiful kite.

37
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,560
It would be so much fun to use it for Liujia training.

38
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,800
Who is it?

39
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,960
That's dangerous.

40
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,400
Miss, be careful!

41
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,560
Sorry, boss.

42
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
This one is broken.

43
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,320
It's fine, it's fine.

44
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,280
Great Immortal, so merciful and compassionate.

45
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,880
Ah, no, no, I'm not an immortal.

46
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,080
This is the Liu Jia technique.

47
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,440
Liu Jia technique?

48
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,560
Miss,

49
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,240
are you alright?

50
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,960
Young master, I'm fine.

51
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,080
Young master, my name is Bu Chan.

52
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,920
May I ask your surname, young master?

53
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,880
Where do you live, young master?

54
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,160
Are you married, young master?

55
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,400
I... my surname is Zhu, my name is Die'er.

56
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,640
I live at the Zhu family stronghold outside Jianye.

57
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,280
I'm not... not married yet.

58
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,640
Zhu family stronghold?

59
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,480
Young Master Zhu, please wait.

60
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,520
You saved my life, Young Master Zhu.

61
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,480
I want to go back with you.

62
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,200
I'll serve you tea, do your laundry, and take care of you.

63
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,520
No, no, that's not possible.

64
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,360
I still have to go study at the academy.

65
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,840
We appreciate your kindness, miss.

66
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,800
We appreciate it.

67
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,280
Yes, yes, we appreciate it, let go of me.

68
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,480
Hey, don't pull me.

69
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,880
Miss, please, don't.

70
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,120
Do you think you can just leave Jinghong Pavilion whenever you want?

71
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,160
Thank you, Young Master Zhu, for saving my life.

72
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
I thank you on behalf of Bu Chan.

73
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,040
It's only right to help someone in need.

74
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,960
A scholar studies not just for a bright future,

75
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,600
but also to learn proper conduct.

76
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,960
Lending a helping hand is the right thing to do.

77
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,000
You two will surely become pillars of the nation one day.

78
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,960
Hehe, well then,

79
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,440
thank you, Madam Yinzhu, for the tea.

80
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,720
We've rested enough.

81
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,760
It's time to report to the academy.

82
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,040
Let's go, let's go.

83
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,160
Wait.

84
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,840
May I ask, Young Master Zhu,

85
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,480
are you a descendant of the Liu Jia Sect?

86
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,120
Yes.

87
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,560
My father is Zhu Gongyuan.

88
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,560
He is the third-generation leader of the Liu Jia Sect.

89
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,760
I saw you use the true Liu Jia technique.

90
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,880
You truly are a direct heir of the Liu Jia Sect.

91
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,520
You even know about such a small, rundown sect?

92
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,720
Small.

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,800
Over twenty years ago, Liujia Sect was the largest and most renowned sect in the world.

94
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,640
Wow.

95
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,040
My father never says much about it.

96
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,600
Sister, can you tell me

97
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,280
more about the origins of Liujia Sect?

98
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,000
It turns out Liujia Sect has four main branches: Water, Fire, Wood, and Wind.

99
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,400
I wonder if I’ll be able to befriend any of their members after enrolling.

100
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,360
Brother Liang.

101
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,720
So this is the academy.

102
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,920
It’s so big.

103
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,760
It’s much bigger than the ancestral hall at the Zhu family stronghold.

104
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,240
That’s right, Brother Zhu.

105
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,200
The Four Clans Academy is a royal academy.

106
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,360
Its standards are naturally higher.

107
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,160
What is the Four Clans Academy?

108
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,160
Lu, Zhou, Zhu, and Ma.

109
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,920
The four largest noble families in Jiangdong.

110
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,480
The Sun family raised an army and started an uprising in Jiangdong.

111
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,040
They received the full support of the four clans.

112
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,200
It took over thirty years to establish the Jiangdong foundation.

113
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,440
All four clans rose to high positions.

114
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,120
Oh, that’s well deserved.

115
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,080
After Jiangdong was founded, this royal academy was established.

116
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,120
It gathers the most learned people from across the land.

117
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,280
To educate royal descendants and the children of noble families.

118
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,800
As well as the descendants of military heroes.

119
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,720
So you are...

120
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,480
I’m just Young Master Ma’s study companion.

121
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,080
What’s a study companion?

122
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,960
Oh, it’s Sanbai.

123
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,960
Explaining the academy’s history to the new students again?

124
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,760
Good morning, Mr. Yan.

125
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,480
Don’t call me that.

126
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,400
How could an old gatekeeper like me be called “Mister”?

127
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,120
Elders have experienced much in life.

128
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,120
They are wise and understand the ways of the world.

129
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,960
There’s always something we can learn from them.

130
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,280
So cute, so cute.

131
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,880
And this young man,

132
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,440
where have you come to study from?

133
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,640
Hello, Mr. Yan.

134
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
I am Zhu Die'er from the Zhu family stronghold on the outskirts of Jianye.

135
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,880
Oh my, oh my.

136
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,320
Why do you two look like childhood sweethearts at first glance?

137
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,240
Brother Zhu is a man.

138
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,280
How could we be childhood sweethearts?

139
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,520
We—we've only known each other for a few days.

140
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,920
What's wrong with being a man?

141
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
And what's wrong with being a woman?

142
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
It's all the same.

143
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,320
Both can rely on their own intelligence and talent to achieve great things.

144
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,200
It's just a pity

145
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,000
that the academy doesn't accept women.

146
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,440
Isn't the world missing out on half its talent?

147
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,720
Grandfather is right.

148
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,800
Absolutely right.

149
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,000
Fortunately,

150
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,160
even though the academy has no female students,

151
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
it does have a female teacher.

152
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,120
That's a good start.

153
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,120
Oh, a female teacher.

154
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,760
Go on in.

155
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,520
The head of the academy could come to inspect at any time these days.

156
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,800
Don't mess up your attire.

157
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,480
Don't pull me.

158
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,920
I can walk by myself.

159
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,720
Hurry up, hurry up.

160
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,000
The head of the academy is not easy to deal with.

161
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,160
There's still an empty seat in this class.

162
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,080
You sit down first.

163
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,040
Nice to meet you.

164
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,240
I've heard so much about you.

165
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,160
Isn't there an empty seat in the first row?

166
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,480
Someone's sitting there.

167
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,720
Young Master Ma hasn't come.

168
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:34,960
Oh, I see.

169
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,720
Hold onto these books for now.

170
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,400
If there's nothing on your desk, you'll get noticed.

171
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,880
Isn't that a bit inappropriate?

172
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,360
Shouldn't I go through the enrollment process first?

173
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,720
There's no time for that now.

174
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,200
I forgot the headmaster gives a speech on the first of every month.

175
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,400
We almost ran late.

176
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,360
We'll get scolded.

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,680
Just sit down for now.

178
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:53,800
Okay.

179
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,600
Arrange them neatly.

180
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
What does the headmaster look like?

181
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,360
Is he a fierce-looking uncle or an old white-bearded grandpa?

182
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,400
You'll see in a moment.

183
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:08,720
Hey.

184
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,600
Has the headmaster arrived?

185
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,640
The headmaster is a young man.

186
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,360
Headmaster Sun

187
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,400
This is...

188
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,040
I wasn't asking you.

189
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,120
G-g-greetings, Headmaster.

190
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:30,920
Hello.

191
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,920
D-d-do you have any instructions, Headmaster?

192
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,480
Why are you stuttering?

193
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,000
I-I-I'm n-n-not s-s-stuttering.

194
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,480
You call that not stuttering?

195
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,200
You're just like those quails.

196
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,640
Hello, Headmaster Sun.

197
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,840
Do you have any instructions, Headmaster Sun?

198
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,640
Introduce yourself.

199
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,720
What's your name?

200
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,560
Where are you from?

201
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,680
My name is Zhu Die'er.

202
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,080
I'm from the Zhu family village on the outskirts of Jianye.

203
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,920
I'm twenty years old.

204
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,000
I usually do farm work at home.

205
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,520
During the off-season, I learn a bit of basic martial arts.

206
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,400
My father's name is Zhu Gongyuan.

207
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,280
He's an unlicensed doctor.

208
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,400
His medical skills aren't great, but he can handle headaches, fevers, bruises, constipation, and diarrhea.

209
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,440
Those aren't really a problem for him.

210
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,160
What's going on?

211
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,120
Why all the noise?

212
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,240
The Left Dean is here for an inspection.

213
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,160
And you still dare to act out?

214
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,880
It's fine, it's fine.

215
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,040
Usually, it's just a bunch of timid quails.

216
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,440
Today, I see a sparrow.

217
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,080
That's quite interesting.

218
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,360
Student Huang,

219
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,120
what did you do?

220
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,040
Come out here.

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
My surname isn't Huang.

222
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,120
Hey!

223
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,440
You dare talk back?

224
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:36,800
Come out.

225
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,120
Enough.

226
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,240
I'm asking questions—why are you two interrupting?

227
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,880
We wouldn't dare.

228
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,480
Left Dean, please give your instructions.

229
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,680
Student Huang,

230
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,240
oh, I mean Student Zhu,

231
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,120
you're new here, right?

232
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,040
Since you've introduced yourself,

233
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,240
out of courtesy,

234
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
I'll introduce myself as well.

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,560
Dean, please.

236
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,920
My surname is Sun, given name Bulin.

237
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,240
I'm twenty-one this year.

238
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,360
I'm the Left Dean of the Four Families Academy.

239
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,040
There are left and right deans?

240
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,080
You dare talk back?

241
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,760
Left for martial arts, right for literature.

242
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,000
I usually teach students swordsmanship and martial arts.

243
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,640
To strengthen the body.

244
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,920
And to protect our home and country.

245
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,760
Great!

246
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,360
My dream is also to fight evil and help the good.

247
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,320
To protect our home and country, huh?

248
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,720
You—

249
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,840
You just said you've learned a bit of martial arts.

250
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,560
I'd like to see it for myself.

251
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,840
Sure, sure!

252
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,040
The courtyard outside is quite spacious.

253
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
This is such a rare opportunity.

254
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,760
Alright.

255
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,240
Then let's have a match.

256
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,720
Dean Zuo, you mustn't!

257
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,400
Absolutely not!

258
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,440
Think of the academy's reputation!

259
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,560
And the royal dignity!

260
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,720
You mustn't, you mustn't!

261
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,640
Dean Zuo!

262
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,360
Let's go.

263
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,440
If you lose, the royal family's honor will be gone!

264
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,000
Let go of me!

265
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,520
I've been bored to death these past few months.

266
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,920
Finally, something interesting has come up.

267
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,440
If you don't let go, I'll poke you with my sword!

268
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,680
No, you mustn't!

269
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,040
Hurry, go watch the fun!

270
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,120
How should we compete?

271
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,640
You decide.

272
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,800
Swords are too dangerous.

273
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,120
Let's just compete in martial arts.

274
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,440
No fighting to the death.

275
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,120
If one person falls,

276
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,200
the other is the winner.

277
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,640
Could I really lose to this kid in just two moves?

278
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,680
I lost.

279
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,840
You didn't lose, you didn't lose.

280
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,920
Dean Zuo didn't fall.

281
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,760
He didn't fall at all.

282
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,600
It doesn't count.

283
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,600
It's fine, try again.

284
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,600
Dean Zuo's "Thousand-Pound Drop" is the strongest I've ever faced.

285
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,440
Let's go again, let's go again!

286
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,080
Think of the royal family's honor!

287
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Then I'll make my move.

288
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,240
His agility is much better than mine.

289
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,480
It messes with your mind.

290
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,520
This kid really has some skills.

291
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,720
If this keeps up, I'll run out of stamina soon.

292
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,160
This won't do.

293
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,760
I won.

294
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,440
Master Zuo, Master Zuo!

295
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,480
Are you alright?

296
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,240
How are you?

297
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,320
My waist...

298
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,800
Don't help me, don't help me.

299
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,640
I'll do it slowly.

300
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,200
I'll do it myself.

301
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,320
As long as you're okay.

302
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,400
Cut him down! Cut him down!

303
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,960
Princess Jun!

304
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,120
Princess Jun!

305
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,080
Don't!
