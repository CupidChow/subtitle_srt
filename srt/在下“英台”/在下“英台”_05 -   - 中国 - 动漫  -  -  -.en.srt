1
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,910
What? A political marriage?

2
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,990
Yes.

3
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,990
Sister Shangxiang married that old man.

4
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,830
After she died in sorrow,

5
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,470
You promised this wouldn't happen again.

6
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,110
To be a good emperor,

7
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,910
everyone is just a tool to you.

8
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,790
This time, it's not an old man.

9
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,110
He's the same age as you.

10
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,870
It's not about age.

11
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,670
It's about what you see me as.

12
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,590
After all, He Yan from Luobei has stationed 400,000 troops at Luling.

13
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,550
Back then, when Chiji sent 800,000 troops south,

14
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,750
didn't we still win?

15
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,270
That was then, this is now.

16
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,590
Do you think the armies of the four great families of Jiangdong

17
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,030
all listen to me?

18
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,750
Zhu Ke has 100,000, the Lu and Ma families have 50,000 each.

19
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,830
The other regional governors together have about 50,000.

20
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,390
What about the Sun family’s own troops?

21
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,630
Less than 70,000.

22
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,630
Blame me—after the crushing defeat at Xiaoyao Ford,

23
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,750
most of the Sun family’s troops were lost.

24
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,230
It's already good enough that we can keep Jiangdong stable.

25
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,910
Expecting Zhu Ke to use all his forces to resist He Yan

26
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,270
—if he doesn't collude with the enemy, that's already loyal enough.

27
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,830
I forgot about Xiaoyao Ford.

28
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,830
No wonder the great families call you "Sun Hundred-Thousand" behind your back.

29
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,030
If we agree to a marriage alliance, will they withdraw their troops?

30
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,470
It's not that simple.

31
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,070
He Yan doesn't want to sacrifice all his main forces either.

32
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,470
What he wants is submission.

33
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,150
If we agree to a marriage alliance today, he'll just turn his attention to Jingxi.

34
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,510
Give me a few years to keep that Zhu boy in check.

35
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,070
We just reduced Prime Minister Lu's military power, and now we're thinking of doing the same to the Grand General.

36
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,270
Aren't you tired?

37
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,550
It's not about reducing power, it's about maintaining balance.

38
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,070
The four families aren't what they used to be.

39
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,350
Lu Boyan is old, and Lu Hang is just starting out.

40
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,430
Ma Wenzhong is sitting on the fence, watching everyone.

41
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,790
Grand Minister Gu Tan is too upright and doesn't know how to adapt.

42
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,790
In my Sun family, Yan Yuan and Sun Heng both died young.

43
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,270
Who else is there?

44
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,990
Who else? Am I not good enough?

45
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,390
Don't joke around. Four hundred thousand troops are already at the border.

46
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,950
Give me a little more time.

47
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,190
A marriage alliance... Why did it have to come to this?

48
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,750
Did Sister Shangxiang have someone she liked back then?

49
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,270
Hmph, of course you wouldn't know.

50
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,230
Rong Ji, look over there.

51
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,790
That place has a pleasant climate,

52
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,590
and the six counties of Jiangdong are filled with birdsong and blooming flowers.

53
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,790
Once I have unified the land,

54
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,190
I will live in seclusion with you in Pingjiang.

55
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,550
We’ll go boating on Taihu Lake,

56
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,390
and I’ll build the Guanwa Palace for you again.

57
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,870
I don’t want you to repeat King Fuchai’s mistakes.

58
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,790
So what if I do?

59
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,150
All that matters in life are the spring flowers and autumn moon,

60
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,310
and having a beautiful woman by my side.

61
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,190
Otherwise, who would I conquer this vast land for?

62
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,750
Princess Jinxiang, Minister He.

63
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,270
Speak.

64
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,070
Reporting to Minister He,

65
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,270
the letter has been delivered to Grand General Zhu Ke of Jiangdong.

66
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,150
Now we just have to wait for Zhu’s decision.

67
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,470
I, He Yan, don’t like fighting and killing.

68
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,150
I prefer to pit tigers against wolves.

69
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,230
To win without fighting.

70
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,230
If you don’t like fighting, why bring so many soldiers?

71
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,750
I’m here for a hunt.

72
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:22,990
Phoenix, oh phoenix, return to your homeland.

73
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:32,510
You roam the four seas in search of your mate.

74
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:39,910
When the time has not come, there is nothing to long for.

75
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,870
Stop, stop, stop.

76
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,550
Do you know what time it is now?

77
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,350
And you still sang it wrong.

78
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,910
It's "Phoenix Seeks Mate,"

79
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:45,990
not "Mate Seeks Phoenix."

80
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,270
Qiao Jiang, what are you thinking about?

81
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,350
Mama, she did it on purpose.

82
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,470
She must have someone she likes.

83
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,870
She met a general the other day.

84
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,390
And she even smiled.

85
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,190
In a few days, we have to perform at the new Prime Minister's residence.

86
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,310
It's such a grand occasion.

87
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,830
So many noble families will be there.

88
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,710
If you sing it wrong and anger the host,

89
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,870
they might drag you out and behead you on the spot.

90
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,110
Yinzhu Mama.

91
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,270
I know, I know.

92
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,710
I definitely won't sing it wrong in a few days.

93
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,430
Don't think you can be careless just because you're the most popular in Jinghong House.

94
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,390
I have hundreds of ways to deal with you.

95
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,950
You really want to marry a general, huh?

96
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,630
Gentlemen, it's not that we won't receive you.

97
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,950
We truly have an important performance to rehearse for.

98
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,510
Which young master got drunk and dared to barge into my Jinghong House?

99
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,830
Hey there.

100
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,830
Which general's young master is this?

101
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,270
Why haven't I seen him before?

102
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,870
Such a handsome young man.

103
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,430
My surname is Ma, given name Cheng.

104
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,030
This is Young Master Suo.

105
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,550
My sworn brother and I are here to find lodging.

106
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,910
We heard there are rooms available here.

107
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,750
There's food, and plenty of wine too.

108
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,030
Hey, who told Young Master Ma you could eat and stay here?

109
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,270
This is an entertainment house, not an inn.

110
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,190
It looked like an inn to me.

111
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,590
So I came in.

112
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,110
This is a place for music and dance performances.

113
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,230
There must be a few empty rooms, right?

114
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,510
Then arrange two rooms for my brother and me.

115
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,030
Uh...

116
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,390
Are you worried I can't pay?

117
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,350
No, no, not at all.

118
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,790
Madam Yinzhu, how about...

119
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,870
How about letting the young man in red stay in my room?

120
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,430
I'll sleep with Qiao Jiang.

121
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:39,830
Hey.

122
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,350
The room is small, please forgive me, sir.

123
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,390
It's not bad.

124
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,070
It's just... too fragrant.

125
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,830
It's been ten years since we last met, hasn't it?

126
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,390
Uncle Master, forgive my offense.

127
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,510
Why have you come?

128
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,710
I must avenge my father's death.

129
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,630
Please, Uncle Master, I ask for your help.

130
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,630
Who do you seek revenge against?

131
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,230
Lu Boyan, Situ Yi, and Zhuge Long.

132
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,990
Back then, my father Jie Ling led his troops to Northern Luo, shaking Jingxiang with his might.

133
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,670
But he was ambushed by Jiangdong and his forces were trapped in Sucheng.

134
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,350
Yet Master Zhuge Long refused to send reinforcements.

135
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,870
For some reason, Grand Tutor Situ Yi of Northern Luo

136
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,830
withdrew the border troops from Jiangdong.

137
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,390
This allowed Governor Lu Boyan of Jiangdong to focus without distraction

138
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,870
and gather all Jiangdong's forces at Sucheng to kill my father.

139
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,430
Who told you this?

140
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,430
That's not important.

141
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,110
I just want to know

142
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,270
why the three of them joined forces.

143
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,550
After General Jie passed away, there were no more wars between the states.

144
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,750
The world has been at peace for nearly twenty years.

145
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,270
So my father had to be sacrificed?

146
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,150
I must ask Lu Boyan the truth about this matter.

147
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,790
Mom, the food is ready!

148
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,150
Oh! You startled me.

149
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,510
So noisy! Go, go, go!

150
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,310
Okay.

151
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,750
Gentlemen, please forgive us.

152
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,990
Where were we in our conversation?

153
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,870
Oh, this art house,

154
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,110
I mainly take in orphans and girls who have been trafficked.

155
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,150
I give them food and teach them some singing and dancing.

156
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,230
At least they can support themselves.

157
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,630
Oh, Mama Yinzhu, it's not easy for you.

158
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,950
These children are very pitiful, so

159
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,550
please don't start any more wars that would leave more girls homeless.

160
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,070
General Lu

161
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,950
General, what brings you here?

162
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,030
Miss, sorry to trouble you.

163
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,590
The Imperial Guards are acting on orders.

164
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,550
We're searching the entire city for the assassin who broke into Jianchu Palace this morning.

165
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:55,470
Oh.

166
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,150
Is the proprietor here?

167
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,030
Yes, upstairs.

168
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,110
General.

169
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,070
Let's go.

170
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,790
Did any strangers enter Jinghong Hall today?

171
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,190
I wouldn't dare hide anything from you, General.

172
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,750
Two young gentlemen checked in.

173
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,350
The two of them—where are they from?

174
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,270
Ah, Second Young Master Lu!

175
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,990
Why are you searching for criminals in my place?

176
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,350
These two?

177
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,470
Oh, they're my distant cousins from Wuling.

178
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,430
They came to the capital looking for work.

179
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,710
Looking for work?

180
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:41,590
Yes, that's right.

181
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,950
There are at least four checkpoints between Wuling and Jianye.

182
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,750
Do you have travel permits?

183
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,430
Gentlemen, please show your permits.

184
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,910
Young Master Suo, how should we handle this?

185
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,190
Why are you panicking?

186
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,110
Me? I-I'm not panicking!

187
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,870
They're asking you a question.

188
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,750
Want to fight?

189
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,550
Be careful!

190
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,070
Master Uncle, why does this person know the Six Jia Technique?

191
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,550
Lu Boyan's second son.

192
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,950
Of course, he is the direct heir to the Water Six Jia Technique.

193
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,070
Offense

194
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,590
Who exactly are you?

195
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,110
It's a misunderstanding.

196
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,710
State your identity.

197
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,030
There are only a few people in the world who know the Liujia technique.

198
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,350
How many could there be?

199
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,830
A true wood element user, from Jingxi.

200
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,910
That's right.

201
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,030
This morning, the assassin claimed to be from Jingxi.

202
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,030
He kept saying he wanted to avenge General Jie.

203
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,830
Are you an accomplice?

204
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,910
Sigh, some people are always so short-sighted.

205
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:53,750
What?

206
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,670
The Luobei army is stationed at the Jiangdong border.

207
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,550
If Jiangdong can't hold out,

208
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,470
then Jingxi will be in danger too.

209
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,870
Then you are...

210
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,510
My master is Zhuge Long.

211
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,070
I'm from the Jingxi Prime Minister's residence.

212
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,550
Why have you come here?

213
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,190
To discuss joining forces against Luobei.

214
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,630
General Lu, you truly have impressive skills.

215
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,590
Not at all.

216
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,630
Young Master Suo, you’ve had a long journey.

217
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,190
Let’s have another drink.

218
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,910
Mother.

219
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,630
From a tense standoff to drinking together.

220
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,670
Are all men like this?

221
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,790
Yeah, pretty much.

222
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,430
Enemies and friends—

223
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,750
They switch roles so quickly.

224
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,830
Prime Minister Zhuge has been gone for many years.

225
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:48,630
But the chief secretary and us juniors still uphold his final admonitions.

226
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,590
To actively promote friendly relations between Jingxi and Jiangdong.

227
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,030
Yes, indeed.

228
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,030
Back then, our two nations together defeated Luobei’s 800,000-strong army—a glorious feat.

229
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,430
Truly moving and inspiring.

230
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,070
Indeed, indeed.

231
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,310
That assassin who claimed to be from Jingxi—

232
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,630
Was probably a Luobei spy trying to sow discord between our nations.

233
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,390
Yes, very likely.

234
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,910
Ah, I can’t stay here much longer.

235
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,950
After this drink, I must return to the city to search for the assassin.

236
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,270
Perhaps they were sent by Luobei to confuse us.

237
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,270
May I ask, General, what does the assassin look like?

238
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,670
Red neck, long face—looks like a horse demon.

239
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,110
Calls himself Chilin.

240
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,150
Let’s finish this cup.

241
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,350
Young Master Suo.

242
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,670
How is the joint resistance against Luobei progressing?

243
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,750
I’d like to discuss it with Grand Commander Lu.

244
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,150
My father has been entrusted by His Majesty and now serves as Prime Minister.

245
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,350
Ah, so you are the son of Prime Minister Lu.

246
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,070
That’s right.

247
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,270
My apologies for not recognizing you.

248
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,510
Currently, all military affairs are managed by Grand General Zhu Ke.

249
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,390
As for the allied resistance against Luobei—

250
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,430
Tomorrow, I’ll introduce you to the right people.
