1
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,400
Flourishing and dazzling, hazy and confused.

2
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,800
Mountains and rivers, through lifetimes and generations.

3
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,880
Hey, Huang.

4
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,600
I'm talking about you.

5
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,320
My surname is Zhu.

6
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,960
Aren't you talking back?

7
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,120
Disrupting class discipline—get out.

8
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
Isn't this just bullying?

9
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,560
And this is just the first class.

10
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,840
You, you, you—

11
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,880
Unbelievable, unbelievable!

12
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,520
What's going on?

13
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,360
The imperial envoy has arrived with a decree.

14
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,000
Then, then, go inform Dean Sun!

15
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,440
Dean Sun went to the palace early this morning.

16
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,320
Then, since you are highly respected—

17
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,960
You should go receive the decree.

18
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,960
I'm just an old man in my twilight years.

19
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,520
It should be you, Assistant Dean.

20
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,840
His Majesty's decree.

21
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,680
What is this about?

22
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
Is it to select a general?

23
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,240
Assistant Dean, no need to be so formal.

24
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,040
There's no decree to receive.

25
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,800
I'm just delivering a message, no need for ceremony.

26
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,200
His Majesty is summoning Zhu Die'er and Liang Sanbai to the imperial city.

27
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,720
May I ask, Envoy—

28
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,400
Did these two students offend some noble?

29
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,800
I do not know.

30
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,800
I heard an assassin broke into the imperial city yesterday.

31
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,560
Could it be related?

32
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,520
May I ask, is it because of the assassin incident yesterday—

33
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,840
Are the two involved?

34
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,840
I'm just a messenger.

35
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,360
Assistant Dean, please don't make wild guesses.

36
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,120
Come on, what trouble did you two get into?

37
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,960
Nothing, nothing happened.

38
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,640
Is it related to the assassin who broke into the palace yesterday morning?

39
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,640
Oh, yes, yes, it is related.

40
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,360
We've become entangled in the shocking case of an assassination attempt on His Majesty.

41
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,000
They'll definitely say I failed to educate the students at the academy.

42
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,280
That I didn't manage the academy strictly enough.

43
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,360
Then they'll hold me accountable.

44
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,280
Exile me to the frontier.

45
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,400
No, no—behead me.

46
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,040
And implicate my entire family.

47
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,080
Not a single one spared.

48
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,200
Crush our bones and scatter the ashes.

49
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,040
What are you two whispering about over there? Hurry up and get going.

50
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,000
Let's go.

51
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,920
Yesterday, you demonstrated excellent skills in the Liu Jia technique.

52
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,360
Since the Liu Jia technique is so profound,

53
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,320
why not use it to study formations in depth?

54
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,440
Show its power on the battlefield.

55
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,120
Serve Jiangdong.

56
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,680
I am willing to serve Jiangdong.

57
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,680
Good, good.

58
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,320
Alright, let's drink to that.

59
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,600
With pleasure.

60
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,400
Here.

61
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,280
The academy produces many talented people.

62
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,880
Select and reserve fifty young officers from among them.

63
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,760
Understood.

64
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,200
I grant you both the rank of captain.

65
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,400
Work together to capture the assassin Ma Yao.

66
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,680
And participate in maintaining the capital's security.

67
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,040
Now that Luobei has stationed troops at the border, if war breaks out,

68
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
you may lead your unit to campaign with General Zhu Ke.

69
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
Achieve merit and establish your career.

70
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,480
Why can't we go to war with Dean Sun?

71
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,760
Hey, hey, you really don't understand, do you?

72
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,400
The battlefield is so dangerous.

73
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,960
Maintaining security in the capital is a cushy job.

74
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,160
You've trained your students well.

75
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,720
Even His Majesty is wary of me.

76
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,600
In your heart, do you really think so little of women?

77
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,920
You say this in front of everyone?

78
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,680
Breaking one's word.

79
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,240
Didn't I already grant you official titles?

80
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,920
There are many people here today, all eyes are watching.

81
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,040
We can't just force you, let's find a way out.

82
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,680
This way out must be someone who makes you uneasy.

83
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,640
Zhu Ke.

84
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,240
Die'er and I will help you resolve it.

85
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,680
Otherwise, you'll break your promise to your savior today, and to everyone else.

86
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,120
Ridiculous, discussing it is pointless.

87
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,320
How can a woman command troops? There's never been such a precedent.

88
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Your Majesty, King Wu Ding of Shang's wife, Fu Hao,

89
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,280
once led thirteen thousand soldiers to attack the Qiang.

90
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,560
She captured a hundred thousand Qiang people and filled Guanzhong, her achievements were outstanding.

91
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,480
So that's how it was.

92
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,520
If there's a precedent, then it's worth trying.

93
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,600
Let's test the abilities of you three first.

94
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,000
Your Majesty, the assassin entered Jianchu Palace the other day.

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,480
There must be an insider of high status working with them.

96
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,040
Yes, I also remember what the assassin looked like.

97
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,920
We will apprehend them as soon as possible.

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,840
Besides the assassin,

99
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,040
we must also expose the insider.

100
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,600
Present the culprit within seven days.

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,880
Otherwise, we won't have the face to ask for rewards again.

102
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,760
It's a deal.

103
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,280
If we succeed,

104
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,320
I accept the command, lead the border troops, and will never break my word.

105
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,720
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your reward.

106
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,840
The horse demon and Zhu Ke don't seem to be connected.

107
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,200
Both matters need to be resolved.

108
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,560
We can do it.

109
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,240
Zhu, wait a moment!

110
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,520
Oh, I'm exhausted.

111
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,000
Zhu Die'er, receive the imperial decree.

112
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,800
There is one more thing.

113
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,200
His Majesty says,

114
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,760
In ancient times, wise kings cultivated themselves to set a moral example and highlight the virtuous.

115
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,840
Now Zhu Die'er has found her calling and is worthy of great responsibility.

116
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,800
She is granted the imperial student token, and I will personally instruct her.

117
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,200
Oh, "instruct her"? What does that mean?

118
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,360
His Majesty is taking you as his student.

119
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,640
Huh? Both father and daughter are now my teachers?

120
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,280
Yes, you're not just the princess's student.

121
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,720
You're also His Majesty's student.

122
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,120
Achieving success isn't just your own ability.

123
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,400
It's also an opportunity given by His Majesty.

124
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,560
Don't forget His Majesty's kindness in the future.

125
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,760
This old... His Majesty really planted a watchdog above me.

126
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,080
The imperial student token is transferable.

127
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,960
Only the most talented heirs of the major clans can receive it for a short time.

128
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,280
What can this do? It's just a hard stick.

129
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,440
It's actually very powerful.

130
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,200
With this token, you can wear a sword and shoes in the palace, and don't have to kneel or announce your name.

131
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,560
That doesn't sound very fun.

132
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,640
It's like how the prime minister commands all officials.

133
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,440
With the imperial student token, you can advise all officials.

134
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,720
You can also instruct all the scholars and teachers in Jiangdong.

135
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,120
Instruct?

136
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,960
Instruct on behalf of His Majesty.

137
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,040
Personally guide and admonish.

138
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,720
That's one way to put it.

139
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,960
Like how a teacher can use a ruler to discipline me.

140
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,280
Right, so this token

141
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,520
is shaped like a ruler.

142
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,600
Those who refuse to admit their mistakes are as guilty as traitors.

143
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,880
What's wrong with you?

144
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,880
Imperially bestowed, a scholar of the emperor, here to set things right.

145
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,040
Oh my, the imperial criminal has been released!

146
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
He wasn't beheaded.

147
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,040
Is that head of his sewn back on?

148
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,880
Master Zhu, you mustn't.

149
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,000
What? A dignified teacher like you,

150
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,240
isn't it only right to discipline a student?

151
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,400
Liang Sanbai, even you have been led astray by this country boy.

152
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,640
No, no, I'm just thinking of you two teachers.

153
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,440
Thinking of us?

154
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,680
As if we would be afraid of him.

155
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,040
Imperially bestowed, a scholar of the emperor, here to set things right.

156
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Ah, the imperial scholar's certificate.

157
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,320
Ah!

158
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,680
Huang—no, I mean, classmate Zhu, how do you have this?

159
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,640
Is it right to keep calling students by the wrong name on purpose?

160
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,840
No, it's not right, not right.

161
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,000
A country boy can't study at the academy?

162
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,280
Or go to the battlefield and earn merit?

163
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,680
He can, he can, he can.

164
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,680
Is it right to just recite the textbook mindlessly in class?

165
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,640
I was wrong, I was wrong.

166
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,080
When students ask questions, you scold them.

167
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,160
You have no insight at all.

168
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,600
You make us look things up ourselves.

169
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,040
So what do we need teachers for?

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,160
During holidays, you extort things from our parents.

171
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,760
You ask for cured meat, rice, flour, and silk.

172
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,040
I was wrong.

173
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,480
I was greedy, please stop hitting me, stop!

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,360
Alright, alright.

175
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,200
You few have made a mess of the academy.

176
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,440
The promising youth of Jiangdong are being ruined by you.

177
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,400
Go back and prepare your lessons properly.

178
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,320
Teach seriously tomorrow.

179
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,560
Got it, got it.

180
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,760
Stop fooling us with flashy nonsense.

181
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,560
Alright, I promise to get it done.

182
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,360
Then let's pay attention in class today.

183
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,640
Alright!

184
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,680
Watch out!

185
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,840
Who shot that arrow in secret?

186
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,760
My young master—ah!

187
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,520
Scared now, aren't you? Ah!

188
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,120
I don't care who you are—shooting arrows recklessly in the classroom in broad daylight!

189
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,600
What an interesting kid.

190
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,320
You don't know the Ma family of Jiangdong's gentry?

191
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,480
Then today I'll teach you a lesson.

192
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,000
You

193
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,440
Useless. Get lost.

194
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,400
The academy has an archery range. Young Master Ma is an excellent archer, famous throughout the land.

195
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,480
But it's not appropriate to do something so dangerous in the classroom.

196
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,160
You're just my study companion, here to take exams for me.

197
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,440
Know your place. You don't need to worry about anything else for me.

198
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,840
But this concerns the lives of our classmates.

199
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,280
I'm not talking to you.

200
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
This new classmate,

201
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
You actually don't recognize me?

202
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,800
You seemed pretty domineering just now.

203
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,080
You had all the teachers under your thumb.

204
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,840
I'm just Young Master Ma's study companion.

205
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,560
So you're the Young Master Ma they were talking about.

206
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,960
This new classmate smells so nice.

207
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,200
Don't make me deal with you.

208
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,840
Go ahead, deal with me then.

209
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,000
If you handle me well, there’s a reward.

210
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,640
Liang, how can there be someone like this?

211
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,360
So now that you have the imperial student recommendation, you dare talk back to me?

212
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,280
In Jiangdong, even the emperor has to consider the major families before issuing an order.

213
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,880
Either become my retainer and keep me company,

214
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,400
or I'll have both you and your study companion expelled.

215
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,080
That's so mean.

216
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,160
If I have fun,

217
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,400
I'll pretend this never happened.

218
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,960
I'm willing to go along. How do you want to play?

219
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,520
Just now, you two questioned why I wouldn't go to the archery range.

220
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:44,040
Fine. In the past two years, this is the first time anyone has doubted my archery skills.

221
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,680
Alright, alright.

222
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
Then let's go to the archery range and compete.

223
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,160
Where do you get your confidence?

224
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,360
It's just archery.

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,560
You set the rules.

226
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,160
Alright, but don't regret it.
