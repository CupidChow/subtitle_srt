1
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,050
In a few days, it will be the Prime Minister's sixty-third birthday.

2
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,610
And the Emperor has just entrusted the Prime Minister with a high position.

3
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,170
We can't be careless with such a double celebration.

4
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,330
If you all keep working this slowly,

5
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,050
how can we finish the preparations in just two days?

6
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,730
Manager Nan,

7
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,170
it's not that we're slow.

8
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,770
The standards are just too high.

9
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,570
The purchase volume is huge, and deliveries have been delayed by three days.

10
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,650
Lu You, don't give me excuses.

11
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,690
Since we agreed on the deadline, it must be met.

12
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,170
If problems come up, you have to find a way to solve them yourself.

13
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,690
You know the Emperor's most frequent instruction to our master is

14
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,330
"Act at your own discretion, Commander."

15
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,290
That's because our master always completes strategic goals smoothly.

16
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,090
Otherwise, how could he have become the Grand Commander of the army?

17
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,010
Or the Supreme General?

18
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,210
And now, how could he be appointed as Prime Minister?

19
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,530
I never wanted to be the Grand Commander.

20
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,490
A rotten log can't be carved.

21
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,970
I'm not a rotten log.

22
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,890
I'm yew wood.

23
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,930
Stop nagging.

24
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,370
Appointed as Prime Minister, celebrating a birthday—

25
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,450
such an important double celebration.

26
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,490
Pay more attention.

27
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,090
Just don't be clumsy.

28
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,170
A-You,

29
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,330
the birthday person's portrait goes right in the center.

30
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,650
Don't let anything go wrong.

31
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,050
Okay.

32
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,970
Good morning, Uncle Nan.

33
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,770
Second Young Master looks so dashing, even I can barely contain myself.

34
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,370
Let alone all the young ladies and maids wandering around Jianye Street.

35
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,970
Uncle Nan, you're teasing me.

36
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,690
The youngest commander of the Jinwu Guards since the founding of Jiangdong.

37
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,250
I wouldn't dare.

38
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,690
The rebel traitors in the north of Luo haven't been eliminated yet.

39
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,330
Lately, they've even stationed troops at the border.

40
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,410
The imperial city guard is rotating shifts.

41
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,170
I'll take my leave first.

42
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,490
Well done.

43
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,010
Second Young Master.

44
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,170
Go ahead.

45
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,250
Second Young Master is so outstanding.

46
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,450
And the master has been honored with the position of Prime Minister.

47
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,290
The Lu household is truly fortunate.

48
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,730
I started serving the master at thirteen.

49
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,530
Now it's been exactly fifty years.

50
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,610
Without realizing it, we're both already sixty-three.

51
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,090
The Jinwu Guards are taking over the imperial city security.

52
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,930
It's an honor for all the Jinwu Guards.

53
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,410
Let's move out.

54
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,330
Make way, make way!

55
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:02,970
Move aside!

56
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,210
Are you deaf?

57
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:18,730
Please forgive me, madam.

58
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,330
I bumped into your cart.

59
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,650
Here's compensation.

60
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,170
Please be sure to accept it.

61
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,930
The old deaf woman doesn't know how to yield.

62
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,250
General, there's no need for that.

63
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,610
The city streets are meant for walking.

64
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,850
The frontier battlefield is where you ride horses.

65
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,370
Yes.

66
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,130
What are you thinking about?

67
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,610
Judging by your bearing, you must be quite a high-ranking general.

68
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,130
We performers

69
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,210
shouldn't make things harder for ourselves.

70
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,970
What's wrong with being a performer?

71
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,970
Performers have the right to fall in love too.

72
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,970
Yes, yes, yes, we have the right.

73
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,050
Let's hurry to the Prime Minister's residence to deliver the performance program.

74
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,130
We might even have time to buy some incense.

75
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,530
It's rare for us to come out, and look how you're dawdling.

76
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,010
Both of your uncles were once renowned generals.

77
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,050
I want to be like my aunts too.

78
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,410
To find a hero.

79
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,170
Stop talking about heroes.

80
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,770
Blame your gambling father.

81
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,250
He sold you to the performing troupe. Come on, let's go.

82
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,330
Oh, Zhu.

83
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,010
You're here so early.

84
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,210
Good morning, Mr. Sun.

85
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,610
Your caltrop formation is well done.

86
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,770
How many times do you practice each day, and for how long each time?

87
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,450
Sir, to answer your question,

88
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,130
I practice half an hour each at dawn and dusk.

89
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,450
Wow, then your foundation must be very solid.

90
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,970
No wonder I lost to you.

91
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,850
I also practice horseback archery for another half hour every day.

92
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,730
You're definitely material for a vanguard.

93
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,570
I'll recommend you to the Grand Marshal soon.

94
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,130
My master said

95
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,290
I should focus on my studies first,

96
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,370
learn how to be a good person,

97
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,610
and then join the army to serve the country.

98
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:05,890
Master?

99
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,570
Isn't your father the one who taught you martial arts?

100
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,170
I mentioned it to you and the headmaster last night.

101
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,890
Ah.

102
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,690
That old Mr. Lu actually knows the Six Jia Technique.

103
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,210
Really? The one you mentioned yesterday?

104
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,170
I think he's the chief steward of some big merchant family.

105
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,090
Chief steward?

106
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,770
Father is getting old.

107
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,010
He can't see more and more talented people being lost.

108
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,370
The fish is salty.

109
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,890
Then just use less salt.

110
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,210
You're the only one who likes it.

111
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,410
Breakfast is here.

112
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:37,970
Salted fish with porridge.

113
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,130
Oh, we just mentioned salted fish.

114
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,170
And now we have salted fish with porridge. How nice.

115
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,010
Oh, Liang made it?

116
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,690
I didn't get the teacher's permission.

117
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,050
I cooked by myself, sorry for the impropriety.

118
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,050
I'm starving.

119
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,530
No need to apologize.

120
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,650
You boys just lack a bit of masculinity.

121
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:56,450
Look at Die'er.

122
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,290
Ah, it smells so good.

123
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,450
So much smoke.

124
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,850
Do wealthy families really make breakfast over a fire?

125
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,330
Yes, it's Jianchu Palace.

126
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,410
Something happened at the palace.

127
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,370
Oh, then...

128
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,330
Let's go help put out the fire.

129
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:10,690
Let's go.

130
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,690
Wait, bring my great sword.

131
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,570
What happened?

132
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,210
There are assassins.

133
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,850
Ordinary folks, step aside.

134
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:29,890
Are you rebelling?

135
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,210
This is Princess Yuanhe.

136
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,610
Orders from above.

137
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,370
No one is allowed in.

138
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:37,890
We're here to protect His Majesty.

139
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,610
Even so, you can't go in.

140
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,570
Open your eyes and look carefully.

141
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,970
What is that? Never seen it.

142
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,290
You may not have seen it, but you should have heard of it.

143
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,330
The Ancient Ding Sword.

144
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,330
Seeing this sword is as if Prince Huan of Changsha is here in person.

145
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,250
All must kneel and obey.

146
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,250
It's that effective?

147
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,610
Judging by your attire, you're not palace guards.

148
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,370
Where are you from?

149
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,170
Reporting.

150
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,410
Princess Yuanhe.

151
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,610
Reporting to Princess Yuanhe.

152
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,330
I am Zhu Fei, a captain under General Zhu.

153
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,890
One of Zhu Ke's men.

154
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:15,650
Yes, yes, that's right.

155
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,210
Why are you stopping us from entering?

156
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,570
They say it's to guard against more assassins.

157
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,650
What kind of twisted logic is that?

158
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,850
I think you're actually guarding against reinforcements.

159
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:23,530
Father

160
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,570
General Lu

161
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,930
Where did this monster come from?

162
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,250
Mr. Sun, the horse demon calls itself Chilin.

163
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,650
It wants to avenge the beheading of Jieling.

164
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,370
Jieling, twenty years ago—

165
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,650
People from the Sun and Lu families—

166
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,290
That makes sense, then.

167
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,890
Benefactor, step aside.

168
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,330
You said you would repay me.

169
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,330
A gentleman keeps his word.

170
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,970
The Sun family will not kill.

171
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,930
But there is another enemy who must die.

172
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,410
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

173
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,530
Seize this monster!

174
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,090
Our debts are settled. Farewell, benefactor.

175
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,170
Monster, surrender now.

176
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,250
The assassin who tried to kill His Majesty—after him!

177
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,450
I just heard it.

178
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,770
The demon called you its benefactor.

179
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,170
Tell the truth.

180
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,010
Zhu Ke.

181
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,050
Princess Yuanhe, what are your orders?

182
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,090
I order you to put down your sword.

183
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,810
It was Zhu Die'er who saved the Emperor.

184
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,530
How do you explain this?

185
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,490
General Zhu, put down your sword.

186
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,090
Your Majesty, I arrived too late to protect you.

187
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,530
I am incompetent.

188
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,890
I put Your Majesty in danger.

189
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,650
The assassin has retreated.

190
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,770
Both generals have fulfilled their duties.

191
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,210
On General Lu's first day on duty, such a serious incident occurred.

192
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,690
The Yulin Guards withdrew early.

193
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,890
There was a gap during the Jinwu Guards' shift change.

194
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,290
Please punish us, Your Majesty.

195
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,570
You're putting the blame on me?

196
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,410
It was clearly your people who were slow—

197
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,690
Just now, his men blocked us.

198
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,850
They said no one could enter.

199
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,650
Not even to save the Emperor.

200
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,970
The captain was just doing his duty.

201
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,010
Who knew if the newcomers were accomplices?

202
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,170
They only blocked Princess Yuanhe.

203
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,570
That deserves punishment.

204
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,250
Then why didn't your people come to help?

205
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,370
Didn't I come just now?

206
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:29,730
You—

207
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,250
Enough.

208
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,610
The Grand General set up defenses outside the palace gates.

209
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,210
That was also a thorough precaution.

210
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,530
There's no need to argue.

211
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,410
Your Majesty, please judge fairly.

212
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:39,770
Are you alright?

213
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,450
Brothers—

214
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,610
It's also their first day on duty, but—

215
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,850
May I trouble the General to send someone to help.

216
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,970
As you command, Princess Yuanhe.

217
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,850
I take my leave.

218
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,810
This commoner takes his leave.

219
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,970
It's been a long time since I returned to Jianchu Palace.

220
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,890
Join me for lunch.

221
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,650
I've prepared salted fish porridge at the academy.

222
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,890
Saving a life is as great a kindness as giving someone a new life.

223
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,930
Why are you still trying to drive them away? What are your intentions?

224
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,890
It's the duty of the Jinwu Guards.

225
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,410
Then these two young men should be rewarded.

226
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,130
Tell me, what are your wishes?

227
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,930
Anything at all?

228
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,410
Yes.

229
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,770
I want to sit in the six-horse jade carriage.

230
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,610
Father, um, I'm just a country boy with little experience.

231
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,170
Go, go, go! Hurry up!

232
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,170
What's wrong? What's going on?

233
00:14:59,050 --> 00:14:59,730
That's overstepping your bounds!

234
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,890
That's a crime punishable by execution and extermination of your whole clan!

235
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,610
Go, go, go!

236
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,530
Don't go!

237
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,090
This young man spoke without meaning any harm.

238
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,450
After all, he saved me. It's fine, it's fine.

239
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,690
Then, let's change the topic.

240
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,210
Women should hold up half the sky.

241
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,210
His Majesty has built the foundation of Jiangdong for decades.

242
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,330
He has governed diligently and appointed people based on their abilities.

243
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,570
No talent has been left undiscovered in the land.

244
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,090
But the northern Luo and western Jing still frequently harass and provoke us.

245
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,250
His Majesty surely hopes to recruit more virtuous and talented people.

246
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,170
Anzhou Commandery secures the borders.

247
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,090
He is eager to find talent.

248
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,010
Someone as wise and brave as Master Sun,

249
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,450
broad-minded, whether governing the state in court

250
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,850
or securing the nation on the battlefield, is a pillar of the country.

251
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,810
Therefore, women can also hold up half the sky.

252
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,290
If His Majesty grants Director Sun the seal to recruit and command troops,

253
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,650
many capable generals will surely emerge.

254
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,890
Recommend and recruit talents.

255
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,570
Upright people will fill the government offices and commanderies.

256
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,170
His Majesty's decrees will spread far and wide.

257
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,770
And he will be able to command as easily as moving his own arm.

258
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:19,810
Mm-hmm.

259
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,130
You little brat.

260
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,570
I have always hoped you would marry and raise children.

261
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,530
To live in peace and happiness.

262
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,690
That is the true purpose behind men fighting on the battlefield.

263
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,850
Hmph, I don't need anyone's protection.

264
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,290
You all are injured.

265
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,970
You should return home early to rest and recover.

266
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,170
Think carefully about what rewards you want.

267
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,890
We will discuss it again tomorrow.

268
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,570
We take our leave, Your Majesty.

269
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,650
Don't go yet, I have something to discuss with you.

270
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,330
That General Zhu,

271
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,650
just looks like a bad person.

272
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,930
Grand General Zhu Ke is in charge of defending North Luo.

273
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,530
He hasn't made a mistake in years—he's a key minister of the state.

274
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,090
Now, the new Junior Tutor of North Luo, He Yan, is eyeing Jiangdong covetously.

275
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,410
Your Majesty also needs to rely on General Zhu.

276
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:25,410
So even Your Majesty has people you need to be wary of.

277
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,690
Oh, I forgot to ask—General, you are...?

278
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,410
Lu Hang, the new commander of the Jinwu Guard.

279
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,570
Oh, such a high-ranking general!

280
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,570
My apologies, my apologies.

281
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,490
You really look like someone I know.

282
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,770
Maybe it's just fate.

283
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,850
Which families are you two from?

284
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,770
Liang Sanbai, Zhu Die'er.

285
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,730
We're both students of the Four Families Academy.

286
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,570
So we're schoolmates!

287
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:51,530
That's great!

288
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,490
Ah, senior!

289
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,250
As expected, all students from our Four Families Academy are outstanding.

290
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,170
Just now, Zhu junior's argument on virtue really impressed me.

291
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,530
You're too kind.

292
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,050
Jiangdong really needs talented young people like you two.

293
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,650
Let's achieve great things together in the future.

294
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,930
Please guide us, senior.

295
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,410
Take me to the battlefield with you!

296
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,850
Alright, let's serve our country together.

297
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,930
You're amazing, senior!

298
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,810
Your legs aren't well.

299
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,050
Let me carry you.

300
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,330
I can walk by myself.

301
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,330
Put me down!

302
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:21,730
No need to be polite.

303
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,330
What? A political marriage?
