1
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,560
Isn't that Young Master Ma?

2
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,560
Hey, Young Master Ma.

3
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,480
Young Master Ma, the night dew is heavy. Don't catch a chill.

4
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,880
Ah, Ji Sa.

5
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,880
What's wrong, Young Master Ma?

6
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,680
I've never seen that look on your face.

7
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,840
It's nothing.

8
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,680
You must have something on your mind.

9
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,800
Let me share your worries.

10
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,960
It's not worry, it's joy.

11
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,840
Joy?

12
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,080
I feel like I've become a different person.

13
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Hmm, I feel that too.

14
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,040
Young Master Ma.

15
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,280
I thought the chess game was in my hands, but as it went on,

16
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,520
I ended up at a disadvantage.

17
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,080
Yet I willingly admit defeat.

18
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,360
Isn't it obvious? The Prime Minister has fallen.

19
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,400
The Zhu family is now the top clan in Jiangdong.

20
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,960
If you don't hurry and send gifts now,

21
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,200
you won't get another chance.

22
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,320
Hurry up.

23
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,840
What are you looking around for?

24
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,120
Oh.

25
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,320
Grand Marshal, I'll take my leave.

26
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,000
Mm.

27
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,080
In the corridor.

28
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,400
Who's there in the corridor?

29
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,520
Your servant.

30
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,440
Your servant Qiao Jiang.

31
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,040
I work under Madam Yinzhu at Jinghong Pavilion.

32
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,120
Oh.

33
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,920
A girl from Jinghong Pavilion.

34
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,680
What brings you to me?

35
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,320
Madam Yinzhu says the Grand Marshal is the most powerful man in the city.

36
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,440
She sent me to deliver some handmade pastries.

37
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,680
Hoping for your favor.

38
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,800
If there's a banquet at your residence,

39
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,880
or a feast,

40
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,480
please consider inviting Jinghong Pavilion.

41
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,160
Of course.

42
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,520
With your breathtaking beauty, who wouldn't come to see your performance?

43
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,280
I wouldn't dare claim that.

44
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,760
There are sisters in the pavilion even more beautiful than me.

45
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,960
Oh?

46
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,520
Lately,

47
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,720
everything has gone smoothly.

48
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,800
That's something worth celebrating.

49
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,200
Then please ask Madam Yinzhu to arrange a performance at my residence tomorrow.

50
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:14,960
Alright.

51
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,240
By the way,

52
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,640
bring all your sisters to perform together.

53
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,400
Oh!

54
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,520
You're finally awake.

55
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,280
A lightweight like you actually downed three jugs.

56
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,320
Were you happy,

57
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,880
or just reckless?

58
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,200
I...

59
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,160
Did I sleep all night?

60
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,760
All night?

61
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,320
You slept for four days and three nights.

62
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,320
That long?

63
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,520
Is Lu Boyan dead yet?

64
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,840
Execution is set for five days after the verdict.

65
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,240
There's still one day left.

66
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,040
Let's go watch the spectacle tomorrow night.

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,240
There's still someone left out.

68
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,360
Where to?

69
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,120
That Zhu Die'er.

70
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,960
She has many connections. She won't just sit and wait for doom.

71
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,200
I need to deal with her first.

72
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,920
The girls from Jinghong Pavilion have arrived right on time.

73
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,600
Oh.

74
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,200
Then let's begin.

75
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,680
Should I invite Young Master Suo and the others to watch the dance?

76
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,600
Why invite them?

77
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,640
Well,

78
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,880
you and Young Master Suo are working together—

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,600
Shut up.

80
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,040
Ah!

81
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,800
Working together?

82
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,440
Do I, Zhu Ke, need anyone's help to get rid of those annoying people?

83
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,560
Those two Jingxi savages,

84
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,280
impoverished nobles,

85
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,200
dare to sit as my equals and watch the dance?

86
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,280
They're not worthy, not at all.

87
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,840
Forgive me, sir.

88
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,080
Qiao Jiang is late.

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,160
Here they are.

90
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,000
These must be the two peerless beauties Qiao Jiang mentioned.

91
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,160
Yes.

92
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,080
Sisters,

93
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,280
this is the most powerful man in Jiangdong.

94
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,840
Grand Marshal Zhu.

95
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,000
Sisters, introduce yourselves.

96
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,320
Your servant.

97
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,840
Xiao Lin.

98
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,600
Indeed.

99
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,760
A true beauty.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,600
This humble servant

101
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,560
is called Xiao Die

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,320
peerless beauty

103
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,760
breathtaking charm

104
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,280
Thank you, General, for your praise

105
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,800
Jinghong Pavilion will soon be under your protection

106
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,080
Perform well

107
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,720
I, Zhu Ke, will surely cherish these graceful beauties

108
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,600
Thank you, Sir

109
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,960
Then

110
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,240
let's begin

111
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,240
Such a heavy murderous aura

112
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,080
Your servant

113
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,240
dances with trepidation

114
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,680
Sir

115
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,600
I'm afraid

116
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,880
these elegant ladies might overwhelm us

117
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,120
Ha

118
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,040
Look

119
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,080
The beauties are laughing at you

120
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,000
Trust the young ones

121
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:29,920
That's right

122
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,840
It's just

123
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,520
to attract the Ma demon

124
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,560
this move is quite risky

125
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,560
It doesn't just attract the Ma demon

126
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,760
it also draws Zhu Ke's followers here

127
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,520
Even with the four Zhu brothers guarding

128
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,960
the enemy still hides in the shadows

129
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,040
and the Imperial Guards are lying in ambush

130
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,480
There's nothing to fear

131
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,840
At my age, it's an honor to serve Jiangdong

132
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,880
It's a blessing

133
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,640
Let's proceed as planned

134
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,400
Grand Commander Lu, please come this way

135
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,400
Grand Commander Lu

136
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,920
Lu Boyan

137
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,200
Let me join the dance too.

138
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,360
Several fairies have descended from the heavens.

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,320
How can I possibly resist such temptation?

140
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,080
The general's power is immense.

141
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,400
Why bother resisting?

142
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,120
How is it immense?

143
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,600
His Majesty is above us all.

144
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,600
His Majesty has yet to achieve military merit.

145
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,000
He is far behind the general.

146
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,880
You ladies are wiser than many men.

147
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
Forced to live under another's roof.

148
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,120
This humble servant feels it's unfair for the general.

149
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,600
You ladies are not only beautiful and talented,

150
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,320
but also truly understand my heart.

151
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,960
I regret meeting you so late.

152
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,520
Might as well join He Yan of Luobei.

153
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,400
And divide the realm anew.

154
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,960
Who are you?

155
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,600
Zhu Ke and He Yan have been exchanging letters.

156
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,800
Secretly colluding, but there's no solid evidence.

157
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,720
Lord He said the letters have been at his residence for a long time.

158
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
He Yan's people.

159
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,400
Why has the lord not acted for so long?

160
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,960
We must wait for the right moment.

161
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,880
So it's true after all.

162
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,400
The lord hasn't just left them unopened somewhere, has he?

163
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,760
Of course not.

164
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,000
He read the letters and stored them in his study.

165
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,400
Lord He gifted the two of us to General Zhu.

166
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,680
To show his sincerity.

167
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,080
Please make plans as soon as possible.

168
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,520
Ah.

169
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,720
So that's how it is.

170
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,120
He Yan knows my preferences well.

171
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,960
So thoughtful.

172
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,680
I'm tired.

173
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
I wish to rest in your study.

174
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,680
Alright.

175
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,720
Then,

176
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,360
let's rest for a while first.

177
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,280
Catch the assassin! Catch the assassin!

178
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,360
Could it be Uncle Chilin?

179
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,560
Go check quickly!

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,640
Stop!

181
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,440
Who goes there?

182
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,440
State your name!

183
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,080
This is bad.

184
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,080
Imperial Guards.

185
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,520
I am Captain Ma of the Prime Minister's residence.

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,280
Who is the assassin in the middle of the night?

187
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,760
Please show your residence badge.

188
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,960
Heh, are you kidding me?

189
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,880
I went out late and forgot to bring it.

190
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,360
Don't go! Stay right there!

191
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,720
Where is the assassin? If you don't tell, I'll finish you.

192
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,800
Surrounded by the Imperial Guards at the East Market.

193
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,800
Something's happening! Who's there? Show yourself!

194
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,360
Do you really want to be discovered?

195
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,720
It's not like I did it on purpose.

196
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,920
Hurry, come out!

197
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,400
This is bad. The Imperial Guards are palace defenders, not ordinary officers, and there are many of them.

198
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,360
Aren't you clever? Think of a way to make them retreat.

199
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,360
Let's go, quickly!

200
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,000
What's there to fear? They're just a bunch of weaklings.

201
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
You think the two of us can't handle them?

202
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,560
We can't get stuck in a fight.

203
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,040
If we have Uncle Chilin's whereabouts, hurry to the East Market!

204
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,080
Ah, forgive me, General.

205
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,440
He Yan instructed that the handwriting must be verified.

206
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,200
Fairy, please take a look.

207
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,880
After reading, you must attend to me tonight.

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,200
Does Xiao Lin want to join in serving tonight too?

209
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,760
I've heard Jiangdong can resist Luobei to survive.

210
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,080
All thanks to Grand Marshal Zhu's talents.

211
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,840
Heroes always admire other heroes.

212
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,320
Yan acts only for the general's sake.

213
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,280
Unifying the divided realm, the time is now.

214
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,880
I wish to lead a million troops to conquer Jingxi and Jiangdong.

215
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,280
That's why I've delayed.

216
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,640
Because General Zhu's wisdom is enough.

217
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,640
Troops are stationed at Luling, looking south to Jiangdong, ready to strike.

218
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,600
I sincerely invite the general to join me in this great endeavor.

219
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,120
To destroy the unworthy Sun clan.

220
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
The six counties of Jiangdong will belong to General Zhu.

221
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,000
That is my wish as well.

222
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,360
If the general is unwilling, I will march alone.

223
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,600
Give it to me! Give it to me!

224
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
So General Zhu really is colluding with the enemy.

225
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,040
Enemy? What are you talking about?

226
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,000
Men are full of weaknesses.

227
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,280
What?

228
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,360
Why should women always be used by men?

229
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,480
Aren't you He Yan's people?

230
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,000
Grand Marshal, guess who we are.

231
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,600
You think I'm afraid of two brats?

232
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,160
Then let me show you what we can do.

233
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,280
Ah! Who are you really?

234
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,240
Hurry and pay your respects to Princess Yuanhe!

235
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,760
You tricked me! Guards!

236
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,320
Go out and block them!

237
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Take a good look.

238
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,040
You dare lay hands on a royal?

239
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
I’m cutting down a member of the Sun family.

240
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Switch!

241
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
Princess Yuanhe is here.

242
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,760
Anyone who wants to rebel, step forward!

243
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
You traitors!

244
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,040
I’ll wipe out your entire clan!

245
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,200
Chase them! Don’t let them escape, you useless fools!

246
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,680
This is bad. More and more people are coming.

247
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,640
Just fight it out!

248
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,120
No way.
