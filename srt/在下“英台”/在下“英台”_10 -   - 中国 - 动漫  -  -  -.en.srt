1
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,160
Who goes there?

2
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,600
I've waited here in hardship for over a year.

3
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,440
At last, you’re here, Lu Boyan.

4
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,600
Gong Yuan, that's enough.

5
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,240
Master once said,

6
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,000
the true form of a qilin cannot be pierced by arrows.

7
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,840
Chi Lin.

8
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,280
The Hundred Illusion Butterfly Clan and the Fire Qilin Clan of the South Sea have been neighbors for a thousand years.

9
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,600
For the sake of our clans’ long-standing harmony,

10
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,640
let’s end this today.

11
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,160
But they killed my master.

12
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,920
Decades of chaos.

13
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Millions have died.

14
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,440
Must all grudges be repaid?

15
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,680
And kill millions more?

16
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,080
I don’t care about others.

17
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,200
General Jie’s kindness to me is as great as a mountain.

18
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,280
As long as I live, I will avenge him.

19
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,080
Benefactor, be careful!

20
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Butterfly... Are you a butterfly demon?

21
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,560
Why do you oppose me?

22
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,880
By order of Master Huang,

23
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
I am to protect Grand Commander Lu.

24
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,040
Don’t think you can cause trouble here.

25
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,440
Enough talk.

26
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,640
I won’t trouble you today.

27
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,720
Stay out of my business.

28
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,080
Today, I only want the heads of Lu Boyan and Ma Wenzhong.

29
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,400
Ling Feng, let me go.

30
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,040
You still need to look after Die’er.

31
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,880
Dunjia Four Symbols Formation.

32
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,320
Sixth and Fourteenth, block the retreat.

33
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,280
Twenty-first, help me drive him to the center of the formation—only then can we harm this creature.

34
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Why is this demon so skilled in Six Jia Arts? Where did it learn such techniques?

35
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,240
The Ma demon hunted the Grand Commander for years without success.

36
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,720
Why did its power surge after the Battle of Yiling?

37
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,520
It even mastered the Six Jia Stone Man Formation.

38
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,280
Prime Minister Lu should know.

39
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,800
But he remains tight-lipped.

40
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,320
After the great victory at Yiling,

41
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,600
we could have marched straight to the undefended capital of Jingxi.

42
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,760
But instead, we immediately withdrew to Jiangdong.

43
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,720
There were no more battles after that.

44
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,320
Then... what about my mother?

45
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,960
Weren’t you the ones fighting?

46
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,280
Your mother...

47
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,200
When Grand Commander Lu was in danger,

48
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,920
You know the power of the South Sea Giant Illusion Butterfly.

49
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,040
Don’t force me to fight to the death.

50
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,400
Interesting girl.

51
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,400
Then let’s fight to the death.

52
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,080
Master’s orders cannot be disobeyed.

53
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
But this Ma demon has inherited Zhuge Long’s true teachings.

54
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,480
It’s too difficult to handle.

55
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,560
I’ll lure it into the Butterfly Clan’s illusion formation at Niushou Mountain.

56
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,080
That’s a fight to the death.

57
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,000
There’s no other way.

58
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,440
Gong Yuan, take good care of Die’er.

59
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,640
May we be husband and wife in the next life.

60
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,880
Both are of the divine race.

61
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,040
They fought until dawn.

62
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,200
Grand Commander Lu quickly led his troops back to Jianye in Jiangdong over several days.

63
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,360
Outside Jianye, the Ma demon intercepted them again.

64
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,960
Ling Feng was exhausted.

65
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,600
But the Ma demon grew stronger with each battle.

66
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,960
Seeing defeat was near,

67
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,200
Mother used all her mystical power to summon the South Sea Divine Mountain and suppress the monster.

68
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,440
Hmm.

69
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,280
So I’m here with my uncles to guard this place.

70
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,520
In case the demon breaks free.

71
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,400
And hoping for a miracle in twenty years.

72
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,040
Your mother may still be alive.

73
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,280
The monster isn’t dead—its essence isn’t fully refined.

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,440
So your mother still has a breath of life left.

75
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,200
She’s temporarily sealed inside this hairpin.

76
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,720
Ling Feng.

77
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,000
The true Six Jia artifacts of Water, Fire, Wood, and Wind.

78
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,760
Opening the Four Symbols Altars together can gather life force.

79
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,840
But after Elder Huang passed, the three states became hostile.

80
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,240
It’s easier said than done.

81
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
I must save my mother.

82
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Hey, Master.

83
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,920
Hey, Yingtai, why are you visiting the Prime Minister’s residence?

84
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,360
I was about to ask you the same.

85
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,960
I didn’t expect Uncle Yi to be the chief steward of the Prime Minister’s residence.

86
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,000
So Uncle Yi is the chief steward of a great merchant family.

87
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,720
Wait, that’s not right.

88
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,360
Just now, the old man named Lu Nan said he’s the chief steward here.

89
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,880
Oh, you, you, you...

90
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,680
You’re the Prime Minister!

91
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,560
The master has returned.

92
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,200
Grand Commander Lu, it's been twenty years.

93
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
General Zhu has guarded the fortress for many years.

94
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,360
You've worked hard.

95
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,600
Grand Commander Lu, forgive us. The four of us have neglected our duties.

96
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,440
We failed to contain the Ma demon.

97
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,840
General Zhu, please rise.

98
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,080
You have protected my safety for twenty years.

99
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,720
I am deeply grateful.

100
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,040
The demon's escape was destined.

101
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,200
It couldn't be forced.

102
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,920
How could I blame you?

103
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,920
Please, get up.

104
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,920
Master, are you really the Chancellor?

105
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,720
It's so lively tonight.

106
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,440
Ah, Mr. Sun.

107
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,720
The Princess knows about all this too.

108
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:55,840
Yes.

109
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,840
We were hoping the Chancellor could help resolve this.

110
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,560
Alright, let's talk in the backyard.

111
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,120
Whenever I go out these days, I get new information.

112
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,160
The problem is how to find the letter proving collusion.

113
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,200
Otherwise, many local garrisons support the Zhu family.

114
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,560
The three of us, along with Princess Yuanhe,

115
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,920
have received a secret decree from His Majesty.

116
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
We are investigating and handling this matter.

117
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,400
The Zhu family has many troops and ample supplies.

118
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,600
If we push them to rebel,

119
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,240
Hmm.

120
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,960
it will be hard to control.

121
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,160
So regarding Zhu Ke framing General Lu,

122
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,160
we must go along with it.

123
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,320
Set a trap to counter them.

124
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,240
Hmm.

125
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,920
I've always worried about this fragile peace.

126
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,680
It seems there are successors.

127
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,000
Fragile peace.

128
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,400
How is the world divided?

129
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,320
Three parts.

130
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,760
You three, come here.

131
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,880
Stand around this basin.

132
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,520
Each of you hold one side.

133
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,080
Do not support each other.

134
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,440
If two argue now,

135
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,280
and one leaves,

136
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,600
what happens?

137
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,360
The basin falls, and people stumble.

138
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,920
If two join forces against one,

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,880
what happens?

140
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,880
The basin falls, and people stumble.

141
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,840
If all three fight together,

142
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,680
what happens?

143
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
The basin falls, and people stumble.

144
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,200
How can the basin not fall?

145
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,560
Live in harmony.

146
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,240
Hmm. If a fourth person pushes one of you,

147
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,480
what should be done?

148
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,800
Join forces to eliminate them.

149
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,640
Ah.

150
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,680
This is what happened with Jie Ling in Jingxi years ago.

151
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,680
Yes.

152
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,480
Sanbai is so clever.

153
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,320
Back then, Jie Ling ruled the nine counties of Jingxiang alone.

154
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,240
He refused to be restrained.

155
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,560
In one battle, he flooded seven armies.

156
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,280
His forces marched straight to Xuchang, the northern capital.

157
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,520
So many mysterious coincidences led to his defeat and death.

158
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,880
It wasn't a coincidence.

159
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,560
It was a plot by the three states.

160
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,400
Why did the three states agree?

161
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,920
Because the three brothers of Six Jia Sect agreed.

162
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,440
Each of us was a high minister or general.

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,440
We acted according to our abilities.

164
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,080
So it was all done by Six Jia Sect for the people's peace.

165
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,400
But now, Zhuge Long has ascended, and the Minister has retired.

166
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,160
I am also old and no longer useful.

167
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,760
The world belongs to the young.

168
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,240
For the people, this peace must be cherished.

169
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,240
Die'er has not formally become your disciple.

170
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,600
Today, Die'er truly wishes to inherit your teachings.

171
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,520
Alright.

172
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,920
My disciple has ambition.

173
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,720
As your master, I formally accept you.

174
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,960
Alright, then I, Princess Yuanhe, will be the witness.

175
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,080
And I, Liang Sanbai, also wish to learn from the Chancellor.

176
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
Wash hands.

177
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,920
Straighten clothes.

178
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,640
Present the traditional teacher’s gift.

179
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,600
Bow.

180
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,880
Now that you are my disciple and a Six Jia Sect heir,

181
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,880
I will teach you the Water Element Six Jia Incantation.

182
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,640
Water has no fixed form, soldiers have no fixed tactics.

183
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,920
The weak overcome the strong.

184
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,600
The gentle overcomes the hard.

185
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,240
Circumstances are like water; follow them to succeed.

186
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,120
I have fulfilled my duty and captured the Lu family traitor.

187
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,640
Alright.

188
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,880
You’ll be credited for this.

189
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,320
Go to the Court of Justice and arrange for their detention and sentencing.

190
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,160
Prime Minister Lu hasn’t made any move.

191
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,120
No.

192
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,280
Only those two academy kids are making a fuss.

193
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
That old man is really patient.

194
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,400
He’ll probably ask Ma Wenzhong at the Court of Justice for help.

195
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,960
After all, Ma Wenzhong used to be Lu Boyan’s deputy.

196
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,320
That old softie.

197
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,640
No need to worry.

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,960
I’ve already written a letter.

199
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,960
Zhu Fei.

200
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,080
At your service.

201
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,040
Come here.

202
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,560
Make sure to deliver this letter to Lord Ma Wenzhong in person.

203
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,920
Oh dear, Second Young Master Lu, how could you be so careless?

204
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,440
I served your father, Grand Commander Lu, for over ten years.

205
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,880
We called each other brothers.

206
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,320
I’ve always treated you like my own son.

207
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,440
Look at my useless son Ma Wancai—his name means “ten thousand talents,” but he only has three.

208
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,680
Eating, drinking, and sleeping.

209
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,480
I wish he could be like you, serving His Majesty as Commander of the Jinwu Guards at such a young age.

210
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,480
But today, I have to judge your case.

211
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,840
It pains me deeply.

212
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,600
Sigh.

213
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,000
All the witnesses are here.

214
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
No matter who you are in this court,

215
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,680
Old friends,

216
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,640
Family,

217
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,680
Or benefactors,

218
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,720
Even if it pains me,

219
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,200
I must remain impartial.

220
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,600
And uphold justice.

221
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,040
When I ask questions,

222
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,080
Just answer yes or no.

223
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,880
Say anything extra and you’ll be slapped.

224
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,760
Whether you’re the defendant, plaintiff, or witness,

225
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
Is that clear?

226
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,920
Yes, yes.

227
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,920
Alright, alright.

228
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,360
Let’s begin.

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,040
On the day His Majesty was attacked,

230
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,840
Were you inside Jianchu Palace?

231
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:55,880
Yes.

232
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,000
Zhu Die’er, suspected of colluding with the enemy.

233
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,040
Huh?

234
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,480
Inside Jianchu Palace.

235
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
The assassin called you “benefactor.”

236
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,240
Is that true?

237
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes.

238
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:06,960
But—

239
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,240
Hmm.

240
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,920
The defendant calls you brother.

241
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,680
Yes.

242
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,360
That settles it, then.

243
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,960
You’re in league with the assassin.

244
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,560
Defendant Lu Hang is guilty of colluding with the enemy.

245
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,560
Guilty as charged.

246
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,640
Take them away and execute them at once.

247
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,800
Yes, sir.

248
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,040
Sir, this is too hasty!

249
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
What kind of jerk logic is this?

250
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,680
You’re treating lives like nothing!

251
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,760
Dad, how can you be so careless?

252
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,640
My lord, shouldn’t you hear more testimony?

253
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,600
Hey, hey!

254
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,960
That’s it? So quick?

255
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,080
What kind of people has my father raised?

256
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,560
Sir, if we’re putting on a show, we should do it properly.

257
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,960
Finish the act, then lock them up.

258
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,160
Wait for the Prime Minister’s residence to turn against us.

259
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,840
The real target is Prime Minister Lu.

260
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,240
Put on the full act.

261
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,360
Hmm.

262
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,480
Nonsense.

263
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,560
If that’s the case,

264
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,320
You claim to have old ties with Prime Minister Lu.

265
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,560
And treat Lu Hang like a son.

266
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,920
Doesn’t that make you an accomplice too?

267
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,160
You—you—

268
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,520
Where did this brat come from, spouting nonsense?

269
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,400
Hey, Lord Ma is one of the Nine Ministers.

270
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,080
Don’t be reckless, Zhu.

271
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,680
You two refuse to accept the verdict.

272
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,760
And shout in court.

273
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,720
Give each of them twenty strokes.

274
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,280
Disgraceful.

275
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,720
General Lu risked his life and was seriously injured protecting His Majesty. Aren't you going to investigate?

276
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,120
Then tell me,

277
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,640
Benefactor,

278
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,680
what happened?

279
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,360
Then you should investigate me too.

280
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,600
What does this have to do with General Lu?

281
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,480
What could a country bumpkin like you possibly do?

282
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,640
You must have been ordered by Lu Hang.

283
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,920
Nonsense!

284
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,200
Who ordered you to close this muddled case?

285
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,320
Was it him?

286
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:49,960
Or him?

287
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,040
Or his master, Zhu Ke?

288
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,160
Executioners, where are you?

289
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,320
Father, Zhu Die'er did not collude with the enemy.

290
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,120
What spell are you under?

291
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:01,920
Father,

292
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,800
I've never asked you for anything.

293
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,440
Fine, forget it.

294
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,720
I'll only hold Lu Hang accountable.

295
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,960
You're targeting General Lu.

296
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,000
That's right. Let go.

297
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,560
You're an accomplice to the assassin.

298
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,800
Your classmates,

299
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,520
teachers,

300
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,080
friends,

301
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,640
relatives,

302
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,320
I can arrest any of them at will.

303
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,680
They're all accomplices.

304
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,960
Why act like a hero?

305
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,720
Do you want your entire clan executed, everyone dying because of you?

306
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,080
Let go, now!

307
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,680
I am magnanimous and will not hold your past offenses against you.

308
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,600
Proceed to the next hall for trial.

309
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,360
My Court of Justice has three thousand elite soldiers. Why would we fear a mere wanderer like you?

310
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,640
Especially with such a shocking case.

311
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,680
I have already consulted His Majesty before taking this stance.

312
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:54,440
Former Jinwu Guard Commander Lu Hang ordered several academy students, unaware of the truth, to collude with Jingxi.

313
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,680
They infiltrated Jianchu Palace and attempted to assassinate His Majesty but failed.

314
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,200
Such intentions deserve death.

315
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,560
Sentenced to dismemberment.

316
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,880
Execution will be carried out in autumn.

317
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,400
Prime Minister Lu Boyan indulged his rebellious son.

318
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,640
His crime is unforgivable.

319
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,400
Order:

320
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,800
Strip him of his title.

321
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,160
Grant him the imperial white silk.

322
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,880
In consideration of his great merits,

323
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,960
a five-day deadline is given.

324
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,480
General Zhu, impressive tactics.

325
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,040
You seized on the word "benefactor" and convicted them all.

326
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,120
Young Master Suo, you can't drink anymore.

327
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,840
My great vengeance is fulfilled. I am delighted.
