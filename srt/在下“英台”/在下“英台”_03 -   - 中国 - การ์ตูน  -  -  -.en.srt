1
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,800
Could there be something hidden here?

2
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,760
Who... who are you?

3
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,680
A demon.

4
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,560
Die'er, I am your mother.

5
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,720
Mother...

6
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,600
Die'er, I'm sorry.

7
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,160
I wasn't there to protect you as you grew up.

8
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,760
Because I had to protect the people here.

9
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,360
What happened?

10
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,800
I am a descendant of the Hundred Illusion Butterfly Clan from the South Sea.

11
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,720
I have no surname, my name is Ling Feng.

12
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,600
I carry the bloodline of the Butterfly God.

13
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
I traveled to Jiangdong and was moved by its beauty.

14
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,200
So I decided to settle here.

15
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,600
With a local farmer—

16
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,000
who is your father, Gong Yuan.

17
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,280
We came to know and accompany each other.

18
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,200
Gong Yuan joined the Liujia Sect and followed Master Huang to protect Jiangdong.

19
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,360
He encountered the fierce demon Chilin, who brought disaster here.

20
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,320
They fought for three days but could not win.

21
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,440
When the Liujia Sect was about to be defeated with heavy losses,

22
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,040
I couldn't bear it and summoned the true form of the Butterfly God.

23
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,360
I used up my life force to call the sacred mountain of the South Sea to suppress the demon.

24
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,800
After twenty years of purification, the demon could be turned into clear water.

25
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,880
Only sixty-four days remain, but fate has played a trick today.

26
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,360
You were able to enter such a hidden place.

27
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,640
And now the giant stone of the sacred mountain has cracked.

28
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,400
It seems conflict will break out in the world again.

29
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,120
Mother, did I cause trouble?

30
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,800
Heaven and earth are intertwined, both influencing each other.

31
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,200
There must be some unusual sign for this to happen.

32
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,800
Then what should I do?

33
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,760
Protect the people.

34
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,080
Does that mean I should fight for justice?

35
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,320
Follow the way of heaven and temper your emotions.

36
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,840
Without experiencing the world, you can't tell truth from falsehood.

37
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,080
Since the purification isn't finished,

38
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,080
I still have a trace of life force left.

39
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,320
But I have no form or shape, so I can only reside within your Liujia true form.

40
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,720
Perhaps when you meet a master of the Liujia Sect, we can meet again.

41
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,840
A gentle spring breeze by the window softly lifts the vermilion curtain

42
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,760
casting light and shadow on your profile

43
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,320
Wind chimes tinkle, carrying a lingering fragrance

44
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,320
My brush dances like a dragon, writing our fated love

45
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,000
I dare not look back

46
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,040
as rosy clouds fill the sky

47
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:16,280
My eyes lower, heart brimming with emotion

48
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,160
Oh no, it's about to collapse

49
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,920
Where's the bunny?

50
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,800
Thank you, benefactor.

51
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,600
You, you are...

52
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,240
Ox-Head and Horse-Face.

53
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,800
I am Chilin.

54
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,520
I will definitely repay your kindness.

55
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,280
Could this be the fierce demon Chilin that Mother mentioned earlier?

56
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,560
I need to hurry back to the Zhu family stronghold to warn Father and everyone.

57
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,800
Why am I here again?

58
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,680
I've been circling around for an hour.

59
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,680
What should I do now?

60
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,880
Hey, Bunny, did you see something?

61
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,200
Was it that demon from before?

62
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,240
No, no one.

63
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,360
Which way should we go?

64
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,920
Deep worries and heavy responsibilities.

65
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,600
Ah! A demon!

66
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,800
Determined to be loyal and sincere.

67
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,280
Cautious day and night.

68
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,520
Unable to eat or sleep in peace.

69
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,000
Wishing for peace in the country and benefit for the people.

70
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Planning for long-term stability.

71
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,640
He looks kind.

72
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,800
He doesn't seem like a demon.

73
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,200
What is this young man doing here?

74
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,320
Um...

75
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,000
Hello, uncle, I...

76
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,400
Uncle, be careful and hide behind me.

77
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,880
Be careful, quickly hide behind the tree!

78
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,480
You’re stumped by a mere brat?

79
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,440
Stop with the sarcastic remarks.

80
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,080
Why don’t you help, then?

81
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,480
Troops have no constant formation, water has no fixed shape.

82
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,880
Adapt to the terrain and defeat the enemy accordingly.

83
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,480
When dispersed, like a vast expanse.

84
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,080
When gathered, strong as steel.

85
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,760
With the force of a mountain.

86
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,600
Water-element Liujia

87
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,960
There's an expert here today.

88
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,640
Wait until the Baiju group has assembled before taking action.

89
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,840
Hmph.

90
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,000
Things are getting more and more interesting.

91
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,800
Did we just encounter a tree spirit?

92
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,240
It's the same Liujia technique as yours.

93
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,840
But the wood element comes from the Jingxi Zhuge lineage.

94
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,760
Uncle, you're so knowledgeable.

95
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,000
Thank you, young man, for your help.

96
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,520
Hey, uncle, wait up!

97
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,640
I'm lost.

98
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,560
Young man, where are you headed?

99
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,560
Uh, I'm going to become a great hero.

100
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,840
What is a hero?

101
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,080
Someone who fights the strong and helps the weak.

102
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,480
That's a minor hero, not a great one.

103
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,680
A true hero roams the battlefield.

104
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,480
They kill enemies, earn merit, and protect their homeland.

105
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,360
Not quite.

106
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,720
Then what is it?

107
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
Do you have any martial skills?

108
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,800
I can take on ten ordinary bandits by myself.

109
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,720
Oh, impressive.

110
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,840
What if twenty show up today?

111
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,840
I know a bit of magic.

112
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,200
Even twenty or thirty wouldn't be a problem.

113
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,080
What about a hundred?

114
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,400
I... I'll go back and get my father to help fight them.

115
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,640
And a thousand?

116
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,480
Uncle, you're teasing me.

117
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,240
A thousand bandits is nothing.

118
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,880
Back then, the Yellow Turbans numbered in the millions.

119
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Tens of thousands, even up to a hundred thousand, gathered in each county.

120
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,520
They swept through the land like locusts.

121
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,520
Isn't that exactly why we ride into battle?

122
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,120
An era of heroes.

123
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,720
How stirring and moving.

124
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,520
What a stirring era of heroes.

125
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,320
Two million men, women, and children in Jiangdong.

126
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,280
One million in Jingxi.

127
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,000
Plus four million in Northern Luo, only seven million people left in the world.

128
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,720
Did you know there were fifty-seven million people during Emperor Huan's Yongshou era?

129
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,240
This is the so-called stirring era of heroes you speak of.

130
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,440
Fifty million are gone.

131
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,720
Everyone called themselves rulers and fought each other for sixty years.

132
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,920
Only one in ten commoners survived.

133
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,640
Fifty million lives for three emperors.

134
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,040
Please, sir, give me your guidance.

135
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,680
No, please take me as your disciple.

136
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,320
Zhu Die'er truly wants to serve the people and the world.

137
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,960
There's nothing wrong with fighting on the battlefield.

138
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,680
But what is the purpose?

139
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,280
Master, please teach me.

140
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,400
Don't rush to call me master, let me think first.

141
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,000
It's not hard to die in battle.

142
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,040
But that won't bring peace and prosperity to the nation.

143
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
Then what should I do?

144
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,280
Protect the people.

145
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,920
Protect the people.

146
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,920
Only save lives.

147
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,080
Ride into battle to end war with war.

148
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,560
End the war

149
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,480
I never thought I could take on a disciple at such an old age.

150
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,200
Disciple Zhu Die'er hopes for your guidance, Master.

151
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,360
Regardless of gender,

152
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,200
one should aspire to be a hero in life.

153
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,400
Climb the high platform, be appointed general, and protect the nation.

154
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,640
I will give you the name Yingtai.

155
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,120
It feels great to make such a dazzling entrance.

156
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,520
Thank you, Master.

157
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,280
Master, may I ask your surname?

158
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,120
My surname is Lu.

159
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,440
I must not be late to visit my friend today.

160
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Let’s meet again at the city academy in three days.

161
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,360
Okay.

162
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,160
How do I get there?

163
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,520
Head towards the sunrise for two more miles and you'll reach the capital.

164
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,880
Regardless of gender, aspire to be a hero.

165
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,320
Climb the stage, be appointed general, and protect the nation and its people.

166
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,440
Yes, the ambition of a hero.

167
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,480
I really wish I could ask Uncle Lu for advice in person.

168
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
There are hidden sages in the wild.

169
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,760
I need to ask Father Emperor to investigate further.

170
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,120
Hey, you’ve been talking for over an hour.

171
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,560
You still haven’t said what your relationship is.

172
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,800
Never mind, I won’t say.

173
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,240
Come on, stop keeping us in suspense.

174
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,560
Ah, I finally found the way.

175
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,400
I see the Zhu family stronghold.

176
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,400
So there’s a small path behind the village that leads up the mountain.

177
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
A gentle touch of red lips

178
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,600
The first time I once imagined

179
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,880
ended up being given to a country boy

180
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,600
Oh well, oh well

181
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,320
I was still reluctant to give up my first time

182
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,520
Ah, where's my bunny?

183
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,280
You scared my bunny away

184
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,120
Why are you here?

185
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,320
It was you who knocked me down

186
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,360
Why ask me?

187
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,760
I—well, who told you to stand here?

188
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,800
It was just a sad accident

189
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,760
Sanbai, pull yourself together

190
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,040
Tell me, what are you here for?

191
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,960
Uncle left his pouch at the Zhu family stronghold

192
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,800
I plan to go retrieve it

193
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,680
I was just passing by

194
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,520
Pouch

195
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,480
This one

196
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,280
That's right

197
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,920
Take it and leave, you're making me mad

198
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,280
No, you're making me mad

199
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,200
Wait

200
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,760
Do you have something

201
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,680
you need my help with?

202
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,080
Don't tell me you want me

203
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,680
to take responsibility for this

204
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,240
What nonsense

205
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,800
We're both men anyway

206
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If you need help

207
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,600
How about you take me to the academy in the city

208
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,560
You guys

209
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,960
How about we just forget this ever happened

210
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,760
Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to forget

211
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,040
Right, we're all good brothers here

212
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,600
Tonight, the new student can stay in a guest room at Yuanhe Residence

213
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,280
We'll arrange a dormitory tomorrow
