00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,130
Can you stop bothering me?

190
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,490
Wen Yifan...

191
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,560
am I really that bad?

192
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,610
I hate it

193
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,730
that every time I have to come out and see you.

194
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,400
It's frustrating

195
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,440
that you keep coming to Beiyu for me.

196
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,890
So I chose a place

197
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,210
farther away from Beiyu than Nanwu.

198
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,610
When I go to Yihe,

199
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:22,890
I hope

200
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,370
you won't come looking for me again.

201
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,090
Sang Yan, you're a great person.

202
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,850
I was the one who hurted you.

203
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,590
♪What was lost...♪

204
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,010
Let him stay this way forever,

205
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,560
full of life.

206
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,440
It's better

207
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,250
if we never ran into each other again.

208
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,250
Sang Yan.

209
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Are you asleep?

210
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,040
No.

211
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,970
No need to get up and open the door.

212
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,920
I just have a few things to say.

213
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,970
I've thought about it.

214
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,040
Given my current situation,

215
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,490
it's not really suitable for me to have a roommate.

216
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,640
So...

217
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,330
I'll move out as soon as possible,

218
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,640
find a one-bedroom place,

219
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
and live alone.

220
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,160
That way, I won't be a bother to you.

221
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,640
I just wanted to inform you of my decision.

222
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,890
Get some rest.

223
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,970
And don't forget to lock the door.

224
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,370
I don't get it.

225
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,610
You're the one subletting the place to Sang Yan.

226
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,160
You're technically the landlord.

227
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,210
So why are you the one looking for a new place?

228
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,280
Shouldn't he be the one moving out?

229
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,090
He paid several months' rent upfront.

230
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,370
I can't ask him to leave.

231
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,400
Why not?

232
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,970
Because I sleepwalk.

233
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,800
I don't want to bother him.

234
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,040
Sleepwalking is one thing.

235
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,210
But we're talking about first-come, first-served here.

236
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,010
You were there first.

237
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,330
Why should you be the one to move?

238
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,760
Are you satisfied with this place?

239
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,920
It's okay.

240
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,290
No!

241
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,490
It's not going to work.

242
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,250
The kitchen and bedroom are basically connected.

243
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,440
The cooking fumes will get everywhere.

244
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,370
How am I supposed to sleep?

245
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,610
Also,

246
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,560
there are cracks on the walls.

247
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,760
The paint is ugly, too.

248
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
I can have someone repaint it for you.

249
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,970
I'm offering with full sincerity.

250
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,210
The rent is already super cheap.

251
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,160
If you like it,

252
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
just pay a deposit first.

253
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,440
This place is in high demand.

254
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,160
If you hesitate too long, someone else will take it.

255
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,090
This apartment is so tiny.

256
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,210
And there's a construction site right outside.

257
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,520
The noise would drive me insane.

258
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,370
It's not worth the original price.

259
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,440
Lower the rent.

260
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,370
That puts me in a tough spot.

261
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,040
In this area,

262
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,560
you won't find a place cheaper than this.

263
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,010
Go ask around if you don't believe me.

264
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,210
If this one won't do, I'll keep looking.

265
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:38,850
No.

266
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,640
I'll show you my utmost sincerity.

267
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,890
I'll give you a huge discount

268
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
on the agency fee.

269
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:44,760
What do you think?

270
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,610
Sounds good.

271
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,610
Hey, no.

272
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,680
We appreciate your sincerity,

273
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,760
but we still want to think it over.

274
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,730
Let's check out other options.

275
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,280
No.

276
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,040
Thanks.

277
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,560
Are you happy with it or not?

278
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,800
We'll keep looking.

279
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,040
The cost-performance ratio is really high here.

280
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,830
Let's discuss it.

281
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,050
We're looking further.

282
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,400
Did you notify Sang Yan?

283
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,330
Notify what?

284
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,440
Don't you two notify each other

285
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,040
if you bring guests home?

286
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:06,850
It's fine.

287
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,920
You should notify, though.

288
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,680
What if he suddenly comes back?

289
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,850
He's on a business trip today.

290
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,800
He won't be home.

291
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,370
You should've said so earlier.

292
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,850
Why are there so many

293
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,040
pretty little night lights in your place?

294
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,680
And this padding strip?

295
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,090
Sang Yan put them up.

296
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,130
He was worried you'd hurt yourself sleepwalking.

297
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,330
He's really considerate toward you.

298
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,850
That won't work.

299
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,040
Sleepwalkers don't respond to light.

300
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
You two really have no chance?

301
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:51,800
Forget it.

302
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,280
You must have your reasons.

303
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,680
But is just moving out

304
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,760
really the best idea?

305
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,130
At least it'd be better for him.

306
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,010
But yeah,

307
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,400
If you stay,

308
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,610
the guilt will only grow.

309
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,160
You see each other every day, after all.

310
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,490
Things from the past you want to forget

311
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,920
aren't so easy to erase.

312
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,010
Maybe moving out is for the best.

313
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,250
You won't dwell on the past anymore.

314
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,010
Go shower.

315
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,760
All right, I'm going.

316
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,130
Think it over.

317
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,330
Why is apartment hunting so exhausting?

318
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,100
Hello?

319
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,250
Miss Wen.

320
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,370
This is Cao from the agency.

321
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,890
Is this a good time to talk?

322
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:41,730
Yes.

323
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,330
I just wonder

324
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,160
if you've made a decision about today's place.

325
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,160
We're still discussing it.

326
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,890
Could you tell me exactly

327
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,640
what's holding you back?

328
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,520
I can find more options

329
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,210
that suit your needs.

330
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,040
I don't even know what I'm hesitating about.

331
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
All right.

332
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,010
Take your time.

333
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,130
But if you do want this place,

334
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,210
make sure to pay the deposit

335
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,250
by tomorrow night.

336
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,330
Otherwise, I'll have to let another client take it.

337
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,610
Got it.

338
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:27,850
What are you looking at?

339
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,560
Why is there a white spot here?

340
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,970
After Lin left, that spot's been empty.

341
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,800
I haven't decided what to hang there yet.

342
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,370
I see.

343
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,920
I'll get you a nice painting next time.

344
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,890
Why bother if I'm moving out?

345
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,280
I kept thinking about it in the shower.

346
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,760
Do you really have to move?

347
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,280
Even if you two don't fall for each other over time

348
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,560
or rekindle old feelings,

349
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,040
he hasn't treated you badly.

350
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,130
I think he's adapted pretty well.

351
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,920
Maybe he even likes your sleepwalking.

352
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,370
Honestly, he's been giving way to me a lot,

353
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,130
even covering more of the household costs.

354
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,800
Just like this mark on the wall,

355
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,010
a painting was here for so long,

356
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,330
and of course it left a trace.

357
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,010
He's holding onto the past.

358
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,640
Some marks deep down

359
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,250
will never fade.

360
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,280
It feels like you're talking about me.

361
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,640
That's why

362
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,560
I went all in haggling

363
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,400
with the agent today.

364
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,610
I want to buy you more time

365
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,730
so you wouldn't regret it later.

366
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,400
Thank you.

367
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,160
This apartment is great.

368
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,890
It's so spacious.

369
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,090
If it were me, I wouldn't move.

370
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,760
Unlike me,

371
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,800
I'm already this age

372
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,330
and still living with my brother and two nieces.

373
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,400
Have you ever considered moving out?

374
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,410
Of course.

375
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,280
But every time I think of my mom,

376
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,760
I change my mind.

377
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,760
Why?

378
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,440
Look,

379
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,400
she wakes up at 5:30 every morning

380
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,290
to make breakfast for the whole family.

381
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,920
Then she spends the day

382
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,130
running the lottery shop.

383
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,810
By the time she gets home to rest,

384
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,000
it's already past midnight.

385
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,770
Her whole life

386
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,330
has been about taking care of others.

387
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,720
If I move out for real,

388
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,570
then all of this work

389
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,000
would be left to her alone.

390
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,830
She must be touched

391
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,200
that you stayed.

392
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,570
She has no idea.

393
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,370
She just thinks

394
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,400
I'm saving on rent.

395
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,640
You and your mom are the same,

396
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,290
saying one thing but meaning another,

397
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,810
complaining but still living for others.

398
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,200
Isn't that just life?

399
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,240
We're all running around nonstop

400
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,960
just to live for others

401
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,200
and make other people happy.

402
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,850
Why is it that people

403
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,330
are always trying to please others

404
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,920
but forget to be kind to themselves?

405
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,570
Shouldn't we first learn...

406
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,850
Shouldn't we first learn to love ourselves?

407
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,570
Dian.

408
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,050
Dian.

409
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,150
[Autumn]

410
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,290
Most cases start in childhood.

411
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,000
It gradually improves with age.

412
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,130
But in some cases,

413
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,960
sleepwalking is a late-onset condition.

414
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,530
Though the data is still insufficient.

415
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,370
How has your sleep quality been lately?

416
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,050
When work gets busy,

417
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,640
I might sleep less.

418
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,810
Here, sit.

419
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,090
You need to make sure

420
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,050
to maintain regular exercise

421
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,330
and a stable sleep schedule.

422
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,440
When you're sleep-deprived

423
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,270
or under excessive stress,

424
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,210
the chances of sleepwalking increase.

425
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,640
The main trigger is sudden stress.

426
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,920
Have you been under a lot of pressure lately?

427
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,070
No.

428
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,050
Of course, you have.

429
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,680
Sang Yan.

430
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,770
That doesn't count as stress.

431
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,090
It does.

432
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,810
Do you live alone?

433
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,770
I have a roommate now.

434
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,770
That's good.

435
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,790
At least if anything dangerous happens,

436
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,130
there's someone to keep an eye on you.

437
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,200
Make sure you eat properly

438
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,680
and don't overwork yourself.

439
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,150
Ever since you moved in with Sang Yan,

440
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,480
your sleepwalking got worse.

441
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,160
Didn't it?

442
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,090
Seems like it.

443
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,770
But it's not that frequent.

444
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,430
In total...

445
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,670
five or six times.

446
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,770
So you're really affected by Sang Yan.

447
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:27,680
That's a lot of pressure.

448
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,680
He's not pressuring me.

449
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,000
Then is it work stress?

450
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:33,900
No.

451
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
So it's neither Sang Yan

452
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,090
nor work...

453
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,640
But aren't these the only two things in your life?

454
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,530
What else is there?

455
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,440
I don't want to see

456
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,440
any of you ever again.

457
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,690
Look,

458
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,130
If you like this gentleman...

459
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,630
I'm your mother.

460
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,920
So my mother can just ignore my feelings?

461
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,810
I have an idea.

462
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
If you can't pinpoint the cause,

463
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,610
then just find a way

464
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,050
to relieve stress.

465
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,290
How?

466
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,640
Date someone.

467
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,530
If you don't want to develop things with Sang Yan,

468
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,330
then go find

469
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,090
a new guy.

470
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,480
I can't.

471
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,570
You've never flirted before?

472
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,720
Then what's the point of having this face?

473
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,050
It's such a waste of a good look.

474
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,680
Just be a little more playful with your words.

475
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,130
When he talks,

476
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:26,810
respond.

477
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,920
But make it seem like you're interested

478
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,330
without being too obvious.

479
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,480
Give me an example.

480
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,960
Start with casual conversation.

481
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,720
Once the topic gets deeper,

482
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,290
ask him about his zodiac sign.

483
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,370
Then based on that,

484
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,340
praise a few traits of his sign.

485
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,000
For example,

486
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,440
I personally like Cancers.

487
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,480
I think they're kind and attentive...

488
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
Wouldn't that be too obvious?

489
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,920
No way.

490
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,050
I can't do that.

491
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,160
I've never flirted either.

492
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,720
What is it?

493
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,960
I just saw Su Haoan's grandpa.

494
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,290
I'll go say hi.

495
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:08,720
Alright.

496
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,640
- I'm heading back to the TV station. - Okay, bye.

497
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,200
- Say hi to Grandpa for me. - Will do.

498
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,770

499
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,570
What are you doing here?

500
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,640
Hello.

501
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,200
Grandpa.

502
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,330
Are you here to see a doctor?

503
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,200
Which department?

504
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,960
Oh, right.

505
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,090
Which department am I here for?

506
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,370
Grandpa, if you haven't finished your check-up,

507
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,570
how about I stay with you?

508
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,090
Okay.

509
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,370
But which department am I seeing?

510
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Where's Uncle Ma?

511
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,850
Right, where's Ma?

512
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,720
Sir!

513
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,240
Ma, where did you go?

514
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,680
Sir,

515
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,090
I should be asking you that.

516
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,680
Where did you go?

517
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,400
I parked the car.

518
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,890
And when I went to the entrance,

519
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,240
you were gone.

520
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,890
This hospital is too big.

521
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,290
It's easy for Grandpa to get lost.

522
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,050
It's okay.

523
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,960
I'll stay with you.

524
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,530
No need.

525
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,680
Thank you.

526
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,240
It's fine. No need to be so polite.

527
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Let's go see the doctor now.

528
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,680
See you later.

529
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,130
Bye, Qiao.

532
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,400
Have a seat.

533
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:37,850
Dr. Liu,

534
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,850
truly sorry.

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,610
[Dr. Liu Jianming]
I just found the patient.

536
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,160
He got lost earlier.

537
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,770
Next time, it's best to have a family member

538
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,000
come with you.

539
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,640
I need to speak with them.

540

Ma is with me.

00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,240
He is my family.

542
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,810
I meant your wife and grandson.

543
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,290
Didn't you say last time

544
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,640
that they're still around?

545
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,960
Do they know about your condition?

546
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,720
They know.

547
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,770
Hello? Su Haoan.

548
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,640
You won't believe this.

549
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,400
I just ran into Grandpa at the hospital.

550
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,530
I know.

551
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,050
Uncle Ma told me.

552
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,610
Do you know about Grandpa's health?

553
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,960
Of course I do.

554
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,370
Isn't it just a diabetes follow-up?

555
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,640
He's seeing a neurologist.

556
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,400

557
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,370
you're back?

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,480
Then...

566
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:17,810
can this disease be cured?

567
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,570
Completely reversing it

568
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,770
is impossible.

569
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,240
But with timely treatment and intervention,

570
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,680
we can slow down its progression.

571
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,050
What you should focus on now

572
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,000
is how to support his treatment

573
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,680
and how to take care of him in the future.

574
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,480
Alzheimer's

575
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,680
doesn't just challenge the patient.

576
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,090
It challenges the family as well.

577

Didn't the doctor say

581
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,400
the early stage is just mild forgetfulness?

Don't worry.

592
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,000
I know an old lady who treats me like her own granddaughter.

593

And she's one of my long-time clients.

594

00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,210
Since elementary school,

756
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,370
his grades were just average.

757
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,440
We pretty much gave up on him.

758
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,400
But then, out of nowhere,

759
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,480
he started working insanely hard.

760
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:57,730
And now...

761
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,480
you're his new roommate.

762
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,850
Are you free tomorrow?

763
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,440
We can go watch a movie together.

764
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,370
Yan has been out of college for years

765
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,080
and still hasn't had a girlfriend.

766
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,920
It worried us so much.

767
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,210
We even wondered

768
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,000
if it was because we didn't let him date back then.

769
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,770
Why are you doing your own laundry?

770
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,290
Mom.

771
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,730
Auntie, you guys keep talking.

772
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,600
I'll head back to my room.

773
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,560
Okay.

774
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,170
Did that little brat spill the beans?

775
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,330
Sang Yan,

776
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,900
you're living with her,

777
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,250
a lady.

778
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,040
Did you tell Mom and Dad?

779
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,330
You've been off the radar for so long.

780
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,040
Of course, I had to check in.

781
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,440
Didn't I go on a business trip recently?

782
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,770
Kexin.

783
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,480
- Auntie. - Stay a little longer.

784
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,370
I need to talk to Yan.

785
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,080
Okay.

786
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,810
Just stay for a bit.

787
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,480
What's wrong with you?

788
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,000
Last time, you were set up with Miss Yu.

789
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,080
And then you just disappeared.

790
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,650
Her mother had to come looking for me,

791
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,000
and that's when I found out you two never even kept in touch.

792
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,400
Tell me the truth.

793
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,170
You don't like her, do you?

794
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,520
Do you have someone else in mind?

795
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,520
Is it that girl who opened the door?

796
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,810
Is she your girlfriend?

797
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,080
Is she your girlfriend?

798
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,810
If she is...

799
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,810
Why is Auntie suddenly so excited?

800
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:46,730
I won't have to set you up

801
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,730

802
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,560
For now...

803
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,120
she's not.

804
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,330

You brat.

806
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,850
If you do, go after her.

807
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,370
You're a man.

808
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,080
Does Sang Yan like that girl?

809
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,250
All right.

810
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,080
You don't need to worry about me.

811
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,370
Then who else would I worry about?

812
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,440
Honestly.

813
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,650
Sounds like

814
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:17,120
Sang Yan really does have feelings for her.

815
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,080
Treat us to a meal, then.

816
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,040
No nonsense. Hurry up.

817

819

Get ready.

820

Something's burning.

821
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,850
She's so careless.

822
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
You two live together.

823
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,600
If there's a fire, it'll be a disaster.

824
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,650
Turn it off, quick.

825
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:34,890
Kexin,

826
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,370
let's go eat out later.

827
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,080
What do you want to eat?

828
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:37,960
Anything's fine, Auntie.

829
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,890
I'll go with whatever Sang Yan wants.

830
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,810
Have you eaten?

831
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,770
Eat with me.

832
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,850
You haven't eaten yet?

833
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,080
Not yet.

00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,440

You go ahead.

836
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,250
I'll take a shower first.

837
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,730

849

Or do you want to ask

850
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,040
if my date went well?

851
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,290
No.

852
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,560

853
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,690
you've been dressing

854
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,850

I know.

862

you have to respond.
