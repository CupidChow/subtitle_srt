never calls,

172
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,890
We had agreed

173
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,690
to go to the same university.

174
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,490
But in the end, you chose Yihe University.

175
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,100
Was it because of your grades?

176
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,540
No, I deliberately didn't apply to Nanwu University.

177
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,780
So you fell for someone else?

178
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,450
I never liked anyone else.

179
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,490
Not in the past.

180
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,330
Not in the future.

181
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,300
He was really devastated.

182
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,570
That was the first time

183
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,980
I thought he was like a lump of clay,

184
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,660
with no charm whatsoever.

185
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,660
That whole summer,

186
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,660
he locked himself in his room.

187
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,300
He had no motivation to do anything.

188
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,980
Sang Yan, drink some porridge.

189
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,930
Sang Yan, take your medicine.

190
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,490
Sang Yan, have a jelly.

191
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,890
Get some sugar in you.

192
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,450
Actually, this was a good thing.

193
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,380
Why?

194
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,300
He's always been smart,

195
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,540
good at everything since childhood,

196
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,140
always so arrogant,

197
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,020
full of himself.

198
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,500
Even with family, he kept his distance.

199
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,810
Then he decided school was useless

200
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,060
and only did what he liked.

201
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,260
Everyone indulged him,

202
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,690
but the more they spoiled him,

203
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,090
the harder he was to deal with.

204
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,330
I couldn't get close to him either.

205
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,420
Until later,

206
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,420
when he experienced

207
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,610
a failure as big as losing you.

208
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,780
That's when he finally understood

209
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,810
the world

210
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,540
doesn't revolve around him.

211
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,500
Sang Yan,

212
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,660
what's wrong with you?

213
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,450
The family has been so happy

214
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,140
that you got into Nanwu University.

215
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,420
They even told me to learn from you.

216
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,300
What's there to learn from me?

217
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,570
I'm terrible.

218
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,850
Who said you're terrible?

219
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,730
Tell me.

220
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,780
I want to be friends with him!

221
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,780
Sang Yan,

222
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,730
you're heartbroken, aren't you?

223
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,780
What does a little kid like you know?

224
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,020
Why wouldn't I know?

225
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,210
In fairy tales,

226
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,660
when the prince can't find the princess,

227
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,970
he looks just like you!

228
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,260
And then?

229
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,060
Then the prince endured countless trials,

230
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,930
mastered all kinds of skills,

231
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,380
and crossed snowy mountains,

232
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,140
deserts,

233
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,850
and forests full of monsters.

234
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,970
In the end,

235
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,930
he saved the princess,

236
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,930
and they lived happily ever after.

237
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,210
Kid,

238
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,810
you sure know a lot.

239
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,780
I'm not a kid anymore.

240
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,660
You don't even know how good cartoons are!

241
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,850
Here, have a jelly.

242
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,690
Get some sugar in you.

243
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,610
What food do we have?

244
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,020
Weren't you skipping dinner?

245
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,850
Mom!

246
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,060
Put away the chicken drumsticks and steak!

247
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,330
Here.

248
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,060
That's when I realized

249
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,970
he was someone I could be close to.

250
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,090
He was no longer just that serious older brother,

251
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,660
but someone I could actually connect with.

252
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,850
We changed each other,

253
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,260
and became better versions of ourselves.

254
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,540
Come on,

255
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,970
drink up.

256
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,900
- Here. - Yifan,

257
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,570
it's all home-cooked food today.

258
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,780
We don't see you as an outsider.

259
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,140
Thank you, Uncle, Auntie.

260
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,500
No need to be polite.

261
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,610
- Here. - No need to be so formal.

262
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,450
Try my cooking.

263
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,900
Eat more.

264
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,610
This is her specialty dish.

265
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,420
Is my makeup smudged?

266
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,380
No.

267
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,540
Yifan,

268
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,810
you're really beautiful!

269
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,260
Ping,

270
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,610
you're staring too much.

271
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,180
You're making her embarrassed.

272
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,420
But Yifan,

273
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,420
ever since we met you in high school,

274
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,260
she has been saying the same thing.

275
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,210
- Right. - She even said,

276
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,450
"Look at our Yan,

277
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,850
how is he even worthy of a girl like her?"

278
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,730
- Right? - Exactly. She's stunning.

279
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,970
What are you laughing at?

280
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,570
How do you talk to your sister like that?

281
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,730
This kid...

282
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,200
Come on, eat.

283
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,160
- Eat up. - Dig in.

284
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,180
Let me try this dumpling filling.

285
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,180
Honestly, back in high school,

286
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,180
we weren't dating.

287
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,210
We only...

288
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,090
When I was on a business trip in Beiyu,

289
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,420
he came to find me.

290
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,020
That's when we actually got together.

291
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,420
Either way, he liked you from the start.

292
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,330
That never changed.

293
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,660
He's so stubborn.

294
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,610
He really thought we didn't know?

295
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,210
It's true.

296
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,090
He's been out of college for years,

297
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,500
and still didn't date anyone.

298
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,210
We were so worried.

299
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,300
We even thought that conversation back then

300
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,450
scared him off.

301
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,210
Yeah.

302
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,020
We even tried setting him up on blind dates.

303
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,730
You even introduced me to a foreigner.

304
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,260
Now comes the important part!

305
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,380
Here.

306
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,780
Thank you, Mom.

307
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,540
You're welcome.

308
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,090
Here.

309
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,540
Thank you.

310
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,930
Here.

311
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,330
I get one too?

312
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,380
Of course.

313
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,610
From now on,

314
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,140
you're family.

315
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,180
Take it.

316
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,210
Take it.

317
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,140
Take it.

318
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,140
Thank you, Auntie.

319
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,810
No need to be so polite.

320
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,780
Come on, eat up.

321
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,450
Come on.

322
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,900
Don't drink too much.

323
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,570
Take it easy on the drinks.

324
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,140
Alright.

325
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,300
Let Yifan eat more.

326
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,930
Here,

327
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,570
some shrimp.

328
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,500
Finally,

329
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,970
I feel like I have a family.

330
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,380
Come on, eat up.

331
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,260
Being part of their family,

332
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,330
feeling their love,

333
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,690
completely wrapped in warmth...

334
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,450
It's such a good feeling.

335
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,380
Yifan,

336
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,810
this is my room.

337
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,090
Have a seat.

338
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,660
Stay with me tonight.

339
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,380
I'll tell you my secret.

340
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,260
Let me take this call first.

341
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,970
Okay.

342
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,900
Hello? Jiaxu?

343
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,500
Zhi,

344
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,140
Happy New Year!

345
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,180
Happy New Year!

346
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,450
We had dumplings.

347
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,210
And...

348
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,210
my mom made ribs.

349
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,270
Yeah, I read it.

350
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,680
What?

351
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,480
No, I didn't.

352
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,920
I didn't get to that part.

353
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,930
The door wasn't locked.

354
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,020
We're home!

355
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,500
You can't sleep?

356
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,930
I'll sleep later.

357
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,810
Want to sleep with me?

358
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,380
No.

359
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,260
Then go.

360
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,500
The door's still open.

361
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,060
Sit down.

362
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,730
Why are you still awake?

363
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,500
Waiting for someone.

364
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,300
Tomorrow,

365
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,540
are you staying here?

366
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,850
I really like your home.

367
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,850
What's so great about my place?

368
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,850
It's just

369
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,780
such a happy

370
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,260
and warm family.

371
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,090
Only a home like this could raise someone like you.

372
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,210
Someone like me?

373
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,060
What kind of person am I?

374
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,500
Proud.

375
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,930
Confident.

376
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,420
Passionate.

377
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,740
Like the sun.

378
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,570
Sang Yan,

379
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,370
