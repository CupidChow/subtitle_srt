I need your help, urgent.

189
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,480
I'm busy. Ask someone else.

190
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,270
Well,

191
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,510
my grandpa

192
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,600
is at my place.

193
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,390
He says he's here to see Wang Linlin.

194
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,510
Apparently, I got drunk one time

195
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,480
and told him that...

196
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,240
that we're planning to get married and have kids,

197
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,480
and we're going to live together.

198
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,000
Please come over now!

199
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,320
I'm busy.

200
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,150
Busy with what?

201
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,030
Come on.

202
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,960
Please?

203
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,790
Just this once, I beg you.

204
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,600
Zhong Siqiao!

205
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,480
Grandpa,

206
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,870
after getting supper,

207
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,600
Linlin went to a friend's birthday party.

208
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,790
She won't be back tonight.

209
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,870
I'll wait here until she gets home.

210
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,870
By the way, let me ask you...

211
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,720
Why haven't you gone

212
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,630
to visit your parents' and brother's graves?

213
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,960
I'll find time to go.

214
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,550
Really?

215
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,550
Really.

216
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,390
I checked with the cemetery staff.

217
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,750
No one else has visited

218
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,060
aside from your Grandma and me

219
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,750
in the past two years.

220
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,670
Tell me,

221
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,960
do you really dislike them that much?

222
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,670
I've been busy with work.

223
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,630
My business is huge now, really.

224
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,960
You'll see for yourself next time you visit.

225
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,520
How busy are you, really?

226
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,630
Look at yourself.

227
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,000
Drifting through your days,

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,360
wasting time.

229
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,390
Sooner or later,

230
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,440
Linlin will leave you.

231
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,840
You're just getting back now!

232
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,550
Grandpa, I'm home!

233
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,000
Where did you go?

234
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,270
We ran out of toilet paper at home.

235
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,960
And there was a sale today, so I went to buy some.

236
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,270
Weren't you at your friend's

237
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,320
birthday party?

238
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,790
Yeah!

239
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,790
The supermarket belongs to my friend's family.

240
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,080
Since it was her birthday today,

241
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,360
they had a sale.

242
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,390
Haoan,

243
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,550
go buy a serving

244
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,120
of Nanwu's best soup dumplings

245
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,360
at the same place

246
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,790
I used to take you when you were little.

247
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,720
Grandpa,

248
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,200
you already bought late-night snacks.

249
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,720
Did you forget?

250
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,630
They've been sitting for so long.

251
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,360
Grandpa, I'm not hungry anyway.

252
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,580
Yeah, she's not hungry.

253
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,440
Me neither.

254
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,670
What do you mean by that?

255
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,630
You can buy handbags for Linlin

256
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,910
but not soup dumplings for your grandpa?

257
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,150
Go!

258
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,840
Go on!

259
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,360
Fine.

260
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,030
Unbelievable.

261
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,000
Linlin,

262
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,630
I want to ask you a few things.

263
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,240
Do you usually sleep

264
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,270
on the left side

265
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,030
or the right side?

266
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,320
The right side!

267
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,120
That's strange.

268
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,510
Haoan

269
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,720
has always slept on the right side.

270
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,080
Yeah, I know.

271
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,440
But I've also slept on the right side since I was a kid.

272
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,080
So he lets me have it.

273
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,480
Where are your clothes?

274
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,910
Haoan said mine didn't look good.

275
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,000
He wants to buy me new ones.

276
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
So for now,

277
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,510
I'm just wearing his.

278
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,910
It's loose, comfy,

279
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,000
and sweet!

280
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,390
Are you two hiding something from me?

281
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,960
This Haoan...

282
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,360
he actually dared to lie to me!

283
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,720
Actually, I...

284
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,320
You two aren't really living together, are you?

285
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,000
- We... - You're about to get married.

286
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,320
What's wrong with living together?

287
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,910
Or do you want to wait until after the wedding

288
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,720
to find out your husband

289
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,120
snores so loudly

290
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,960
that you can't sleep at night?

291
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,870
That after work,

292
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,480
he leaves his clothes and socks everywhere

293
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,320
and refuses to do housework?

294
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,150
Your place is a mess!

295
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,790
Grandpa,

296
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,720
you're surprisingly open-minded.

297
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,550
I was young once too.

298
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,670
Love...

299
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,030
is blind.

300
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,620
Haoan

301
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,910
has always kept things to himself

302
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,390
since he was little.

303
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,960
You've been through a lot.

304
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,360
Be patient with him.

305
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,910
I will, Grandpa.

306
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,510
What happened here?

307
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,750
When did it get so tidy?

308
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,030
I made extra porridge.

309
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,910
Help me finish it.

310
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,150
I'll just have cereal.

311
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,960
I'm heading out.

312
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,870
I can't get used to all this.

313
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,030
Going back to how things were

314
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,360
might be the best choice.

315
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,630
If I get used to his presence...

316
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,840
maybe...

317
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,630
one day, it'll all disappear.

318
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,510
Morning, Yifan.

319
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,390
Morning.

320
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,150
This is the breakfast

321
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,840
I specially prepared

322
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,720
to share with you.

323
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,840
I already ate. Have it on your own.

324
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,840
Come on, help me out.

325
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
It's too much for me alone.

326
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,900
I can't finish it.

327
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,240
Good morning.

328
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,750
Morning.

329
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,550
Are you having breakfast?

330
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,360
Try some.

331
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,670
He made too much.

332
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,390
How about let Su Tian finish it for you?

333
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,670
Great. I haven't eaten yet.

334
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,390
Then I'll trouble you, Su Tian.

335
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,000
You're pregnant. You should eat more nutritious food.

336
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,870
Thank you!

337
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,510
Um...

338
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,120
Yifan.

339
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,270
I want to apologize.

340
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,400
Yesterday...

341
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,390
did I disturb you and Senior Sang?

342
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,630
A little.

343
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,270
But I just don't get it.

344
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,150
He's so cold and distant.

345
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,390
Yifan,

346
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,240
why do you force yourself to live with him?

347
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,580
You deserve

348
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,790
a better roommate.

349
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,030
I don't feel forced.

350
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,000
Maybe I'm just used to it.

351
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,800
Yifan,

352
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,750
director Shen from the finance department is looking for you.

353
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,350
Got it.

354
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,070
Morning.

355
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,960
- Chengyun, have you eaten? - Morning.

356
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,400
I bought two servings.

357
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,640
- Want to share? - Yifan.

358
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,920
I hope you know

359
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,350
how to take care of yourself.

360
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,510
You need to open your eyes

361
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,480
and see who truly cares about you.

362
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,720
Don't always assume it's normal for people to push you around.

363
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,790
That's a bad habit. You should break it.

364
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,830
Alright.

365
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,240
Thanks for your concern.

366
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,070
Also...

367
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,640
I think I can tell

368
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,200
what's actually a bad habit.

369
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,590
Mr. Shen.

370
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,070
I sent the interview outline

371
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,960
for Wanda Corporation to your email last night.

372
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,270
I've assigned Zhen Yu from your team

373
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,480
to handle the interview.

374
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,510
Is there an issue with my outline?

375
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,200
I heard about what happened

376
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,550
at Yihe Daily.

377
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,480
Even though that's your personal matter,

378
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,680
Chairman Cao of Wanda

379
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,240
used it as a reason to reject you.

380
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,070
You should head back for now.

381
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,000
Step aside!

382
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,270
You're Wen Yifan, right?

383
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,200
People

384
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,070
all have emotions and desires.

385
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,480
But I won't criticize you here.

386
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,680
Yifan, what's wrong?

387
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,960
You look so upset.

388
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,590
Yifan,

389
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,200
are you okay?

390
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,070
Got it.

391
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,160
Yifan,

392
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,920
the security guard downstairs

393
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,110
said someone is looking for you.

394
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,550
This is the last time I'm coming here.

395
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,110
I don't want to see...

396
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,680
any of you ever again.

397
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,440
What do you want from me?

398
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,480
Jiang!

399
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,750
I sent you a message before.

400
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,880
Did you see it?

401
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,720
Your aunt has already gone back to Beiyu.

402
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,680
That day,

403
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,790
I didn't think it through.

404
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,640
How did you get in?

405
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,280
I won't let her come to my house anymore...

406
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,270
How did you get in?

407
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
I'm your mother.

408
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,510
Does that mean my feelings don't matter to you?

409
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,830
Jiang,

410
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,270
I talked to your aunt recently.

411
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,830
About what happened before,

412
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,790
I wasn't there for you,

413
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,880
I didn't know the details.

414
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,350
So, I didn't take your side.

415
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,550
I was wrong.

416
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,480
Is that so?

417
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,400
I always thought

418
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,960
they took good care of you.

419
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,000
I felt reassured.

420
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,480
At that time,

421
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,160
I wanted to bring you back.

422
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,000
But I was afraid that moving around too much

423
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,310
would affect your college entrance exams.

424
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,480
How could I not be angry?

425
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,640
He was just drunk

426
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,070
and went into the wrong room.

427
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,000
She just randomly put this accusation on him!

428
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,350
I thought...

429
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,160
after some time, things would settle.

430
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,790
Once you got into college in Nanwu,

431
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,240
I could take better care of you.

432
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,590
I have to go now.

433
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,350
Uncle Zheng drove me here.

434
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,270
He's still waiting outside.

435
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,310
I can't make him wait too long.

436
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,590
I'll call you later.

437
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,350
Call her later?

438
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,510
Are you trying to run away?

439
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
I never expected

440
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,350
you'd end up going to Yihe University,

441
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,480
a place far away.

442
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,270
If I returned to Nanwu, would you have lived with me?

443
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,510
Jiang,

444
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,160
I'll make it up to you.

445
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,550
Okay?

446
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,110
Please...

447
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,550
don't be mad at me anymore.

448
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,550
Is there anything else you need to say?

449
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,510
I have to work now.

450
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,200
I brought you

451
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,440
some of your favorite food.

452
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,790
You're too thin. Take it.

453
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,830
No need. Thanks.

454
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,030
Jiang.

455
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,750
Jiang!

456
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,370
Take it, okay?

457
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,920
I already brought it. Just keep it.

458
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,580
[Clear chat history]

459
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,740
[Are you sure you want to delete the chat with Zhao Yuandong?]

460
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,740
[Are you sure you want to delete the chat with Zhao Yuandong? Delete]

461
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,960
Mr. Gan,

462
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,590
we've worked together for so many years.

463
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,290
You know what kind of person I am.

464
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:23,960
I can't hear you.

465
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,350
I'm someone

466
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,200
who means what I say.

467
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,880
I don't do things carelessly.

468
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,030
I came to see you today

469
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,960
mainly about Wen Yifan.

470
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,000
Wen Yifan's affair

471
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,510
is spreading like wildfire

472
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,790
throughout the department.

473
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,590
Yifan.

474
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,570
- Everyone knows. - Hello.

475
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,980
- Hey... - Do you think she's a mistress...

476
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,400
come with me to the restroom.

477
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,880
- or was she just kept by someone? - Let me put my stuff down first.

478
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,030
No need. Let's go.

479
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,590
I never thought

480
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,030
Wen Yifan was that kind of person.

481
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,110
She's actually a mistress.

482
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,640
She offended a client.

483
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,400
Now the advertising department is blaming us.

484
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,350
How do you expect me to explain this?

485
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,880
I'm so sick of these rumors.

486
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,240
Excuse me.

487
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,200
And you,

488
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,550
just sent her to my team

489
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,590
to build connections without a word.

490
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,830
You know

491
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,030
that the companies I interview

492
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,070
for the finance column

493
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,510
are all potential clients.

494
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,310
If I accidentally ruin

495
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,000
my relationship with them,

496
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,510
and the advertising department hold me responsible,

497
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,640
how am I supposed to explain that?

498
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,240
About this matter...

499
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,160
I'm sorry.

500
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,440
Regarding what happened at Yihe Daily,

501
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,070
I've already explained it

502
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,480
to Director Gan and Ms. Qian.

503
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,070
I don't understand

504
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,110
how baseless rumors like this

505
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,110
can spread

506
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,650
in a news department that's supposed

507
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,000
to be fact-based.

508
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,930
Why do I have to take responsibility

509
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,960
for false accusations?

510
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,860
False accusations?

511
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,200
If we, as journalists,

512
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,960
don't pursue the truth,

513
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,680
don't verify facts,

514
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
then how are we any different from gossip tabloids?

515
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,090
Where is our

516
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:00,750
journalistic integrity?

517
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,110
Well said.

518
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,310
That was a great point.

519
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,510
Yifan,

520
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,350
you've worked hard

521
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,270
this past year.

522
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,240
As journalists,

523
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,750
we must have the spirit

524
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,310
to never give up

525
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,830
until we uncover the truth.

526
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,680
But some people

527
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,440
might have forgotten the basics

528
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,400
after working in this field too long,

529
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,720
Isn't that right, Shen?

530
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,110
That's just

531
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,880
how I am.

532
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,110
If someone thinks

533
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,110
I got my position through connections,

534
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,350
then I'll do everything in my power

535
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,830
to prove my ability through my work.

536
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,960
I'll use results to shut them up.

537
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,480
Got it?

538
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,400
Thank you, Mr. Gan.

539
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,310
I'll get back to work now.

540
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,510
Let's head out for fieldwork, Mu Chengyun.

541
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,440
Got it!

542
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,480
Yifan,

543
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,880
you've finally broken your bad habit.

544
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,570
Your bad habit

545
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,750
is always putting yourself last.

546
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,310
But what you just said

547
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,830
was so satisfying to hear.

548
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,830
That was awesome.

549
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,240
You shut those bullies up completely.

550
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,280
Want to get drunk?

551
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,480
No.

552
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,070
This alcohol isn't that strong.

553
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,870
What's wrong?

554
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,480
Did you forget the rule?

555
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,350
If you're not back by ten,

556
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,150
you need to let me know.

557
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,870
I forgot.

558
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,680
Sorry.

559
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,350
I feel like lately, you've been...

560
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,280
a bit distant.

561
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,830
I'm just really tired.

562
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,200
I just want to sleep.

563
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,310
Then sleep...

564
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,100
[The Human Protagonist: Yue Xinghe]

565
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,790
So, you sleepwalk...

566
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,480
when you're in a bad mood

567
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,310
and when you're drunk?

568
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,350
What's going on today?

569
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,590
Hey, are you about to walk out the door?

570
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,960
What are you looking at?

571
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,040
Why are you acting like a creep?

572
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,280

Your room is over there.

576
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,830
Over there.

577

Your room is over there.

00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,590
He didn't come to me.

583
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,680
Does that mean nothing happened?

584
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,200
He can't catch me sleepwalking every time.

585
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,040
I'm getting used

586
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,040
to the breakfast he made.

587
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,000
It's strawberry-flavored, as always.

589

It was a pleasure being interviewed by you.

Really?

591

I used to think journalists were all aggressive.

592

I just hope you felt free to speak openly.

593
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,000
Thank you.

594
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Thanks. You worked hard today.

595

596

Yifan, you did it!

We're not in the service industry.

Isn't the point of an internship

Good work today.

613

Yifan,

614
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,960
are you free after work tomorrow?

It's fine. I'll handle them.

619
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,150
Looks like it's drizzling.

620
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,110
Yifan,

621
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,480
actually,

622
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,000
I know a senior.

623
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,670
He just had a baby girl.

624
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,070
So I want to buy a gift

625
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,110
for his daughter.

626
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,070
But I don't know much about these things.

627
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,320
So I was wondering

628
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,800
if you could come pick one with me.

629
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,040
A daughter?

630
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,150
Then maybe you should ask Zhen Yu.

631
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,670
She has a two-year-old daughter.

632
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,440
She'd know better than I would.

633
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,840
Zhen Yu?

634
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,150
I'm not that close with her.

635
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,920
No worries. I can ask her for you.

636
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,480
Let's go.

637
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,970
Yifan, wait a second.

638
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,440
I see something

639
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,880
on your neck.

640
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,190
I wanted to clean it off for you.

641
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,920
Sorry.

642
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,070
It was just instinct.

643
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,360
Did I hurt you?

644
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,590
It's fine.

645
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,750
I just didn't expect

646
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,000
such a big reaction from you.

647
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,840
I don't like physical contact.

648
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,630
Sorry.

649

650
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,440

651

What brings you here?

652
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,520
I came to see my brother.

653
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,960
I think he's not back yet.

654
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,710

660
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,270
I did great.

661
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,670
Which university did you pick?

662
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Yihe University.

663
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,710
Yihe University?

664
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,070
That's pretty far away.

665
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Are you sure?

666
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,920
I'm sure.

667
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,800
I thought about it for a long time.

668
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,000
Compared to Nanwu University,

669
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,520
the program I want

670
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,920
is better at Yihe University.

671
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,550
And I don't really want

672
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,800
to stay in Nanwu forever.

673
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,630
I'd like to explore other cities too.

674
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,840
That sounds nice.

675
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,040
But my brother doesn't seem happy about it.

676
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,550
Why?

677
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,070
Honestly,

678
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,150
I didn't really talk to him about it.

679
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,550
I only discussed it with my parents.

680
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,550
So he always assumed

681
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,000
I was applying to Nanwu University.

682
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,920
He only found out about Yihe University recently

683
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,230
and started blaming me.

By the way, Yifan,

do you know who my brother's

691
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,880
rumored high school crush was?

692
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,550
I don't really know.

693
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,400
Why ask about this all of a sudden?

694
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,480
Because I feel like,

695
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,230
in my memory,

696
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,920
he looks just as upset now

697
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,000
as he did back when the results came out.

698
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,710
He shut himself in for days,

699
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,550
ignoring everyone.

700
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,150
I think he got dumped.

701
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,880
I feel like my brother

702
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,070
really liked that girl.

703
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Back then,

704
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,270
his grades weren't great.

705
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,720
In his second year of high school,

706
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,190
he suddenly changed,

707
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,110
doing nothing but studying.

708
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,190
My parents were so happy.

709
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,480
They thought he finally grew up.

710
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,670
I bet someone had been encouraging him.

711
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,960
I think it was that girl he liked.

712
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,440
What are you talking about?

713
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,440

715
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,440
I should've told you earlier about choosing Yihe University.

716
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,190
That was my mistake.

717
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,040
But I did well

718
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,630
