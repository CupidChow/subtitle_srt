00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,490
You argued with him

I won't survive!

289
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,940
Sis, please. I'm begging you.

290
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,810
Sis, please.

291
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,700
I'll even kneel to you.

292
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,420
I'm begging you.

293
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,250
Please!

294
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,380
Please help me!

295
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,570
Mom and Dad are gone.

296
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,530
You're my only hope!

to all those girls I hurt.

301
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,140
I couldn't control myself,

302
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,180
and I turned their youth into a nightmare.

303
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,220
The crimes I've committed...

304
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,980
are unforgivable.

305
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,420
I deserve death.

306
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,900
I plead guilty.

307
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,620
This court declares:

308
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,050

It's really over.

337
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,980
It's time to leave it behind in my life, too.

It took me so long

00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:53,860
Will you go?

378
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,810
I don't plan to.

379
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,050
Want to eat?

380
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,330
Of course.

381
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,460
Ouch, my hand

382
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,730
really is...

383
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,270
Earthly Delights: Linlong Market

384
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,770
Guo Ling's dad

385
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,180
called me again today.

386
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,490
What did he say?

387
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,420
He said,

388
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,770
he appreciates my honest reporting

389
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,050
and the effort I put in.

390
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,380
Something along those lines.

391
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,770
But I just see it as my job.

392
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,620
Those aren't mutually exclusive.

393
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,090
It's your job,

394
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,770
but people can still thank you.

395
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,770
Actually, I used to...

396
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,660
not really like being a reporter.

397
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,530
Why not?

398
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,220
It's not about the industry.

399
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,730
I just felt nothing mattered

400
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,980
except dancing.

401
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,290
Then why did you go to grad school?

402
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,770
To better myself.

403
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,940
Those are two separate things.

404
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,810
Maybe you started liking this job.

405
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,530
Sang Yan,

406
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,900
have you ever thought about this?

407
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,530
If one day we could go somewhere

408
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,050
no one knows us,

409
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,380
even change our names,

410
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,860
could we forget the past

411
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,700
and start fresh?

412
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,460
Is that

413
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,490
why you left without telling me twice?

414
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,090
The first time, I didn't know how to handle things.

415
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,140
I thought you deserved someone better.

416
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,220
What about the second time?

417
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,700
Regarding the second time...

418
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,530
I thought if I left,

419
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,770
he wouldn't have any reason to hurt you.

420
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,420
I get it.

421
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,810
You wanted to protect me.

422
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,010
But later,

423
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,420
I also sympathized

424
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,860
with those who wanted to vanish.

425
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,460
Maybe only by doing that

426
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,140
could they find courage to start again.

427
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,090
If that's true,

428
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,220
then I should thank you

429
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,810
for your time in Hong Kong, China.

430
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,010
The only thing I couldn't let go of...

431
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,860
was you.

432
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,770
I know.

433
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,330
Know what?

434
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,050
That you can't get over me,

435
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,090
and that I'm amazing.

436
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,860
You're still so cocky.

437
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,010
Wen Shuangjiang,

438
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,330
do you want to dance again?

439
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,250
If we went back a few years,

440
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,700
probably yes.

441
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,570
And now?

442
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,420
Now...

443
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,010
After finishing the article

444
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,290
on Che Xingde's case last night,

445
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,490
and then getting a call

446
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,730
from Guo Ling's dad today,

447
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,140
I suddenly realized

448
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,810
I really love being a reporter.

449
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,570
As long as you're happy.

450
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,810
From now on,

451
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,460
you'll only dance for me.

452
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,380
That's great, too.

453
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,940
Did you always love watching me dance?

454
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,050
You just realized?

455
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,980
And what if I stop dancing now?

456
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,570
So what?

457
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,330
I like you no matter what.

458
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,980
What do you want to eat?

459
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,730
I just saw...

460
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,090
I'll take this.

461
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,570
Hi, one pack, please.

462
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,070
[Nougat Candy]

463
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,700
Thank you.

464
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,180
I've paid. Thanks.

465
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,010
The packaging is pretty nice.

466
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,220
Want some?

467
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,660
Then I'll have one.

468
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,460
It tastes pretty good.

469
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,090
It's not too sweet, and very milky.

470
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,460
Your standards for good candy are weird.

471
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,140
"Not sweet"?

472
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,570
Let me try it.

473
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,900
You tricked me.

474
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,660
This is sweet enough.

475
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,980
You need to chew it, too.

476
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,900
It's nougat.

477
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,140
Chew it to taste the milkiness.

478
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,530
It has nothing to do with chewing.

479
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,810
Get it?

480
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,140
What are you looking for?

481
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,730
Oh right,

482
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,010
the landlady said

483
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,730
she wants the place back.

484
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,180
We have to move out by next March.

485
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,420
Next March?

486
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,180
So we only have

487
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,570
six more months of dating.

488
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,420
Huh?

489
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:12,900
What?

490
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,010
Aren't we doing fine?

491
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,090
How come we only have six months left?

492
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,530
What are you thinking?

493
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,940
Is that what I meant?

494
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,010
Why do you talk in riddles now?

495
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,050
I've never paid attention to other couples.

496
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,770
Usually,

497
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,530
how long do people date

498
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,460
before getting married?

499
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,220
Usually pretty quick,

500
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,810
days or weeks even.

501
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,220
We're already pretty slow.

502
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,490
Way too slow.

503
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,700
Then let's date another year or two.

504
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,050
You want it longer, huh?

505
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,730
Sure,

506
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,180

probably yes.

I'm saying this

because I want

525
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,570
to stay with you forever.

526
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,130
Aside from changing your boyfriend,

527
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,980
I'll support you

528
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,090

We still have plenty of time.

532
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,340
It's never too late

533
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,380
to start anything.

534
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,740
Just do whatever you want.

535
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,570
Got it?

536
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,820
Sang Yan,

537
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,260
I'm different now.

538
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,050
I used to be weak,

539
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,340
with no one to rely on.

540
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,610
But now,

541
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,210
I can do whatever I want,

542
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,780
without worrying about others.

543
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,490
Because I have you now.

544
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,940
And I've realized

545
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,340
I truly like being a journalist.

546
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,940
I've dedicated myself to this job

547
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,090

to do something else,

550
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,130
I'd feel unhappy about it.

551
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,570
And I can be like you.

552
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,010

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,570
right here.

570
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,130
Yifan,

571
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,380
Mr. Gan asked you to see him.

572
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,340
Got it.

573
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,690
What did she say?

574
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,740
Mr. Gan asked for me.

575
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,940
You try it first.

576
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,740
If there's any problem,

577
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,610
I'll help you when I'm back.

578
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,610
Last year's event

579
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,820
was okay,

580
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,050
but we can't do the same thing every year.

581
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,380
Mr. Gan.

582
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,210
Come in.

583
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,050
You wanted me?

584
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,980
Yifan,

585
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,010
you studied dance for ten years, right?

586
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,090
The annual party is coming soon,

587
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,340
so prepare a performance

588
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,380
and bring honor to our First News team.

589
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,980
But I haven't danced properly

590
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,170
in a long time.

591
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,210
No worries.

592
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,490
It's all about participation.

593
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,340
Please help us out, Yifan.

594
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,610
Just one performance.

595
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,490
I'm afraid I won't have time to practice,

596
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,940
plus there are a lot of reports coming up.

597
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,820
No pressure,

598
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,900
just add to the atmosphere.

599
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,420
Put Yifan down for a performance.

600
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,210
Got it.

601
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,010
Alright,

602
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,130
you can get back to work now.

603
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,300
I'm your brother.

604
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,010
I've eaten more salt than...

605
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,130
than you have.

606
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,460
Why don't Mom and Dad approve?

607
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,130
What do you think? Why wouldn't they?

608
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,210
Honestly,

609
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,650
well...

610
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,010
he is a bit older.

611
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,050
Don't get mad. It's just the truth.

612
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,260
Was that Zhi?

613
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,780
What's wrong?

614
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,380
She said

615
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,380
she wants to bring Duan Jiaxu home for New Year holiday,

616
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,490
but our parents don't approve.

617
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,210
Why not?

618
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,170
They think he's too old.

619
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,300
Really?

620
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,010
Well, he is from the older generation.

621
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,340
How about...

622
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,570
coming home with me

623
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,050
this New Year holiday?

624
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,380
But what if your parents

625
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,050
also disapprove of us?

626
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,900
My parents don't have many requirements

627
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,740
for my partner.

628
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,940
Any girl will do.

629
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,210
Say that again!

630
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,530
So, are you free on the 22nd?

631
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,090
The 22nd?

632
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,170
What's up?

633
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,260
My station is holding a year-end party.

634
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,690
I'm singing with Su Tian.

635
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,300
They said we could bring...

636
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,210
bring family.

637
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,610
Family?

638
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,460
Then your family member has time.

639
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:05,860
On the 22nd, right?

640
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,420
Su Tian, are you ready?

641
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,260
Almost.

642
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,170
Maybe use my phone if you can't fix it.

643
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,330
No way.

644
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,260
We need something professional.

645
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:27,820
Yifan, how's it going?

646
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,420
Are you ready yet?

647
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,260
Almost.

648
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,780
Okay.

649
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,570
Get ready.

They told you, family should stay outside.

653
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,460
They kept saying it.

654
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,170
But you insisted on watching.

655
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,340
Doctor,

656
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,420
how's the recovery?

657
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,490
Pretty good so far.

658
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,650
The wound is healing well,

659
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,570
no obvious swelling.

660
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,300
But I'd suggest

661
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,530
coming next week for another check-up,

662
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,980
to see how it's healing

663
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,420
and decide about removing stitches.

664
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,010
