00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,200
Where's my top?

187
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,550
Did you hide it?

188
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,480
What about my clothes then?

189
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,080
Stop running around my house!

190
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,640
Your place is such a mess.

191
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,550
That's why I told you not to run around.

192
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,480
How did I even get in here?

193
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,390
See?

194
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,030
Please explain

195
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,600
why you're following me.

196
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,840
The driver made me get out of the car.

197
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,720
Wasn't it you who brought me back to your place?

198
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,320
You were throwing up so badly.

199
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,440
[The main entrance to the Upper District]
I just helped you up.

200
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,550
I didn't want you to come with me.

201
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,090
You could have just let me sleep there.

202
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,510
Why did you help me?

203
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,600
Do you think I'm that kind of person?

204
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,750
Of course, I had to help you up,

205
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,550
but I didn't expect you

206
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,670
to cling to me.

[Outside the elevator]

208
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,200
Why did you carry me on your back?

209
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,320
I never said I would carry you.

210
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,120
You got on my back by yourself.

211
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,510
Show me the proof.

212
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,960
- Why are you blaming me? - Keep playing.

213
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,600
Keep playing.

214
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
You even asked me to dance.

215
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,000
Look at yourself.

[Inside the elevator]

217
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,670
Honestly,

218
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,600
from what I saw on the footage,

219
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,550
it looked like a mutual thing.

220
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,360
So, why is it

221
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,200
no longer mutual now?

222
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,390
None of your business.

223
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,550
Just keep watching.

224
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,060
[Outside the elevator on the third floor]

225
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,290
Bye.

after you closed the door

is out of our hands.

231
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,000
We didn't do anything.

232

Help yourself.

233
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,750
Dig in.

234
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,390
Why aren't you eating?

235

You...

236
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,270
Is it not to your taste?

237
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,200
No.

238
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,390
I'll eat it.

239
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,960
We've cleared up the misunderstanding.

On the right.

How do you open this door?

247
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,840
It's probably because of the dry weather lately.

248
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,720
Thanks.

255
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,790
Xiang Lang?

256
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,160
Didn't I ask you to hide?

257
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,510
Now there's no surprise.

258
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,440
It's still a surprise.

259
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
Qiao, how come

260
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,880
you didn't even tell me?

261
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,830
I told you before, okay?

262
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,030
I've told you several times

263
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,000
that he's coming back.

264
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,720
You just didn't listen to me properly.

265
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,590
I might have accidentally forgotten.

266
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,070
Where are you guys now?

267
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,030
At the airport.

268
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,110
I originally thought of

269
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,920
asking you to come pick him up with me,

270
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,640
but they said they were worried about you being busy with work

271
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,240
and didn't want you to get up so early.

272
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,480

273
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,510

00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,310
We definitely should.

Since we're roommates,

305
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,550
you can help bring in more customers.

Has your business gotten so bad

307
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,510
that you need to personally bring in customers?

308
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,070
I've told you before that it's not making much money.

309
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,640
We have to find ways to promote it

310
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,440

I can give you a roommate discount.

What's the discount?

314
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,820

318
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,830
How generous.

319
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,480
I'll consider it.

320
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,270

What do you mean?

329
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,400
I just mean the sign isn't obvious,

330
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,880
and it doesn't really look like a place to eat.

331
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,000
It looks more like a barbershop.

332
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,480
But of course,

333
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,030
that's just my personal opinion.

334
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,110
No need to take it to heart.

335

I got it.

340
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,070
I'll think about your comment,

341
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,550
but I won't change it.

342

Since she's my roommate,

346
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,750
I didn't feel right saying no,

347
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,240
so I ended up buying these low-quality products from her.

348

Isn't that taking advantage of me, too?

353

She swindled all my savings away.

I worked for two years to earn that money.

What's the rush?

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,640
Sorry, I'll go find someone to clean this up.

374
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,550
Is that necessary?

375
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,920
Everyone knows what you are like.

376
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,720
Let's go.

377
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,310
Wen,

378
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,750
you've seen the newspaper today, right?

379
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,270
Your article wasn't included.

380
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,830
Sorry, sir.

381
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,880
I'll keep trying my best.

382
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,960
It's actually quite simple.

383
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,070
Do you know

384
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,160
where

385
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,030
the problem lies?

386
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,720
I know,

387
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
but I can't do it.

388
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Also, please don't text me

389
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,200
in the middle of the night anymore.

390
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,550
Yifan,

391
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,550
why are you here alone?

392
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,830
Are you okay?

393
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,160
Or have you heard about it?

394
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,070
Heard about what?

395
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,440
Lately, everyone's been gossiping about you.

396
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,200
They say when you were at Yihe Daily,

397
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,970
the boss's wife came after you,

398
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,780
and then the local press blacklisted you.

399
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,640
You couldn't handle it anymore,

400
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,310
so you secretly returned to Nanwu.

401
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,070
Those who spread rumors really overestimate me,

402
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,550
saying I was blacklisted.

403
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,160
Pretty girls always get caught up in rumors like this.

404
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,480
I've told them that it's definitely not true.

405
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,750
You should go explain it to them quickly.

406
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,790
Do you think they'll believe me even if I explain?

407
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,510
You vixen, wait and see how I deal with you today.

408
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,440
Get out of the way!

409
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,830
You're Wen Yifan, aren't you?

410
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,270
You vixen.

411
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,270
You're the one who sent late-night messages

412
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,310
to flirt with my husband, right?

413
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,110
Shameless!

414
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,310
You shameless wretch!

415
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
What are you doing with your phone?

416
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,160
Let me tell you.

417
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,360
I won't believe a word you say today!

418
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,270
Take a good look.

419
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,590
It's your husband who's been sending me messages,

420
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,030
and I've never replied with anything inappropriate.

421
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,310
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

422
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,830
You'll see

423
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,110
how I deal with you today.

424
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,640
It takes two to tango.

425
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,680
Keep this up, and you'll make the headlines.

426
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,920
It's clearly the wrongdoer's fault,

427
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,480
yet the victim

428
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,650
bears the blame.

429
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,720
Do you really believe

430
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,480
those words were said unconsciously because he was drunk?

431
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,480
I'll write an investigation report and send it

432
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,720
to the president

433
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,960
and the newly formed supervisory committee.

434
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,830
However, I'm not sure

435
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,350
what the result will be.

436
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,510
Why?

437
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,310
He must have his side of the story.

438
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,680
After all, this isn't the first time.

439
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,000
But if you don't say anything,

440
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,920
they'll assume you're admitting it.

441
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,160
Whether I admit it or not,

442
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,590
they'll only believe

443
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,960
what they want to believe.

444
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,680
Rumors are like wounds.

445
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,440
If you don't pay attention to them,

446
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,400
they'll stop hurting after a while.

447
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,890
Don't worry about me.

448
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,550
I'm fine.

449
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,480
What time is it now?

450
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,680
It's almost three o'clock.

451
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,030
I'll go out for an interview now.

452
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,750
All right, Mr. Chen, let's get started.

453
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,350
Could you walk us through

454
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,070
what happened during the incident?

455
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,480
That night,

456
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,750
my daughter was helping me out

457
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,880
at the snack stall after school.

458
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,550
Three men at a table were drunk.

459
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,750
My daughter's only sixteen,

460
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,790
but they kept harassing her.

461
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,640
At that moment, all I could think

462
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,310
was if they laid a finger on her,

463
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,000
I'd...

464
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:49,270
Dad.

465
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,160
- Are you okay? - Dad.

466
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,030
- Careful. - I'm fine.

467
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,310
Are you all right, Dad?

468
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,920
It's all my fault.

469
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,350
You are hurt because of me.

470
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,920
This injury's nothing.

471
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,030
I'd be heartbroken

472
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,550
if I hadn't kept you safe.

473
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,680
It's because of me.

474
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,350
It's all my fault.

475
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,240
It's not your fault.

476
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,960
Yifan,

477
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,350
this child is only sixteen.

478
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,070
Yet their family had to go through such an ordeal.

479
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,480
It's like misfortune always targets the most vulnerable.

480
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,000
But I filmed everything that happened just now.

481
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,310
That kid was crying, and it was heartbreaking.

482
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,790
Wen Yifan?

483
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
It really is you.

484
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,590
How come you're back in Nanwu?

485
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,350
I moved back to Nanwu.

486
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,110
- Yifan, maybe I should... - No need.

487
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,240
We're busy right now.

488
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,310
Let's get in touch later.

489
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,400
Who do you think you are?

490
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,830
Who wants to get in touch with you?

491
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,030
Yifan, how about I go back to the car first and sort things out?

492
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,720
You guys can chat.

493
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,200
Thank you.

494
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,160
Why are you back if there's nothing wrong?

495
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,400
Why can't I come back even if nothing's wrong?

496
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,750
I didn't mean it that way.

497
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,240
Don't worry,

498
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,310
I won't be staying at your place now that I'm back in Nanwu.

499
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,240
Let's just pretend we never met today.

500
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,880
As long as you don't say anything, no one will know.

501
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,240
I never said you couldn't come to my place.

502
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,270
You didn't.

503
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,900
Why are you being so annoying?

504
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,440
Fine.

505
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,510
I was at fault back then.

506
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,270
I was young and didn't know better.

507
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,270
I was wrong to ask you to leave my house.

508
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:29,830
All right.

509
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,480
I don't want to bring up the past,

510
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,070
nor do I think we need to catch up.

511
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,070
That stuff is heavy, right?

512
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,550
Go check on the patient.

513
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,830
Will you go back home for the Spring Festival?

514
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,000
I have to work during the Spring Festival.

515
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,030
All right, let's add each other on WeChat.

516
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,590
No need.

517
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,070
I just want to live my own life.

518
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:49,880
You...

519
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,480
My return to Nanwu has nothing to do with anyone.

520
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,790
I won't stay at your place,

521
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,510
and it's not because I'm afraid of you.

522
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,550
Every decision I make is for myself.

523
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,110
I'm actually busy. I'll get going now.

524
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,440
Dad, look.

525
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,030
It's snowing outside.

526
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,000
It really is snowing.

527
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,590
Pretty, isn't it?

528
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,350
Yes.

529
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,310
Isn't it lovely?

530
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,270
It is.

531
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,030
Are you happy?

532
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,720
Yes.

533
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,070
Let's have a snowball fight later.

534
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,240
It's snowing.

535
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,640
It's snowing.

536
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,240
Let me lift you up.

537
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,810
Jiang, do you know

538
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,520
how you got your nickname?

539
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,460
I don't.

540
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,450
It's because

541
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,550
you were born

542
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,110
on the day of Frost's Descent.

543
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,070
What exactly is Frost's Descent?

544
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,680
Frost's Descent happens

545
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,440
in late September of the lunar calendar,

546
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,960
when the sun

547
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,030
is farther away

548
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,310
from Earth.

549
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,880
It's the day

550
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,400
with the largest temperature difference

551
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,510
between day and night,

552
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,000
making the night

553
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,750
particularly cold.

554
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,920
But I'm afraid of the cold.

555
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,640
Don't be afraid, Jiang,

556
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
I'm here.

Wen Yifan,

571
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,120
I have a little flaw

572
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,960
about me.

573
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,590
Only one?

574
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,200
I'm very safety-conscious.

575
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,560
If I don't lock the door before going to bed,

576
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,680
I can't sleep.

577
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,350
I always lock the door.

578
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,310
If you're tired, go ahead and sleep.

579
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,000
I'll lock it if I get back late.

580
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,960
I'm talking about before sleeping.

581
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,410
I remember telling you explicitly

582
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,830
before we started sharing the apartment

583
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,200
that I frequently work overtime

584
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,920
and have an irregular routine. You agreed to it.

585
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,070
Then please let me know

586
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,880
in advance

587
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,720
if you're coming back after 10 p.m.

588
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,070
Why?

589
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,110
It's a matter of mutual respect.

590
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,000
If you don't come back all night,

591
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,720
wouldn't I

592
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,480
have to spend the night in anxiety and fear?

593
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,720
I'll let you know next time.

594
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,070
Can I go rest now?

595
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,730
Who is he?

596
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,240
I forgot to tell you.

597
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:42,830
He's my friend.

598
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,440
Hi,

599
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,880
I am Duan Jiaxu.

600
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,680
I heard from Su Haoan

601
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,450
that Sang Yan didn't date a single girl during his four years at university.

602
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,930
He spent all his time hanging out with a campus heartthrob

603
00:31:58,930 --> 00:31:59,960
named Duan Jiaxu.

604
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,640
Duan Jiaxu,

605
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,550
I've heard a lot about you.

606
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,400
I also have a flaw:

607
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,270
my safety awareness is stronger than someone else's,

608
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,310
and I remember we have a contract clause.

609
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,310
I don't quite recall.

610
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,920
You should inform me in advance before bringing friends home.

611
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,400
All right.

612
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,350
I remember now.

613
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,070
I'm sorry.

614
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,750
It's okay.

615
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,750
We're still getting used

616
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,270
to living together,

617
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,270
so small mistakes are excusable.

618
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,640
I'll let it slide this time.

619
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,920
You two catch up.

620
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,350
I told you to leave earlier, but you didn't listen.

621
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,880
You even spilled food on your clothes.

622
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,680
So, where do you think we should go on Thursday?

623
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,550
How about Overtime?

624
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,790
It's opened by Sang Yan.

625
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,920
Sang Yan?

626
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,310
You are still in touch?

627
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,160
I only met him recently,

628
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,310
and it was at his gastropub.

629
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,440
So, uh,

630
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,720
I need to tell you something.

631
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,240
Remember I told you I have a roommate?

632
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,640
Well, that roommate

633
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,550
is Sang Yan.

634
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,100
He said if we go to his place, he'll give us a discount.

635
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,580
You're actually sharing a place with Sang Yan?

636
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,480
And what discount do we get?

637
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,920
Let's talk about it when we meet.

638
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,370
I still have to get some work done tonight.

639
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,180
I'm going to log off now.

640
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Wait. How much of a discount are we getting?

641
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,400
1 percent.

642
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,830
1 percent?

643
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,590
I'll log off now. Bye.

644
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,000
Wait, did I hear that right?

645
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,900
Is a 1 percent discount still considered a discount?

646
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,270
Let's go with Dian's choice this time.

647
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,240
We've always picked the places before.

648
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,640
It's rare for her to have an opinion.

649
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,070
You're totally on her side, huh?

650
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,510
Wait until we meet,

651
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,440
I'll crack open her brain

652
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,790
and see what's going on in there.

653
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,790
Why would she share a place with Sang Yan?

654
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,750
I really don't get it.

655
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,160
It's getting late, Qiao.

656
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,550
You should go to bed now.

657
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,110
All right, then.

658
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:03,920
Goodnight.

659
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,640
Night.

660
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,000
Hello.

661
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,440
Dian, are you ready?

662
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,190
We're here.

663
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,070
You are already here?

664
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,480
So soon? Just give me a moment.

665
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,030
The car isn't allowed to enter,

666
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,190
so I've just parked it at the entrance.

667
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,290
All right, I just finished washing the clothes.

668
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,570
I'll be out as soon as I hang them up.

669
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,840
It's okay. No rush.

670
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,630
Take your time.

671
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,020
Who says there's no rush?

672
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,960
I'm about to die of hunger.

673
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,070
Dian, hurry up.

674
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,250
I'll save your life in a minute. Got to go now.

675
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,670
Hey,

676
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,550
did you save a spot for us at Overtime?

677
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,030
We're going to eat first.

678
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,960
We'll be at Overtime around eight.

679
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,320
Are you heading out too?

680
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,360
When did you change your clothes?

681
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,880
Are you going to the garage?

682
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:23,800
Well...

683
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,480
We haven't reached the basement level yet.

684
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,400
This is the first floor.

685
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:40,020
[Uptown Flower City]

686
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,710
Let's go.

687
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,480
Dian.

688
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,630
Dian.

689
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,840
It's been a while.

690
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:49,880
It's been a while.

691
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,440
Why are you two acting shy?

692
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,360
The Nanwu Trio is finally united.

693
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,190
From now on, we'll overcome all obstacles and be invincible.

694
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,630
Who is this?

695
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,510
Is this your boyfriend?

696
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,920
What boyfriend?

697
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,920
This is Xiang Lang.

698
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:12,800
Xiang Lang.

699
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,710
I remember.

700
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,360
You are from Class 15.

701
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:16,840
Yes.

702
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,710
- I'm Su Haoan. - Hi.

703
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,230
Sang Yan.

704
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:22,960
Long time no see.

705
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,590
Didn't we agree that you'd drive your car?

706
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,480
I can't be bothered to drive.

707
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,550
I drove here.

708
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:38,880
Where do you need to go?

709
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,190
It's fine.

710
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,480
We'll just find somewhere to eat.

711
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,630
Didn't you guys already make plans?

712
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,360
You can go ahead.

713
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,880
We really haven't met in a long time.

714
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,880
We should definitely catch up.

715
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,800
It's been a while since we last met as well.

716
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,960
Why make such a big deal of it?

717
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,880
You're not really close with them.

718
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,150
Even if we're not close, we can still catch up,

719
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,800
right?

720
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,320
Yeah. So you want to go with them, right?

721
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,670
Is it all right?

722
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,610
I don't think so.

723
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,800
I think it's pretty all right.

724
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:06,760
Where's your car?

725
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,800
Open the door.

726
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,510
Yes, boss.

727
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,630
It's amazing how fate works.

728
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,410
You haven't seen a friend in seven or eight years,

729
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,320
and then you just run into them like this.

730
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,640
If Sang Yan and Wen Yifan can be roommates,

731
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,000
what else is impossible?

732
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,400
Since there are so many of us,

733
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,630
I'll tidy up the car first.

734
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,480
I'll help you.

735
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,190
I know

736
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,960
this is definitely something worth bragging about.

737
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,440
What are you talking about?

738
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,710
There's no need to bring up

739
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,360
our shared rental to everyone.

740
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,360
We'll manage if the five of us squeeze a bit.

741
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,800
This should be all right.

742
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,450
Dian, you sit in the passenger seat

743
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,260
and help me with the navigation.

744
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,550
My legs are too long.

745
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,670
It's uncomfortable sitting in the back.

746
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:04,960
You can just go straight.

747
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:09,920
Okay.

748
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,030
It's fine, I'll sit in the back.

749
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,280
Is that okay?

750
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,110
Sure. No worries.

751
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,510
I can't see the road with you like this.

752
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,030
Well, then pay attention to the road.

753
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Have you got a girlfriend?

754
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,000
No.

755
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,000
I still haven't met the person I like.

756
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,150
I just thought of a rumor.

757
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,190
Sang Yan, Xiang Lang, and Wen Yifan,

758
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,800
they said you three were in a love triangle.

759
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,630
Is it true?

760
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,670
It was all just rumors.

761
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,360
It got passed on

762
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,070
and started to sound like it was real.

763
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:34,880
It simply wasn't true.

764
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,400
What do you mean by "sound like it was real?"

765
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
You're really into gossip and just making things up.

766
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,480
What I'm saying is true.

767
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,000
If you don't believe me, ask Sang Yan.

768
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,070
He even got into a fight over it.

769
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,630
I heard from Zhou Zhiming

770
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,880
that Pretty Face Wen doesn't actually like Sang Yan.

771
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,000
She only got together with him

772
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,190
because he kept pursuing her.

773
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,320
So, when she met someone better,

774
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,710
she immediately cheated.

775
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,190
Who's better?

776
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,880
It's Xiang Lang from the class next door.

777
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,800
If I didn't tell you,

778
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,920
would you think Pretty Face Wen is this kind of person?

779
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,110
It's really quite disgusting.

780
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:21,630
Indeed.

781
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,360
But why?

782
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,840
She thinks being good-looking makes her great.

783
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,400
There are a lot of good-looking people out there.

784
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
Surely they won't all act like this.

785
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,480
Let me tell you this.

786
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,800
With an attitude like yours,

787
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,590
what's the point of being pretty?

788
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:39,670
Apologize.

789
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,360
I'm sorry.

790
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,920
I'm not asking you to apologize.

791
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,710
Zhou Zhiming,

792
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,510
do I need to teach you?

793
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,880
I won't apologize.

794
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,600
I was just joking earlier,

795
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,440
and I'm not the only one saying this.

796
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,440
Joking?

797
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,360
You're a man with such a sharp tongue,

798
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
aren't you embarrassed?

799
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,760
Let me make this clear today.

800
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,510
If anyone dares spread such rumors again,

801
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,190
the consequences will be the same as his.

802
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,630
I don't have many hobbies.

803
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,710
I just like holding grudges.

804
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,190
Talk.

805
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,670
Pretty Face Wen...

806
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,280
No,

807
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,150
Wen Yifan,

808
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,710
I'm sorry.

809
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,510
It was me who told others you were cheating,

810
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,590
but I had no proof.

811
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,710
I was just making things up.

812
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,070
I won't say it again in the future.

813
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,110
Is that enough?

814
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,000
Can you let me go now?

815
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,440
What about me?

816
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,400
Am I not also a victim?

817
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,550
Sang Yan,

818
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,320
I'm sorry.

819
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,630
Why are you a victim?

820
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,760
Can you spread rumors according to the facts?

821
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,110
What do you mean the other person found someone better

822
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,030
and dumped me?

823
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,550
If I were actually pursuing them that hard,

824
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,960
they'd be completely

825
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,480
captivated by me.

826
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,550
Understand?

827
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:05,880
Yes.

828
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,760
Louder.

829
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,150
Yes!

830
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,280
Thank you.

831
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,190
He doesn't even know who's better.

832
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,360
Sang Yan has always been

833
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,880
a stickler for details since he was a kid.

834
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,440
He doesn't talk much,

835
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,590
but whenever he does, he's ready to fight.

836
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,670
He has a terrible temper.

837
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,280
I'm all right.

838
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,190
See? He loves hitting others.

839
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,590
Wen Yifan,

840
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,880
I'm sorry

841
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,960
I didn't tell you in advance

842
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:44,760
about Sang Yan moving in.

843
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,760
I heard it shocked you.

844
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,800
I'll pay for the meal later.

845
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:47,920
No need.

846
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,630
This has nothing to do with you.

847
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:51,670
Sang Yan,

848
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,070
did you know in advance

849
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,400
that your roommate would be Dian?

850
00:43:59,230 --> 00:43:59,840
Yes,

851
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,510
that's why I decided to move in.
