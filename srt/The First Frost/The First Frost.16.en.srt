00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,710
for your gossip today anyway.

378
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,550
See you later.

379
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,640
If you need anything,

380
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,790
feel free to ask me.

381
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,880
Maybe...

382
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,080
Maybe I will have time.

383
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,310
Got it.

384
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,400
See you later.

385
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,270
First Frost (Shuangjiang).

386
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,950
Doesn't that mean Shuangjiang?

387
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,990
Hello, everyone.

388
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,120
My name is Wen Yifan.

389
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,750
My hobby is dancing.

390
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,640
My nickname is Shuangjiang

391
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,360
because the day

392
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,120
I was born was the first frost.

393
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,510
Then my father gave me this nickname.

394
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,400
So he always remembers it.

395
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,040
Wen Shuangjiang.

396
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:53,840
What's up?

397
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,470
Nothing.

398
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,750
So you can hear me.

399
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,790
Shuangjiang.

400
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,030
I suddenly want to fall in love.

401
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:09,990
In love

402
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,600
with Sang Yan.

403
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,360
Hey, Qiao.

404
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,120
♪Happy birthday to you♪

405
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,270
♪Happy birthday to you♪

406
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:53,200
♪Happy birthday to you♪

407
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,640
Dian, happy birthday.

408
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,790
Thank you.

409
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,120
I held off all night

410
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,950
and tried hard to wait until 12:00 to say this.

411
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,640
How's that?

412
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
Am I the first?

413
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,120
Are you free tomorrow?

414
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,360
I'll treat you to dinner.

415
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,640
Are you free now?

416
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:07,920
Right now?

417
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,790
What are you doing tomorrow?

418
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,790
Why does it have to be today?

419
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,840
I have something on my mind.

420
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,080
If I don't

421
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,160
figure it out tonight,

422
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,200
I might not be able to sleep.

423
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,470
What's that?

424
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,310
Why is it so serious?

425
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,640
It's my first time in this situation,

426
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,230
so I don't have much experience.

427
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,080
I want to be straight,

428
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,080
but I'm afraid he'll think

429
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,990
I'm up to something else.

430
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,400
What are you talking about?

431
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,950
Who are you plotting against?

432
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,310
No.

433
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,360
I want

434
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,270
to court Sang Yan.

435
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,840
Really?

436
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:52,980
Keep your voice down.

437
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,120
So

438
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,680
you finally figured it out?

439
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,120
Doing your best to woo him?

440
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
I'm definitely behind you.

441
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,840
Really?

442
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,360
Of course.

443
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,120
Since we met,

444
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,440
I've never heard of you

445
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,510
trying to woo someone.

446
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,360
Actually, I'm glad

447
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,360
you told me that.

448
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,360
We're close,

449
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,360
but you never share

450
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,710
what's on your mind with me.

451
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,230
I'm sorry.

452
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,160
I didn't blame you.

453
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,310
Tell me.

454
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,750
Do you have any plans to court Sang Yan?

455
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,840
I don't have any,

456
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,160
so I wanted to ask you.

457
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,030
I don't like your type.

458
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,680
What's my type?

459
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,360
I'm passionate. You don't like me?

460
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,680
You're sticking to me too much.

461
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,470
He may not like too passionate courting.

462
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,990
Then you can't be too passionate,

463
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,950
but not too subtle either.

464
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,400
That's too difficult.

465
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,790
But I think the biggest difficulty is still

466
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,990
that I don't have the courage.

467
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,200
Wen Yifan.

468
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,640
I won't allow you to say that about yourself.

469
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,160
Who says you don't have courage?

470
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,950
You've never relied on your family

471
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,200
or given your friends

472
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,680
any trouble.

473
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,160
You've solved everything on your own.

474
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,680
In my opinion,

475
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,710
you're the bravest girl

476
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,950
I know.

477
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,310
That's like the sauce in this pizza.

478
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,120
If it doesn't form strands,

479
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,790
it won't taste good,

480
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,950
so you have to lay some strands

481
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,790
on him every now and then

482
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,270
to make him feel like you care about him.

483
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,790
That way, he'll need you.

484
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,030
That's like

485
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,400
a spider's web

486
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,920
he can't escape from.

487
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,750
Then, wait for him to confess to you.

488
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,510
How's that?

489
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Is it really possible?

490
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,120
I think so.

491
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,750
Anyway, whatever you decide,

492
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,160
I wish you a stunning success.

493
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Once and for all.

494
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,310
I want to be desperate this time

495
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,160
and run to that person

496
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,920
without thinking about anything.

497
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,440
I also want to try

498
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,440
to be that passionate person.

499
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,750
I don't think

500
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,270
it matters if I fail.

501
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,680
I want

502
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,950
to try at least once.

503
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,550
I want to court Sang Yan.

504
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,840
The light is still on.

505
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,470
He doesn't seem to be sleeping.

506
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,660
[Thank you for the gift]

507
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,420
[Thank you]

508
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,340
[Thank you]

509
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,160
Get an early night.

510
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,990
Get an early night.

511
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,080
So

512
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,030
on your birthday,

513
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,880
I'll

514
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,360
give you a gift back.

515
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,950
If he agrees,

516
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,310
even if he moves out then,

517
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,310
I'll have a reason to talk to him again.

518
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,790
Uh-huh.

519
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,120
Uh-huh?

520
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,920
There are

521
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,310
69 days left.

522
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,080
There are

523
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,600
69 days left.

524
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,600
There are

525
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,230
69 days left.

526
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,200
There are

527
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,790
69 days left.

528
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,080
If it's okay,

529
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,950
can you

530
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,400
give me a countdown every day?

531
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,920
I'm afraid I'll forget.

532
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,880
Why are you so cheeky?

533
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,550
Can't you be a little sincere?

534
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,990
It's something

535
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,550
You should remember this all the time

536
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,920
instead of asking me to remind you once a day.

537
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:43,920
Understand?

538
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,920
OK. I'll remember.

539
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,600
OK. I'll remember.

540
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,310
Then...

541
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,360
Do I need to remember

542
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,510
your birthday later?

543
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,880
January 2nd, Capricorn,

544
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,550
but I don't like celebrating birthdays.

545
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,080
Guo's been nice to you, Tian.

546
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,040
He even arranged this for you while you were in labor.

547
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,310
Of course.

548
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,710
He said he'd help me

549
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,830
and love me well

550
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,040
and bought me those four things.

551
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,000
As long as he's good to you and the baby.

552
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,160
Yifan.

553
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,520
Did you wear perfume today?

554
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,200
This smells good.

555
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,160
Really?

556
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,120
I feel like you're a little off today.

557
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,480
Are you in love?

558
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,910
No, I'm not.

559
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,910
I've been courting someone lately.

560
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,160
What?

561
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,710
You're courting someone?

562
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,830
I didn't realize

563
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
even you would be so proactive.

564
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,910
Yifan.

565
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,270
You should know

566
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,830
that you're very good,
