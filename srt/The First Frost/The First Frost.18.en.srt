00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,000
Come one, girl.

188
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,480
There's a child. Be careful!

189
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,120
Do it gently.

190
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,600
Come on.

191
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,480
Come on, little one.

192
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,510
- Give me your hand. - Mind her head.

193
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,550
My dad's still inside.

194
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,150
Yu!

195
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,960
- Mind her head. - Be careful.

196
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,200
Save my dad...

197
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,080
Little one.

198
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,440
Little one, lie down.

199
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,440
My dad's still inside...

200
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,000
Get the ambulance closer!

201
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,030
Your dad will be out soon.

202
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,270
The skylight's too small.

203
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,510
My dad can't crawl out...

204
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,870
Save my dad...

205
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,320
Be careful.

206
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,720
Do it gently.

207
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,150
Hurry, get her in the ambulance!

208
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,240
Dad...

209
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,870
Yu!

210
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,840
Dad...

211
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,870
- My dad's still inside... - Yu!

212
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,030
Ambulance, open the door!

213
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,640
Hurry!

214
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,440
Be careful.

215
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,240
Yu, don't be scared.

216
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,360
Mom's here, don't be scared!

217
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,150
Dad...

218
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,000
Yu!

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,750
Yu, don't be scared.

220
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,550
Mom's here!

221
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,670
Dad's still inside...

222
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,120
Dad...

223
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,910
Yu, don't be scared.

224
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,120
Mom's here. Don't cry.

225
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,200
Hello everyone.

226
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,480
[First News, All Ears for You]
I'm Su Tian, a reporter from Nanwu TV.

227
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,510
We've just learned

228
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,270
that among the seventeen rescued victims,

229
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,870
fourteen have minor injuries,

230
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,360
and three have more severe injuries.

231
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,790
They are currently receiving treatment.

232
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,390
The one most people are concerned about

233
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,630
is seven-year-old girl Shi Jiayu.

234
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,550
She is still under observation in the ICU.

235
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,200
Any latest updates

236
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,390
will be brought to you as soon as possible.

237
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,960
Is Shi Jiayu still in the ICU?

238
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,750
Please wait.

239
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,390
I'll check

240
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,510
if she's been moved from the ICU

241
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,960
to a regular ward.

242
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,030
Should we do an interview?

243
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,510
Yes.

244
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,080
I originally planned to take Yu abroad

245
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,630
for immigration next month.

246
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,790
I've divorced her father.

247
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,840
This time,

248
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,030
it's a farewell trip between her and her father.

249
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,550
But...

250
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,150
I never imagined

251
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,240
we'd encounter such a disaster.

252
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,840
Now, Yu's father's life and death are still unknown.

253
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,030
I really have no idea

254
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,720
how to tell Yu about this

255
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,510
when she wakes up...

256
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,240
It's okay. Everything will be fine.

257
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,120
Your daughter's medication has been changed.

258
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,320
You can go visit her now.

259
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,120
Okay.

260
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,600
Mom.

261
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,870
Tian,

262
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,360
how's everything over there?

263
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,200
I didn't want to disturb you yesterday.

264
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,480
Is it dangerous over there?

265
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,440
It's not dangerous. Everything's fine.

266
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,670
How's the baby?

267
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,440
Let me see.

268
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,360
Okay.

269
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,000
Look.

270
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,750
Look, the baby's asleep.

271
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,360
She's asleep?

272
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,960
Mom, you've worked hard.

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,840
I still have some things to do.

274
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,360
I'll hang up now.

275
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,270
Okay, go ahead.

276
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,720
Be sure to stay safe.

277
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,790
What's wrong?

278
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,790
Is everything fine at home?

279
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,600
Yes.

280
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Is the baby fine?

281
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,790
She's fine.

282
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,510
Alright,

283
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,510
tomorrow,

284
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,630
you don't need to go to the site.

285
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,440
Just stay at the hospital and keep watch.

286
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,600
It's alright, Ms. Qian.

287
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,120
I'm recovering well after childbirth.

288
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,320
The hospital also needs someone to stay.

289
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,510
Don't overthink it.

290
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,360
Thank you, Ms. Qian.

291
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,510
No need to be polite.

292
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,790
Alright,

293
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,600
stop crying.

294
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,670
This vehicle

295
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,510
[Beiyu Tunnel 3 Rescue]
was overturned due to the impact

296
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,510
[Hour 74]
of the mudslide.

297
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,750
Fortunately,

298
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,120
a tree broken by the stones

299
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,600
was positioned over the vehicle.

300
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,790
This created

301
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,240
a narrow survival space.

302
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,270
So the little girl

303
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,840
could escape through the skylight.

304
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,240
But the skylight was very small.

305
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,150
The little girl's father, Mr. Shi,

306
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,910
is still trapped in the car.

307
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,670
Excuse me, Leader Li.

308
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,320
Is it possible

309
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,790
to determine her father's location

310
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,270
from the place where the little girl was rescued?

311
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,960
There was hope at first.

312
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,870
However,

313
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,480
there was another collapse just now.

314
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,510
The vehicle shifted

315
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,630
and got buried even deeper.

316
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,030
Although

317
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,120
the difficulty of the rescue is great,

318
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,150
as long as there's a sliver of hope,

319
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,720
we will never give up!

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,630
Thank you.

Yifan,

335
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,360
I bought some authentic local breakfast.

336
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,440
It's really delicious.

337
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,360
Try it.

338
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,390
Thank you.

Nothing.

Yifan,

I'm starting to admire you more.

343
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,480
You've barely rested, yet you're not tired.

344
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,150
I think...

345
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,150
What?

346
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,440
Nothing.

347
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
You can have the breakfast first.

348
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm going to reply to a message.

349
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,320
There are

Let me know when you receive my message.

352
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,030
When you come back,

353
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,150
bring me an apple.

354
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,240
Today's Christmas Eve.

355
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,840
I don't know if I'll get the chance

356
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
to make it back before his birthday.

357
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,790
Everyone, gather up!

358

Hello.

360
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,120
I just arrived at the hotel.

361
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,320
I've been busy all day.

362
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,870
I guessed it.

363
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,840
It's alright.

364
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,790
Is everything okay?

365
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,390
Why are you stealing my words?

366
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,150

367
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,630
Yeah, a bit.

368
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,000
My eyes are almost too tired to keep open.

369
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,960
I'll sleep in a bit.

370
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,840
Yifan, I'll head back to rest now.

371
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,080
Goodnight, Yifan.

372
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,200
Well...

373
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,320
Goodnight.

374
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,240
Goodnight.

375
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,030
It sounds like it's raining heavily over there.

376
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,320
