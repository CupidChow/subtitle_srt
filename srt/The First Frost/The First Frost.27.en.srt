00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,540
You danced so well today!

192
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,140
Why were you so amazing today?

193
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,900
Everyone was amazing today!

194
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,730
Yeah.

195
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,690
Wen Yifan.

196
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,210
What happened to your foot?

197
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,450
I twisted it

198
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,780
while dancing with the kids.

199
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,930
You just got off the plane?

200
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,900
I didn't want to miss your performance.

201
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,180
Where's Qiao and the others?

202
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,570
They said...

203
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,540
they wanted to see the night view,

204
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,500
so they left.

205
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,660
Are you coming to our celebration later?

206
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,660
Sure.

207
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,090
The kids

208
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,500
didn't win any awards today,

209
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,660
but they were happier than if they had won first place.

210
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,850
Me, too.

211
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,930
Seeing you...

212
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,260
makes me happier than anything else.

213
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,610
After coming here,

214
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,060
I checked and knew

215
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,210
that I was eligible to apply for school.

216
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,730
So I was thinking

217
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,260
maybe I should give it a try.

218
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,260
Do you really want to go back to school that much?

219
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,330
Not exactly.

220
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,540
I just want to be better.

221
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,060
You're already more than enough.

222
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,090
Only then would I deserve you.

223
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,180
Are you flattering me in a roundabout way?

224
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,540
It was because of him.

225
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,420
He made me feel

226
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,020
like I don't deserve good things,

227
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,850
and like he could take it all away at any moment.

228
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,850
It's his fault.

229
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,180
You don't have to carry this alone.

230
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,540
Understand?

231
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,850
You disappearing without a word

232
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,570
was what really destroyed my world.

233
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,210
Understand?

234
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,140
I love you.

235
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,690
So much.

236
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,020
Looks like it's going to rain.

237
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,850
Should we buy an umbrella?

238
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,780
I should've given you my umbrella that day.

239
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,690
What day?

240
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,300
The day college admission results came out.

241
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,060
When you came to Beiyu to see me.

242
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,420
That day...

243
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,090
it rained?

244
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,090
So what if I got wet?

245
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,930
Why apologize?

246
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,380
I'm a grown man.

247
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,330
Getting rained on is no big deal.

248
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,540
I'm not that fragile.

249
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,850
Stop treating your boyfriend like a delicate flower.

250
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,690
What are you laughing at?

251
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,930
This hotel I booked for you

252
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,300
isn't that great.

253
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,570
It's fine.

254
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,900
It has a unique charm.

255
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,850
I'll go check

256
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,540
if they have two rooms.

257
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,780
I only booked one.

258
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,780
So, are you planning

259
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,930
to go back home?

260
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,850
It has two beds.

261
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,020
Sit tight.

262
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,380
I'll check us in.

263
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,450
Wait here.

264
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,380
Good evening, sir.

265
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,610
- Hello. - How can I help you?

266
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,900
I have a reservation.

267
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:38,610
Come here.

268
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,180
Sit.

269
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,610
When did you buy the medicine?

270
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,730
Just now.

271
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,900
While you were showering.

272
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:05,780
Does it hurt?

273
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,020
This leg injury

274
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,460
was got back in Beiyu.

275
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,020
Back then, I was trying to escape from Che Xingde,

276
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,610
the man who called himself my Uncle Che.

277
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,700
I jumped from the second floor.

278
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,780
That's when I got hurt.

279
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,610
Dancing with the kids made the old injury

280
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,610
flare up again.

281
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,980
The first time I saw him in Nanwu

282
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,060
was one night

283
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,130
when I was covering a car accident.

284
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,980
He was involved.

285
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,220
But nothing happened

286
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,460
that night.

287
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,500
The next time I saw him

288
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,130
was when we were at Overtime together.

289
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,460
And then later,

290
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,300
he applied to be a security guard at my workplace.

291
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,700
I didn't tell you the truth back then.

292
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,810
After moving to Beiyu,

293
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,780
Che Xingde lived with us.

294
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,330
He did a lot for my Uncle Wen's family,

295
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,850
so no one dared to say anything against him.

296
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,220
No one dared to cross him.

297
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,130
It was him.

298
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,890
He kept...

299
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,020
harassing me.

300
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,700
Wen Shuangjiang...

301
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,500
If you don't want to talk about it, don't.

302
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,170
It's not that I don't want to.

303
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,540
One night,

304
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,980
he broke into my room.

305
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,850
I fought back as hard as I could.

306
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,540
My Uncle Wen's family

307
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,850
usually didn't get back from selling food

308
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,130
until 3 a.m.

309
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,260
But that night, it rained.

310
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,300
So they came home early.

311
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,890
Luckily, they came home early.

312
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,540
At that time, I didn't know what to do.

313
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,570
No one helped me.

314
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,500
Not a single person

315
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,650
stood by my side.

316
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,020
Not even my mom.

317
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,370
So I didn't think about anything else.

318
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,610
I just wanted

319
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,740
to get far away

320
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,020
from Nanwu and Beiyu.

321
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,810
I wanted to go somewhere far, far away.

322
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,300
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,130
I should've told you all this.

324
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,570
But at first,

325
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,980
I really did apply to Nanwu University.

326
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,810
I wanted to go to college with you.

327
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,980
I wasn't lying.

328
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,090
I'm sorry, Sang Yan.

329
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,740
I said a lot of things that hurt you.

330
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,780
But that's not what I really meant.

331
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,460
It's okay.

332
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,300
If there's something you wanted to say back then,

333
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,540
say it now.

334
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,300
I just felt like...

335
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,890
I was the one who changed my application.

336
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,410
I was the one who messed up.

337
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,610
And Nanwu is really far from Yihe.

338
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,740
I didn't want you running around all the time

339
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,780
like you did in high school.

340
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,090
It was too much for you.

341
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,100
Anything else?

342
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,220
I never made any promises to anyone.

343
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,890
Only to you.

344
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,130
I know.

345
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,380
[Goal: Nanwu University!]

346
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,810
I don't deserve you.

347
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,460
Wen Shuangjiang.

348
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,060
Take that back.

349
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,300
Do you know

350
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,540
why I never dated anyone all these years?

351
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,810
Because I only wanted the best.

352
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,740
Understand?

353
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,330
I never saw you as a backup.

354
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,700
All these years,

355
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,220
there was never anyone else.

356
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,610
Only you.

357
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,460
I'm sorry, Sang Yan.

358
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,980
I broke our promise.

367
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,740
it was shameful

368
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,780
and humiliating.

369
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,170
My relatives said the same.

370
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,740
They told me not to report it.

371
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,570
They said it would ruin my reputation.

372
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,540
That's why I didn't want you to know.

373

Listen to me.

377
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,300
There is nothing shameful

378
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,090
or humiliating about this.

379
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,370
Understand?

380
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,500
You did nothing wrong.

381
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,130
You did the right thing.

382
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,890
You protected yourself.

383
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,780
You were brave.

384
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,020
You should be standing tall,

385
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,020
fearless, in the sunlight.

386
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,090
That villain is the one who belongs to the gutter.

387
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:08,810
Got it?

388
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,300
♪You're like the sun, shining bright♪

389
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,620

♪And give you a starry sky♪

396
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:46,940
Thank you.

397
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,740
You protected my Jiang.

398
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,660
♪No one else but you♪

♪You are my one and only♪

401
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,810
Also...

402
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,650
saying all this now

403
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,300
isn't late at all.

404
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,850
If you had told me this back then,

405
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,570
maybe I wouldn't have wanted to date.

406
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,060
Even if you chased me,

407
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,130
I wouldn't have said yes.

408
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,890
But back then,

409
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,130
you were the one chasing me first.

410
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,060
Didn't you like me, too?

411
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,740
If you like me, chase me properly.

412
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,610
Look at you...

413
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,540
liking someone

414
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,740
but waiting for them to make the first move.

415
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,020
That much pride?

416
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,890
I just didn't know how to chase someone.

417
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,890
And you think I did?

418
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,940
You seem pretty experienced.

419
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,460
You say you're easygoing,

420
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,740
but sometimes, you're really annoying.

421
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,330
What?

422
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,700
Let me touch you.

423
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,260
What's this?

424
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,170
I fell before.

425
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,460
Where did you get hurt?

426
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,460
I just tripped. That's all.

427
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,170
How did it happen?

428
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,330
It's nothing. It's healed.

429
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,330
This doesn't look healed at all.

430
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,170
How is this "nothing"?

431
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,570
How did you get this?

432
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,220
Why did you stop?

433
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,610
I see.

434
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,130
So that's why

435
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,370
you went out of your way to book only one room,

436
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,890
and even tried to cover it up

437
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,020
by choosing a twin-bed room.

438
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,780
Fine, I'll go

439
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,410
take a shower.

440
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,060
Then...

441
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,540
should I wait for you?

442
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,540
What else?

443
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:47,850
Or...

444
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,300
do you want to skip that and view my body now?

445
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,090
Here?

446
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,460
Or here?

447
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,410
Or maybe here?

456
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,130
Are they

457
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,170
all your students?

458
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,020
Do you like this job?

459
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,020
I do.

460
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,330
Here you are.

461
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,500
Yesterday, the music file crashed right before they went on stage,

462
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,410
but they still went out and performed.

463
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,740
I was really moved.

464
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,780
And when they danced,

465
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,650
their eyes sparkled.

466
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,410
That pure, simple joy

467
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,740
reminded me of so many things.

468
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,810
Honestly, rather than me teaching them to dance,

469
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,060
it feels

470
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,700
like they taught me so much more.

471
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,330
Eat up!

472
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,330
Wendy,

473
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,540
where are you going?

474
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,260
I'm going home.

475
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,810
Will you come back and play with us?

476
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:48,780
Of course!

477
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,540
Whenever I have time, I'll come visit you.

478
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,940
Listen up!

479
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,540
I'm leaving for now.

480
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,460
But while I'm gone,

481
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,650
keep practicing hard.

482
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,460
I'll come back to check on you, alright?

483
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,810
Alright!

484
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,780
Sorry.

485
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,810
I had to leave so suddenly.

486
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,610
It's fine.

487
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,170
Didn't we agree on this before?

488
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,130
You'd stay until your course was done.

489
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,610
And now, it's about that time.

490
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,130
I should be thanking you

491
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,170
for stepping in just in time.

492
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,410
So,

493
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,980
he's the one you've been thinking about nonstop?

494
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,570
Who? Me?

495
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,810
When we're free, we'll come visit you.

496
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,260
Alright, drop by anytime.

497
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,460
Can we take a picture with Wendy?

498
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,300
Why don't we take a big group photo first?

499
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,020
Let's take a group picture!

500
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,980
Then we'll take turns for individual shots, alright?

501
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,700
Okay!

502
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,980
Here, you handle the camera.

503
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,650
One, two, three!

504
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,850
So pretty.

505
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,540
You look so cute.

506
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,500
What? Do you want one, too?

507
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,850
You're smiling so much.

508
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,740
Three, two, one!

509
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,500
Alright.

510
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,850
I guess

511
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,170
you don't like this place, do you?

512
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,460
How do you know?

513
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,810
You barely have any luggage.

514
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,370
That tells me you never planned on staying long.

515
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,300
I just want to be where you are.

516
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,500
I'll help you pack.

517
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:36,300
[Nanwu]

518
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,940
I really admire you.

519
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,460
You have the courage to leave everything behind,

520
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,740
to disappear from the world.

521
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,090
What made you change your mind?

522
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,090
It was him.

523
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,540
He gave me a lot of courage.

524
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,130
He made me realize

525
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,700
that not everything can be solved by hiding in the shadows.

526
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,370
You know,

527
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,370
maybe we can't live for love alone,

528
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,570
but love

529
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,940
really does give us so much courage.

530
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,260
That's how I felt when I had my child.

531
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,060
The treatment is all done.

532
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,420
You both can rest a little longer.

533
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,380
If you need anything,

534
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,210
just call us anytime.

535
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:11,900
Thank you.

536
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,500
I feel like my looks

537
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,690
just leveled up again.

538
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,290
By lots of levels.

539
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,020
But I am still

540
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,420
several levels below you.

541
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,650
We deserve all the good things in life.

542
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,860
So we have to take care of ourselves.

543
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,500
By the way,

544
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,460
will you go back to the TV station?

545
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,980
I've been gone for so long.

546
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,250
Do you think Ms. Qian and Mr. Gan

547
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,610
would still take me back?

548
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,170
At worst,

549
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,770
you'll just have to pass their test again.

550
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,540
Have you put on some weight recently?

551
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,170
Have I?

552
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,770
Of course!

553
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,900
You used to be all skin and bones.

554
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,650
It hurt to lean on you.

555
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,380
Now look at you, all happy and plump.

556
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,250
I met up with Su Tian today.

557
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,290
Seeing her

558
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,570
brought back so many memories.

559
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,290
Want to go back to the station?

560
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,090
What do you think?

561
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,610
Do you like this job?

562
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,290
As long as you like it and want to do it,

563
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,900
no matter what it is,

564
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,090
I'll always support you.

565
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,020
You're the most handsome man I've ever seen.

566
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,340
Shouldn't you be shouting that out loud?

567
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,770
I have the most handsome man.

568
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,570
And you're a fairy.

569
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,730
Want some fruit?

570
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,020
Here, have a cherry.

571
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,060
Have you had any sleepwalking episodes recently?

572
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,540
Back when you studied in Hong Kong, China,

573
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,820
being in a new environment

574
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,980
must have been stressful.

575
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,460
Did you sleepwalk during that time?

576
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,690
I haven't sleepwalked in a long time.

577
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,340
I think

578
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,380
I'm getting better

579
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,500
at handling stress.

580
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,690
From now on,

581
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,060
you just need to keep an eye on it.

582
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,250
No need for further check-ups.

583
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,860
So,

584
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,130
can I go back to reporting?

585
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,460
Of course.

586
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,210
No one should have to give up their dreams

587
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:49,980
just because of sleepwalking.

588
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,610
Besides,

589
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,570
you're in a really stable condition now.

590
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:53,940
So go.

591
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,170
Give it your all.

592
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,820
Thank you, doctor.

593
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,940
No problem. Good luck!

594
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,250
Back when you left,

595
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,650
I couldn't quite understand why.

596
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,340
Right?

597
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,170
Of course, she had her reasons.

598
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,340
So,

599
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,650
did you find your answer?

600
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,820
This might be a bit direct,

601
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,130
but I'd like to ask you both:

602
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,250
What do you think

603
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,980
is the most important trait of a journalist?

604
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,380
The drive

605
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,210
to pursue the truth.

606
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,020
For me,

607
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,610
it's about keeping the passion alive.

608
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,570
Even though I don't have the same energy anymore,

609
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,770
whenever I'm the first on the scene,

610
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,380
I can still feel

611
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,170
that rush.

612
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:42,770
And you?

613
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,650
Your turn to answer.

614
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,340
I think journalism can protect people.

615
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,090
When the truth comes to light,

616
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,210
all the ugliness in the dark

617
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,540
can no longer hide.

618
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,650
That's why I want

619
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,980
to grow stronger,

620
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,540
to be braver,

621
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,770
so I can fight for the weak.

622
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,420

624
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,060
will be even tougher.

625
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,650
I like this version of you.

I want to let you know in advance,

636

637

Yes.

We just got a lead

656

for a news report.

657
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,770

659

a woman took a recording

662
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,170
to the police station.

663
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,210
