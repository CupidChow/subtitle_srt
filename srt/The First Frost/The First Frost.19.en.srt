189
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,510
No,

190
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,510
but just in case.

191
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,270
Then I'll do the same later.

192
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,960
I'm going back.

193
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,510
I have to get up early tomorrow and go back.

194
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,480
I'll stop chatting.

195
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,120
Good night.

196
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,080
Sang Yan.

197
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,510
What?

198
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,750
Happy birthday.

199
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,360
What's your birthday wish?

200
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,240
I won't say.

201
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,360
Why not?

202
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,120
Because

203
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,150
it's already come true.

204
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,550
Good night.

205
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,440
[Qiao]

206
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,360
Did you see that?

207
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,840
Sang Yan posted in his WeChat Moment.

208
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,960
He has a girlfriend.

209
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,320
You didn't say anything,

210
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,790
so his girlfriend must not be you.

211
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,200
Then who is it?

212
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,000
He doesn't even tell us

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,720
when he's in love.

214
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,240
Luckily, you didn't have anything with him.

215
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,360
Did his account

216
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,630
get hacked?

217
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,790
That's too much.

218
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,360
Take a look at the screenshot I sent you.

219
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,580
[Sang Yan]

220
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,000
[Duan Jiaxu: Has your account been hacked?]

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,300
[Sang Yan: Sorry, my girlfriend asked me to post.]

222
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,030
So he got the cake.

223
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,260
[He wasn't hacked]

224
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,220
[His girlfriend is me]

225
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,450
Hello?

226
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,410
Hello?

227
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:24,840
Dian.

228
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,120
What's going on?

229
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,200
Just like what I said.

230
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,480
It happened just now.

231
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,000
Aren't you on a business trip?

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,390
How do you have time for that?

233
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,790
And didn't you say before

234
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,960
that you weren't getting anywhere?

235
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,120
Did I?

236
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,360
Yes.

237
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,960
You caused me to worry about you two.

238
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,480
You're such a lukewarm character.

239
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,440
Tell me.

240
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,030
How did it go so fast?

241
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,960
Probably because I didn't control myself.

242
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,840
Gosh.

243
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,150
Wen Yifan.

244
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,790
When are you going back to Nanwu?

245
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,000
Tomorrow morning.

246
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,480
Then we'll meet at noon.

247
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,790
Talk me through it.

248
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,670
Okay, then.

249
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,670
That's it. Bye.

250
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,180
[Grandpa loves Woodie Jr. Thank you.]

251
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,870
Are you really my friend?

252
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,270
You're either stalking me

253
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,120
or not replying to me for so long.

254
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,030
How are you and your grandpa doing?

255
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,000
You need to check in with me.

256
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,000
I didn't message back for so long because...

257
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,510
Because...

258
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,600
Sorry. I'm a little nervous.

259
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,240
It's because

260
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,750
I don't want to be just friends with you.

261
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,030
I want to be your boyfriend,

262
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,630
okay?

263
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,120
Just confess like that?

264
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,910
I'm next to your house right now.

265
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,480
Anhe Bridge.

266
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,790
Xiang Lang?

267
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,600
Why are you here?

268
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,870
I just wanted to call you.

269
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,000
I just got off the plane

270
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,360
and wanted to surprise you.

271
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,000
We're on vacation at work,

272
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,240
so I wanted to come back and see you guys.

273
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,200
It's a bit of a shock.

274
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,960
Why not a surprise but a shock?

275
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,120
Actually,

276
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,240
it just so happens that a friend came to see me, too.

277
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,720
Meeting you this late?

278
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,750
Dian?

279
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,000
No.

280
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,480
It's a

281
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,550
boy.

282
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,390
Don't think too much.

283
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,550
You know him, too.

284
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,480
I know him, too?

285
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,200
So can we

286
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,120
go together?

287
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,030
Maybe

288
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,360
OK.

289
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,670
I've just learned some very shocking news.

290
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,200
I think you'll know it sooner or later.

291
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,550
Dian

292
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,240
is in love with Sang Yan.

293
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,630
But that's good.

294
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,720
We should wish them well.

295
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,750
Are you sure you're okay?

296
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,440
Of course.

297
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,240
What about you?

298
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,320
When can you care about yourself?

299
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,080
I...

300
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,310
I'm sorry

301
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,110
to bother you

302
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,790
guys.

303
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,350
You're the one who asked Qiao out so late.

304
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,270
You're together?

305
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,590
What a coincidence.

306
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,920
He's here to see me too.

307
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,880
Yes.

308
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,310
I just came back from Hong Kong, China

309
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,310
to meet my childhood friend.

310
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,830
Actually,

311
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,920
I have something important

312
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,160
to talk to Qiao alone today,

313
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,960
but I didn't expect you to be here.

314
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,200
But that's okay.

315
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,720
As a man,

316
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,350
I don't need to hide anything.

317
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,830
Zhong Siqiao.

318
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,270
I want you to be my...

319
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,030
Wait.

320
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,440
Don't be impulsive.

321
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,680
Let's talk privately.

322
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,240
What's so bad about this?

323
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,920
Qiao.

324
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Let him say.

325
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,000
But...

326
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,750
Don't care about me.

327
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,350
Grab your own happiness.

328
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,590
- Su Haoan, I just feel... - Xiang Lang.

329
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,680
What do you mean?

330
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,640
I think you may have misunderstood.

331
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,160
Qiao and I

332
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,510
will always be best friends,

333
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,000
so Su Haoan,

334
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,270
if you want to say something,

335
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,880
just say it.

336
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,070
Xiang Lang, don't you love Wen Yifan?

337
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,790
I made it very clear just now.

338
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,790
So you've rejected Zhong Siqiao's confession?

339
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,590
Yes.

340
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,160
I confessed to Xiang Lang,

341
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,790
but he refused.

342
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,750
That was my wishful thinking,

343
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,480
okay?

344
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,000
Both of you, stop it, okay?

345
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,350
You still love him, don't you?

346
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,720
Of course not. How can that be?

347
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,240
Then why don't you try to accept me?

348
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,680
How can I try?

349
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,510
So it was my wishful thinking.

350
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,400
I'm sorry

351
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,480
to bother you.

352
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,270
Su Haoan.

353
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:10,920
Good morning.

354
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,550
Good morning.

355
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,830
We're going to meet downstairs

356
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,400
and probably have breakfast before going back.

357
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,590
Okay.

358
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,240
Did you sleep well?

359
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,070
Let's go.

360
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,640
Are you coming with us?

361
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,510
Can't I?

362
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,000
Hi. Check out.

363
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,590
Hi.

364
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,510
Me too.

365
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,590
Okay. Just a moment.

366
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,400
Ma'am. Confirm check-out.

367
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,030
Morning, Ms. Qian.

368
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,830
Done.

369
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,480
It's you.

370
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,590
Are you here for work

371
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,720
or pleasure?

372
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,440
I'm here to see her.

373
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,110
Let's go check out.

374
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,550
Okay.

375
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,590
Check out for me. I need to confirm something.

376
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,590
Sang Yan.

377
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,030
I know you want to see Yifan,

378
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,790

about her feelings a bit.

384

confessing his love to Qiao,

432
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,440
but

433
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,030
he was ruthlessly rejected by Qiao.

434
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,160
Su Haoan was almost crashed.

435

Do you love him?

440
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,550
I don't know,

441
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,350
but when I don't see him,

442
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,920
I'll wonder

443
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,590
why I can't hear from him at all.

444
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,200
And yet, as soon as we met...

445
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,270
He confessed to her.

449
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,960
it's a kind of fate.

00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,790

00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,340
[Aren't you partying with them?]

568
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,400
It's so boring. Be with me.

569
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,480
We'll be right there.

570
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,640
Where are we going?

571
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,070
To Overtime.

572
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,830
Let's go.

573
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,920
Do they know you're in love with Sang Yan?

574
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,000
Probably not.

575
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,000
I didn't ask.

576
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,720
Since you're already in love,

577
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,000
ask if you want to.

578
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,310
Wait.

579
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,790
Feel my heartbeat.

580
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,510
Why is it racing?

581
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,440
I'm so nervous.

582
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,640
Why are you nervous?

583
00:32:59,270 --> 00:32:59,960
Please.

584
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,880
This will be the first time

585
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,000
Sang Yan appeared in front of me

586
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,960
as my best friend's boyfriend.

587
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,350
I don't even know how to face him.

588
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,720
Let me see where he is.

589
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,790
Just do the same as before.

590
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,920
OK.

591
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,750
Indeed,

592
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,110
I'm also a bit overwhelmed by the change

593
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,350
in our relationship after so many years.

594
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,480
Taste what I just cooked today.

595
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,750
Taste the fish in muddy water.

596
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,490
- There you are. - Hello.

597
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,200
- There you are. - Hello.

598
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,270
- Welcome. - Hello.

599
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,350
- Sit down. - Come on.

600
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Come on.

601
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,500
- Come on, Yifan. - Thank you.

602
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,130
Sit next to me.

603
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,240
Here. Use this.

604
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,750
Thank you.

605
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,000
What are you doing?

606
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,750
- What do you mean? - Thanks.

607
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,960
Don't you have a girlfriend?

608
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,920
Why do you invite other girls

609
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,830
to sit next to you?

610
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,750
Don't ask.

611
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,510
Looks like he hasn't told them yet.

612
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,230
Why are you looking at me?

613
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,960
It's the first time I've seen you in khaki.

614
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,000
No wonder

615
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,550
l felt something strange about Yan today.

616
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,440
It's so obvious, but you're just now realizing it?

617
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,880
What's the point of wearing this?

618
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,000
It's so flirty.

619
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,360
Are you the hero of a movie?

620
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,280
Right, Yifan?

621
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,710
Right?

622
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,800
Maybe.

623
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,230
I think it's quite manly.

624
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,920
You don't have an aesthetic.

625
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,360
My girlfriend bought it for me.

626
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
She likes this color.

627
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,920
Girlfriend?

628
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,840
Oh, my God.

629
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,840
You're moving too fast with your girlfriend.

630
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,030
How long have you been in love?

631
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,840
You called her girlfriend.

632
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,670
Wine.

633
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,550
- Thank you. - Looking good.

634
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,280
Thank you.

635
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,880
Come on. Taste it.

636
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,510
She doesn't drink.

637
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,710
Right?

638
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,880
Sang Yan.

639
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,630
We've been sitting here all afternoon,

640
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,000
and you haven't had a drink,

641
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,920
but now you're taking Yifan's.

642
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,800
I don't drink either.

643
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:01,760
I'm going to drive.

644
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,360
Sang Yan, you're so weird,

645
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,550
but

646
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,670
I have to kindly remind you,

647
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,400
who's been single since birth,

648
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,550
not to be like me.

649
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,960
Don't worry. I won't.

650
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,030
Yan.

651
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,510
I'd also like to remind you

652
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,550
to restrain yourself

653
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,800
so you won't scare away

654
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,320
the only woman in the world

655
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,360
who can put up with your bad temper.

656
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,280
It's not sure if he has a girlfriend or not.

657
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,150
OK.

658
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,480
I won't be like you either.

659
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,070
Can I be a backup like you or...

660
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,000
She only likes people like me.

661
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,070
So when are you gonna

662
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,480
bring your girlfriend over

663
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,230
and show us?

664
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,000
Right?

665
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,110
How many days has it been?

666
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,110
Or

667
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,110
are you so unsure

668
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,320
that you're afraid your girlfriend will fall in love with me

669
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,150
when she gets here?

670
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,760
Stop bragging.

671
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,630
It's a pipe dream.

672
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,070
See you later.

673
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:48,880
Look. He's gone again.

674
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,290
- Nonsense. - Bye-bye.

675
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,280
Bye.

676
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,110
Come on, Yifan.

677
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:57,960
Are you leaving, too?

678
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,510
You're going, too?

679
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,400
With him?

680
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,630
No. Come back. Sit down.

681
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,550
Don't go.

682
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,030
Sang Yan.

683
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,760
You have a girlfriend,

684
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,110
but why do you still hang out

685
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,480
with your roommate every day?

686
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,710
What's the matter with you?

687
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,400
Is your girlfriend okay with this?

688
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,320
It's inappropriate.

689
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,480
Think about it.

690
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,030
Two idiots.

691
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,880
See you later.

692
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,880
- Qiao. - Just go. Don't worry about me.

693
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,880
Qiao, don't go.

694
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,440
I won't.

695
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,800
- Stay here. - Don't get too close.

696
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,800
Yeah.

697
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,440
Come on. Let's drink.

698
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:23,960
Come on.

699
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,880
- Come on. - Try my new dish.

700
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,400
OK.

701
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,550
Come on.

702
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,400
Didn't you tell them

703
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,630
your girlfriend was me?

704
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,000
I didn't think they'd be able to tell.

705
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,480
I'd better tell them in a formal setting.

706
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,960
What?

707
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,760
You can't wait?

708
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,960
I'm just curious.

709
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,400
Is this coat really nice?

710
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,280
Of course.

711
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:48,880
Both the shape

712
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,150
and the fabric.

713
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,760
And it's very warm, too.

714
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,760
I'm even sweating.

715
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:55,920
I was going to say

716
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,230
that this color

717
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,190
might make you look a little softer,

718
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,190
but I didn't expect...

719
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,110
Didn't expect what?

720
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,320
I didn't expect it

721
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,280
to be as cocky as you are.

722
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,190
What?

723
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,880
Shocked by how handsome your boyfriend is?

724
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,280
Whatever you say.

725
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,590
Have dinner with me.

726
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,960
Didn't you eat just now?

727
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,670
No. I was waiting for you.

728
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,190
Have you eaten?

729
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,760
A little.

730
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,800
Didn't I just show you a picture?

731
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,000
What do you mean?

732
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,590
Are you settling a score with me

733
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,670
or to show your hand to your rival?

734
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,550
Sit down and talk.

735
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,070
Have some water.

736
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,320
I know you're busy,

737
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,360
so I'm sorry,

738
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,440
but I really don't know who to talk to.

739
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,360
I had a really hard time before.

740
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,230
I've never felt this way before.

741
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,030
I just want to know more about her.

742
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,710
Of course, I wanted to ask Wen Yifan at first,

743
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,440
but I felt

744
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,710
that Qiao would be angry

745
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,440
if she knew,

746
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,550
so after thinking it over,

747
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,760
I asked you to come here.

748
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,920
Actually,

749
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,070
Qiao wasn't as happy

750
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,670
as she seemed,

751
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,320
but she always played along

752
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,000
without saying anything.

753
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,150
When she was a sophomore in high school,

754
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,070
Dian moved to Beiyu.

755
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,280
Actually, she was never happy

756
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,320
during that time.

757
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,030
When I came back to see her

758
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,800
during my first winter break,

759
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,190
she didn't accept that

760
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,400
right away.

761
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,630
It was very unlike her before.

762
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,150
I expected you

763
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,400
to extort a big meal from me,

764
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,880
but I didn't expect you to treat me to a cake.

765
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,230
Why don't you eat it?

766
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
I suddenly feel

767
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,550
that the three of us have become so distant.

768
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,440
Nanwu Trio?

769
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,920
No one even cares about that.

770
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,880
What's wrong with you?

771
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,590
Did something happen to you recently?

772
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,920
Do things have to happen to me to make me miss you?

773
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,960
Do friends have to care about each other

774
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,360
when something happens to them?

775
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,510
We've all been a little busy lately.

776
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:37,880
Yes.

777
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,030
You're all busy.

778
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,440
You don't have to make time

779
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,670
to see me during the short time

780
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,110
you're here.

781
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,000
Qiao.

782
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,150
I'm sorry.

783
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,070
Do you know why I bought the cake?

784
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,800
Because you're going back soon.

785
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,550
Your birthday is on March 14th.

786
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,480
I was worried no one would celebrate your birthday there,

787
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,670
so I bought it.

788
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,280
I remember your and Dian's birthday every year,

789
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,510
but what about you guys? Do you remember mine?

790
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,440
She always remembers

791
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,110
what everyone likes

792
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,670
and our birthdays.

793
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,880
It's like we're all used

794
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,590
to her being there.

795
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,070
She's often not the one

796
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,320
at the center,

797
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,440
but

798
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,760
the one at the center

799
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,400
sure needs her.

800
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,880
Can you

801
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,110
tell me more?

802
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,840
Would you like some?

803
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,880
Talk while eating.

804
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,760
I just feel like I don't know

805
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,110
anything about her,

806
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,030
so I'd like to learn more

807
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,000
about her.

808
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,670
I thought of one more thing.

809
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,280
Actually, during that time,

810
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,590
it wasn't all because of Dian that she was unhappy.

811
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,000
At that time,

812
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,880
her mom and dad were about to be divorced.

813
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,840
Which flavor of dumpling would you like?

814
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,230
Or do you want to order something else?

815
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,230
Take your pick.

816
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,760
I owe you a meal anyway.

817
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:36,760
But

818
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,800
this one doesn't count.

819
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,960
You decide.

820
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,230
What do you want to eat?

821
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,630
Don't you have a lot of taboos?

822
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,550
Not anymore.

823
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,070
What are you looking at?

824
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,760
That lamp is pretty.

825
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:57,840
Now eat.

826
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,360
Do you like it?

827
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,510
I ordered something

828
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,590
with strong flavors.

829
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,840
Do you like it?

830
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,880
Don't you like mild food?

831
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,070
I tried to imagine what you like.

832
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,360
I do like dumplings quite a bit.

833
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,670
What

834
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,320
are you looking at?

835
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:34,920
The ferris wheel.

836
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,030
Let's eat

837

quickly then.
