00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,390
It's even harder to find a place

187
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,910
as close to the company

188
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,120
as mine.

189
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,550
You can thank me later.

190
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,320
Distance isn't a big concern for me.

191
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
What I'd like to know is the rent.

192
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,870
How can you not care about distance?

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,200
In our line of work,

194
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
we're always on the go, working crazy hours.

195
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,840
Time is money.

196
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,480
If you can sleep longer, why wake up earlier?

197
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,440
This room is yours if you want it.

198
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,080
The last tenant was a friend of mine

199
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,390
who had moved out for a while.

200
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,960
She dated a rich guy

201
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,030
and upgraded to a hillside villa.

202
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,840
Here's the bathroom.

203
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,080
Honestly, renting with strangers

204
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,720
these days is too risky.

205
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,870
There are too many weirdos out there.

206
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,390
That's why I'd rather leave it vacant

207
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,000
than rent it to someone I don't know.

208
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,360
That's why

209
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,720
I offered it to you first.

210
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,670
Take a look before you decide.

211
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,670
Moving isn't a small thing,

212
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
after all.

213
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,790
So, that vacant room of yours...

214
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,960
I need to take this call.

215
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,390
Help yourself to some water.

216
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,880
Hey.

217
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,510
I just wanted to ask

218
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,000
if you got the New Year's photos.

219
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,120
I mean the ones from our hot spring trip.

220
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,240
Don't show them to anyone else.

221
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,870
Don't call me that.

222
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,080
I'm not your girlfriend.

223
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm hanging up.

224
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,320
So, what do you think?

225
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
The smaller room is 3,000, and the whole place is 7,000.

226
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,550
We can split

227
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,790
the utility bills equally.

228
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,790
But if you're planning

229
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,360
on running the AC all day,

230
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,840
taking super long showers,

231
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,320
and cooking daily,

232
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,270
then we'll need a different arrangement.

233
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,510
I'll take it then.

234
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,200
Welcome to your new home

235
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,150
at Uptown Flower City.

236
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,870
Let me know

237
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,960
if you need anything.

238
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,600
Although the rent here is much higher than in Urban Haven,

239
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,200
as long as I can get a good night's sleep,

240
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,480
it's fine.

241
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,790
Lin,

242
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,910
you've already broken up with your ex.

243
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,030
Why are you still having a meal with him?

244
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,360
He kept begging me

245
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,750
to give him another chance.

246
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,060
I know we're done,

247
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,550
but having a meal together doesn't hurt.

248
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,870
He even booked a fancy restaurant,

249
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,240
so don't hesitate to dig in.

250
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,790
Lin.

251
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,390
Get in the car.

252
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,440
I wasn't late.

253
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,720
I actually arrived half an hour ago.

254
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,320
I just wanted to buy you a flower.

255
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,960
Wen Yifan?

256
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,600
You're Wen Yifan, aren't you?

257
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,870
I'm not mistaken this time, am I?

258
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,480
Are you Su Haoan?

259
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,320
Yes, it's me.

260
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,720
I ran into Zhong Siqiao at Overtime last night

261
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
and even mistook her for you.

262
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,440
Let's talk in the car.

263
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,320
Maybe it's better if I don't go.

264
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,000
Why?

265
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,720
It's fine.

266
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,080
Let's celebrate becoming roommates.

267
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,000
Careful.

268
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,690
OK.

269
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,480
Careful.

270
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,630
Sit tight.

271
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,200
There's someone else.

272
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,320
Wake up and see your romantic interest.

273
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,390
Wen Yifan is here.

274
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,790
So, you all know each other?

275
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,550
We were in the same class in high school.

276
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,360
Romantic interest?

277
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,600
What does that mean?

278
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,320
Are you saying Sang Yan had feelings for Fan

279
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,030
but she never reciprocated?

280
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,030
Yes.

281
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,750
Really? How come I don't remember?

282
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,550
Maybe you misremembered.

283
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,600
There's no way I misremembered.

284
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,360
Back in high school, weren't you two...?

285
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,870
Is this awkward for you guys?

286
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,150
It's been so many years.

287
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,270
I was just bringing it up as a fun memory.

288
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,720
How long has it been since you last saw each other?

289
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,910
Wen Yifan, I recall

290
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,120
you transferred schools in either your first or second year of high school.

291
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,240
The second semester of sophomore year.

292
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,510
So,

293
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,910
it's been seven or eight years now.

294
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,600
Sang Yan,

295
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,440
why aren't you saying anything?

296
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,320
Don't tell me you're still

297
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,440
holding a grudge over this.

298
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,500
He probably thinks

299
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,730
Wen Yifan had poor taste back then

300
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,390
and didn't fancy him.

301
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,180
Who knew he'd turn out just like this?

302
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,000
Stop it.

303
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Just focus on driving.

304
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,600
It's so late.

305
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,200
Why are you taking so long?

306
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,250
Do I have to come pick you up myself?

307
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,080
We were stuck in traffic.

308
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,670
Finally, you're here.

309
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,670
Who's that girl?

310
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,580
Sang Yan, that's not cool.

311
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,390
You got a girlfriend and didn't even tell us.

312
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,870
Quit joking around.

313
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,960
She

314
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,120
is our former classmate,

315
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,150
the legendary beauty from our high school days.

316
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,240
No way Sang Yan could ever be in her league.

317
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,240
Wen Yifan,

318
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,480
meet

319
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,920
Qian Fei and Chen Junwen.

320
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,510
They

321
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,920
were Sang Yan's dormmates.

322
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,570
Hello.

323
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,000
As for me,

324
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,350
I'm their closest friend.

325
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,920
The four of us run Overtime, our gastropub, together.

326
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,510
Hi.

327
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:21,880
Don't try to cozy up to her.

328
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,830
Let's eat first. I'm starving.

329
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,200
Let's eat. Come on.

330
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,640
Thank you.

331
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,480
Come on.

332
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,400
Let's have some cold dishes first.

333
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,440
We can treat today like a New Year's celebration.

334
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,820
- Okay. - None of you

335
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,750
were available on New Year's,

336
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,200
so I had to run Overtime all by myself.

337
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,770
I was working overtime.

338
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,140
It's part of my job.

339
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,070
Just ask Fan if you don't believe me.

340
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,720
I just wanted to ask

341
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,350
if you got the New Year's photos.

342
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920
I mean the ones from our hot spring trip.

343
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,550
It's okay,

344
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,880
as long as you're here.

345
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,720
This is for you.

346
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,750
Thanks.

347
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,920
Since everyone's gathered here today,

348
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,310
let's celebrate Sang Yan's birthday together.

349
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,550
January 2nd.

350
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,400
A Capricorn?

351
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,550
I'm getting emotional.

352
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,070
Did you get my permission

353
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,000
to celebrate my birthday?

354
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,510
Dude, this is a surprise.

355
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,400
Why aren't you showing some appreciation?

356
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,000
Dude,

357
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,790
you brought it up so early.

358
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,110
How can we still call this a surprise?

359
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,590
You know Su Haoan.

360
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,000
He can't keep secrets.

361
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,110
You are quite something.

362
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,270
I'm speechless.

363
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,000
Sorry.

364
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,680
My bad.

365
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,590
Come on.

366
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,270
Happy Birthday.

367
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,440
Fan,

368
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,980
you rejected

369
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,460
Sang Yan before?

370
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,960
I just don't get it.

371
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,550
He's got everything,

372
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,720
the looks, the height, the money.

373
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,030
But

374
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,240
seeing how cold he is today,

375
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,000
it's possible he doesn't have any feelings for you anymore.

376
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,550
It's all in the past now.

377
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,790
You

378
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,550
need to learn how to seize opportunities.

379
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,880
Sometimes,

380
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,500
finding a good partner

381
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,010
can be more effective than a promotion.

382
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,640
By the way, what lipstick shade are you wearing?

383
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,160
It's really nice.

384
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,510
I didn't wear any today.

385
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,480
Normally I use...

386
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,880
We are both women.

387
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,310
Can't you just be honest?

388
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,110
I really didn't wear any.

389
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,270
It's been a while.

390
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,000
It's been a while?

391
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,030
It's only been two days since the New Year's event.

392
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,480
No need to act

393
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,350
like you've been missing me as if it's been ages.

394
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
You were the one acting like you didn't know me.

395
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,720
I thought you didn't recognize me

396
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,110
since I was wearing a mask that day,

397
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,400
covering my face completely.

398
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,200
I didn't expect your eyes to be that sharp.

399
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,920
My eyes are sharp?

400
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,590
Sorry,

401
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,920
you got it wrong.

402
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,000
I didn't see you at all.

403
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,720
It was my sister who saw you

404
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,420
and mentioned

405
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,000
that you were staring at me.

406
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,700
That's true.

407
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,880
Because I noticed

408
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,240
your zipper was down.

409
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,760
A lot of people around me

410
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,030
were talking about it at the time.

411
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,440
But don't worry too much

412
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,030
since it has been

413
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,210
a few hours already.

414
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:55,880
I'm off now.

415
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,720
They were talking about a limited edition or something.

416
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,270
Come on.

417
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,480

Any updates on the singer?

420

A couple of friends

421
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,130
recommended a few to me the other day.

422
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,160
Sorry, I need to head back now.

423
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,440
My supervisor just told me

424
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,880
that I have a task to finish.

425
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,130
You hardly ate anything.

426
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:43,730
Are you full?

427
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:44,640
Is it because of Ms. Qian?

428
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,350
I'll talk to her.

429
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,700
No need. I just passed my probation period,

430
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,270
if you know what I mean.

431
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:48,920
You've worked hard.

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,510

Let's have a toast together.

438
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,070
was parked on?

439
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,030
I think it's on the second basement floor.

You don't remember?

441
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,310
Which section and what number?

442
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,240
It should be section A,

could you give me a ride?

448
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,310

450
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,960

451
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,030
