00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,750
Which one is your brother?

190
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,480
That one over there.

191
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,120
Didn't I tell you to wait for me here?

192
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,750
How would I know this place?

193
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,150
What a coincidence.

194
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,150
She's my sister.

195
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,440
I'm going now.

196
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,790
Miss, thank you.

197
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,030
Let's eat ice cream together.

198
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,550
If you're free, let's go.

199
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,030
If it weren't for my brother's promise to buy me candy,

200
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,550
I wouldn't have helped him...

201
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,550
I wouldn't have helped him lie.

202
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,360
Let's go, Miss.

203
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,200
Let's go eat pizza.

204
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,840
I'm not hungry.

205
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,630
You guys go ahead.

206
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:10,910
By the way,

207
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,240
there's a lot of food

208
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,440
in these cabinets

209
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,600
and in the fridge.

210
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,720
Take whatever you want.

211
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,240
It's mostly your brother's stuff.

212
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,870
Wait, Miss.

213
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,030
How did you end up as my brother's roommate?

214
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,320
Just a coincidence.

215
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,840
It must be fate.

216
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,480
Are you eating or not?

217
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,440
Hurry up, go eat.

218
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,360
I'm going to work now.

219
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,150
You're such a bigmouth.

220
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,480
It's time to eat!

221
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,720
Go bring the other dishes over.

222
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,870
Why don't you ask Yifan to join us for dinner?

223
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,480
Aren't you going to invite her?

224
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,630
Since you two are roommates,

225
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,000
you should get along well.

226
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,030
Why are you talking like mom?

227
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,000
Besides, what's it got to do with you?

228
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,670
She's been good to me.

229
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,840
She even lets me take whatever I want.

230
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,550
Shouldn't you be polite with her?

231
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,390
She's nice to you,

232
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,550
but what's it got to do with me?

233
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,080
Invite her yourself.

234
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,670
I won't.

235
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,360
She's not my roommate, anyway.

236
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,960
I'm not polite, and you shouldn't be either.

237
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,670
Go.

238
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,150
Miss Yifan.

239
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,320
Please come in.

240
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,030
Miss,

241
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,440
my brother made a hotpot.

242
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,750
Come join us.

243
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,440
I'm not hungry. You guys go ahead.

244
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,360
Miss, you might not know,

245
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,670
but my brother and I

246
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,510
can never enjoy a meal alone.

247
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,480
Please.

248
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,030
Okay.

249
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,510
Let's go.

250
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,000
Are you hungry again so soon?

251
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,240
My brother says,

252
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
the New Year is all about family reunion, having hotpot.

253
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Miss Yifan, please sit here.

254
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,390
Thank you, Sang Zhi.

255
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,080
You can call me by my nickname, Zhi.

256
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,000
Zhi?

257
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,240
That's really cute.

258
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,440
What are you laughing at?

259
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,150
What's wrong with her saying my nickname is cute?

260
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,550
Doesn't it sound like a maid's name?

261
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,750
Your name sounds like a eunuch.

262
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,600
You'd better say that in front of your dad.

263
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,360
Eunuch Yan.

264
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,720
By the way, Zhi,

265
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,440
you're about to take the university entrance exam, right?

266
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,960
Have you decided which university you want to go to?

267
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,440
Not yet.

268
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,080
I'm stuck between Nanwu University and Yihe University.

269
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,000
Are you confident about both?

270
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,480
Unless something unexpected happens.

271
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,000
So, your grades are good enough.

272
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,390
I'm just worried about a bad performance on the exam.

273
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,910
No need to worry so much.

274
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,960
And both universities

275
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,240
are pretty good.

276
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,630
They each have their own advantages.

277
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,320
The only thing is that Yihe is further from Nanwu.

278
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,840
Also, the climate there is different from here.

279
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,790
You should consider this point.

280
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,790
Miss, which university did you graduate from?

281
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,910
Yihe University.

282
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,840
No wonder you know so much about it.

283
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,550
What's your major?

284
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,960
Network and New Media.

285
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,150
Wouldn't Nanwu University be a better choice

286
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,000
for this major?

287
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,960
If we just talk about this major,

288
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,790
actually,

289
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,390
Nanwu University's is the better choice.

290
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,870
Then why did you choose Yihe University?

291
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,360
What are you looking at me for?

292
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,440
Keep talking.

293
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,790
I want to know, too.

294
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,550
What's the reason?

295
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,270
At that time, I didn't plan to apply for this major.

296
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,200
Maybe,

297
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,550
I misjudged

298
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,720
the cut-off scores,

299
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,360
so I applied to Yihe University.

300
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,630
I'm full.

301
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,150
What's wrong with him?

302
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,720
Why is he being so sarcastic?

303
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,870
By the way, Yifan,

304
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,320
can I ask you something?

305
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,360
Did you

306
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,600
ever date my brother?

307
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,630
No.

308
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,000
I heard from my parents

309
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,840
that my brother had an early romance

310
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,870
in high school.

311
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,080
I just remembered.

312
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,600
Little rascal.

313
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,150
What's up?

314
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,120
Let's go home.

315
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,630
I just started eating.

316
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,840
I want to stay a bit longer.

317
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,390
Mom and Dad will be home soon.

318
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,870
They asked me to escort you back.

319
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,910
Let's go.

320
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,160
No, I want to eat more.

321
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,240
Eat? Who can eat more than you?

322
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,790
What are you staring at?

323
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,550
Sang Yan, why do I feel

324
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,440
like you don't treat Miss Yifan well?

325
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,480
She's nice, isn't she?

326
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,270
She's gentle when she talks.

327
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,720
But just based on apparences,

328
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,200
you two are worlds apart.

329
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
With your attitude,

330
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,240
girls definitely won't like it.

331
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,030
What attitude?

332
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,440
Girls generally like

333
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,720
gentle,

334
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,590
good-tempered,

335
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,200
attentive,

336
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,000
and considerate guys.

337
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,550
It's fine if their family situation isn't great.

338
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,550
Like Jiaxu.

339
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,160
Who?

340
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,720
Jiaxu.

341
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,590
You're quite knowledgeable, huh?

342
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,790
So,

343
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,750
since you don't have the advantage in looks,

344
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,830
you need to work harder.

345
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,590
Don't just stay at home,

346
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,400
sitting around.

347
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,270
Does your brother have any other job

348
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,480
besides running the restaurant?

349
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,160
He did before,

350
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,550
but recently, I don't know why, he quit.

351
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,590
Do you also think

352
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,240
my brother is a bit idle?

353
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,680
Today, she even asked me

354
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,790
about your work.

355
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,550
Why don't you stop at the parking lot?

356
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,680
It's just a few steps.

357
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
You can go up by yourself.

358
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,110
You're not going home tonight?

359
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,510
Aren't you afraid Mom and Dad will break your legs?

360
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,400
Let me know when you're home.

361
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,830
Transfer the fare to me.

362
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,400
Leaving?

363
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,160
I knew you had something going on!

364
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,420
♪The dust of lies and your wounds♪

365
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,060
♪All hide in your eyes♪

366
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:07,620
♪Jot down the wishes you've made before♪

367
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,940
♪Will you cherish my heart...♪

368
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,160
You didn't go home?

369
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,720
It's too noisy at home.

370
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,160
Could it be noisier than here?

371
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,400
When I was little, I loved fireworks.

372
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,070
Does your family set off fireworks for the New Year?

373
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,200
Not often.

374
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,680

00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,000
Grandpa is amazing.

564
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,920
Then I'll definitely enjoy this meal to the fullest!

565
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,510
Good.

566
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,750
An,

567
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,480
introduce her properly.

568
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,920
Grandpa, Grandma, this is Zhong Siqiao.

569
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,440
Zhong Siqiao?

570
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,550
She's...

571
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
I am...

572
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,510
living near a bridge

573
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,110
called Zhong Siqiao.

574
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,680
Exactly!

575
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,680
My name is Wang Linlin.

576
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,030
- Right. - Just call me Linlin.

577
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,350
Ma,

578
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,350
where's the Zhong Siqiao Bridge?

579
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,160
It's newly built!

580
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,200
- Right, newly built! - Newly built.

581
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,200
Newly built.

582
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
Miss Wang,

583
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,110
I've heard so much about you.

584
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,350
Grandpa,

585
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,310
the dishes you made look so delicious.

586
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,350
It's a shame they're cold.

587
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,440
Let's eat quickly.

588
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,110
Grandpa, please.

589
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,200
- Try it. - Come on.

590
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,830
Quick, try it.

591
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
This is my grandpa's specialty,

592
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,070
Kung Pao Shrimp.

593
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,350
This is white wine.

594
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,110
I'll go get some tissues.

595
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,720
Are you alright?

596
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,880
Quick!

597
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,790
Linlin is from Hunan.

598
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,510
Grandpa thinks Hunan folks love spicy food,

599
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,830
so he added a lot of chili.

600
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,830
But you, being from Hunan, need to keep up!

601
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,270
Right.

602
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,720
Here, cheers!

603
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,030
Move aside,

604
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,720
or it'll spill on you.

605
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,550
Grandma,

606
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,790
let me help you with the washing.

607
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,960
I'm good at washing cars.

608
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,110
I'll help you.

609
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,480
Is it okay in this cold weather?

610
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,640
It's fine. It's not cold.

611
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,160
Grandma,

612
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,720
these essential oils

613
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,920
all have the function of refreshing.

614
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,590
When get sleepy while driving,

615
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,750
you can sniff them,

616
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,000
apply them behind your ears, or on your neck.

617
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,510
It'll immediately lift your spirits.

618
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,160
You've studied this?

619
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,920
I often use them when I work night shifts.

620
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,000
You have my grandson as your personal ATM,

621
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,000
why are you still working so hard?

622
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,550
I know

623
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,400
you're not Wang Linlin.

624
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,590
I just searched it on the map app.

625
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,790
There's no Zhong Siqiao Bridge

626
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,070
around Nanwu at all.

627
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,790
Since Zhong Siqiao isn't a bridge,

628
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,350
that must be your real name.

629
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,510
Grandma,

630
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,400
you're really too smart.

631
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,270
All you old and young ones

632
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,480
don't tell me the truth.

633
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,480
Grandma, don't be mad.

634
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,030
We were wrong.

635
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,920
But there's some good news.

636
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,440
Su Haoan has broken up

637
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,030
with the real Wang Linlin.

638
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,110
He asked me to pretend to be his girlfriend

639
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,440
just to get you home for the New Year reunion.

640
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,930
I know what my grandson thought.

641
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,590
I don't blame you.

642
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,410
But I am really curious.

643
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,980
As a young girl,

644
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,240
you can wash cars,

645
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,590
install things,

646
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,200
and aren't afraid to walk barefoot.

647
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,800
What do you do for a living?

648
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,860
I just help out with everything,

649
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,790
fixing things,

650
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
queuing for tickets,

651
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,310
talking to the elderly,

652
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,920
taking the elderly to see doctors, and more.

653
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,410
Is there this kind of job?

654
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:32,900
Yeah.

655
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,190
I even have a service app.

656
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,480
There's a QR code on the business card.

657
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,310
You can scan it and place an order.

658
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,190
[Zhong Siqiao]
If you ever need any help,

659
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,080
you can find me.

660
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,630
Great.

661
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,520
I'll make sure my grandson

662
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,830
gives you a good review.

663
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,080
Thank you, Grandma.

664
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,790
I'll continue helping you install it.

665
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,960
There's a massage chair left.

666
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,750
Jiang, you're here!

667
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,310
No need to change shoes. Just come in and sit.

668
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,630
Why are you dressed so lightly?

669
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,920
Isn't it cold outside?

670
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,360
This is for you.

671
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,840
Sorry, I should've helped you with it.

672
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,030
Come in and sit.

673
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,280
Come on, let's sit inside.

674
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,920
Isn't it cold outside?

675
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,400
You're dressed too lightly.

676
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,760
I'll go get you a cup of water.

677
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
I didn't visit you before

678
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,590
because I didn't want

679
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,550
to disturb you.

680
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,550
I haven't seen you for so long.

681
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,190
I'm a bit excited.

682
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,920
Here, drink some water.

683
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,400
Warm up your hands.

684
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,400
Look at you,

685
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,000
you've got so thin.

686
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,760
Haven't you been eating properly?

687
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,190
If you want anything to eat, just tell me,

688
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,320
I'll come over and make it for you.

689
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,630
No need.

690
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,360
I'm eating well.

691
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,360
Besides, I have a roommate. It's not convenient.

692
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,230
I still have things cooking in the kitchen.

693
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,400
Knowing you were coming,

694
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,150
I made sweet dumplings specially for you.

695
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,880
You loved hot sweet dumplings when you were little.

696
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,550
Today

697
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,630
is the 15th day of the New Year.

698
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,320
This is when the family should reunite.

699
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,400
Here.

700
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,670
Hurry, eat it while it's hot.

701
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,550
Jiang,

702
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,110
you've grown up

703
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,400
and looked even prettier now.

704
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,510
Why don't I see Uncle Zheng?

705
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,000
And where's Zheng Kejia?

706
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,710
They

707
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,670
took her grandma back to their hometown.

708
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,280
No wonder you insisted I come over today.

709
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,480
Mom.

710
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,030
Mom.

711
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,230
Xin!

712
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,030
Why did you come down?

713
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:16,760
Who is he?

714
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,710
I told you last time

715
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,000
I wanted to introduce someone to you.

716
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,800
This is him.

717
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,320
He's the son of me and your Uncle Zheng.

718
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,320
He's your real brother.

719
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,920
His name is Zheng Kexin.

720
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,440
Mom, who is she?

721
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,610
She's your sister, Jiang.

722
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,230
She's also my child.

723
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,190
She's your real sister.

724
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,150
Why didn't you mention her to me?

725
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,590
She didn't mention you to me either.

726
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,280
Let me explain.

727
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,030
I was quite old

728
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,880
when I had him.

729
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,710
I even had a miscarriage before...

730
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,320
Xin!

731
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,150
Xin!

732
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,070
Who's this?

733
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,320
Isn't that Jiang?

734
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,000
How many years has it been since we last met?

735
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Let me take a good look at you!

736
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,780
She was embarrassed to see you.

737
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,440
What's embarrassing about that?

738
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,800
Jiang is not an outsider.

739
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,440
Come on,

740
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,710
let me take a good look at you.

741
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,150
Look at you,

742
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
you're so ungrateful.

743
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,230
You studied out of town for years

744
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,920
and never came back to see me,

745
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,710
honestly.

746
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,670
Why is she here?

747
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
It's a coincidence.

748
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,670
Your aunt just happened to come over.

749
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Jiang, don't act like that.

750
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:44,590
Jiang,

751
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,960
what are you doing now?

752
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:49,920
By the way,

753
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,590
my head hurt earlier, and my throat's sore.

754
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,400
Go get me some medicine.

755
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,030
Okay.

756
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,760
I'll get it for you.

757
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:00,630
By the way,

758
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,840
I have to tell you something.

759
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,400
Your cousin Wen Ming

760
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,030
is getting married this year.

761
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:10,920
Congratulations.

762
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,880
What's so great about it?

763
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,760
They got the certificate,

764
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,710
but they haven't settled on the wedding house yet.

765
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,590
So what?

766
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,030
You see,

767
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,150
before,

768
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,480
we took care of you for so long.

769
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,030
You should at least help him.

770
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,760
After all, you're just a girl.

771
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,070
You don't have many expenses.

772
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:30,670
Right?

773
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,670
Aunt,

774
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,400
I knew a lady lately.

775
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,710
She's very rich.

776
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,150
She's not very old,

777
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
two years younger than you.

778
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:41,760
How about this?

779
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,710
I could introduce her to Wen Ming.

780
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,510
That way, you won't have to worry about the wedding house.

781
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,650
What nonsense are you spouting?

782
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,590
That's the only way I can talk to you.

783
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,040
If I knew you were such an ungrateful person,

784
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,670
I shouldn't have taken care of you back then!

785
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,000

786
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,400

787

Before my dad passed away, he told me

794
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,760
to take good care of you.

795

I have no choice but to follow his will.

796
