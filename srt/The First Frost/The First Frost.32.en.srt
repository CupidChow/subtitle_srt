I could feel he was particularly flustered.

385
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,370
He has always been so calm

386
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,090
and not easily seen with his emotions,

387
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,940

00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,610

superficially told him that he'd be okay

394
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,370
and hoped that he'd be okay,

395
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,220

that he was really upset.

During the New Year's Eve dinner,

401
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,740
I had a secret conversation with Yifan

402
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,170
about my brother's high school days.

403
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,780
At that time, I was very depressed

404
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,130
because I saw that he,

fell into the lowest point of his life,

408
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,540
and became very upset every day.

409
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,090

00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,570
