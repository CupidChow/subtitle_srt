It's peeing everywhere

295
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,470

Simply put,

299
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,380
it just wants you to care more for it

300
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,620
and love it more.

301
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,710
The old Woodie stayed with me for seventeen years.

302
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,860
Why should it

303
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,060

304
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,230

You're still keeping them.

308
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,190

you haven't accepted Woodie Jr. yet?

310
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,340
Alright,

311
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,140
I'll gradually get used to it.

312
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,750
Do you often think of Grandma?

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,780

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,860
wouldn't it be better

317
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,750

318
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,990

how it feels

when someone suddenly realizes

321
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,910
they're often forgetting things?

322
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,380
I only know

323
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,230
that if I suddenly forget something,

324
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,580
I'll get very anxious.

325
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,300
Right.

326
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,670
Now, I write everything I need to do

327
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,510
on my phone,

328
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,620
so I won't forget.

329
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,300

330
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,230
recently,

00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:23,990

how to use my phone.

333
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,780

00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,270
to me.

336

337
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,950
many habits can't be changed.

339
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,990

343
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,340
may I ask

344
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,340
who is "Laughter"?

345
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,780
Look at this.

346
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,710
Who does she look like?

347
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,340
Is this...

Grandma?

349
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,750
When she was in a relationship with me,

350
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,190
she laughed so much.

351
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,910
So, I gave her a nickname

352
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,060
called Laughter.

353
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,710
Later, we often argued.

354
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,060
So I stopped calling her by her nickname.

355
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,470
But,

356
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,820
I was afraid I'd forget

357
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,510
about those happy days

358

between me and her.

359
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,190
So,

360
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,270
I had to write everything down quickly.

No, I want to try it myself.

376
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,060
Alright.

377
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,470
Then after you finish,

378
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,750
send me a picture to check.

379
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,910
Okay, bye.

380
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,230
So this is what a woman in love

381
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,670
is like.

382
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,370
[Uptown Flower City]

383
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,770
[Is this you? I'm not really sure, so I'm asking.]

384
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,710
I shouldn't be bothered by such trivial things.

385
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,290
[Delete]

386
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,010
[Fortune]

387
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,380
Sang Yan

388
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,750
should like what I posted.

389
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,310
Qiao!

390
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,860
Dian!

391
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,380
I bought you something.

392
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,040
Why did you buy so many things?

393
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,470
I went to the market to help out this morning,

394
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,470
and bought them on the way.

395
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,300
Here's the painting for you.

396
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,300
I promised to give you a painting last time.

397
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,060
I'll hang it for you.

398
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,340
You're so nice.

399
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,950
It looks great.

400
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,300
Check if it's straight.

401
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,670
Move this side down a bit.

402
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,190
This side?

403
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,430
Is it okay?

404
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,470
Move down a bit more.

405
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:02,710
Is it okay?

406
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,140
Good.

407
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:03,860
Alright.

408
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,750
I spent a long time picking this painting.

409
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,060
It symbolizes you and Sang Yan,

410
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,100
hand in hand,

411
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,950
walking through the cold winter together.

412
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,820
I wish you

413
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,470
a lifetime of happiness.

414
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,540
Is the size of it too small?

415
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,990
No.

416
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,030
Regret is also a kind of beauty.

417
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,510
Well, I'll go then.

418
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,030
Aren't you staying for dinner?

419
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,670
I don't want to interrupt you two.

420
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,380

You're back.

439
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,710
You've worked hard.

440
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,380
You finally get some rest.

441
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,270
What's keeping you busy?

442
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,510
I made you a nice meal.

443
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,380
It's to return your favor.

444
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,380
You made it?

445
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,270
You made it yourself?

446
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,100
It's not bought?

447
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,340
Why...

448
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,030
Make it like a candlelight...

449
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:41,990
dinner.

450
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,100
A simple version.

451
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,820
I'm

452
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:47,820
starting to eat.

453
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,140
You're eating so casually?

454
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,860
Aren't you going to comment?

455
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,060
What else would you expect?

456
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,950
Do you want me to say it's incredible

457
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,030
or that it's

458
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,380
unbelievably delicious?

459
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,270
What if I poisoned it?

460
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,510
Then you should eat it, too.

461
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,540
Let's go together later.

462
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,230
Don't you know that the person who cooks

463
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,510
usually doesn't have an appetite to eat?

464
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,270
But when I cook, I usually have a good appetite.

465
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:36,670
What's this?

466
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,100
Tofu soup.

467
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,430
Here.

468
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,670
Let me taste it.

469
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,230
There's tofu in it.

470
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,950
Actually, I've always wanted to tell you

471
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,100
these little lights...

472
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,580
don't really do anything.

473
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,100
Because when we sleepwalk,

474
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,510
we don't really react to light.

475
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,430
We just follow the usual path during the day

476
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,540
and go with some sensations.

477
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,910
But I'm still really touched.

478
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,340
I'll take them down later.

479
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,430
How come I never noticed

480
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,510
you're so dramatic before?

481
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,780
Maybe you didn't get enough to eat.

482
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,270
But since being with you,

483
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,300
my sleepwalking has decreased a lot.

484
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,510
It feels like pressure doesn't matter anymore.

485
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:45,990
These words

486
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,030
make me pretty happy.

487
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,910
At least I'm more useful than the little lights.

488
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,580
What I mean is...

489
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,510
no matter what, you'll always catch me.

490
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,430
I'm okay.

491
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,380
Eat up.

492
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,750
Wen Yifan.

493
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,540
No matter what,

494
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,710
I will always catch you.

495
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,060
Eat up.

496
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,060
From now on, you have to speak up about anything.

497
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,860
Or else, I'll just keep drawing butterflies for you.

498
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,300
Are you tired today?

499
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,100
No.

500
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,580
Then later,

501
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,750
how about watching a movie?

502
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,510
I heard there's a good thriller movie recently.

503
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,540
Aren't you tired?

504
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,670
No.

505
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,620
I slept all day.

506
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:09,990
Let's watch it later.

507
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,140
Wen Shuangjiang,

508
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,820
was your main goal just to watch the movie

509
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,780
or was it to be with me?

510
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,230
You.

511
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,470
I want to watch a movie with you.

512
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,820
Finish the dishes.

513
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,060
It's movie time!

514
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,030
Okay.

515
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,300
It's not a horror movie, right?

516
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,710
Do you want to watch a horror movie?

517
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,620
I'll change it for you, here.

518
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,540
Though it's a pity, but it's fine.

519
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,750
Maybe next time.

520
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,380
Let's change it.

521
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,060
No need.

522
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,230
I can't believe this.

523
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,230
Your relatives from your dad's side

524
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,470
are so shameless.

525
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,860
They've been at our house

526
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,380
for a week already.

527
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,620
Do they want to live here long-term?

528
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,950
No matter what, you're closer to them, right?

529
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,710
Can you take them away soon?

530
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,950
Also,

531
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,620
your aunt keeps asking Mom for money.

532
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,340
What does it have to do with us

533
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,860
that her son is buying a house to get married?

534
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,750
If you want to watch a movie with me,

535
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,100
can you focus for a moment?

536
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,140
Got it.

537
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,190
I'll throw my phone aside.

538
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,190
So, they've all come to Nanwu.

539
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,820
Why?

540
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,910
Why the face all of a sudden?

541
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,430
Nothing.

542
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,540
Focus on the movie.

543
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,820
Then,

544
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,950
want some fruit?

545
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,910
I'll go get it.

546
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,370
[Zheng Kejia: Mom asks, will you come home for New Year holiday?]

547
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,340
When did you get your holiday?

548
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:02,580
Your New Year holiday.

549
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,140
I've been off since the little New Year.

550
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,790
Ms. Qian specifically told me

551
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,910
I can't work overtime this time.

552
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,990
Are you going home?

553
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:18,950
No.

554
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,580
Let me calculate...

555
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:26,990
What are you calculating?

556
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,870
Calculating when should I come back to see you.

557
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,030
Why are you back?

558
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,060
Didn't you say that you won't be back until the 8th day?

559
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,100
There are too many relatives at home.

560
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:42,870
I don't have a place to stay.

561
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,740
Last year, you suddenly came back on New Year's Eve.

562
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,310
Was it because you don't like spending New Year's at home,

563
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,220
or...

564
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,220
Or what?

565
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,660
Or did I come back for you specifically?

566
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,430
Did you?

567
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,260
Sang Yan,

568
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,540
don't you want to know

569
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,950
why I didn't go back to celebrate the New Year with my mom?

570
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,990
I believe you will tell me

571
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,060
when you're ready.

572
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,140
Just now,

573
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,830
Zheng Kejia sent me some messages.

574
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,180
She said my mom asked if I'm going home for the New Year.

575
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,220
But my relationship with my stepfather's side

576
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,310
isn't very good.

577
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,430
Soon after

578
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,540
my dad passed away,

579
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,510
my mom remarried.

580
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,510
This is Uncle Zheng.

581
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,100
He's been helping

582
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,990
since your dad got sick.

583
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,660
Why are you silent?

584
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,260
Greet him.

585
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,060
You're so impolite!

586
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,060
What is

587
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,350
your plan for Yifan?

588
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,100
What's wrong?

589
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,260
Nothing.

590
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,430
I suddenly feel...

591
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,310
I'm glad I skipped class that day.

592
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,430
So, what happened later?

593
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,540
Why didn't you stay with your mom

594
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,310
and stepdad?

595
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,060
We didn't get along.

596
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,390
Not long after, I went to my grandma's place.

597
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,580
Yifan, I really miss you.

598
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,310
She cared so much about my dad,

599
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,620
so she cared for me, too.

600
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,470
Being cared for

601
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,700
is ultimately happy, right?

602
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,260
Even when life is tough.

603
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,100
I was sent to my uncle's house

604
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,510
when Grandma got sick.

605
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,390
I rarely hear you talk about these things.

606
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,660
What about your stepsister?

607
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,700
During the last dinner gathering,

608
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,030
she acted like she was really close to you.

609
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,180
That's just her personality.

610
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,100
She's been pampered

611
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,140
since she was little.

612
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,030
She always had the best of everything.

613
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,310
She never settled for less.

614
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,220
Even if there's a problem

615
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,140
or a difficulty,

616
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,870
she always gets others to solve it.

617
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,470
And I'm a few years older than her,

618
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,700
so it's only right to tolerate her.

619
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,390
Tolerate her?

620
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,660
Where did that rule come from?

621
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,990
You never tolerate your younger sister.

622
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,470
Can you eat properly?

623
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,510
Your bones are hurting me.

624
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,620
When will you gain some weight?

625
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,910
My friends say I've gained weight.

626
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,950
What nonsense.

627
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,740
Are they purposely trying to annoy me?

628
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,310
Is something wrong with you?

629
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,660
You want me to gain weight.

630
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,140
If I get fat, you'll pick on others.

631
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,180
Then you can attack me personally.

632
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,220
Wen Shuangjiang.

633
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,220
Don't project your stepsister's harsh words

634
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,950
and those nonsensical standards

635
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,870
onto me.

636
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,140
Do you understand?

637
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,520
Do you think everything in this house

638
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,430
was bought randomly?

639
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,470
Every item,

640
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,180
each one,

641
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,540
was chosen for you.

642
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,140
Also,

643
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,470
you said your stepsister has been pampered?

644
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,310
Just because of your taste in choosing a partner,

645
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,660
you deserve the best of everything.

646
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:12,990
