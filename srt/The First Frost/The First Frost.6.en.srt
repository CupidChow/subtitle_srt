Don't worry, Tian.

213

Just go back for the Spring Festival.

214

Your baby needs to rest

even if you don't.

216

Or is all of this

221
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,720
an arbitrary act?

222
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,390
Do you think my kid

223
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,270
will ask me where their dad is

224
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,150
in the future Spring Festivals?

225

Don't think too much.

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,800
I'll help you put the rest in the refrigerator.

So?

357
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,390
I probably can't help you with too much.

358
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,870
What?

359
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,560
I'm not very hungry.

360
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:24,910
I know.

361
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,120
The noodles you cooked

362
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,040
are pretty tasty.

363
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
Your expression

364
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,910
will make people think I intoxicated you.

365
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,800
I didn't know you could cook.

366
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,320
Is there anything I can't do?

367
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,040
Aren't there a lot?

368
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,800
Such as?

369
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,320
Such as

370

I'll eat later.

374
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,430
It's a little weird

375
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,000
for you to stare at me while I eat.

I can't find the poker cards.

589

Look for them yourself.

590

Okay, I'll get them for you later.

It's too noisy here.

He's killing his way back!

Aren't we supposed to watch movies and play cards at home?

Anyway, I haven't been home for a long time

613

616
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,310
Good!

617
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,670
But I can't go home too late.

618

Dian,

619
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,750
something's wrong with you.

620

Are you afraid of Sang Yan?

621

What does it have to do with Sang Yan?

622
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,920
One thing in the joint rent agreement

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,920
between Dian and Sang Yan

624
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,560
is both of them can't take friends home for fun.

625
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,750
And they can't go home too late.

626

Don't be so exaggerate.

Is Sang Yan

628
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,040
usually very fierce to you?

629
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,400
Why do I feel you fear him?

630
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,440
No, don't listen to Qiao's overstatement.

I'll tell you in advance next time.

756
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:00,920
Next time?

757
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,230
Do you want to punish me?

758
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,120
Okay, punishment.

759
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,630
So what will be the punishment?

760
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,710
I don't know.

761
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,190
It's up to you.

762
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,560
If it's up to me,

763
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,670
then...

764
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,520
Exchange.

765
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,190
Exchange for what?

766
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,310
Tomorrow,

767
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,630
I'll take someone home for dinner too.

768
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,120
Do you have a girlfriend?

769
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,750
I mean

770
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,960
you should tell your girlfriend

771
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,520
about our joint rent

772
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,600
if you have one

773
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,790
in case of misunderstandings.

774
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,790
I don't have a girlfriend.

775
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,040
But

776
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,310
don't be too happy about it.

777
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,710
I don't want one.

778
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,520
Okay.

779
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,560
So we'll talk about it

780
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,790
if you find a girlfriend

781
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:11,600
during our joint rent.

782
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,230
And of course,

783
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,310
I will tell you if I have a boyfriend.

784
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,000
Not interested.

785
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,750
Who is he going to bring back home?

Dad,

791
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,630
I think something's wrong

792
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:56,480
with my brother.

793
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,790
Your brother...

794
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,670
Let's toast!

795
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:04,350
Well, next...

796
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,480
I have things to do. I'm going out.

797
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,600
Where are you going on the Spring Festival Eve?

798
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,040
To meet a friend.

799
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,750
What friend?

800
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,790
Is it Jiaxu?

801
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,880
Meet him tomorrow even if you have to.

It's the Spring Festival Eve.

803
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,310
Come on, Ping.

804
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:17,830
It's the Spring Festival Eve.

805
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,270
It's fine.

806
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,630
It's because you spoiled him.

807
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,880
Why are you back?

808
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,270
Didn't you said you wouldn't be back until the eighth day of Spring Festival?

809
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,520
