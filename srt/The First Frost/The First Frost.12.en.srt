00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,200
It's on me!

192
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,250
That's what we've been waiting for!

193
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,350
Cheers!

194
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,470
Cheers, everyone!

195

Cheers!

196
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,730
Come on!

197
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,980
- Let's go! - Thanks.

198
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:52,920
Boss.

199
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,280
Why bother coming over?

200
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,870
You worked all day already.

201
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,680
We got this.

202
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,440
No need for you to worry.

203
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,230
Not welcome me?

204
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,350
Boss, what do you want to drink?

205
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,230
I'll mix one for you.

206
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,800
No drinking. I'm driving.

207
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,400
By the way,

208
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,750
your friends are holding a party upstairs.

209
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,350
Glad you came.

210
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,750
May I

211
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,350
stand on your left?

212
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,350
Why?

213
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,750
Because this way,

214
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,110
I'll be closer to your heart.

215
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,520
Just think of it as a reward

216
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,830
for my hard work these days.

217
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,990
Yifan.

218
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,080
Where's that classmate of yours?

219
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
We didn't see him today.

220
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,110
Who?

221
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,280
The one who's...

222
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
handsome and miserable.

223
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,080
Who?

224
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,680
Here.

225
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,160
Check out my idol.

226
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,680
Look at him.

227
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,950
Who stays this calm in a fire?

228
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,720
[This side profile is amazing!]
Happy, I am very happy...

229
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,870
Isn't that Senior Sang Yan?

230
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,080
Senior?

231
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,750
He's from our school, too?

232
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,520
Yeah.

233
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,440
He was in the same class as another senior I'm close with.

234
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,280
So, back then,

235
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,440
I tagged along

236
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,200
to their graduation dinner.

237
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,710
After the dinner,

238
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,520
did anything crazy happen?

239
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,680
Not really.

240
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,560
But I do remember one thing.

241
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,350
At the graduation dinner,

242
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,040
most people

243
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,160
had a few drinks,

244
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,080
except for two,

245
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,830
the legends of the Computer Science department,

246
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,630
Sang Yan and Duan Jiaxu.

247
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,350
One didn't touch a drop,

248
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,800
the other downed bottles like water,

249
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,680
over ten bottles.

250
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,950
Ten bottles?

251
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,200
Who drank them?

252
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,160
Sang Yan.

253
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,200
Are you okay?

254
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,440
I'm fine.

255
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,470
I'm just a little unsteady.

256
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,920
Unsteady, huh?

257
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,040
Let go.

258
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,680

Who's your senior?

262
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,710
I'm a Nanwu University student, too, you know.

263
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,230
Could you be a little nicer to me?

264
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,710
Wen Yifan.

265
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,590
Can you stand still?

266
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,040
Then do me a favor.

267
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,750
Open the car door.

268
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,750
Need help?

269
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,680
Yeah.

270
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:16,520
No.

271
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,750
You're clumsy

272
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,630
and careless.

273
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,230
You can't take care

Thanks.

You're awake?

289
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,320
Aren't you an actor?

290
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,110
That was terrible acting.

291
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,830
What?

292
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,320
I pulled

293
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,920
that little trick ages ago.

294
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,800
And you think it's your turn now?

295
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,230
What are you waiting for?

296
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,950

297
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,630

299
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,920
He's faking it. Can't you tell?

300
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,520
You're leaving, too?

301
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,240
The teacher

302
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,710
finally treated you guys to dinner.

303
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,920
Didn't Su Hao'an say

304
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,990
you were going on a night tour?

305
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,560
I'm not interested.

306
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,400
Then I'll get going.

307
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,520
Take care.

308
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,440
What's wrong?

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,830
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,400
Are you okay?

311
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,040
I'm fine, just...

312
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:55,990
I'm a little...

313
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,350
a little unsteady.

314
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,920
If you could...

315
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,560
give me a hand...

316
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,400
that'd be great...

317
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,480
Did you drink just now?

318
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,350
Why would a high schooler drink?

319
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,830
I thought it was juice.

320
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,080
So I just grabbed a cup.

321
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,110

Just go.

326
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,000
Sit here for a bit.

337
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,350
Yeah, I'm good.

338
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,830
I'm still unsteady.

339
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,080
Maybe put your shoulder under me?

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,190
Isn't this the same?

341
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,150
No, it's not stable.

this...

this position is kind of uncomfortable.

Is this better?

Alright,

347
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,390
then just...

348
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,720
Hold steady.

349
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,190
This is much better.

00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:47,560

384
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,190
Where are we going?

385
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,040
Sit down.

386
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,350
Drunkard.

387
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,040
Don't drink so much next time.

388
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,830
At your graduation,

389
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,040
you drank over ten bottles.

390
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,190
You're the real drunkard.

391
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,520
How do you know?

392
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,280
Why did you drink so much?

393
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:42,670
Goodbye.

394
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,110
Goodbye.

395
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,830
It's been so long.

396
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:31,910
I don't even remember anymore.

397
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,480
Shuangjiang.

398
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,760
Here.

399
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,190
Drink this honey water.

400
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,150
I don't want to, Dad.

401
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:36,670
Drink it.

402
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,480
Come on, be good.

403
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:38,910
Here.

404
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,350
It'll warm you up.

405
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,590
Your hands and feet won't be cold.

406
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,560
Drink it, then go to sleep.

407
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,320
Thank you, Sang Yan.

408
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,670
If...

409
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,630
the renovation smell still lingers...

410
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,190
you should stay here...

411
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,960
for a little longer.

412
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,720
Except for the two, legends of the Computer Science Department,

413
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,520
Sang Yan and Duan Jiaxu.

414
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,630
One didn't touch a drop,

415
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,630
the other downed bottles like water, over ten bottles.

416
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,800
Ten bottles?

417
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,870
Who drank them?

418
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,000
Sang Yan.

419
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,480
But that night,

420
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,350
he looked really off.

421
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,560
He was drinking alone,

422
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,630
barely saying a word.

423
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,630
He wouldn't listen to anyone.

424
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,760
Sang Yan,

425
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,560
was I really that bad to you?

426
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,720
I'll treat you better from now on.

427
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,870
Okay?

428
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,040
Sleepwalking again?

429
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
What triggers your sleepwalking?

430
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,630
Even being drunk can trigger it?

431
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,080
Just this once.

432
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,280
Just one impulsive moment.

433
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,830
Aren't you taking advantage of me this time?

434
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,150
Sang Yan,

435
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,390
I really hate

436
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,800
to meet you like this.

437
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,430
I just wanted to do...

438
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,280
what I really wanted to do back then.

439
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,320
Alright.

440
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,190

Did I really pretend to sleepwalk?

466
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,390
Did I really take advantage of him?

467
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,920
How could I hug him?

468
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,520
How could I hug him?

469
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,240
I was drunk.

470
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,670
Being drunk causes trouble.

471
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,350
I'm never drinking again.

472
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,720
Even if I do, I won't act recklessly.

473
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,040
If I ever get the chance,

474
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,150
I want to apologize to Sang Yan

475
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,830
for what happened while I was drunk

476
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,480
instead of carrying

477
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,910
the blame

478
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,150
for taking advantage of him.

479
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,040
I can't let this guilt weigh on me.

480
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,280
Sleep. Just sleep.

481
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,280
Everything will be fine tomorrow.

482
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
I made some porridge.

483
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Last night,

484
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,630
I think I sleepwalked again.

485
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,040
I didn't do anything weird, right?

486
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,080
You did.

487
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,110
You just...

488
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,520
hugged me for a moment.

489
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,040
You were pretty restrained.

490
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,520
Sorry.

491
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,630
How many times has this happened?

492
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,240
So,

493
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,480
why are you feeling guilty now?

494
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,560
I mean...

495
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,080
Weren't you pretty cocky before?

496
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,960
Every time we talked about this,

497
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,560
you always had excuses,

498
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,020
blaming it on being unconscious.

499
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,460
I'd say one thing, you'd argue back.

500
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,040
And in the end,

501
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,520
you even tried to pay me off.

502
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,590
Wasn't that you?

503
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,910
How about this?

504
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,150
From now on,

505
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,400
just keep yourself

506
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,790
locked in your room at night.

507
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,400
Try not to come out.

508
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,150
Do we have a beast at home?

509
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,440
Lock your door.

510
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,310
I can't exactly break in, can I?

511
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,080
Your sleepwalking is pretty unique.

512
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,790
It even involves taking advantage of people.

513
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,480
I never...

514
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,960
used to do that.

515
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,710
I don't know why.

516
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,360
So...

517
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,630
it's just me you take advantage of?

518
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,360
Or is this...

519
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,310
some new trick of flirting?

520
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,790
I'm starting to doubt you now.

521
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,270
Was it really sleepwalking?

522
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,310
Yes.

523
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,670
Today,

524
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,270
you're awfully quiet.

525
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,360
Am I?

526
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,670
Whenever we talk about this,

527
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,330
you usually have plenty of excuses.

528
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,790
But it's happened so many times.

529
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,560
That's true.

530
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,360
So now you just stay silent

531
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,310
and accept your guilt?

532
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,110
I'm full.

533
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,880
Hey, beast.

534
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,670
What?

535
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
Press the first floor.

536
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,040
I'm in a good mood today.

537
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,000
I have a meeting near the TV station.

538
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,520
I might as well give you a ride.

539
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,400
Thanks.

540
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,480
Not feeling well?

541
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,480
No.

542
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,480
Guess you burned all your energy sleepwalking.

543
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,150
Last night when you lifted my shirt,

544
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,230
you were pretty enthusiastic.

545
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,750
When did I lift your shirt?

546
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
How do you know you didn't?

547
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,920
Didn't you say

548
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,710
that all I did...

549
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,480
was hug you?

550
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,790
Then maybe I got mixed up.

551
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,670
It must've been last time.

552
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,270
It kept happening, after all.

553
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,230
I can't remember them all.

554
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:18,960
When I get time,

555
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,520
I'll really go get checked at the hospital.

556
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,080
Sorry for the trouble.

You've...

562
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,590
got something on your head.

563

On my head?

564
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,310
Left side.

565
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,920
Isn't this the left?

00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:53,790
Right side.

Come closer.

570
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,400
Come closer.

571
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,040
Alright, done.

572
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,040

620

try using this next time you sleep.

621
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,190
It might stop the sleepwalking.

623

Isn't the package way too big?

625

No need to thank me.

I won't take up much of your time.
