48
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,570
I've learned a bit

49
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,220
about your situation.

50
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,340
I've been through

51
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,540
the same thing.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,170
Back then, I dragged him

At that moment,

55
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,100
I thought maybe dying wasn't so bad.

56
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,690
But later, I realized

57
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,020
dying with someone like him

58
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,850
wasn't worth it.

59
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,340

63
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,730
I was just a kid then.

64

All I could do was cry.

65
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,610
I usually cried the whole night.

00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,650
Do you even have a conscience?

192
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:20,980
Sister,

193
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,130
don't be mad.

194
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,610
I was wrong.

195
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,460
I swear...

196
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,530
I won't do it again.

197
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,610
Never again.

198
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,770
All right?

199
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,730
Listen to me,

200
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,220
just act like nothing happened today.

201
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,530
Just say you were drunk.

202
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,130
Understand?

203
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,370
Wasn't I drunk anyway?

204
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,110
- You... - Look at you.

205
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,490
When I found out Che Xingde

206
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,490
killed someone for this,

207
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,060
I was so scared I almost dropped my phone.

208
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,730
But deep down,

209
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,980
I knew I had to stay calm.

210
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,770
I had to call the police.

211
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,100
Or else, the next one to die would be me.

212
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,100
You're very brave.

213
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,980
All right.

214
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,180
I shouldn't shed tears for that villain.

215
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,530
Talking to you

216
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,890
makes me feel a lot better.

217
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,460
I'm not afraid of getting hurt.

218
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,370
I want the truth

219
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,100
to come to light.

220
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,650
It will.

221
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,060
We're not just victims.

222
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,580
We are people who bravely protected ourselves.

223
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,770
Yifan.

224
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,850
Ms. Qian said

225
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,060
we should head over now.

226
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,820
I'll go get ready.

227
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,940
Thank you for today.

228
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,250
If anything comes up, reach out anytime.

229
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,730
The victim's description

230
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,610
matches the missing person, Guo Ling.

231
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,650
She was murdered while studying at Beiyu High School.

232
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,580
Guo Ling,

233
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,730
do you remember me?

234
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,340
I'll pay you back for the bus fare later.

235
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,650
We probably live nearby.

236
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,580
It's fine. No need.

237
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,130
Thank you, then.

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,580
By the way,

239
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,700
I'm Wen Yifan.

240
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,770
What about you?

241
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,770
I'm Guo Ling.

242
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,490
I just transferred to Beiyu High School.

243
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,610
I'm in Class Four.

244
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,650
What about you?

245
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,100
I'm in Class Eight.

246
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,580
Class Eight?

247
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,770
That's the advanced class.

248
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,940
You must be really smart.

249
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,250
[Sang Yan]
Call me when you're done with work.

250
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,010
Off work?

251
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,490
Where are you?

252
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,220
At the hotel?

253
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,940
I found a guesthouse.

254
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,460
Are you tired?

255
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,530
I'm okay.

256
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,490
Sang Yan...

257
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,420
something happened with Che Xingde.

258
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,100
He's a suspect

259
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,890
in this murder case.

260
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,300
He's still on the run.

261
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,300
Maybe...

262
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,460
maybe I'm overthinking.

263
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,580
But I'm worried he might come after you.

264
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,490
Be extra careful when you go out,

265
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,130
okay?

266
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,130
This time, you went to Beiyu

267
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,610
just for this?

268
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,650
Why are you

269
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,580
always worrying about me, a grown man?

270
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,060
Wen Shuangjiang,

271
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,490
you're the one who needs

272
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,250
to be careful.

273
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,300
And also,

274
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,100
make sure to listen

275
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,730
to that recording pen.

276
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,370
With you here in person,

277
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,060
why should I bother with a recording?

278
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,460
Saying some things out loud

279
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,820
just feels too cheesy.

280
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,250
Oh, right.

281
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,220
Today,

282
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,340
I ran into

283
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,890
a policewoman I used to know.

284
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,340
Remember when I reported it back then?

285
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,580
After I moved out of my Uncle Wen's house,

286
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,940
she took me in for a while.

287
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,980
Seeing her today made me happy.

288
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,180
It brought back a lot of feelings.

289
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,250
She was really good to me.

290
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,940
Her daughter, Chen Xi, was too.

291
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,730
Next time we get a chance,

292
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,100
let's visit her together.

293
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,770
Sure.

294
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,940
What about when Chen Xi gets married?

295
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,820
Let's go together.

296
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,890
I saw on her social media

297
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,820
that her boyfriend proposed.

298
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,820
I'm not sure when exactly the wedding will be.

299
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,700
We'll see if you're free when the time comes.

300
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,730
Wen Shuangjiang,

301
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,250
are you hinting at something?

302
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,770
What?

303
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,890
Your birthday's coming up, isn't it?

304
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,650
Make sure to wish

305
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,730
for something good this year.

306
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,300
And I,

307
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,980
as always,

308
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,980
will make it happen.

309
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,370
I'll hang up now.

310
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,490
All right.

311
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,370
If you're tired, get some rest.

312
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,460
Goodnight.

313
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,770
Coming.

314
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,890
Hello, Mr. Guo.

315
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,420
Who are you looking for?

316
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,890
I'm a friend of Guo Ling.

317
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,940
I want to visit her.

318
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,220
Please come in.

319
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,490
I'm a reporter from Nanwu TV.

320
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,980
But don't worry,

321
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,530
I won't interview you.

322
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,620
Have a seat.

323
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,460
When Ling was three,

324
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,700
her mother passed away.

325
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,380
I was busy running my stall,

326
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,140
up early and home late,

327
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,010
barely having time for her.

328
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,140
She was always

329
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,460
a well-behaved,

330
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,420
quiet child.

331
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,730
She would often hide away in her room,

332
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,620
writing things on her own.

333
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,700
But I never encouraged her.

334
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,730
I always thought the things she wrote about,

335
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,050
romance, dreams...

336
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,860
were just unrealistic.

337
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,420
That night,

338
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,730
we had an argument.

339
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,730
It was the first time she ever talked back to me.

340
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,140
I never thought...

341
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,460
it'd be the last.

342
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,770
Ling.

343
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,140
Why are you just sitting there?

344
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,180
Come help me

345
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,890
sort things for tomorrow's stall.

346
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,140
Dad,

347
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,700
look at what I wrote!

348
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,530
I really love writing.

349
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,250
I want to get published.

350
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,460
I don't want to see it.

351
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,460
Who's going to read

352
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,770
that worthless nonsense?

353
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,730
Dad, don't say that.

354
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,490
My dream

355
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,050
is to become a bestselling author!

356
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,980
I have a dream, too!

357
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,180
My dream

358
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,460
is figuring out how to make money

359
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,330
so I can put food on the table.

360
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,600
But I can't just spend

361
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,250
my whole life

362
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,290
selling goods with you outside.

363
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,940
I have my own dreams.

364
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,420
What's wrong with selling things?

365
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,250
Does it embarrass you?

366
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,220
Writing novels can make money, too.

367
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,290
You?

368
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,810
Make money from writing?

369
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:35,810
Let me see.

370
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,860
Where's the money?

371
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,330
Money? Where is it?

372
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,380
If you're not helping, just go to bed!

373
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,730
Unbelievable!

374
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,420
I never thought...

375
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,460
after she said those words,

376
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,940
she'd never come back.

377
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,860
All these years,

378
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,220
I thought she was mad at me,

379
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,460
hiding away, writing,

380
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,090
refusing to come home.

381
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,140
Tell me...

382
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,420
If back then,

383
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,420
I had cared just a little more,

384
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,770
maybe she wouldn't have run away.

385
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,700
Maybe by now,

386
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,810
she really would've

387
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,940
made a name for herself

388
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,330
and become the author she always dreamed of being.

389
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,770
I should've been the father she relied on.

390
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,250
But...

391
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,050
I was the one who led her to that monster.

392
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,660
I deserve to die.

393
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,330
I deserve to die!

394
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,400
Mr. Guo, stop!

395
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,860
This isn't your fault.

396
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,490
Calm down.

397
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,730
She let her guard down

398
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,250
because he was the neighbor.

399
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,380
Don't worry.

400
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,570
Once the verdict is out, I'll report it as it is.

401
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,700
I just hope no one else

402
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,940
goes through the same thing.

403
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,860
Thank you.

404
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,460
Thank you.

405
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:18,960
Hello?

406
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:19,940
What's the situation?

407
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,090
Che Xingde is still on the run.

408
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,570
But Che Yanqin

409
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,180
has been detained, I think.

410
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,460
Are you coming back to Nanwu?

411
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,290
When will you be back?

412
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,290
We're planning to head back soon.

413
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,460
But I just got a call.

414
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,770
They want me at the police station

415
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,620
to assist with the investigation.

416
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,570
Also...

417
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,530
Che Xingde

418
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,010
might be back in Nanwu.

419
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,700
Be extra careful when you go out,

420
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,290
okay?

421
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,490
You're the one who should be careful.

422
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,460
I'll be waiting for you at home.

423
00:21:54,020 --> 00:22:13,860
[Tea]

424
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,570
Did you see that?

425
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,140
Yifan,

426
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,290
I sent you the files.

427
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,010
I'm heading out.

428
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,570
All right, take care.

429
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,220
Bye.

430
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,090
I'm leaving now, Yifan.

431
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,140
Just swap

432
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,770
those two around.

433
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,900
See? Super simple.

434
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,730
Got it?

435
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,460
All right, finish up and head home.

436
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:36,980
Thanks.

437
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,810
Bye.

438
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,570
Yifan,

439
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,700
why hasn't

440
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,420
that relative of yours

441
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,250
been reported?

442
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,810
The police are still investigating.

443
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,090
We're waiting for the confirmed results.

444
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,810
Hope they can bring that villain

445
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,490
to justice soon.

446
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,900
I hope so, too.

447
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,460
All right,

448
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,490
I'll get going.

449
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,620
You should head home soon, too.

450
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,700
Stay safe.

451
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,490
[Sang Yan]
Let me know when you're done working.

452
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,810
I'll come pick you up.

453
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,140
[Wen Yifan]
Okay. Come at 8:30.

454
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,090
If I ever hit rock bottom,

455
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,570
no matter where you go,

456
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,900
I'll always find you.

457
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,290
I'm not feeling great today.

458
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,460
I think I'll just head home.

459
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,450
Lower the overall saturation

460
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,420
a bit more.

461
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,700
And then, these two characters...

462
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,460
- Sang Yan. - ...should be enlarged.

463
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,140
Going or not?

464
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,770
These two?

465
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,810
To Overtime.

466
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,570
I'm not going.

467
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,290
Right.

468
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,250
Right here.

469
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:52,860
Okay.

470
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,090
Does this part need any adjustments?

471
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,620
Bro.

472
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,900
Why aren't you going again?

473
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,380
I've got to pick up my girlfriend from work.

474
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,090
You two can't stand

475
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,810
even a little time apart, huh?

476
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,460
Right?

477
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,460
When are you free?

478
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,700
Let's get together for a hot pot.

479
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,770
It has been ages since we hung out.

480
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,380
With who?

481
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,180
A bunch of couples.

482
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,420
Sure.

483
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,290
Wait for me.

484
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,730
I'm wrapping up here.

485
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,010
Come pick me up now.

486
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,900
[Okay]

487
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,180
Che Xingde is still on the run.

488
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,660
But Che Yanqin

489
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,490
has been detained, I think.

490
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:38,730
Also...

491
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,700
Che Xingde

492
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,010
might be back in Nanwu.

493
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,700
Hello, I'd like to report a crime.

494
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,250
I'm at the entrance of Nanwu TV station.

495
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,620
I spotted the suspect, Che Xingde.

496
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,860
Yes.

497
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,250
He's been

498
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,380
harassing me nonstop.

499
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,380
Luckily, they came home early.

500
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,380
What are you doing here?

501
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,250
None of your business!

502
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:52,940
Let go of me.

503
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:53,940
Let go!

504
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,570
Tired from running all this time?

505
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,570
Wouldn't it be easier to sit back and enjoy your time in prison?

506
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,140
Why don't you try it yourself?

507
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,810
Why weren't you answering your phone?

508
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:26,920
Hello?

509
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,370
Hello?

510
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,660
Who's this?

511
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,940
I just found this phone.

512
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,660
The owner

513
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,860
got stabbed in a fight.

514
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,420
What?

515
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,700
Where are you guys?

516
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,420
Here!

517
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:10,810
I'm here!

518
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:12,770
Here!

519
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,380
Were you the one who answered the phone?

520
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:14,900
Yeah.

521
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,700
Where is he now?

522
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,220
He just got taken to the hospital.

523
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,900
Are you his girlfriend?

524
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,770
Is his name Sang Yan?

525
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,220
I don't know.

526
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,010
I just saw a tall, skinny guy.

527
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,140
His hands were covered in blood.

528
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,620
His stomach got slashed, too.

529
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,980
The blood just kept flowing.

530
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,380
That much blood...

531
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,090
Did the medics say anything?

532
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,090
He was taken

533
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,220
to Nanwu Central Hospital.

534
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,770
Thank you.

535
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,620
His phone!

536
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,090
Thanks.

537
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,770
Hurry!

538
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,700
It'll be okay...

539
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,730
It'll be okay...

540
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,090
I love you.

541
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,770
So, so much.

542
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,460
Do you understand?

543
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,180
Can you go any faster?

544
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,420
See?

545
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,250
So much traffic.

546
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,380
Miss, are you all right?

547
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,250
Wen Shuangjiang.

548
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,490
Stay safe at work.

549
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,010
Your man

550
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,570
wants you home safe.

551
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,220
Wen Shuangjiang.

552
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,490
Stay safe at work.

553
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,940
Your man

554
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,490
wants you home safe.

555
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,700
Sir,

556
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,530
is there another route we can take?

557
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,810
Nope.

558
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,250
What's going on today?

559
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,420
Traffic's a total mess.

560
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,140
Just pull over here, please.

561
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,980
[Unknown caller]

562
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,200
Hello?

563
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,810
Is that you, Sang Yan?

564
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,460
Wen Shuangjiang...

565
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,380
Are you okay? Where are you hurt?

566
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,900
I'm fine.

567
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,460
Just a small cut on my hand.

568
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,250
You call that fine?

569
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,700
I saw so much blood.

570
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,980
Most of it was probably Che Xingde's.

571
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,770
I swear. I'm okay.

572
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,000
Don't worry so much.

573
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,340
I already told you. I'm fine.

574
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,380
I'll head home myself later.

575
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,570
I still need to make a statement here.

576
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,530
It might take some time.

577
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,980
Where are you now? I'll come to you.

578
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,620
I'm at...

579
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,490
Central Hospital's emergency room.

580
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,570
Got it.

581
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,090
Sir.

582
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,620
Thank you.

583
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,250
Okay, Mr. Sang.

584
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,490
Once you're done with treatment,

585
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,940
we'll come back to check in with you.

586
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,940
All right. Thank you.

587
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,530
Excuse me.

588
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,730
Is there a patient

589
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,530
named Sang Yan here?

590
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,530
Over there.

591
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,660
Thank you.

592
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,420
No problem.

593
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,130
Besides the eight stitches on your hand,

594
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,260
is your stomach wound all right?

595
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,090
It's fine now.

596
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,980
Okay then.

597
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,340
If there's any update,

598
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,300
let us know.

599
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,490
Got it. Thanks.

600
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,530
Just a small cut?

601
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,010
A small cut needed eight stitches?

602
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,210
Well...

603
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,570
not only do you not care about me,

604
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,610
but you're actually mad at me?

605
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,860
Why did you go after him?

606
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,130
What?

607
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,130
Did I do something wrong?

608
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:01,900
When you saw him,

609
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,460
why didn't you just call the police?

610
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,860
What if he ran away?

611
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,050
Do you always have to play the hero?

612
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,420
What's wrong with you?

613
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,380
I don't like you doing this.

614
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,170
Can you just stay out of this?

615
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,820
Don't make me regret telling you this, okay?

616
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,050
Go to work.

617
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,740
Come home.

618
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,170
Just be safe. Is that so hard?

619
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,170
I don't even care about this anymore.

620
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,340
Even if I want Che Xingde

621
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,570
to rot in prison forever,

622
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,420
that thought...

623
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,090
doesn't compare to my fear of losing you!

624
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,490
Why aren't you happy?

625
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,940
Che Xingde was caught.

626
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,650
Your aunt paid the price.

627
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,170
That girl finally got justice.

628
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,570
And...

629
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,130
this time,

630
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:16,940
I protected you.

631
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,010
I actually care a lot.

632
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,900
I care so much.

633
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,940
Back then, when I said I wouldn't chase after you,

634
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,050
I really meant it.

635
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,210
But now I think...

636
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,340
why does a man like me

637
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,570
care so much about pride?

638
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,570
Why did I

639
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,250
hold this grudge for so many years?

640
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,250
Back then, young and reckless,

641
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,020
loving someone

642
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,340
meant giving you everything,

643
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,940
and lowering my pride over and over.

644
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,770
But...

645
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,130
but at the same time,

646
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,420
your words could tear me apart so easily.

647
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,540
I told myself,

648
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,250
for the rest of my life,

649
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,610
I would never step into your world again.

650
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,900
But I knew I was lying.

651
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,130
I knew all I could do was wait, hopelessly.

652
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,770
Still, for the sake of dignity,

653
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,170
for the sake of saving face,

654
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,060
I thought...

655
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,650
I could never be the one

656
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,540
to reach out first again.

657
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,940
But now, I regret it.

658
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,940
I regret spending two whole years

659
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,500
only thinking about

660
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,340
how I was the weaker one in this relationship.

661
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,210
Yet, not once did I try to pull you out of it.

662
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,940
I never even noticed the pain and despair

663
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,900
you kept buried so deep.

664
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,250
Stop.

665
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,940
This was my fault.

666
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,940
It's not on you.

667
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,900
The only one to blame is that villain, Che Xingde.

668
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,940
So, Wen Shuangjiang,

669
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,690
I did it this time.

670
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,060
Can you be happy for me?

671
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,940
I put that villain behind bars.

672
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,090
Can you stop crying now?

673
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,020
Come on, I'm the one in pain from the stitches.

674
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,820
Why are you crying so much?

675
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,210
What are you doing?

676
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,340
If you keep crying,

677
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,170
I'll...

678
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,170
Take care.

679
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,820
Don't you feel bad for me?

680
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,210
All right. I'm fine now.

681
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,730
It doesn't hurt at all.

682
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,090
Wen Shuangjiang,

683
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,020
what's with you?

684
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,060
Weren't you

685
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,770
covering this news?

686
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,290
How could I be in the mood for that?

687
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,940
When my house burned down,

688
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,860
you were eager to report on it.

689
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,210
That was different.

690
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,210
All right. It's over now. Let's go.

692
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,060
I'm really fine. Just a few scratches.

Are you okay?

694
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,380
