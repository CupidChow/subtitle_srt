00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,010
Let me think.

190
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,690
I went to the place

191
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,490
where your father, mother,

192
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,840
and your brother had the accident.

193
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,250
It was so empty,

194
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,400
yet so beautiful.

195
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,400
I spent the whole day there.

196
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,840
I stayed there

197
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,610
from morning till night.

198
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,130
Did you see it?

199
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,760
I didn't expect

200
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,890
that after all these years,

201
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,370
this place has become even more beautiful.

202
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:27,970
If we get the chance,

203
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,280
I'll bring you all here again.

204
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,250
How about that?

205
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,160
Going back there,

206
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,010
you must have been so sad.

207
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,970
I was thinking,

208
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,890
ten years

209
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
have gone by,

210
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,970
and our whole family

211
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,760
has never mentioned the accident.

212
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,130
I'll go slice some fruit.

213
00:08:59,250 --> 00:08:59,890
No need!

214
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:01,490
Come.

215
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,010
Sit down.

216
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,010
We should have a serious talk.

217
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,680
Okay.

218
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,800
After the accident,

219
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,490
our whole family has been silent about it.

220
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,730
But actually, it's been stuck in our hearts.

221
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,130
We can't forget it,

222
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,160
but

223
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,850
we're also avoiding it.

224
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,520
I was just thinking,

225
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:38,920
how nice it is

226
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,890
that I still have you all!

227
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,400
We need to live well!

228
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,490
We need to forget all the sad things

229
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,490
one by one.

230
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,800
Is that okay?

231
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,310
Okay.

232
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,610
Is that okay?

233
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,610
I'm ready now. I'm coming over.

234
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,010
I've been drinking.

235
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,520
Should I have someone pick you up?

236
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,160
No, I'll come over myself.

237
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,130
Be careful on your way.

238
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
Yifan, bye.

239
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,520
- Bye. - Bye, Yifan.

240
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,210
See you later.

241
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:30,800
Yifan.

242
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,400
What's wrong?

243
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,280
You look so pretty today.

244
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,890
I'm going to attend

245
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,210
a friend's wedding banquet.

246
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,520
I have something to tell you.

247
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,760
I'll go down with you.

248
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,210
But now that you two are together,

249
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,330
there's something I want to explain to you.

250
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,160
Actually,

251
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,850
what I said before

252
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,680
about Sang Yan's speech at the graduation ceremony

253
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,280
was all made up by me.

254
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,130
At the graduation dinner,

255
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,010
someone asked Sang Yan,

256
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
"Is what's unattainable always the best,

257
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,330
and is that why you're so sad?"

258
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,210
He said,

259
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,400
"Do you think I could be that devoted?"

260
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,760
But there really was a senior who said

261
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,280
he had been a backup for years.

262
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,160
But I can't really remember the details.

263
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,250
I was unsure how to face you

264
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,920
because of this.

265
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,370
But now, I've come to terms with it.

266
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,370
Why are you saying this now?

267
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,850
Because I'm afraid

268
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,490
those words might affect your relationship.

269
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,280
They won't.

270
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,490
That's good.

271
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,210
I wish you a future

272
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,730
without pressure,

273
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,090
whether it's in work,

274
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,520
life,

275
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,090
or relationships.

276
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,250
Actually, I think

277
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,610
sometimes it's fine to just let things be.

278
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:19,920
I wish you happiness.

279
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,920
Thank you.

280
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:23,560
You, too.

281
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,440
Thank you.

282
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,250
Enjoy your meal.

283
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:47,970
Take your time.

284
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,130
Guys,

285
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,760
let me introduce

286
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,010
today's leading lady,

287
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,160
my wife, Shiwen.

288
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,730
Hello, everyone.

289
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,520
These are my colleagues from the restaurant,

290
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,370
and these are my college roommates.

291
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,760
We're all really good friends.

292
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,280
Why does she look so familiar?

293
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,160
Stop seeking attention, Chen Junwen.

294
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,850
But he's the matchmaker.

295
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,440
Without him,

296
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,560
we wouldn't be together.

297
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,330
Thanks a lot.

298
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,610
I'll drink with you more later, okay?

299
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:08,680
Enjoy your meal, Miss.

300
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,160
Sorry, I'm late.

301
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,520
Did I miss something?

302
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,760
You came at just the right time.

303
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,090
Let's drink more later.

304
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,370
I'll go greet others.

305
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,640
Where have you been for so long?

306
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,090
How dare you be late on such an important day?

307
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,160
Take a taxi back to Yihe now!

308
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,440
Su Haoan,

309
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,330
you've had quite a lot of issues with me lately.

310
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,090
It's just because you're too handsome.

311
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,090
This is Duan Jiaxu, right?

312
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,090
Didn't you meet him last time?

313
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,160
He's quite handsome.

314
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,560
He hasn't changed much.

315
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:35,920
Is he handsome?

316
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
This picture is pretty average.

317
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,520
He looks a bit dull.

318
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:43,920
Yu Zhuo,

319
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,760
is he handsome?

320
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,040
Let me check properly.

321
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,370
You're not really in love with Duan Jiaxu, are you?

322
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,520
Su Haoan,

323
00:13:59,130 --> 00:13:59,730
is he handsome?

324
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,560
He's just okay.

325
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,640
He's not even a fraction as handsome as me.

326
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
What's wrong with you?

327
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,370
I can tell now.

328
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,490
No wonder you blush every time you see me.

329
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,730
Thanks. I'm going to throw up.

330
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,850
But you haven't even drunk yet.

331
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,920
Chen Junwen.

332
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,010
Chen Junwen.

333
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,280
What?

334
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,800
Is he handsome?

335
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,680
- Of course, he's handsome. - I mean...

336
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,520
Who's handsomer, him or me?

337
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,330
Well, obviously, Jiaxu is more handsome.

338
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,280
There's no doubt about it.

339
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,330
Have you eaten enough?

340
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,850
If so, head home.

341
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,560
Duan Jiaxu,

342
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,400
you haven't drunk.

343
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,490
Later, take my sister back home.

344
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,330
I just got here.

345
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,370
Don't mind him.

346
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,850
I've thought it through.

347
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,850
There's the fairest way.

348
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,040
I'll count to three,

349
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,330
and we'll pick the most handsome one we think.

350
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:50,890
How about it?

351
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,970
Okay.

352
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,130
- It's fair. - Come on.

353
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:53,760
One.

354
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,400
Two.

355
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,890
Three!

356
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,370
Call me when you're here.

357
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,160
Sang Yan,

358
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,090
is your girlfriend coming or not?

359
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:03,800
You've been hiding her for so long.

360
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,210
Or...

361
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
did you just make this up?

362
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,520
I think so.

363
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,490
Yeah, boss.

364
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,800
Will she really come?

365
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,760
Exactly.

366
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:14,610
Will she come or not?

367
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,920
Look,

368
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,040
he's on the phone.

369
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,330
I'm getting in the car now.

370
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,520
I'll go find you directly.

371
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:27,920
Let's wait and see.

372
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,040
Let's look forward to it.

373
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,920
What's up? The delivery's here?

374
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,160
What did you order?

375
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,970
Share with us.

376
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,280
Takeout?

377
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
After the banquet, I'll drive you home.

378
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,970
Okay.

379
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,040
Let's go, sir.

380
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,330
Stop here, thanks.

381
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,040
What are you doing here?

382
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,640
I've been waiting for you.

383
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,520
Have you drunk?

384
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,440
Anyone with a girlfriend had to drink.

385
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,280
Will I have to drink, too?

386
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,250
Of course.

387
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:22,850
But,

388
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,520
your boyfriend here has already taken care of that for you.

389
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,250
How much did you drink?

390
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:27,920
I don't know.

391
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,440
I really don't know my limits.

392
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:07,200
Sang Yan,

393
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,400
so your girlfriend is Wen Yifan?

394
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,400
What's wrong?

395
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,370
She's the one you've been talking about,

396
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,920
the girl who's been madly flirting with you?

397
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,770
You actually said that?

398
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,050
Where's Duan Jiaxu?

399
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,370
Duan Jiaxu didn't drink.

400
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,400
So he took Sang Zhi home.

401
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,640
How can Duan Jiaxu miss

402
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,610
such an absurd lie he told?

403
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,000
Wen Yifan, say something.

404
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,290
Slap his shameless face!

405
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,240
Look at him now,

406
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,960
so arrogant and self-righteous.

407
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:30,920
So disgusting!

408
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,860
I do admit,

409
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,770
but it's not about flirting,

410
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,440
It's about pursuing.

411
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,370
Su Haoan,

412
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,480
you said

413
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,050
there was a girl Sang Yan couldn't get

414
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,160
back in high school.

415
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,810
So, that girl is...

416
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:47,640
Yes.

417
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,640
Honestly,

418
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,680
when Sang Yan asked me

419
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,370
if Duan Jiaxu was handsome,

420
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,770
I felt quite strange.

421
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,770
"Who's handsomer,

422
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,770
Duan Jiaxu or me?"

423
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,680
I vote for you.

424
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,330
No need.

425
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,720
I never

426
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,000
force others to make their choices.

427
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,810
I'm sincere.

428
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,290
Really?

429
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,850
Otherwise, I wouldn't

430
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,920
have pursued you so crazily.

448

is actually the first to get married in our class.

449
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,770
Right. We've been out of college for years.

450
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,720
Do you remember

451
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,400
what happened at our graduation dinner?

452
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,160
He got drunk and embarrassed himself so much.

453
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,850
He kept complaining about himself,

454
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,380
saying how long he's been a backup.

455
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,160
Do you remember that?

456
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,480
Wan Lin,

457
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,050
was I just your backup for four years in college?

458
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,770
Bro.

459
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:38,710
Wan Lin...

460
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,480
You've got drunk again.

461
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,680
That's not Wan Lin. You've got the wrong person.

462
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,440
Come over here.

463
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,810
Come here.

464
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,090
This is Wan Lin...

465
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,400
This isn't Wan Lin either.

466
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,400
Wan Lin...

467
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,130
Wan Lin's not here. Hey...

468
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,920
Wan Lin,

469
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,240
for four years in college,

470
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,370
was I really your backup?

471
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,870
Every time he gets drunk, he acts like this. Here.

472
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,960
Am I just your backup...

473
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,200
No?

474
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,970
- Don't move. - Wen Yifan?

475
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,680
Shut your mouth.

476
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,810
Shut up.

477
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:03,810
No more talking.

478
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,200
Am I just your backup?

479
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,440
Sleep!

480
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,130
Backup is fine.

481
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,090
Beauty, sorry.

482
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,850
Sorry, I mistook you.

483
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,850
You two need to calm down, okay?

484
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:18,720
Qian Fei!

485
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,440
Qian Fei!

486
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,130
Come here!

487
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,680
- Come here. - Sit here.

488
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,290
Didn't Sang Yan say so?

489
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,960
Stop talking bad about me.

490
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,130
Sang Yan was also drunk at the time.

491
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,400
He sat there.

492
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,640
I don't know if he mistook me

493
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,200
for someone else.

494
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,920
He kept mumbling.

495
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,480
Mumbling?

496
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,920
Wen Yifan,

497
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,330
here, let me toast to you.

498
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,720
Congratulations on you and Sang Yan being together.

499
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,330
Bro, you're crushing me.

500
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,130
Everyone who's single should drink.

501
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,400
I'm not drinking.

502
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Right, Wen Yifan must drink.

503
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,750
[Qian Fei & Zeng Shiwen]

504
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,440
Where are we going?

505
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,720
Going back home.

506
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,000
I can't walk anymore...

507
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,810
Wen Shuangjiang,

508
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,850
you've really learned something.

509
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,130
You drank so much!

510
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,090
Su Haoan made me drink...

511
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,370
That little brat.

512
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:29,530
Stand up straight!

513
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,720
Stand straight!

514
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,920
I want to squat...

515
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,370
Hold it steady.

516
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,850
Two minutes.

517
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,770
The taxi will be here in two minutes.

518
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,400
I can't stand properly...

519
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,330
Sang Yan.

520
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,720
Sang Yan,

521
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,330
has it been tough for you all these years?

522
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,640
What's wrong?

523
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Who told you something?

524
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,330
I was thinking,

525
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,920
how did you end up opening a restaurant?

526
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,160
What's wrong with me?

527
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,720
I'm making money now.

528
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,240
I'm saving money to support you!

529
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,850
Supporting me? And then?

530
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,400
Then you'll be mine, all mine.

531
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,480
Why do you need to support me?

532
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,440
I do.

533
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,530
You do?

534
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,920
You smiled at all other girls!

535
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,610
Don't start slandering me after getting drunk.

536
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,480
Who did I smile at today?

537
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,570
Not today.

538
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,890
Then when?

539
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,570
I won't say!

540
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,850
Tell me.

541
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,440
No!

542
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,920
I won't say...

543
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:47,400
You...

544
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,680
The first time I visited Overtime,

545
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,050
you smiled at four girls in one night!

546
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,240
And you even added them on WeChat.

547
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,160
I added them on WeChat?

548
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,290
Sir.

549
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,000
Look for yourself.

550
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,370
Did I add them?

551
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,720
Get in the car.

552
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,200
Where are their WeChat accounts?

553
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,610
Lower your head.

554
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,200
Raise your legs.

555
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,890
Anyway, I've already been saving money.

556
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,330
You can't keep doing this.

557
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:20,960
Okay.

558
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,890
Sir, start the car.

559
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,330
What's wrong with my skirt?

560
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,050
Why does it feel so uncomfortable?

561
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,050
I can't button it.

562
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,130
Can you help me button it?

563
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,810
That's not appropriate.

564
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,570
Done.

565
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,890
Done?

566
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,960
Wearing this bracelet,

567
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,000
do they laugh at you, saying you look like a little girl?

568
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,890
What's it to them?

569
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,290
Does it look good?

570
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,570
Yeah, it looks good.

571
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,290
Can you take tomorrow off?

572
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,130
Why?

573
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,090
You're this drunk.

574
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,720
I'm off tomorrow.

575
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:22,960
You will be off,

576
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,570
so you're messing with me tonight,

577
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,330
right?

578
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,090
What messing with you?

579
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:28,770
I'm already

580
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,370
working hard to make money

581
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,440
to support you.

582
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,610
Now, you need to let go

583
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,890
of your "Star" identity.

584
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,810
Whatever you do for me,

585
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,400
you should feel that it's natural

586
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,770
and willingly done.

587
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,370
That makes sense,

588
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,920
but can you save money faster?

589
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,130
Of course, I can.

590
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,850
Why are you the one picking me up?

591
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,200
Didn't you order for me to come?

592
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:04,890
Really?

593
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,610
Yes.

594
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,530
Maybe it's because I wanted to see you.

595
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,200
Sang Yan's girlfriend really is Wen Yifan.

596
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,640
They made it official.

597
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,440
You drank this much

598
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,480
just for that?

599
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,810
Is it worth it?

600
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,720
But I do kind of envy them.

601
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,440
It's just nice that they're happy.

602
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,850
What do you envy?

603
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,480
They can announce to the world

604
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,850
that they're together.

605
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,570
That's even more touching than a proposal.

606
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,160
Unlike my ex-girlfriends,

607
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,810
who wouldn't even let me post on social media.

608
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,370
I wanted us to be together!

609
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,470
♪Love is the loneliest thing in the world♪

610
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,430
♪I understand that♪

611
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:58,470
♪Yet, I still want to fall for you once more♪

612
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,310
♪Lost in this uncertain world♪

613
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,870
♪You're the moment I want to hold onto♪

614
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:12,380
♪I'm fully aware of the danger, yet I dive in willingly♪

615
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,610
Give me your hand.

616
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,920
Give me your hand.

617
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:15,850
Take care.

618
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,920
Mind your head.

619
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,290
Get up!

620
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,570
Good.

621
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,960
Thank you, sir.

622
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,480
You feel like throwing up?

623
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,370
Is it okay?

624
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,160
Seems not at all.

625
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,370
So you definitely shouldn't rely on your looks to make a living.

626
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,000
Got it?

627
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,610
Got it.

628
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,330
Do you know?

629
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,400
Got it!

630
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:43,680
Climb on.

631
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,160
This is the least promising route!

632
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,400
No one pushed you to rely on your looks for a living.

633
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,640
There is...

634
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,570
Who?

635
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,440
When I was in Yihe,

636
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,000
I got into the news department

637
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,370
through campus recruitment.

638
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,090
You know,

639
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,480
the news department has high standards for reporters.

640
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,330
But I never thought I could get in,

641
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,000
just gave it a try.

642
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,050
So I submitted my resume.

643
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,960
And then?

644
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,610
After several months, I found out

645
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,090
that people in our department said

646
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,130
I only got in because I have a good relationship

647
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,400
with the director.

648
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,370
But I didn't care what they said.

649
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,400
After all, people can say whatever they want.

650
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,810
I can't control them.

651
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,720
But I didn't expect

652
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,370
that the director

653
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,240
actually liked me.

654
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,480
He said with my looks,

655
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,680
I could earn more doing anything other than being a reporter.

656
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,370
And it would be easier.

657
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,640
He said, why did I act so high and mighty?

658
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,160
I didn't like that place...

659
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,770
Then,

660
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,050
let's never go back there.

661
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,770
I don't like being talked about like that either.

662
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
Don't listen to them.

663
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,000
They're insane.

664
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,050
Am I heavy?

665
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,050
No, not at all.

666
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,770
Sang Yan...

667
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,480
Before I came back to Nanwu, I dreamed about you.

668
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,770
What did you dream about me?

669
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,200
I dreamed

670
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,810
that you and your wife came to Yihe for your honeymoon.

671
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,850
What kind of dream is that?

672
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,200
Sit down.

673
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,290
You were so happy,

674
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,400
smiling at me.

675
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,290
Then, in the future,

676
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,640
we two

677
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,570
will also go on a trip to Yihe.

678
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,810
Alright?

679
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,890
Sorry, Sang Yan.

680
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,720
What are you apologizing for?

681
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,240
I'm too heavy.

682
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,400
Not all all.

683
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,720
Before apologizing, you should consider

684
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,960
how much weight you're carrying.

685
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,130
Your bones hurt me.

686
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,160
You should eat more.

687
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,720
Can I lie down for a bit?

688
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:34,770
Sure.

689
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,200
There are stars!

690
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,070
Sorry, Sang Yan.

691
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,810
I've been too harsh with my words before.

692
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,200
Do you know?

693
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,680
I don't like Yihe.

694
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,050
I don't like Beiyu either.

695
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,400
No city is a place I like.

696
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,850
And these cities don't like me.

697
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,570
At least Nanwu has my father's grave.

698
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,440
At least,

699
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,530
Nanwu has someone

700
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,050
I've been wanting to see,

701
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,370
but I've never had the courage to.

702
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:50,850
It's you.

703
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,130
Sang Yan was also drunk back then.

704
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,680
He was there,

705
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,570
sitting,

706
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,610
holding his cup,

707
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,480
and kept mumbling.

708
00:30:59,090 --> 00:30:59,960
Mumbling what?

709
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:00,720
He kept saying,

710
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,810
"Am I just your backup?"

711
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,400
"Am I just your backup?"

712
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
"Backup is fine."

713
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,000
At that moment,

714
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,890
Sang Yan's words

715
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,480
were repeatedly striking my heart...

716
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,640
Am I just your backup?

717
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,640
...over and over again.

718
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,770
Am I just your backup?

719
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,160
I feel like I was there,

720
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,890
seeing that fragile Sang Yan.

721
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:31,850
Am I just your backup?

722
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,850
Am I just your backup?

723
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,850
Get up.

724
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,890
Don't touch me. I want to sleep!

725
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,960
Don't touch me!

726
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,050
If you keep touching me, I'll...

727
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:13,850
I'll curse you!

728
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,770
Fine.

729
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:17,570
Curse me.

730
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:18,530
I'm listening.

731
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,720
You're a sinner,

732
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,240
mad and crazy.

733
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,610
You can barely speak properly.

734
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,810
You can't even say it right.

735
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,570
Get up.

736
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,680
Drink this hangover soup.

737
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,050
Do you know how much I drank today?

738
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,240
I thought if I drank too much, someone would take care of me.

739
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,130
But what happened?

740
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,400
What happened?

741
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,640
That person even got angry at me.

742
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,810
Then just ignore her.

743
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:21,920
Drank it all.

744
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:29,920
Take your time.

745
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,530
- One more sip. - You finish the rest.

746
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,130
You drank a lot, too.

747
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,240
You still remember I drank a lot?

748
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,290
I'm sleeping...

749
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,330
I'm sleeping!

750
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,080
Sleep in your room.

751
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:00,890
Get up.

752
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:01,730
No!

753
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,920
Wen Shuangjiang.

754
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:04,400
Come on.

755
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:05,650
I'm not going.

756
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:06,370
I...

757
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,250
I smell bad!

758
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,600
Then just go take a shower.

759
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,960
I don't want to move.

760
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,600
Can you help me shower?

761
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,370
I can't help you.

762
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:19,920
Well,

763
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,960
if you don't want to move someday,

764
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,400
I can help you shower, too...

765
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,560
Stop.

766
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:27,920
Stop.

767
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,690
I don't need your help with a shower.

768
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,650
Go back to your room and sleep, okay?

769
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,400
Stingy.

770
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,960
I'm stingy, huh?

Let's see if you regret it

773
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,960
after waking up tomorrow.

774
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,210
Then I won't shower.

775
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm coming to sleep with you.

776
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,000
I'll stink you out.

777
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,690
I'm not sleeping with you...

778
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,850
Don't try to stink me out.

779
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,810
You said I could hold you while sleeping...

780
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,080
Can you give me some space?

781
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,600
How can I sleep

782
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,040

783
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,960
Why not?

So what?

786
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,440
Figure it out yourself.

787
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,920
Seems like it really doesn't work...

788
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,890
Let me give you a riddle.

789
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,250
Okay.

790
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,770
Dogs go "woof woof woof."

791
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,600
Sheep go "baa baa baa."

792
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,810
What do chickens do?

793
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,730
What do chickens do?

794
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,960
Guess.

795
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,210
Opportunity (pronounced like "chicken") is for the prepared.

796

797
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:25,960

Why are you here?

808
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,330
Why are you holding me while sleeping?

809
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,770
I sleepwalked again?

810
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,040
I...

811
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,210
You...

812
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,600
You wash it yourself.

813
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,080
Yeah. Well...

814
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,080
while sleepwalking,

815
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,400
it's normal to do strange things.

816
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,850
It's just normal.

817
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:08,890
Yeah, it's normal.

818
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,370

821
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,810

822

823
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:17,850
sheep go "baa baa baa,"

824
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,600
and what do chickens do?

825
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,560
But you didn't help me shower.

826
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,850
