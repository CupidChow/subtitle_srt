00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,560
I have things to buy too.

190
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,350
Don't worry.

191
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,950
I'll still help you carry your things

192
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,280
if you can't carry them later.

193
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,200
How's the home improvement of your house going?

194
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,400
Why?

195
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,080
I want to talk about it with you.

196
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,990
About what?

197
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,350
When are you moving out?

198
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,160
Do you want to kick me out?

199
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,830
Let's talk about it when the time comes.

200
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,750
I'm not rushing you.

201
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,400
My colleague introduced a girl to me.

202
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,630
She doesn't need it urgently though.

203
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,800
But we need to confirm the timing first.

204
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:22,470
Okay.

205
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,320
I'll check on the home improvement progress

206

and let you know then.

207

Excuse me.

Do you need a cart?

209

Yes.

210

I don't need it anymore. You can take it.

I'm calculating the price.

215

Where's your cart?

What price?

217
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,680
The price of the toilet paper.

218
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,400
They're all four-ply.

219
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,750
Twenty-three yuan...

220
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,560
One hundred and twenty grams times twelve...

221
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,560
Twenty yuan...

222
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,800
One hundred and forty grams times fifteen...

223
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,950
Two yuan per roll.

224
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,320
Twenty-three divided by ten...

225
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,930
Twenty-three divided by...

226
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,920
One point nine yuan...

227
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,920
or so.

228
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,800
Then I'll take this.

229
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,400
Sure. It's cheaper.

230
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,830
But it only weighs one hundred and twenty grams.

231
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
Then take the one with ten rolls.

232
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,800
I'll calculate again.

233
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,080
Wen Yifan,

234
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,280
did you come to the supermarket for a college entrance exam?

235
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,990
The calculation could take you half a year

236
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,320
with your poor math skills.

237
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,750
It's getting late.

238
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,870
I'm afraid you'll turn in a blank paper.

239

I haven't finished the calculation yet.

240

I'll do the test for you this time, all right?

241
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,470
The one with ten rolls.

242
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,830
The one with ten rolls is a better deal.

243
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,680
The price has gone up?

244
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,470
It seems a bit expensive.

You can have a taste.

249

Why not take some home for your wife?

250

Okay.

Where's the umbrella?

270
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,160

Wait for me.

We have an umbrella.

You can move aside.

276

He looks a bit familiar to me.

Indeed.

376
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,520
You didn't sleep well?

377
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,480
It was okay.

378
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,630
Where are you going

379
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,560
dressed so formally in the early morning?

380
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,560
I have a job interview.

381
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
You are looking for a job?

382
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,590
The jobs are looking for me.

383
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,390
Many companies want me so badly.

384
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,760
I picked one that I like

385
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,390
and will see it today.

386
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,110
How about Overtime?

387
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,350
It's my bywork.

388
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,720
Good luck.

389
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,350
Are you going out?

390
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,000
I have an appointment.

391
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,000
You scored first in the written exam.

392
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,080
Yes.

393
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,430
Do you play games?

394
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,190
Yes.

395
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,000
Can you tell me more about it?

396
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,870
Usually, I play

397
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,110
MMO games.

398
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,190
All kinds of them,

399
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,280
such as SLG, ACT and RPG.

400
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,110
But I play turn-based games most.

401
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,150
Then could you tell me

402
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,870
which algorithm is the best

403
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,910
when designing combat values for turn-based games?

404
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,320
Probably a subtraction formula.

405
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,800
Turn-based combat may look simple,

406
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,350
but

407
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,640
every move

408
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,190
is a battle of wits between players.

409
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,110
The subtraction formula is simple and easy to understand.

410
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,110
It reflects changes in values clearly

411
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,350
and demonstrates strategic value.

412
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
This is something the division formula lacks.

413
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,350
So, what expectations do you have for our company?

414
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,760
I have none.

415
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,350
What about the salary?

416
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,280
It's written on it.

417
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,350
I'll ask you directly.

418
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,830
Why did you apply

419
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,760
to work in our company?

420
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,480
You need to work hard

421
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,240
since your look isn't an advantage.

422
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,430
Don't just stay at home

423
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,150
like an unemployed man every day.

424
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,870
They asked you about your work today.

425
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,520
To find a job.

426
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,830
To find a job?

427
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:49,430
Okay.

428
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,430
The last question.

429
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,720
What do you think

430
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,430
is the most important thing

431
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,040
to design a game?

432
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,110
What would be the reason for you

433
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,630
to start playing games?

434
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,870
Probably loneliness.

435
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,720
Everyone will feel lonely.

436
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,190
They want companionship in games.

437
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,590
It's okay if you want to meet.

438
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,190
But why did you choose to meet around my place?

439
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
Well, I just think

440
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,830
you don't have to go too far to be here

441
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,280
after you finish work.

442
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,480
Then you can go home and rest

443
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,560
after we finish our discussion here.

444
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,460
You have got the wrong idea.

445
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,240
How can I finish work that early?

446
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,280
I almost work around the clock.

447
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,590
Besides,

448
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,870
I'm not your girlfriend.

449
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,040
You don't have to be so considerate.

450
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,870
Maybe

451
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,350
I felt this a nice place

452
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,870
when I sent you home last time.

453
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,670
We can hang out a bit.

454
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,630
So...

455
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,520
I really don't know

456
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,280
what a man like you has in mind.

457
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,480
What kind of man I am?

458
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,870
Anyway, we are a different kind of people.

459
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,280
What's the difference?

460
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,630
What should I say if my grandparents ask about you

461
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,590
since you don't take my orders anymore?

462
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,040
It's true I'm not taking your orders anymore.

463
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,830
But I can still help you as a friend.

464
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,720
Thank you for calling me a friend.

465
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:07,760
I almost forgot.

466
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,630
This is for you.

467
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,800
What's this?

468
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,240
Look at your hands.

469
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,830
They'll rot if you don't put on hand cream.

470
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:22,800
Take it.

471
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,080
Take it.

472
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,670
I have a new order.

473
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,000
I have to leave now.

474
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,910
Don't forget to apply hand cream.

475
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,830
Bye!

476
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:10,830
Mrs. Su?

477
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,080
What are you doing here?

478
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,190
Hi.

479
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,190
It was you who placed the order?

480
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,280
Just tell me directly

481
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,390
if there's anything you need help with.

482
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,280
No need to place an order.

483
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,280
But you're doing business.

484
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,910
You don't have to be polite to me.

485
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,520
But

486
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,240
all you added for the order

487
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,350
was "Support".

488
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,350
What should I do?

489
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,280
Where are we going?

490
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,670
Step back a little.

491
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,190
So, what kind of order is it today?

492
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,000
"Caught in the act" order.

493
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,960
Target:

494
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,480
Su Haoan's grandfather.

495
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,520
What does it mean?

496
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,350
There's no time to explain it to you.

497
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,040
Just do what I tell you later.

498
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:55,590
Let's go.

499
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,390
Madam,

500
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,320
May I ask who the leader is?

501
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,590
Fang!

502
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,590
Someone wants to see you.

503
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,480
Okay.

504
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,190
Fang.

505
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,630
What's up?

506
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,190
Well,

507
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,080
can we sign up to join you?

508
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,480
You?

509
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,590
Don't you see

510
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,590
we are all old people?

511
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,590
This is a government welfare arrangement.

512
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,110
What are you young girls doing here with us?

513
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,280
Fang!

514
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,980
- We've been waiting for you. - Okay, just a moment.

515
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,040
- Here I am. - Let's go.

516
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,830
Mr. Su!

517
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,350
Mr. Su!

518
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,240
Lin, what brings you here?

519
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,520
- Lin. - You two know each other?

520
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,430
My granddaughter-in-law.

521
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,720
Mr. Su,

522
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,670
we haven't married yet.

523
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,080
Can we go together then?

524
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,080
Let's just say we're dancing with you.

525
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,320
Oh, here.

526
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,430
My friend will join us too.

527
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,150
I...

528
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:38,910
Together.

529
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,240
What do you think?

530
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,670
It's okay.

531
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,560
That's great!

532
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,930
Thank you, Fang.

533
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,930
You must be a good dancer, Mr. Su.

534
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,150
He dances really well.

535
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,800
That's awesome.

536
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,480
I'm sorry, Mr. Su.

537
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,110
I'm sorry.

538
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,480
Does it hurt, Mr. Su?

539
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,910
Lin,

540
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,240
your sense of dance rhythm

541
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,630
needs some improvement.

542
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,960
How about this?

543
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,350
You practice over there first.

544
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,800
We'll dance together after your practice, okay?

545
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm really sorry, Mr. Su.

546
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,800
It's okay.

547
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,190
Dian.

548
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,240
I...

549
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,280
Hello, Mr. Su.

550
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,080
I'm Qiao,

551
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,430
Lin's friend.

552
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,720
Please teach me.

553
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,150
You?

554
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:21,430
Okay.

555
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,350
Come on.

556
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,560
Very good.

557
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,520
You learned it so quickly.

558
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,390
Thank you, Fang.

559
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,760
Listen to me, everyone.

560
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,520
Let's take a break now.

561
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,240
Drink some water.

562
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,000
You've worked hard.

563
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,720
Fang,

564
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,080
why didn't your husband come to dance with you?

565
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,000
My husband?

566
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,280
He passed away a long time ago.

567
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:58,870
Young lady...

568
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,870
You are

569
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,830
Mr. Su's granddaughter-in-law?

570
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,110
Yes.

571
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,800
I heard

572
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,720
that his wife left with someone else.

573
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,040
That's not true.

574
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,150
Mr. Su,

575
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,560
who usually dances with you?

576
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,280
It depends.

577
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,320
This one today.

578
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,560
That one tomorrow.

579
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,670
I see.

580
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,280
Do you have a boyfriend?

581
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:22,870
Not yet.

582
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,000
Shall I ask my grandson

583
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,080
to introduce someone to you?

584
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,390
He has a friend

585
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,040
who's still single.

586
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,190
And he keeps bothering my grandson all day long.

587
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:31,910
The two of them

588
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,150
run a bar together.

589
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,670
No, thanks.

590
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,150
There's already someone I like.

591
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,080
Someone you like?

592
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,960
Then you should take the moves

593
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,630
and pursue your own happiness.

594
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,590
Otherwise,

595
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,320
you'll regret it

596
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,830
when you come to my age.

597
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,110
You have regrets too, Mr. Su?

598
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,150
Come on.

599
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,190
Thank you, Mr. Su.

600
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,780
Mr. Su.

601
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,670
I didn't expect you

602
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,670
to learn so fast.

603
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,000
Mr. Su,

604
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,870
you are such a good dancer.

605
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,440
I have to dance with you someday.

606
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:11,790
Look,

607
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,960
is she the lady in red?

608
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,080
Which one do you mean with so many in red?

609
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,040
Fang!

610
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,400
She's putting her hands on him!

611
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,840
It can't be that easy to guess.

612
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,630
Can there be more than one?

613
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,880
Today, I am inviting you

614
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,750
to have some tea.

615
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,710
Mr. Su,

616
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,080
can we join you?

617
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,310
Of course.

618
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,360
Come on!

619
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,670
Sang Yan!

620
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,150
Just call me if you need any help

621
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,270
with the company.

622
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,040
I'll get your back.

623
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,080
What?

624
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,080
Give me your hand.

625
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,520
You are hired.

626
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,040
We're colleagues from now on, bro.

627
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,630
Why not move closer to the company?

628
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,630
We can play games together after work.

629
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,920
Who wants to play with you? You are a bad player.

630
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,840
I think you're used to living with Wen Yifan

631
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,960
and don't want to leave her.

632
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,880
Let's have dinner together tonight

633
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,270
for a celebration.

634
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,710
I'll invite Zhong Siqiao to join us.

635
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,670
Qiao,

636
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,750
let's have dinner together tonight.

637
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
Invite Wen Yifan to join us too.

638
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'll send you the address.

639
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,110
Sang Yan!

640
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,710
You're not going?

641
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,150
Sang Yan!

642
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,100
Have some tea.

643
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,220
Thank you.

644
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,630
Make yourselves at home. Just eat.

645
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,630
It's so rich.

646
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,520
- It smells so good. - Eat that.

647
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,270
I really want to eat it.

648
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,590
Just make yourselves at home.

649
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,480
Feel free to eat.

650
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,750
Let me tell you,

651
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,110
the pineapple buns here are especially authentic.

652
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,920
They're exactly the same as the ones I had in Hong Kong.

653
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,190
Look,

654
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,560
the crust

655
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,400
is very flaky.

656
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,040
With this butter,

657
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,000
it can be called

658
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,560
the world's delicacy.

659
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,190
What Mr. Su recommends must be delicious.

660
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,590
Mr. Su,

661
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,080
eating too much butter isn't good for your health.

662
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,670
How about

663
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,270
I get you something else instead of this?

664
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,080
Young lady,

665
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,790
people our age

666
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,560
should eat whatever they want

667
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,710
and date whoever they like.

668
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,400
We want to live freely

669
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,310
like you young people.

670
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,150
That's what matters.

671
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,110
Don't you think so?

672
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,190
Exactly.

673
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,040
Mr. Su,

674
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,560
do you think I'm right?

675
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,520
This isn't good for your health.

676
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,150
I'll order something else for you.

677
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,790
Here, look at this delicious dish.

678
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,670
You have to eat this.

679
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,110
Come on.

680
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,440
It's full of nutrition.

681
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,110
- With a bite of the dish. - Here.

682
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,760
- With a sip of tea. - Here's the char siu bao.

683
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,000
This is good too.

684
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,310
Thank you.

685
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,270
Thank you.

686
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,330
Eat this, Mr. Su.

687
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,180
Come on.

688
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,130
This is for you.

689
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,630
- Thank you, Mr. Su. - Don't be too polite.

690
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,310
- Let's eat. - Come on.

691
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,920
[I'll be there soon.]
I got one for you too.

692
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,880
We're going to the bathroom.

693
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,880
And this...

694
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,880
Shrimp dumpling.

695
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,520
Yes!

696
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,190
Which one?

697
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,560
Over there.

698
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,360
Look at that one next to your grandfather.

699
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,270
She was serving dishes to your grandfather.

700
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:26,880
Well,

701
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,040
Grandma is more beautiful.

702
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,400
Grandpa may not really like her.

703
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,440
Love isn't just about looks.

704
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,630
I'm being honest.

705
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,880
Grandma is indeed more beautiful than her.

706
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,960
Men only care about looks.

707
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,740
[Yu Da Shi]

708
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,230
Thank you for today.

709
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,230
You got up early for my grandpa's issue.

710
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
You treat us to dinner

711
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,670
just for this?

712
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,480
In the beginning,

713
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,880
I wanted to celebrate for Sang Yan for getting a new job.

714
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,710
But he wouldn't come.

715
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,360
Sang Yan's new job is settled?

716
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,710
Don't worry.

717
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,230
I'll get his back

718
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,790
in the company.

719
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,440
He is really tough to deal with.

720
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,190
He looks tough.

721
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,110
Everything about him is tough.

722
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,400
What's wrong with him?

723
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,190
Talking bad about me

724
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,960
when I'm not around?

725
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,110
Bro!

726
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,040
Why are you here?

727
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,190
Surprising me?

728
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,270
Good.

729
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,310
Our hero is here.

730
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,040
Come on.

731
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Let's have a drink.

732
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,110
Toast to Sang Yan for joining my company.

733
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:34,920
Congratulations.

734
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,230
But, Sang Yan,

735
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,480
why did you suddenly want a job?

736
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,230
After he graduated,

737
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,040
he went straight to a big company in Nanwu.

738
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,630
But who knows what got into him?

739
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,440
He suddenly quit.

740
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,670
Stop talking too much.

741
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,400
Drink it.

742
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,190
Okay.

743
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,790
Yifan,

744
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,150
thank you for today.

745
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,080
Thank you.

746
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,310
You are welcome.

747
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,840
I'm having an off day anyway.

748
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,920
Consider it spending time with Qiao.

749
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:03,840
What do you think

750
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,310
first love even means?

751
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,750
What's the meaning of being together for decades?

752
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,670
I really feel bad for my grandma.

753
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,270
Grandpa was her first love.

754
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,480
He's already at an old age

755
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,480
but is still messing around

756
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,520
with those dance teachers.

757
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,230
He's really troublesome.

758
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
I will definitely ask her

759
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,270
why she would ruin another woman's family

760
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,590
when I find her out!

761
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,000
That's not what I meant.

762
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,270
I want to ask you

763
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,960
to help me find out

764
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,040
if she's reliable.

765
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,360
Is she reliable?

766
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,560
If she is reliable

767
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,560
and they truly love each other,

768
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,400
I will support them.

769
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,230
Mrs. Su,

770
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,440
you are too good to her.

771
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,480
Do you think

772
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,750
if it's good love

773
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,440
when neither of them is happy

774
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,880
being together?

775
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,710
Forcing it won't bring happiness.

776
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,270
What if

777
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,790
he happens to meet the one

778
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,790
he feels is the most important in life?

779
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,080
What should we do?

780
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,080
Mrs. Su,

781
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,190
you'd better

782
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,750
have a good talk with Mr. Su first.

783
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,960
What should we talk about?

784
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,840
Lately, he forgets everything I tell him.

785
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,440
He doesn't even remember my birthday.

786
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,670
His mind is no longer on me.

787
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,040
Why should I hold on to him?

788
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,560
It seems that, for men,

789
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,630
first love is nothing to them.

790
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,960
Maybe only girls care more about their first love.

791
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,630
Not necessarily.

792
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,670
The place of first love

793
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,440
is irreplaceable.

794
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,150
You're talking as if you really understand.

795
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,960
Talk less.

796
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,400
Cheers!
