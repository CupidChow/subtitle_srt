00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,520
Here's another task that isn't so urgent.

189
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,190
You can take care of it.

190
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,560
Okay.

191
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,430
Give it to me.

192
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,390
What?

193
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,800
Your high school friend's number,

194
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,870
so you won't feel awkward.

195
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,520
Let me ask him for you first.

196
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,110
Sure.

197
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,190
Hello and welcome.

198
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,080
I'm here to see someone.

199
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,800
This way, please.

200
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,350
Okay.

201
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,320
Qiao.

202
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,110
Xiang Lang.

203
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,800
Why did you pick such a fancy restaurant?

204
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,080
I thought you wanted a quiet place?

205
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,240
You must be hungry.

206
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,560
Take a look.

207
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,320
- Okay. - See what you'd like to eat.

208
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,800
Any recommendations?

209
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,910
We just added a new set menu for couples.

210
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,910
We are not...

211
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,150
We'll go with the set menu for couples.

212
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,000
All right, please wait a moment.

213
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,480
Xiang Lang.

214
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,000
Do you remember this bracelet?

215
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,590
Isn't this the one I gave you?

216
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,000
You've been wearing it all this time?

217
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,590
I've been wearing it ever since the day

218
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,760
you gave it to me.

219
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,000
Even when it didn't match

220
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,590
my outfits,

221
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,520
I still kept it on.

222
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,760
Qiao, actually…

223
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,190
I've always wanted to ask you this.

224
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,350
When you gave me this bracelet,

225
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,000
was it just a birthday gift?

226
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,000
I don't quite understand

227
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,670
what you mean.

228
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,190
I just want to know

229
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,720
if you had even the slightest feelings for me

230
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,630
when you gave me

231
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,480
this bracelet.

232
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:30,910
Qiao,

233
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,720
did I somehow give you the wrong idea?

234
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,720
I'm sorry.

235
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,830
We've always just been close friends.

236
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,320
Seems like

237
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,830
I was reading too much into it.

238
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,190
But

239
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,500
is there a chance

240
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,430
you might see me

241
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,280
as someone

242
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:06,320
you could be with

243
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,480
from now on?

244
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,000
Actually, I…

245
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,960
I guess the couple's set menu is off the table.

246
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,480
Let's order something else.

247
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,520
Excuse me.

248
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,590
I'm here.

249
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,630
Have you been waiting for long?

250
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,320
You haven't ordered yet?

251
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,390
I was about to say this earlier.

252
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,240
It's not just the two of us today,

253
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,320
but three.

254
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,280
What's happening? It feels a little awkward.

255
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,040
No,

256
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,390
I misunderstood Xiang Lang.

257
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,870
My bad.

258
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,870
You actually got Qiao to apologize to you?

259
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,150
I'm impressed.

260
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,390
Let's order first.

261
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,480
You two eat.

262
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,350
I have to take care of something.

263
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,870
Qiao.

264
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,520
What exactly is happening here?

265
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,830
It's all my fault.

266
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,190
Let me explain to both of you.

267
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,960
That bracelet

268
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,110
was actually something I wanted you

269
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,830
to pass on to Dian back then.

270
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,240
Qiao.

271
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:18,910
Xiang Lang.

272
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,520
Sorry

273
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,830
for the last-minute meetup.

274
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,960
No worries.

275
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,000
It's not often that you ask me to meet up.

276
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,590
I couldn't change my parents' minds.

277
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
They've already booked me

278
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,520
a flight to the U.S. for tomorrow,

279
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,390
so

280
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,140
I want to…

281
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,650
I thought you and Dian

282
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,650
had forgotten my birthday.

283
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,520
Thank you.

284
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,800
That's right.

285
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:46,910
It's your birthday today.

286
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,080
Happy birthday!

287
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,800
Thank you.

288
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,800
This bracelet is gorgeous.

289
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
It must have cost a lot, didn't it?

290
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,670
Not really.

291
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,150
So,

292
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,350
you said your parents booked you a flight.

293
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,350
What's it for?

294
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,040
A vacation?

295
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,670
I'm leaving for the U.S.

296
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,080
to study.

297
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,350
I should have been upfront

298
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,280
with you.

299
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,910
I also

300
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,280
should have confessed my feelings earlier.

301
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
This is all on me.

302
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,080
Dian,

303
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,670
I've actually

304
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,080
felt differently about you

305
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,080
since high school.

306
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,040
What are you talking about?

307
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,910
It's me who should apologize.

308
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,080
I've been deluded,

309
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,590
holding onto something

310
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,830
that wasn't mine for all these years.

311
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,350
You two eat.

312
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,240
I still have work to do.

313
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,350
Qiao.

314
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,000
Dian, I...

315
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,670
Ms. Qian...

316
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,630
All right.

317
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,830
I'm heading over now.

318
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:27,870
Dian,

319
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:28,830
where are you going?

320
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:29,960
I'm going to the TV station.

321
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,960
Get in the car. I'll give you a ride.

322
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,280
We can have a chat on the way.

323
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,350
No need to keep wondering.

324
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,430
She's just not into you.

325
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:10,630
Tell me.

326
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,870
What kind of flirtatious moves did she make?

327
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,560
She hugged you?

328
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:27,830
Since you're both girls,

329
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,280
I'd like you to answer this for me.

330
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,630
This person hugged my friend

331
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,350
and acted like nothing happened the next day.

332
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,350
What do you think that means?

333
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,560
Shouldn't this kind of irresponsible behavior

334
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,830
be reported to the police?

335
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,800
It shouldn't be so serious

336
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,390
if it was just a hug, right?

337
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,630
Are you out of your mind?

338
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,320
Why report it to the police?

339
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,190
But really,

340
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,760
it depends on the nature of your friend's relationship

341
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,910
with this girl.

342
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,080
Maybe the girl

343
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,080
was feeling down

344
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,110
and just needed some comfort,

345
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,870
so

346
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,040
the hug might not mean much.

347
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,080
It could simply be a hug between friends.

348
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm just speculating, though.

349
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:35,960
I don't know

350
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,350
their relationship,

351
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,390
so my opinion

352
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,240
might not be very helpful.

353
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,280
Here's the question.

354
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,800
How's your relationship?

355
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,040
How else could the relationship be?

356
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,000
She's my goddess.

357
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,430
I've been pursuing her for over half a year.

358
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,960
And what are you even talking about?

359
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,720
Didn't I explain everything already?

360
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,800
She gave me

361
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,320
a box of chocolates on Valentine's Day,

362
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,560
not a hug.

363
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,040
The real issue is

364
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,760
that after giving me the chocolates,

365
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,280
she never contacted me again.

366
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,960
She's someone who is madly in love with him.

367
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,430
Your friend must have quite the charisma.

368
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,080
Did this girl confess to him?

369
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,590
Why do you ask?

370
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,910
It just doesn't make sense logically.

371
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,320
If this girl

372
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,320
really likes your friend,

373
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,720
then the meaning of the hug

374
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,870
should be pretty clear.

375
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,670
But your friend probably doesn't need

376
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,080
to bring this up with you.

377
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,800
So, are you implying

378
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,720
that love has clouded his judgment?

379
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,080
From what I just heard you say to your friend,

380
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,590
it seems like this girl

381
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,520
hasn't clearly expressed

382
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,670
her feelings.

383
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,320
So, is it possible

384
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,320
that your friend misunderstood?

385
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,240
Misunderstood?

386
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,390
What did he misunderstand?

387
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,480
Simply put,

388
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,150
it's just him

389
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,630
imagining things.

390
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,870
Did you hear that?

391
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,670
It's just you imagining things.

392
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:16,720
Now, leave me alone.

393
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,640
Wait, Sang Yan, what's wrong with...?

394
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,150
Are you done yet?

395
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,630
What's your problem?

396
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,280
It's you.

397
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,480
I thought it was Chen Junwen.

398
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,000
What's the matter?

399
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,700
Su Haoan mentioned in the group chat

400
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,320
that you went to Yihe recently.

401
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,350
Were you there for me?

402
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,350
What group chat?

403
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,320

404
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,430
You're not in this group chat.

405

Is this necessary?

407
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,670
Stop changing the subject.

408
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,110
Be honest with me.

409
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,430
Have you been to Yihe more than once?

410
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,280
What were you doing there?

411
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,280
You've never loved me, have you?

412
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,000
You've been toying with me, haven't you?

413
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,910
Say something!

414
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,000
Why?

415
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,480

416
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,110
Sir,

417
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,080
I've already bought everything you need

418

420
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,310
just let me know.

421
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,310
Thank you.

422
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,710
The nurse will take you upstairs.

423
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,480
Take care.

424
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,150
Let's go, sir.

425
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,230
Bye.

426
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,080
I really don't blame you for this.

427
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,400
I can't blame anyone for things like this.

428
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,960
I probably just need some time.

429
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,840
I don't think you truly understand me.

430
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
I tend to avoid things

431
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,310
and I'm not very outgoing.

432
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,230
To protect myself,

433
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,040
I could leave everything behind without hesitation.

434
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,000
The person you imagine me to be

435
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,190
is probably not the same

436
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,270
as the one I'm describing.

437
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,880
You really deserve someone better.

438
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,310
I've made things clear with Xiang Lang.

439
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,560
I don't want any misunderstandings between the three of us.

440
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,310
Is it because of me

441
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,080
that you...?

442
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,630
If I really got together with Xiang Lang,

443
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,790
would you cut ties with me?

444
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,790
Of course not.

445
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,110
It's a different time now.

446
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,290
Who would ditch their best friend for a man?

447
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,400
Actually, the main reason I rejected Xiang Lang

448
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,270
is that I don't have

449
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,520
any romantic feelings for him.

450
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,880
Just like

451
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,520
how he feels about me.

452
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,190
But Xiang Lang

453
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,000
is still

454
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,440
a very good friend to us, isn't he?

455
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,480
I don't want to grow up at all.

456

Growing up

457
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,150
just makes everything so complicated.

458
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,000
Wouldn't it be better to be as simple as before?

459
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,520
It's love that makes things complicated.

460
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,670
It's inherently an emotion

461

Why are you suddenly asking this?

501
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,000
Because he's handsome,

502
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,310
and he's really quite charming.

503
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,230
Even though I barely talked to him in high school,

504
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,310
I knew

505
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,790
that he seemed to really like you

506
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,560

What's with this reaction?

513
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,400
So, you really had feelings for Sang Yan back then?

514
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,480
What about now? Do you still feel the same?

515
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,310
That was long in the past.

00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,000

spending so much time around each other.

518
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,190
Besides, you both had feelings for each other before.

519
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,630
What if those feelings resurface?

520
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,000
That won't happen.

521
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,440
He's moving out soon.

522
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,110
So you're implying

523
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,000
that if he stayed longer,

524
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,790
you might have given in to your feelings.

525
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,230
But why didn't you two get together before?

526
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,080
Oh, I get it now.

527
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,710
It was because you transferred schools and moved away,

528
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,230
so you lost contact.

529
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,110
No.

530
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,080

00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,580
I don't know if others

534
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,670
But my college roommate once told me

535
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,520
that she thought

536
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,270
I was emotionally distant.

537
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,360
We were close,

538
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,150
but once we graduated, it felt like we lost touch.

539
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,080
I hardly ever reached out to them,

540
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,840
and they were pretty upset about it.

541
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,040
I admit that.

00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
