00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,020
when I had nowhere to go

192
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,930
and you didn't even care,

193
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,260
I should have understood everything by then.

194
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,540
[In memory of my late father, Wen Liangzhe]

195
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,180
It's good.

196
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,970
I just feel like having something sweet.

197
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,020
How's your health been lately?

198
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,210
Pretty good.

199
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,930
You're always so busy with work.

200
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,970
Just focus on your job.

201
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,380
Jiang.

202
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,260
I just made some tremella soup.

203
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,380
Come have some.

204
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,500
Yeah, try some.

205
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,570
I have homework to do.

206
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,140
Why didn't you greet your uncle?

207
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,900
It's okay.

208
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,090
Yifan is still not used to it.

209
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,780
Don't put her on the spot.

210
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,850
Jiang, I want to discuss something with you.

211
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
But first,

212
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,850
let's agree not to argue.

213
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,500
Keep our emotions in check.

214
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,660
The main thing is,

215
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,420
I can't get emotional right now.

216
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,260
Why?

217
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,140
I'm pregnant.

218
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,300
Uh...

219
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,140
work is calling me.

220
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,450
I need to take this.

221
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,090
Have you already forgotten Dad?

222
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,500
I don't expect you to remember him

223
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,610
for the rest of your life like I do.

224
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,420
You can remarry,

225
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,210
you can have new children...

226
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,570
but not now.

227
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,180
Your stepfather...

228
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,730
He has been

229
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,970
seeing someone else.

230
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,180
Before,

231
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,060
we argued about it a few times.

232
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,850
He promised me he wouldn't do it again.

233
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,300
Kejia probably...

234
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,660
probably just wanted you to come back to keep me company.

235
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,380
That's why...

236
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,780
that's why she called you home.

237
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,930
Is this history repeating itself?

238
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,610
What happened to me back then,

239
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,060
you're experiencing it now.

240
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,060
Neither of us

241
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,690
was ever truly chosen.

242
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,260
We were both abandoned,

243
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,260
left behind.

how to handle our relationship.

your contact info.

253
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,450
I was afraid that if something happened to you,

254
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,260
I wouldn't know what to do.

255
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,260
But later, I realized I was overthinking.

256
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,610
All these years,

257
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,210
you ignored me completely.

258
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,420
And yet, I still managed to live.

259
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,330
I never said these things before.

260
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,570
I kept them buried inside,

261
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,180

To home

286
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:07,850
to celebrate your birthday?

287
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,970
Can I

288
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,420
make a birthday wish now?

289
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,930
If...

290
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,060
next summer

291
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,380
is still just as long,

292
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,780
you will propose to me,

293
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,210
will you?

294
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,210
I will.

295
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,500
Anything else?

296
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,810
Can I make another?

297
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,810
Of course.

298
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,180
You can.

299
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,730
Then...

300
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,020
I hope the summer after next

301
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,170
will be just as long.

302
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,740
Isn't that the same wish

303
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,740
as the last one?

304
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,220
You're really saving me the trouble.

305
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,780
Every year, your wishes

306
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,700
are always the things I want to do.

307
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,700
All my wishes from our first year as roommates

308
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,810
have come true.

309
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,130
Are you talking about work?

310
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,570
Or...

311
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,940
that you wanted me to be your boyfriend?

312
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,220
Any more?

313
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,810
Are you giving me three wishes?

314
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,610
Then...

315
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,610
carry me on your back?

316
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,300
Forget it.

317
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,850
Let's go.

318
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,300
Come on.

319
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,130
Hurry up.

320
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,130
Fine, just for a bit.

321
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,940
Anything else?

322
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,060
Give me a smile.

323
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,130
Why?

324
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,610
Why do you always avoid smiling at me?

325
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,980
You look so cute when you smile.

326
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,940
Don't use that word to describe me.

327
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,500
But...

328
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,980
you look so good when you smile.

329
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,780
Could you?

330
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,170
Every time you smile,

331
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,300
the little mole near your eye

332
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,130
is like a dancing ant.

333
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,700
Like a dancing ant?

334
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,090
Alright,

335
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,650
I'll take that as a compliment.

336
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,610
Either way, you're only allowed to smile for me.

337
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,170
When did you

338
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,130
become so controlling?

339
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,940
You told me to make wishes.

340
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,780
Fine.

341
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,260
Anything else?

342
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,850
What's wrong?

343
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,780
Still thinking?

344
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,740
No one loves me anymore.

345
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,060
Only you.

346
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,610
I only love you.

347
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,540
From the very beginning,

348
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,610
step by step,

349
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,610
we walked here.

350
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,220
We'll keep walking

351
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,650
into the future.

352
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,780
Wen Shuangjiang,

353
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,570
make another wish.

354
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,330
I don't have any more wishes.

355
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,130
You can have mine.

356
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,500
Then I wish...

357
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,940
I wish that besides me,

358
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,020
there will be many people who love you.

359
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,090
Sitting for so long made my back ache.

360
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,740
It's not like you were the one driving.

361
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,300
It's a six-hour journey!

362
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,460
That was exhausting.

363
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,370
Grandma, is this the place?

364
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,780
It looks like there are a lot more trees now.

365
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,850
Haoan,

366
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,170
come here.

367
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,570
Look.

368
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,260
This is the spot

369
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,060
where their car

370
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,300
crashed all those years ago.

371
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,060
They said it was because the car was going too fast.

372
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,090
It skidded and went off the road.

373
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,020
Back then,

374
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,850
how could we have

375
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,780
let a little kid like you

376
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,780
see all of this firsthand?

377
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,130
Your grandpa and I...

378
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,130
we nearly passed out.

379
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,500
It was unbearable!

380
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,740
It was my idea back then

381
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,810
to keep you at home.

382
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,220
I thought

383
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,780
that would be the safest place for you.

384
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,700
But I never imagined

385
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,850
not telling you

386
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,740
would affect you

387
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,130
for so many years.

388
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,610
At first, I thought

389
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,780
it was okay.

390
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,020
Maybe everyone just needed time.

391
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,610
But as the years passed,

392
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,540
I started wondering

393
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,700
was it my fault?

394
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,090
I began blaming myself.

395
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,540
It must've been because I wasn't good enough,

396
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,370
because I didn't meet your expectations.

397
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,330
Everything started with me.

398
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,260
I was the problem.

399
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,540
I deserved to be abandoned, didn't I?

400
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,220
Why would you think that?

401
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,540
No one has ever stopped loving you.

402
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,610
All this time,

403
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,090
you and your brother

404
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,500
have been

405
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,090
the most precious to your grandpa and me!

406
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,890
Alright.

407
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,850
Let us

408
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,650
just forget

409
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,330
all these painful memories,

410
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,570
and let them go.

411
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,170
Have you ever wondered

412
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,850
why your name

413
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,020
is Haoan?

414
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,300
Your father's name

415
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,890
was Su Haoyang.

416
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,500
Your mother's name

417
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,330
was Hu Jiaan.

418
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,540
Your father's second character

419
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,850
and your mother's third character...

420
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,460
That's how you got Haoan.

421
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,060
You and your brother

422
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,090
were both the loves of their lives.

423
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,650
They didn't love him more,

424
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,850
and they didn't love you any less.

425
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,850
All these years,

426
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,890
I tried my best to please everyone.

427
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,460
But the hardest person to comfort was myself.

428
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,220
Those who can't forgive themselves suffer most.

429
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,980
We need to be kinder to ourselves.

430
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,460
Dad.

431
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,570
Mom.

432
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:03,980
Brother.

433
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,700
All these years,

434
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,330
I've grown up.

435
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,540
Can you see me?

436
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,090
The old me

437
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,940
was afraid of loss.

438
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,060
I always relied on others.

439
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,780
But now...

440
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,740
I finally understand

441
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,260
what it means to be loved.

442
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,220
I will keep living my life

443
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,170
with confidence.

444
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,890
And I will take care

445
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,500
of Grandpa and Grandma for you.

446
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,060
You can rest easy.

447
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,700
Don't worry.

448
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,330
Your grandma and I

449
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,810
don't need you to take care of.

450
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,610
Your grandpa agreed to go on a road trip with me.

451
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,370
That's great, Grandma!

452
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,060
Grandpa is finally willing to make your dream come true.

453
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,460
Let's go right away.

454
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,220
Time to hit the road!

455
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,090
Where are we going?

456
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,610
On a road trip!

457
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,780
But first, we need to go home,

458
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,460
Get in my car,

459
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,090
and then we can leave.

460
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,940
Then why are you calling Ma?

461
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,940
This is a trip just for the two of us.

462
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,090
Why bring him along?

463
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,810
He's the driver.

464
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,740
I don't want that!

465
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,130
Just the two of us are enough!

466
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,810
Only us?

467
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:26,850
Well then,

468
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,500
I should call Laughter.

469
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,090
What's wrong with you?

470
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,260
Why are you calling Laughter?

471
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,410
Of course I have to!

472
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,850
I have to call her.

473
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,130
She and I are going on a road trip.

474
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,610
Who's Laughter?

475
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,500
Laughter is you!

476
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,740
I'm just messing with you.

477
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,370
Alright.

478
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,650
Let's head out.

479
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,540
Come on, let's go!

480
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,500
Let's go.

481
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,500
This feels great.

482
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,060
Get in the car!

483
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,330
Where are you now?

484
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,700
Our program starts at seven.

485
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,460
If I don't reply later,

486
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,650
that means I'm already on stage.

487
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,220
Ask Fu Zhuang to bring you in.

488
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,410
Alright.

489
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,940
Try it.

490
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,780
Hurry up.

491
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,610
Still not working?

492
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,090
Yan!

493
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,740
There's an urgent matter for you.

494
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:49,540
Here's the deal.

495
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,090
A few key projects ran into problems.

496
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,330
We need you to fix them.

497
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,650
You two can't handle it?

498
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,810
Yan,

499
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,260
you can solve it in ten minutes.

500
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,330
If they try, they'll be stuck for three days.

501
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,890
- Get to the conference room! - Move!

502
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,850
Yeah, work!

503
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,540
Hurry up!

504
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,330
Yan, quick!

505
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,130
Move!

506
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,540
Zhen Yu.

507
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,300
Zhen Yu.

508
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,890
- Yang. - Yifan.

509
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,500
Can I ask about my performance?

510
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,460
What's my lineup number?

511
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,300
You're third.

512
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,570
That early?

513
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,980
Not ready yet?

514
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,940
No...

515
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,610
I'm worried my boyfriend won't make it.

516
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,570
I never thought you, of all people,

517
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,700
would agree to perform.

518
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,300
So that's why.

519
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,740
Well,

520
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,570
if he doesn't make it,

521
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,940
can I trouble you to record a video for me?

522
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,940
No problem.

523
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,650
I'll make sure you look amazing!

524
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,650
Get ready.

525
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:36,810
Thanks.

526
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,740
Will you make it in time?

527
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,300
I only want to dance for you.

528
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,740
Stunning!

529
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,650
You're up next.

530
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,410
Nervous?

531
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,300
You got this!

532
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,460
Fu Zhuang!

533
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,650
Has it started?

534
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,700
Almost.

535
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,260
Why are you just getting here?

536
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:28,890
Let me tell you,

537
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,330
Yifan has been working so hard.

538
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,370
Every day after work,

539
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,060
she goes to the meeting room alone to practice dancing.

540
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,500
You know how long she's been practicing.

541
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,610
Why haven't you gone to keep her company?

542
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,650
By herself?

543
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,260
Wasn't she singing with Su Tian?

544
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,610
Singing?

545
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,420
Where did you hear that?

546
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,740
Come on, let's go!

547
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,410
What an incredible magic performance!

548
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,410
Everyone saw that, right?

549
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,570
Now, moving on.

550
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,500
I'd like to ask everyone to quiet down.

551
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,020
Up next

552
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,330
is a special performance

553
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,610
from the First News team.

554
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,780
A ballet piece

555
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,700
from The Nutcracker,

556
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,370
performed by

557
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,300
Wen Yifan.

558
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,810
She has been preparing

559
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,980
for this piece for a long time.

560
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,650
I believe you'll all enjoy

561
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,980
a stunning performance.

562
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,570
Did you use to love watching me dance?

563
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,780
Yifan!

564
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,540
When did you get here?

565
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,410
Just as your performance started.

566
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:42,570
You're sweating.

567
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,460
Be careful not to catch a cold.

568
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,890
Why aren't you saying anything about my performance?

569
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,700
Why haven't you danced in so long?

570
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,220
You danced beautifully.

571
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,460
Really?

572
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,610
It's been so long since I properly practiced.

573
