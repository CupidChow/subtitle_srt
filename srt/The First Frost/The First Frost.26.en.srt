00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,340
maybe I can help clear it up.

191
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,530
There is no misunderstanding.

192
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,930
But I heard

193
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,970
you've always minded the fact that she disappeared

194
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,970
after the college entrance exam.

195
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,460
What I said before

196
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,700
about her and I planning

197
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,050
to go to Yihe University together

198
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,660
was nonsense.

199
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,020
I made it up

200
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,050
just to mess with you.

201
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,170
But you didn't react,

202
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,970
so I thought you didn't care.

203
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,610
Then why did she suddenly apply to Yihe University?

204
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,490
I don't know either.

205
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,490
But if I had to guess,

206
00:07:59,190 --> 00:07:59,930
it might have something to do

207
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,290
with her uncle's family.

208
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,490
I know

209
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,020
she had a hard time back then.

210
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,370
I also heard

211
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,970
her aunt yelling at her.

212
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,900
And it wasn't just her aunt.

213
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,730
There was also some...

214
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,100
some Uncle Che of hers.

215
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,220
She never told us about it.

216
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,460
But one time

217
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,850
when Qiao was on the phone with Dian,

218
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,260
Qiao overheard it.

219
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,370
She said there was someone

220
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,290
who called himself Uncle Che.

221
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,340
He said a lot of strange things to Dian.

222
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,290
After that summer

223
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,420
after the college entrance exam,

224
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,010
Dian moved away.

225
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,770
No one knew where she went.

226
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,220
Where is she now?

227
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,610
I think I saw her at the Star Ferry Pier

228
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,540
in Hong Kong, China.

229
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,890
I called out to her,

230
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,940
but she didn't respond.

231
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,540
Then I followed her.

232
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,540
She ran into a building.

233
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,850
I searched for days after that

234
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,650
but found nothing.

235
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,610
Can you give me

236
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,010
the name and address of that building?

237
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,250

240
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,490
if that was her.

Could you check again?

247
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,250

But

250
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,730
can you describe her for me?

251
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,700
Wait a moment.

254

But as far as I remember,

255
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,770
her surname isn't Wen.

256
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,060
Not Wen?

Look.

258
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,970

Of course, I remember her.

But she always looked like she had a lot on her mind.

264
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,060
She seemed really unhappy.

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,700
Every day,

266
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,130
she just ate bread and bottled water.

00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,010
I'm Wendy.

381
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,580
From now on,

382
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,300
I'll be teaching you ballet.

383
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,890
Is that okay?

384
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,060
Yes!

385
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,060
Then,

386
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,370
let's get ready

387
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,420
and start class, okay?

388
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,820
Okay!

389
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,100
Mom.

390
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,850
When are you going to Hong Kong, China?

391
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,010
The day after tomorrow, in the evening.

392
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,100
Take this.

393
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,100
Isn't this the gift I gave you a few days ago?

394
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,890
Why are you giving it back?

395
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,740
Aren't you going with Haoan?

396
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,740
Look at your skin.

397
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,980
You're out in the sun and wind every day.

398
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,930
Be mindful of aging.

399
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,610
Make yourself look nice

400
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,300
when you go out with him.

401
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,450
Maybe

402
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,930
he'll fall for you even more.

403
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,540
Mom,

404
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,930
I don't care if he likes it or not.

405
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,500
This is the real me.

406
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,850
Besides,

407
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,020
we're going to find Wen Yifan,

408
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,130
not on some date.

409
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,740
I know.

410
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,610
You're so independent now.

411
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,300
I don't even know how to help you anymore.

412
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,020
I'm afraid I might just be a burden to you.

413
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,410
Mom, what are you saying?

414
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,820
How could you be a burden to me?

415
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,060
When it comes to relationships,

416
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,100
I have my own judgment.

417
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,340
You don't have to worry about it.

418
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,060
Alright.

419
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,340
Fine.

420
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,130
Come on.

421
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,060
Let's do our skincare together.

422
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,260
Qiao,

423
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,580
what exactly are you unsure about Haoan?

424
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,740
He's a great guy.

425
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,610
And he treats me really well.

426
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,020
Then isn't that good?

427
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,690
I just hope

428
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,020
he can love me in a way

429
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,610
that's different

430
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,740
from his past relationships.

431
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,450
What do you mean?

432
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,130
I don't know.

433
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,210
It's just a feeling.

434
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,500
That's why I'm still waiting.

435
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,370
Are you sure?

436
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,340
Grandma's friend is a professor at the university.

437
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,130
He really found a graduate student

438
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:53,930
named Wen Yifan.

439
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,100
Plus, Xiang Lang has seen her before.

440
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,740
And Sang Yan found the hotel where she had stayed.

441
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,300
These clues are pretty clear now.

442
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,500
Are we really not going

443
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,850
to tell Sang Yan?

444
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,980
Last time,

445
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,370
he was so disappointed when he came back.

446
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,410
And besides,

447
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,100
I'm worried Wen Yifan will reject us again.

448
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,890
Maybe we should go and try talking to her first.

449
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,650
Yeah.

450
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,930
Dian is really stubborn.

451
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,340
Even if we find her,

452
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,500
convincing her to come back to Nanwu

453
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,500
won't be easy.

454
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,850
If we don't find Wen Yifan,

455
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,820
we'll be short a major shareholder for Overtime.

456
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,650
Maybe...

457
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,130
I should sell my shares to you at a discount,

458
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,060
so you can take Sang Yan's place.

459
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,930
Stop joking.

460
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:33,980
Don't overthink it.

461
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,370
Let's find her first.

462
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,540
Hello.

463
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,500
I have a reservation.

464
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,210
Mr. Su, welcome back.

465
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,450
Would you like one room?

466
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,650
Two.

467
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,100
One room is fine.

468
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,060
It's not like we've never shared a bed before.

469
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,780
What are you afraid of?

470
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,370
I just think staying in the same room

471
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,610
will make it easier to talk to Dian.

472
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,450
Thank you.

473
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,580
You seem pretty close with the receptionist.

474
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,210
No, not really.

475
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,060
I just stay here

476
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,540
whenever I help my grandparents

477
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,650
with things.

478
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,170
Feels like you're a regular here.

479
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,100
Have you been here with Wang Linlin before?

480
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,130
No.

481
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,210
What about an ex?

482
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,850
Or the ex before that?

483
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,100
Or the one before that?

484
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,890
My rule is,

485
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,170
never go on trips with girlfriends.

486
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,780
You have a rule for that?

487
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,890
Traveling

488
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,260
means spending all day together.

489
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,980
If your values and habits don't match,

490
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,500
you'll be arguing the whole time.

491
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,740
And I also worry

492
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,100
we'd break up before the trip is even over.

493
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,980
That'd be super awkward.

494
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,100
But,

495
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,780
I feel at ease when going out with you.

496
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,370
Even though...

497
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,450
relationship doesn't mean you have to change for someone,

498
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,170
I think...

499
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,610
I really have changed.

500
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,580
How so?

501
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,170
Well...

502
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,020
I feel like...

503
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,410
I've become more relaxed.

504
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,210
When I'm with you,

505
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,650
I can say anything.

506
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,170
I can laugh and cry.

507
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,450
Life feels so much happier that way,

508
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:57,930
and so much more grounded.

509
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,450
It's like I can tell you anything

510
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,650
and share everything with you.

511
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,060
But,

512
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,130
there's one thing

513
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,740
that's a bit complicated.

514
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,650
What is it?

515
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,500
Right now, with you beside me,

516
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,820
I feel like I'm burning up.

517
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,780
I want to rush over,

518
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,210
hold you in my arms,

519
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,890
and kiss you like crazy.

520
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,980
But I'm trying so hard

521
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,690
to control myself.

522
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,820
I have to be honest...

523
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,370
it's really tough.

524
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,170

Thanks.

555

The school office is so annoying.

00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,450
Qiao,

559
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,650
don't we have a smarter way to do this?

560
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,740
It's way too hot.

561
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,100
Going around asking one by one is not the way.

562
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,260
Can't you be a little patient?

563
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,610
Hello.

00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,930
Do you know Wen Yifan?

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,610
Sorry.

00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,020
Sorry, I don't.

568
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,340
Thank you.

569
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:27,820
Hello.

570
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,100
Do you know Wen Yifan?

571
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,500
No, I don't.

572
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,130
Have you asked her?

573
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,170
Alright.

574
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,170
In just two weeks,

575
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,300
we'll be performing on stage.

576
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,130
Are you nervous?

577
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,300
Yeah.

578
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,170
If you're nervous,

579
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,500
then we need to practice more.

580
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,450
You're not nervous?

581
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,210
Then,

582
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,540
I'll demonstrate it again for you.

583
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,540
Stand in fifth position.

584
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,130
Remember,

585
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,740
when you jump, cross your feet in the air before landing.

586
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,500
Okay?

587
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,690
Hands up.

588
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,370
Second position.

589
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,540
Ready. One, two, three.

590
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,540
Good.

591
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,170
Now let's try it again with the left foot.

592
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,130
Fifth position.

593
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,100
One, two, three.

594
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,370
Got it?

595
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,060
Alright,

596
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,500
show me one more time, okay?

597
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,580
Come on.

598
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,580
Is your foot okay?

599
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,100
I'm fine.

600
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,130
I can cover the lesson.

601
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,410
It's okay.

602
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,370
I'll be fine in a bit.

603
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,780
Really?

604
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,500
Molly,

605
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,980
show me one more time, okay?

606
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,930
Get ready.

607
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,890
Three, two, one.

608
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,210
Sen,

609
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,820
you're so pragmatic.

610
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,650
You only treat me to a meal

611
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,610
when you're too shy to ask a girl out.

612
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,300
You talk too much.

613
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,890
Don't make things up.

614
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:02,980
I treat you to meals all the time.

615
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,410
See?

616
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,450
You admitted it yourself.

617
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,580
How many dates have you been on?

618
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,780
I should be the one treating you today.

619
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,130
Thank you guys

620
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,690
for helping me reconnect with dance.

621
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,580
No worries.

622
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,450
Let's just call it a celebration for your return to ballet.

623
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,370
Yifan said that after her injury,

624
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,130
she stopped dancing.

625
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,340
You even knew about that?

626
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,370
No. You were late just now.

627
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,100
We were chatting.

628
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,540
Same here.

629
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,540
I've lost count of how many times I've broken my toes.

630
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,890
That must've been rough.

631
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,740
I'll have the coconut peach gum milk.

632
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,740
It's great for recovery after an injury.

633
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,540
I have it all the time.

634
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:40,980
Thanks.

635
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,020
Sweet.

636
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,410
Really good.

637
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,410
But in life,

638
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,740
getting hurt is inevitable.

639
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,210
You can get hurt dancing.

640
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,610
You can get hurt cutting your hair.

641
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,540
Even trimming your nails can go wrong.

642
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,540
But it's okay.

643
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,340
We recover after getting hurt.

644
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,210
Then we get hurt again.

645
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,740
Then we recover again.

646
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,610
That's how we become unstoppable.

647
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,170
Got it,

648
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:06,930
Yuqing?

649
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,930
More or less,

650
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,650
we'll all face setbacks, right?

651
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,780
But life is fair.

652
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,780
You'll have a hundred setbacks.

653
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,980
You'll have a hundred setbacks.

654
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,650
I'll have a hundred setbacks.

655
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,690
But isn't it better to face them sooner

656
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,020
rather than later?

657
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,610
Right?

658
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,210
Right?

659
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,450
Right!

660
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,130
So,

661
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,890
I'm really happy now.

662
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,820
Because I've already been through so much.

663
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,260
Are you guys happy?

664
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,690
Are you happy?

665
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,500
Maybe.

666
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,020
Have you had a lot of setbacks?

667
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,850
You're really annoying.

668
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,500
Fine. I'll eat.

669
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,060
Thank you, Sen, for the lesson.

670
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,740
Yifan, does it make sense?

671
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,540
Check, please.

672
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,850
Sen

673
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,260
is such an optimist.

674
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,170
He used to be

675
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,580
a second-string dancer at the New York City Ballet.

676
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,450
I remember

677
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,740
he was there

678
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,820
for about four years.

679
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,540
He finally worked his way up

680
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,130
to an opening in the first team.

681
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,500
He was all set

682
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,820
to perform in Paris next month.

683
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,980
But then, while celebrating

684
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,690
with a steak he had just bought,

685
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,020
a speeding car

686
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,300
came right at him.

687
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,300
And his leg...

688
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,820
His dream was gone.

689
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,500
He spent a long time recovering.

690
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,540
You can imagine how painful it was.

691
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,260
But that's just who he is,

692
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,130
always optimistic, always upbeat,

693
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,980
and always willing to help others.

694
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,930
And guess what the first thing he said

695
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,130
when he came back on crutches?

696
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,130
He said,

697
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,500
"It doesn't matter.

698
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,340
I can still stay here

699
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,580
in my beloved Hong Kong, China,

700
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,850
and do what I love the most."

701
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,060
That's what he said.

702
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,300
What were you talking about?

703
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,980
- Talking behind my back? - No.

704
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,410
No one was badmouthing you.

705
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,130
I was just saying you're optimistic.

706
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,980
Look at your reaction.

707
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,340
I'm starting to think you really were badmouthing me.

708
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,370
I swear I wasn't.

709
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,210
But it's fine.

710
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,410
I'm used to it.

711
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,980
He said he's competing in a ballet competition

712
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,410
next month.

713
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,370
Right.

714
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,780
Talented people are just built differently.

715
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,850
There's prize money involved.

716
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,130
People are realistic like that.

717
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,650
They only join for the money.

718
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,170
Look, Wen Yifan!

719
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:51,980
Dian!

720
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,980
Go ahead.

721
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,100
Dian!

722
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,930
I missed you so much!

723
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,890
Dian!

724
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,610
You've lost weight again!

725
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,890
Why are you here?

726
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,340
Because of you, obviously.

727
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,410
Tonight, we're staying up all night talking.

728
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,020
At your place or my hotel?

729
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,370
I have to work tonight.

730
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,410
Maybe tomorrow.

731
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,060
How about it?

732
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,340
Alright.

733
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,820
How did you even find me?

734
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,210
Thanks to him.

735
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,130
Yeah, me.

736
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,540
I missed you so much!

737
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,890
Qiao, I booked the restaurant.

738
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:44,980
I'll send you the location.

739
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,500
Tomorrow, 1 p.m.

740
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,780
In the end, they still found me.

741
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,060
[Sang Yan]

742
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,740
[Wen Shuangjiang, I'm furious.]

743
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,540
[I'm furious that you never told me]

744
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,440
[what happened in those six years.]

745
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,040
[I'm furious at myself for only now trying to understand your past.]

746
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,940
[Wen Shuangjiang, you always try to protect everyone else.]

747
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,640
[Trust me, I can protect you.]

748
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,540
[Let's talk, okay?]

749
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,900
You little brat.

750
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,730
Where have you been hiding for the past six months?

751
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,330
I'll follow you anywhere.

752
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,980
I will go with you

753
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,210
to the ends of the earth.

754
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,330
I don't need to hide from you.

755
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,130
I can tell you right now

756
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,130
that I'm in Hong Kong, China.

757
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,420
Che Xingde,

758
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,900
I will never be afraid of you again.

759
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,770
I will make sure you pay for what you did.

760
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,130
Just running away

761
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,130
only hurts everyone in the end.

762
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,250
Ugh, I'm exhausted.

763
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,610
What are you doing?

764
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,540
Recharging my skin.

765
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,720
I already promised Sang Yan.

766
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,940
If I find Wen Yifan,

767
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,060
I'll text him right away.

768
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,060
Why won't you let me tell him?

769
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,210
She left Sang Yan without a word.

770
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,730
She must have her reasons.

771
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,770
I have to find out

772
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,980
where she stands first.

773
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,250
Wouldn't it be faster

774
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,330
to just let Sang Yan and Wen Yifan

775
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,130
talk it out themselves?

776
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,940
But what if she met someone better

777
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,130
during this time?

778
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,730
I'm telling you,

779
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,980
that's impossible.

780
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,810
Dian has so much to offer.

781
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,020
There must be tons of guys after her.

782
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,860
How is it impossible?

783
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,810
Indeed.

784
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,810
Sang Yan

785
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,420
isn't much to look at.

786
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,020
He's got a sharp tongue

787
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,730
and a bad temper.

788
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,900
For Wen Yifan to find someone

789
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,980
better than him,

790
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,860
that's way too easy.

791
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,900
Even if she hasn't met someone better,

792
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,330
she's been living in Hong Kong, China for a long time now.

793
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,980
She's definitely been through a lot.

794
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:18,980
How can you be so sure

795
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,810
her feelings haven't changed?

796
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,500
What if she never planned

797
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,980
on getting back with Sang Yan?

798
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,130
If they don't get back together,

799
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,130
it'll take him years

800
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,650
to get over it.

801
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,500
So,

802
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,290
let's hear what Dian has to say tomorrow.

803
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,500
Now, eat your noodles.

804
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,210
Or they'll turn to mush.

805
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,130
What's this?

806
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,580
A sexy nightgown.

807
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,210
Um...

808
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,380
it's my mom's...

809
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,500
I mean,

810
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,860
it's my mom's sleepwear.

811
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,060
I have no idea

812
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,610
how it ended up in my suitcase.

813
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,500
Let's eat the noodles.

814
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,650
How are we going to bring this up with her?

815
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,130
We can't

816
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,130
just ask her outright if she has a new boyfriend.

817
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,130
She wouldn't tell us anyway.

818
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,020
Why don't we

819
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,980
ask her how life in Hong Kong, China has been?

820
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,380
Let's start with something casual,

821
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,690
then bring up

822
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,730
the tougher questions.

823
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,650
How about that?

824
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:36,980
Sounds good.

825
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,730
What would you like?

826
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:40,900
Check the menu.

827
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,730
Dian!

828
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,130
You can sit here.

829
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:47,980
Thanks.

830
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,900
Check the menu and see what you'd like.

831
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:51,980
Did you guys order yet?

832
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,690
Not yet.

833
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,650
I'm just so happy we found you.

834
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,690
Can I tell Sang Yan where you are?

835
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:00,860
Right.

836
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,650
He's been searching for you like crazy.

837
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,940
I'll tell him myself.

838
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,500
Alright, let's order.

839
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,730
Okay.

840
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,420
Then...

841
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,650
let's just order something for her.

842
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,170
Yes.

843
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:20,860
Fine.

844
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,690
What do you think they're talking about?

845
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,380
I have no idea.

846
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,770
"Sang Yan,

847
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,060
I want to break up."

848
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,020
Could that be it?

849
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,020
No way.

850
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,540
If she really dumps him...

851
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,420
I'm afraid...

852
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,810
Sang Yan will...

853
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,330
get even more bad-tempered.

854
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,770
Stop jinxing it.

855
