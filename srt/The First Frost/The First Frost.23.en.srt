192
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,190
Okay!

193
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,240
You're here.

194
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,830
You're looking for our boss, right?

195
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,160
He's upstairs.

196
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,390
Okay, then I'll go up directly.

197
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,390
Want to have a drink?

198
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,070
No, thanks.

199
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,920
Shuangjiang, it's really you.

200
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,070
I knew I wasn't wrong.

201
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,430
Is something wrong?

202
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,200
What do you mean?

203
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,960
How can you talk to me this way, kid?

204
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,440
The last time you saw me, you even pretended not to know me.

205
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,960
Yifan,

206
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,960
it's been so long since you've seen your uncle,

207
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,200
and you didn't even say hello?

208
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,600
Shuangjiang.

209
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,600
Are you okay?

210
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,240
Who are you?

211
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,870
Who am I?

212
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,670
I'm her uncle. Who are you?

213
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,240
He's not.

214
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,200
What?

215
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,320
I'm not your uncle?

216
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,960
Shuangjiang, can you really say that?

217
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,270
I've used to support you.

218
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,150
Don't you remember?

219
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,750
Did you forget?

220
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,870
Do you know him?

221
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,120
No.

222
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,080
Move aside!

223
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,840
Shuangjiang, where are you going?

224
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,240
Let go of her!

225
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,600
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

226
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,200
What do you mean?

227
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,000
The boss is bullying me?

228
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,750
What? You want to hit me?

229
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,630
Who hit you?

230
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,870
Oh, here comes another one.

231
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,600
Come on, hit me.

232
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,480
How come I didn't see anyone hit you?

233
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,600
You mean,

234
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,440
you want to fight with someone, huh?

235
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,080
Fine.

236
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,200
I'm outnumbered and you're tough.

237
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,360
Shuangjiang...

238
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,720
see you next time.

239
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,000
Does it hurt?

240
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,120
Who's that?

241
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,750
My aunt's brother.

242
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,720
He doesn't really count as an uncle.

243
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,440
Does he always act like that?

244
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,870
I mean his attitude towards you.

245
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,960
I'm not really close to him.

246
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,790
He's not a good person either.

247
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,240
If he comes again next time,

248
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,840
just treat him like a stranger

249
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,630
and ignore him.

250
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,960
Have a seat.

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,200
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

252
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,120
If you face any problem,

253
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,510
you can tell me.

254
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,790
Anything.

255
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,320
Don't worry.

256
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,600
It's nothing serious.

257
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,150
Really.

258
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,200
I can solve it myself.

259
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,840
Go ahead and get busy.

260
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,080
Let go of her!

261
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,840
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

262
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,000
Why do you always stare at the clock?

263
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,120
All alone in the living room,

264
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,870
aren't you afraid?

265
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,600
I won't lock the door anymore, okay?

266
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,630
You can come find me directly.

267
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
How are you doing?

268
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,240

my room.

306
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,440
This is my room.

307
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,110
I know.

308
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,440
Then why are you here?

309
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,440
Why am I here?

310
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,110
Who else would be here, if not me?

311
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,110
It really hurts to hear that.

312
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,960
I mean, how come you're here?

313
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,270
How come I'm here?

314
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,200
What do you think? How would I be here?

315
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,200
Think about it yourself.

316
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,240
You're sleepwalking, too?

317
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,440
Sleepwalking can be contagious?

318
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,510
Fine, believe what you want.

319
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,790
Did you have a nightmare?

320
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,680
Or...

321
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,440
did you watch a horror movie last night,

322
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,590
scared yourself, and couldn't sleep?

323
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,920
That's why you came here?

324
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,960
That's not it.

325
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,200
So, you just wanted to sleep with me.

326
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,550
Think about it again.

327
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,240
You sleepwalked last night,

328
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,160
barging into my room,

329
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,110
lifting my blanket,

330
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,640
and carrying me over.

331
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,790
How could I carry you?

332
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,350
So sleepwalking gives you super strength, huh?

333
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,880
I guess I'm pretty tough after all.

334
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,680
What are you laughing at?

335
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,550
I just want to laugh.

336
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,880
Sang Yan.

337
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,480
I'm Wen Yifan.

338
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,830
Only you and Sang Yan haven't shown up on the list.

339
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,510
Sorry.

340
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,440
I thought Sang Yan was a girl's name.

341
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,070
I thought it was you.

342
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,790
Report.

343
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,920
Let's sleep a little longer.

344
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,000
Apart from the name,

345
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,200
my strength is more manly than yours.

346
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,310
Alright, you're right.

347
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,680
Sleep a bit more.

348
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,160
I'll make breakfast for you.

349
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,110
Is it good?

350
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,270
It melts in the mouth.

351
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,030
It's smooth and tasty.

352
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,960
Is "melts in the mouth" a good description

353
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,550
for noodles?

354
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,160
It's just like that.

355
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,270
Do I make any progress?

356
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,350
Of course.

357
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,480
Sang Yan,

358
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,920
if the guy from yesterday

359
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,160
comes to you at Overtime,

360
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,960
no matter what he says

361
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,270
or what he wants,

362
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,200
just ignore him.

363
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,750
What are you thinking?

364
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,830
After being with you,

365
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,590
I've never spoken to strangers,

366
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,480
neither to men nor women.

367
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,270
And,

368
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,640
besides you,

369
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,030
who can casually take something

370
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,920
from me?

371
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,270
Wait a minute!

372
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,920
Elevator, hold on!

373
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,590
Good morning, Yifan.

374
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,240
Mr. Xingde, please put my stuff here for now.

375
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,070
This elevator's too crowded.

376
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,750
- Let's wait for the next one. - Alright.

377
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,440
I'll leave it here.

378
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,350
Remember to take it.

379
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,690
Okay. Thanks, Mr. Xingde.

380
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,830
No problem. Go ahead and get to work.

381
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,480
Mu,

382
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,880
the guy earlier,

383
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,440
that Mr. Xingde,

384
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,200
when did he become a security guard here?

385
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,350
Just recently.

386
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,720
The security near our TV station

387
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,920
isn't very good.

388
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,000
So, he applied for the position.

389
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,350
He's actually quite honest.

390
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,440
And he's very helpful.

391
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,110
He often helps me move equipment.

392
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,480
What's going on?

393
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,550
You've never met him before?

394
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,510
No. It's my first time meeting him.

395
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,510
Yifan,

396
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,270
will you come to my farewell party tonight?

397
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,590
See you tonight.

398
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,590
I'll be a little late.

399
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,720
I still have some drafts to handle.

400
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,720
It's okay.

401
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,310
I'll wait for you.

402
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,830
Toast to you, Chengyun!

403
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,920
Are you toasting to him alone

404
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,790
or to all of us?

405
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,720
Yeah.

406
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,680
We toast to you all.

407
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,750
Come on!

408
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,480
Let's drink together.

409
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:44,440
Hello?

410
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,720
Hello, Yifan.

411
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,550
Today's my farewell party.

412
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,200
If you don't come,

413
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,070
you might never see me again.

414
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,160
Okay, I'm on my way.

415
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,320
[Sang Yan]
When will you get off work?

416
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,920
[Wen Yifan]
If you finish early, go home.

417
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,880
Don't wait for me.

418
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,310
I'm going out to eat with my colleagues.

419
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,350
Miss Wen, you're off work.

420
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,830
Stay safe.

421
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,680
Shuangjiang.

422
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,160
What's wrong?

423
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,550
Did you see a ghost?

424
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,310
What do you want to do?

425
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,350
If you can return to Nanwu,

426
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,680
why can't I?

427
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,720
No matter what misunderstandings we had before,

428
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,400
I've explained everything to you.

429
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,550
It's just that you didn't listen.

430
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,550
Misunderstanding?

431
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,400
Yes.

432
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,440
A misunderstanding.

433
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,340
Do you know

434
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,450
how tough those days were for me?

435
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,210
I felt like I was dying.

436
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,530
Each day felt like a year.

437
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,660
Don't you think what you're saying is absurd?

438
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:42,920
Did I

439
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,440
delay your college admission?

440
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,400
Or did I affect your work?

441
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,160
Or did I affect you

442
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,110
dating that rich boyfriend?

443
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,270
I didn't.

444
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,000
But because of you,

445
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,110
my life changed

446
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,310
since then.

447
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,760
It became like this,

448
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:58,830
worthless.

449
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,000
Who am I supposed to tell my grievances to?

450
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,590
Shuangjiang, right now...

451
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,830
I'm in trouble.

452
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,030
You'll help me, right?

453
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,760
Right?

454
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,830
I'm telling you,

455
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,200
if I can't make it through,

456
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,630
no matter where you are,

457
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,960
I'll find you.

458
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,000
And I'll tell everyone

459
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,110
that you once seduced me.

460
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,000
Right?

461
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,110
You even tried to kill me before.

462
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,790
Even if no one believes me,

463
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,550
you can't wash off

464
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,870
this dirt from yourself.

465
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,550
Because the way I am now

466
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,830
is all because of you.

467
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,070
You have to take responsibility for me.

468
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,240
Right?

469
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,110
Yifan.

470
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,550
Mr. Xingde?

471
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,630
What are you doing here?

472
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,070
It's nothing. I...

473
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,200
I just got off work.

474
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,160
I saw her alone here,

475
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,440
so I came over to talk to her.

476
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,310
You're really responsible.

477
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,000
It's okay. I'll head out first.

478
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,680
Alright.

479
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,920
Be careful on your way home.

480
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,160
Are you alright, Yifan?

481
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,790
I'm fine.

482
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,590
Let's go then, Yifan.

483
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,630
Everyone's waiting for you.

484
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,270
Come on!

485
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,520
Come on!

486
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,870
Let's all toast to Mu Chengyun.

487
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,480
How about it?

488
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,550
Let's wish him

489
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,920
great success!

490
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,550
And when he becomes famous, don't forget us!

491
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,240
Okay!

492
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:49,960
Come on!

493
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,480
Come on!

494
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,400
Once you make it, don't forget us!

495
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,240
Empty it!

496
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,550
Mu Chengyun, no cheating!

497
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,680
Empty it...

498
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,590
How come you're here?

499
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,630
What a coincidence.

500
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,680
No one eats with me.

501
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,550
I'm so hungry, too.

502
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,870
Did you just finish work?

503
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,000
Or did you come from Overtime?

504
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,400
No, I didn't come from Overtime.

505
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,630
I just finished work.

506
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,310
Who's leaving?

507
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,760
Mu Chengyun.

508
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,110
He officially resigned today.

509
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,400
That's a bit of a shame.

510
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,790
He seems pretty happy about it.

511
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,070
He always wants to be an actor.

512
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,480
Now he's doing something he loves.

513
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,830
That's pretty good...

514
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,020
[Zhao Yuandong]

515
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,870
A while ago,

516
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:49,160
Che Xingde went out with a friend for a drive,

517
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,270
and had a car accident.

518
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,310
That's really bad!

519
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,070
He crashed into someone's shop.

520
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,000
I was going to get them to move out.

521
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,870
He promised me

522
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,070
he would work hard.

523
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,160
I heard

524
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,200
he's found a decent job now.

525
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,550
Don't worry.

526
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,310
What's wrong?

527
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,790
You're not happy?

528
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,400
No.

529
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,200
I just want to go home.

530
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,920
If something's bothering you, just tell me.

531
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,310
Today, I visited kids with rare diseases.

532
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,400
They're so young, yet already face life and death.

533
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,550
And they had no expression on their faces.

534
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,110
It made me feel so sad.

535
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,790
They'll get better.

536
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,720
You're so focused on watching TV.

537
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,590
Haven't you slept yet?

538
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,030
Not yet.

539
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,440
We'll sleep in a bit.

540
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,960
I'm going upstairs first.

541
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,480
Okay.

542
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,760
Wear your clothes properly.

Here, He.

545
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,000
A new dish?

546
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,960
What's the name of it?

547
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,070
Golden Hand.

548
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,960
- Oh, Golden Hand. - Be careful.

549
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,160
Don't put your fingers in.

550
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,830
Go to hell.

551
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,000
Boss,

552
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,160
a new dish.

553
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,960

554
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,200
Yan!

555
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,160
What's wrong?

556
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,720
People from the Market Supervision Bureau are at the door.

557
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,590
There are also reporters from Nanwu TV.

558
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,920
What are they here for?

559
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
A customer reported

560
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,350
that the food made by Jun caused food poisoning.

561
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,480
They even called reporters to expose us.

562
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,590
It's the program where Yifan works,

563

First News.

564
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,070
How is that possible?

565
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,240
I ate so much,

566
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,400

00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:26,840
Jiang!

756
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,070
Why didn't you use an umbrella in the rain?

757
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,110
What do you want from us?

758
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,630
I don't care

759
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,880
why you came to Nanwu.

760
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,150
Just don't involve me.

761
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,400
Live your life, and that's all.

762
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,000
Whether you live or die,

763
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,480
it's none of my business.

764
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,320
What kind of talk is that?

765
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,070
You came in here,

766
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,400
and cursed us to death.

767
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,750
What do you mean by that?

768
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,030
There's nothing more to say to you.

769
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,320
If you...

770
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,840
or you...

771
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,190
come bothering me or the people around me again,

772
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,710
I'll definitely call the police.

773
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,440
Call the police, huh?

774
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,920
Why do you love calling the police so much?

775
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,550
Let me tell you,

776
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,320
don't forget

777
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,840
we once raised you!

778
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,670
Don't stop me!

779
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,360
How did you raise me?

780
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,800
Do you need me to remind you?

781
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,070
Do you need that?

782
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,280
Now I can finally live

783
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,230
without depending on anyone,

784
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,520
working hard to live my own life.

785
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,150
Why do you have to show up again?

786
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,030
Jiang,

787
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,710
your aunt...

788
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,750
During those two years, we really lived depending on your aunt.

789
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,440
We can't just turn our backs on that.

790
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,920
Che Yanqin,

791
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,000
the surgery fees you had

792
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,360
were paid by my dad, right?

793
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,030
And Wen Ming's tuition was also paid by my dad.

794
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,000
And the money you needed for your business,

795
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,150
did he ask for it back?

796
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,320
I need to clarify this with you.

797
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,440
All of that money

798
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,190
was your dad's choice to give.

799
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,280
You don't believe it? Ask her!

800
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,360
Ask your mom!

801
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,400
Go ahead!

802
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,030
Ask!

803
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,070
And you...

804
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Why did you make me live under someone else's roof for years?

805
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,710
You could afford

806
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,920
to raise me,

807
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,840
but never had the courage to do so.

808
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,070
Wen Yifan,

809
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,110
what are you saying?

810
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,800
How did you become like this?

811
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,960
Did you learn bad things from that guy

812
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,800
who runs the restaurant?

813
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,630
Learn bad things?

814
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,000
Now you're worried I've turned bad?

815
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,520
Isn't it too late?

816
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,190
I'll say it again.

817
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,070
If you keep bothering the people around me,

818
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,630
I'll fight you to the end.

[The story is not over yet...]

821

824
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,480

00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,230
I'm leaving now.

Jiang.

827
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:28,920
Well...

828
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,070
I just lost all my money

829
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,030
playing mahjong.

830
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,190
Can you lend me

831
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,230
some money for this emergency?

832
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,590
I don't have any money.

833
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,110
I will pay you back.

834
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,110
Come on, lend me some.

835
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,070
I told you, I don't have money.

836
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,110
I'll give it to you tomorrow!

837
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,150
I really don't have any money.

838
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,030
I'm really in a hurry...

839
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,590
I really don't have any money. Let go of me!

840
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,230
Fine.

841
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,030
I don't want it.

842
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,750
