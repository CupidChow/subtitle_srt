00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,120
Eight sixs.

189
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,120
Ten.

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,510
Start.

191
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,440
Start?

192
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,350
This is just the first round

193
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,220
and you're already calling me out?

194
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,590
Let's wait and see.

195
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,350
Here,

196
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,390
Nine sixs.

197
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,200
Su Haoan, you're off to a bad start.

198
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Truth or Dare?

199
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,560
This is a weird one.

200
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,150
Dare.

201
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,440
Take a look,

202
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,680
Choose someone here...

203
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,710
and kiss them.

204
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,350
You're not chickening out,

205
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,400
are you?

206
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,800
Who said I can't play?

207
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,590
I'll go all in.

208
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,230
Bro,

209
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,040
help me out!

210
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,560
Who else would I kiss if not you?

211
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,990
You've kissed Duan Jiaxu while playing games in college, haven't you?

212
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,800
Really?

213
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,830
You and Duan Jiaxu?

214
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,320
You know him, too?

215
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,680
You forgot I'm also from Nanwu University.

216
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,400
They're in the same department, same class,

217
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,470
even the same dorm.

218
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,110
They're both Computer Science majors.

219
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,440
Well done!

220
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,750
See? I'm brave enough to play.

221
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,200
Let's go. Next round.

222
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,160
Here,

223
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,040
Let's go...

224
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,080
Next round.

225
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,040
Six twos.

226
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,040
Six threes.

227
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,800
Seven threes.

228
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,630
Start.

229
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,320
Start?

230
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,400
You're calling it so soon,

231
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,920
Wen Yifan?

232
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,400
Truth or Dare?

233
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,630
Truth.

234
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,520
Then let me pick for you.

235
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,590
Tell us one good trait

236
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,590
about every man here.

237
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,080
Let's start with Su Haoan.

238
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,280
Rich.

239
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,830
What about Xiang Lang?

240
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,950
Smart, handsome,

241
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,200
and considerate.

242
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,160
I thought you were only supposed to say one?

243
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,560
What about Sang Yan?

244
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,990
Calm...

245
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,230
Quiet...

246
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,240
Confident...

247
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,830
Just confident.

248
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,560
Too confident.

249
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,080
Twelve sixs.

250
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,560
Dian,

251
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,750
don't be too eager...

252
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,680
Fifteen sixs.

253
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,110
You really dare to call it?

254
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,870
I dare. Do you dare to open it?

255
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,920
What's there to be afraid of?

256
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,710
Open it.

257
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,160
Five sixs.

258
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:00,830
You won!

259
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,950
Xiang Lang, I told you!

260
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,160
You fell for his trick.

261
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,870
Truth or Dare?

262
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,750
Truth.

263
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,590
Tell us one thing you regret the most.

264
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,920
The biggest regret?

265
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,560
It's probably studying abroad.

266
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,350
I was supposed to go to Yihe University

267
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,520
with Dian.

268
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,630
Why did you choose Yihe University?

269
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,520
I had already made plans with someone else.

270
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,280
Dian was supposed to go to Nanwu University with me.

271
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,040
Who knew she suddenly went to Yihe University.

272
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,920
I had already applied

273
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,280
for the best program at Yihe, Clinical Medicine,

274
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,680
but my parents insisted I go abroad.

275
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,230
Otherwise, from kindergarten to university,

276
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,750
we would have been classmates the whole time.

277
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,400
Real childhood sweethearts.

278
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,200
Let's continue.

279
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,400
Yes, let's continue.

280
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,080
Let's make this round more exciting.

281
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,320
We'll double the penalty for the loser,

282
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,750
both Truth and Dare.

283
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,280
What do you think?

284
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,830
Six threes.

285
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,200
Ten fours.

286
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,950
Ten fives!

287
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,950
Fifteen...

288
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,750
Twenty sixs.

289
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,710
Start.

290
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,920
I lost.

291
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,400
Yeah, you finally lost.

292
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,280
No regrets in my life.

293
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,400
Come on, Truth and Dare.

294
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,590
Let's do truth first.

295
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,950
The last city

296
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,710
you flew to?

297
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,590
What a boring question.

298
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,280
Who cares?

299
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,400
Yihe.

300
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,080
You paid for the bill, right?

301
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
Let's split it three ways.

302
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,630
The front desk said

303
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,350
Sang Yan already paid.

304
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,470
He did?

305
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,160
I thought Sang Yan only gave a 90% discount

306
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,080
and he was so stingy.

307
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,320
Looks like I wrongly accused him.

308
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,710
How about

309
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,110
we leave a five-star review for him?

310
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,040
We can't take advantage of him for free.

311
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,470
I'll take a call.

312
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,400
Hello, Ms. Qian?

313
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,830
Okay, I got it.

314
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,320
I'll take care of it right away.

315
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,470
I got an urgent task.

316
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,590
I need to go home and finish an article.

317
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,990
Let me give you a ride.

318
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,630
You'll get home faster.

319
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,280
Sure.

320
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,470
Take care.

321
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,710
I'll take a few pictures for him.

322
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,990
Okay. Bye.

323
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,230
Bye.

324
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,990
Be careful on your way.

325
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,470
Okay. You take care, too.

326
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,040
Let's go.

327
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,990
Zhong Siqiao!

328
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,830
Why are you still here?

329
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,830
You already treated us.

330
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,350
Shouldn't I take some photos for you

331
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,160
and recommend it?

332
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,200
It's great.

333
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,230
Let me buy you another drink.

334
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,800
Wait a minute.

335
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,920
What's up?

336
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,080
Didn't we agree

337
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,870
we wouldn't drink together again?

338
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,280
Right.

339
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,830
You drink then.

340
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,950
You're the guest.

341
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,350
Or you drink.

342
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,320
You just had a breakup.

343
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,440
Let the alcohol cure your sorrow.

344
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,750
One drink's enough.

345
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,710
I can't keep using alcohol to drown my sorrows.

346
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,160
Let me ask you,

347
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,830
don't you feel like everyone's acting a little strange today?

348
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,040
Yeah, a little.

349
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,800
Let me ask you again,

350
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,990
why didn't Wen Yifan go to Nanwu University?

351
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,230
Her grades are so much higher.

352
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,560
I'm her good friend,

353
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,350
but I don't get it either.

354
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,080
I feel like she just wants

355
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,630
to keep her distance from everyone.

356
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,950
Even I haven't heard from her much.

357
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,230
I thought

358
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,340
when people grow up,

359
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,590
their feelings change.

360
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,950
I really hate this change.

361
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,280
Do you believe me?

362
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,500
Every time I date,

363
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,590
I hope the current one is the last.

364
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,520
But nowadays,

365
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,800
no one believes

366
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,950
that love should be timeless.

367
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,400
If you keep acting like this,

368
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,040
It'll put a lot of pressure on your partner.

369
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,520
What's wrong with wanting to spend a lifetime together?

370
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,560
Maybe you just haven't met the right person yet.

371
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,870
It's you who hasn't met the right person.

372
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,530
Why are you pulling me into this?

373
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,960
I'd rather not date

374
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,830
than settle for the wrong person.

375
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,680
You're still not going home?

376
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,870
What about them?

377
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,680
They've gone back.

378
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,350
I want to ask you something.

379
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,630
You still like Wen Yifan, right?

380
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,470
I just feel like you still have feelings for her.

381
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,590
That's why I tried to set you up to be roommates.

382
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,830
I've said this so many times.

383
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,870
We're roommates,

384
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,280
just roommates.

385
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,440
Enough.

386
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
I can tell,

387
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,280
you're not okay.

388
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,470
For example?

389
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,830
What's not okay?

390
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,470
The way you looked at Xiang Lang.

391
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,430
You didn't like

392
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,520
anything about him.

393
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,910
Weren't you jealous of him?

394
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
Are you insane?

395
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,080
Keep being stubborn.

396
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,040
I've seen you in this awful state before, after all.

397
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:20,870
The last time

398
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,830
was the day the college entrance results came out.

399
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,630
Do you still remember?

400
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:38,740
[Beiyu]

401
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,350
You've been quite busy lately, haven't you?

402
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,110
I've been unable to reach you.

403
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,190
What happened to you?

404
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,630
Nothing.

405
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,910
My phone broke.

406
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,190
Why are you here?

407
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,150
Earlier,

408
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,390
didn't we agree on this?

409
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,760
After the admission results come out,

410
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,590
I'd come to visit.

411
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,630
My results are in.

412
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,320
I got into Nanwu University,

413
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,430
Computer Science department.

414
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,320
Your grades are better than mine.

415
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,000
You'll easily get into the program you want...

416
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,630
Sang Yan,

417
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,170
I didn't apply to Nanwu University.

418
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,800
You're kidding, right?

419
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,430
No.

420
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,520
Then where did you apply?

421
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,800
Yihe University.

422
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,480
Why?

423
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,560
Why Yihe University?

424
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,960
I had already made plans with someone else.

425
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,280
You came back so late. Our parents will be concerned.

426
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,630
Do you want some jelly?

427
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,430
Haoan is already waiting for you.

428
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,480
Does Haoan want some jelly, too?

429
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,560
What about me?

430
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,430
Don't you want to say anything to me?

431
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,350
Well, I'll say it straight.

432
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,590
Sang Yan,

433
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,480
I really hate it

434
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,280
and I really dislike it

435
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,560
that you always come looking for me in Beiyu.

436
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,390
It's annoying

437
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,870
to come out to meet you every time.

438
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,630
Wen Yifan,

439
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,390
am I just your backup option?

440
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,910
Nanwu is closer to Beiyu.

441
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,870
So, I'll go somewhere farther away.

442
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,190
When I get to Yihe,

443
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,480
I hope you won't come looking for me

444
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,390
like this anymore.

445
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,560
You're back.

446
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,190
You didn't reply on WeChat

447
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,590
and didn't answer my calls.

448
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,000
Where have you been?

449
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,560
What are you doing here?

450
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,240
I got into Nanwu University.

451
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,390
Nanwu University!

452
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,190
What's your attitude about this?

453
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,350
Bro, think about it.

454
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,960
We can still be classmates!

455
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,390
You know how bad my grades were.

456
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,960
Getting into Nanwu University

457
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,560
will make my grandparents so happy!

458
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,870
You know what?

459
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,760
When you said you were going to Nanwu University,

460
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,390
I thought,

461
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,150
how good is Nanwu University?

462
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:04,800
Still playing games?

463
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,670
Dian.

464
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:42,760
Nothing.

465
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,320
You're still the same as before.

466
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,590
It seems nothing matters

467
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,830
to you,

468
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
and you're not interested

469
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,040
in anything.

470
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,040
I'm actually quite curious.

471
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,040
What exactly would it take

472
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,560
to get your attention?

473
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,520
It's not as exaggerated as you say.

474
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,870
Then tell me,

475
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,280
how's it been

476
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,080
since you returned to Nanwu?

477
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,110
Pretty good.

478
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,150
Always "pretty good."

479
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,320
Every time I ask, it's always "pretty good".

480
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,520
When I was abroad, you were just as half-hearted.

481
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,430
In our group of three,

482
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,910
only Qiao and I were talking.

483
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,400
You always just replied something

484
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,670
like "Okay," "Yeah," "Nice".

485
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,630
You never talk about your own stuff.

486
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,870
My life is pretty boring.

487
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,000
Even boring things can be talked about.

488
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,000
Our world is like this,

489
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,350
if we're happy, we laugh;

490
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,590
if we're sad, we cry.

491
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,190
You seem like someone from a completely different world.

492
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,430
Dian,

493
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,190
can you promise me one thing?

494
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,430
What is it?

495
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,240
In the future,

496
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,910
if you encounter

497
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,240
any difficulties,

498
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,150
tell me right away.

499
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,520
I don't want you

500
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,430
to always shut me out.

501
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,870
Okay.

502
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,910
Can you explain one thing?

503
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,320
You always wanted to go

504
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,830
to Nanwu University.

505
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Why did you end up

506
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,870
quietly switching to Yihe University?

507
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,830
Don't you feel regretful?

508
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,150
You know it's a regret,

509
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,480
then why bring it up again?

510
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,110
Hey,

511
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,800
when are you two going to Nanwu University?

512
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,870
Didn't I tell you?

513
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,800
We're leaving tomorrow.

514
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,630
We did it!

515
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,390
- Shout it louder! - We did it!

516
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,670
We did it!

517
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,390
One, two, three!

518
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,240
I will definitely get into Nanwu University.

519
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,520
And I believe you will, too.

520
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,320
So let's make a promise

521
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:26,760
to work hard together

522
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,520
and get into Nanwu University.

523
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,280
I will definitely get into Nanwu University.

524
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,520
I'll take your basketball.

525
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,590
Why?

526
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,800
Why? Focus on studying!

527
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,320
Don't you want to get into Nanwu University?

528
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,480

00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,080
you're so early today.

560
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,480
Isn't school just starting?

561
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,960
It's the second year of high school.

562
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,390
If I go early, I can learn a bit more.

563
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,830

that she saw you at the city hospital.
