00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,510
It's done.

189
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,240
Thanks.

190
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,750
I'll help you pack.

191
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,750
Okay, let's go!

192
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,600
Coming.

193
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,840
Hello.

194
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,840
Lin.

195
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,200
Your boyfriend...

196
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,320
Your ex-boyfriend's here.

197
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,360
Lin.

198
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,320
Stay right there!

199
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,790
Don't come over here.

200
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,670
We're not a couple anymore.

201
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,910
I don't care about those bags.

202
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,870
I truly care about our relationship.

203
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,270
I don't care about those bags either.

204
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,840
I really want to return them

205
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,670
to you.

206
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,810
But weren't we just

207
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,980
happily having dinner together?

208
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,890
Don't you understand what a farewell dinner means?

209
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,480
Pretty girl!

210
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,550
Yes!

211
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,080
These are the bags.

212
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,360
Just these two boxes.

213
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,910
Alright.

214
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,750
Help me deliver them there.

215
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,200
Right there.

216
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,910
Could you show me the pick-up code, please?

217
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,050
Sorry.

218
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,580
Could you show me the pick-up code, please?

219
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,600
Only then will the order be completed.

220
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,510
I'm not accepting the order.

221
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,600
Do you know why I bought you bags?

222
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,790
Why I bought you clothes?

223
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,000
Why I bought you whatever you wanted?

224
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,720
Because you can afford to buy them

225
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,270
and I'm qualified to accept them.

226
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,750
During the pursuit,

227
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,240
that's an exchange of goods and services.

228
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,440
That's because I love you.

229
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,120
That word "love,"

230
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,960
of course, can't be weighed or counted.

231
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,360
But it's because I love you

232
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,360
that these bags bear value.

233
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,750
So now that I don't love you,

234
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,910
do these bags have no value anymore?

235
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,360
Just take them.

236
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,120
Consider it me begging you.

237
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,150
Alright?

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,630
By the way,

239
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,840
I can actually deliver them to your door.

240
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,670
1748...

241
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,960
Alright, thank you.

242
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,910
Please throw these bags away for me.

243
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,750
I'll pay the money.

244
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,750
Thirty, right?

245
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,720
Have you heard Wang Linlin is leaving?

246
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,790
Seems like she has landed

247
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,960
a big client in the ad department.

248
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
No wonder she took time off for New Year's Eve.

249
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,960
The last time I saw a car picking her up,

250
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,510
it switched from a Porsche to a Ferrari.

251
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,270
I wish I could drive a Ferrari too.

252
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
Your eavesdropping skills are terrible.

253
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,720
Me?

254
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,360
What do you mean, eavesdropping?

255
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Aren't the three of us a combo?

256
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,600
What's something I can't hear?

257
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,000
You two can't leave me out.

258
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:54,960
Fine.

259
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,200
What's the point of relying on a man?

260
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,360
Relying on ourselves is the best.

261
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,550
Are you stupid?

262
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
You're pregnant and still breaking up with him?

263
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,200
Before breaking up, shouldn't you

264
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,670
at least try to get some child-supporting funds?

265
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,030
I'm talking about Lin.

266
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,790
- Why are you dragging me into this? - Where are the house keys?

267
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,970
Did you forget to leave them for me?

268
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,240
I'm mentioning this for your own good.

269
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,550
Sorry.

270
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,080
Let me know when you have time,

271
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,960
and I'll bring them to you.

272
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,850
Think about it.

273
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,270
When your baby's born,

274
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,030
don't you

275
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,910
need child-supporting money?

276
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,360
Don't you need all sorts of things?

277
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,870
All that messy stuff.

278
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,010
Let me tell you,

279
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,270
I am an independent woman

280
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,750
in terms

281
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,000
of thoughts and finances.

282
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,630
I didn't lose them, did I?

283
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,530
Listen,

284
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,030
I started dating in first grade.

285
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,270
You've had a girlfriend since first grade?

286
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, senior.

287
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,150
Do you know why you're single now?

288
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,150
It's because of a word:

289
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,240
immaturity.

290
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,480
How do you know I'm single?

291
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,480
[Sang Yan]
I'm still in touch with her.

292
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,080
Who knows, maybe we'll get married one day.

293
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,000
How are they with him?

294
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,840
Did you purposely leave them with me?

295
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
I suggest not using

296
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,750
the same trick a second time.

297
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,200
Why didn't he return them to me in the first place?

298
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,710
Did he want to take the opportunity to make a point,

299
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,320
saying I'm being clingy?

300
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,920
So, they're at your place?

301
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,710
Let me know when you're free.

302
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,630
I'll go get them.

303
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,350
Sorry for bothering you again.

304
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,870
After work, come over to Overtime.

305
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,990
Do you have time tonight?

306
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,160
Let's have dinner together.

307
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,350
I have time.

308
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,230
Me, too.

309
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,350
Where should we eat?

310
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,280
Overtime.

311
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,630
So,

312
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,870
is this overtime or dinner?

313
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,180
[Overtime]

314
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,200
Turns out

315
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Overtime is how they call this place.

316
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,290
Looks like

317
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,870
this meal isn't just a casual one.

318
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,680
Thanks.

319
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,830
I won't keep you any longer.

320
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,040
My colleagues are still waiting for me.

321
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,470
Sorry for bothering you so many times.

322
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,830
Let me know when you're free, I'll treat you to a meal.

323
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,800
I'm free anytime.

324
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,400
How many times do you need to say that?

325
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,400
If I don't agree,

326
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,520
you won't give up, huh?

327
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,750
Since you want to treat,

328
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,560
let's do it tomorrow.

329
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,680
What do you want to eat?

330
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,870
Anything.

331
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,590
Any dietary restrictions?

332
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,350
A lot.

333
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,440
Hotpot?

334
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,350
Spicy.

335
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:48,990
BBQ?

336
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,470
Too strong.

337
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,040
Sichuan food?

338
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,470
Too spicy.

339
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,280
So, what do you feel like eating?

340
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,080
I'm okay with anything.

341
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,230
I don't have many restrictions.

342
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,040
Anything.

343
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:03,750
Hey!

344
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,160
Your house exploded!

345
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,350
Speak properly.

346
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,440
Not your house.

347
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,110
It's the house downstairs that exploded.

348
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,560
Do you know how big the fire is?

349
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,870
Your place almost burns down!

350
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,200
You should come back and take a look!

351
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,400
Could you please

352
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,560
call 119 for me?

353
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,320
Thanks.

354
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,590
Your house caught fire.

355
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,040
Aren't you going back to check?

356
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
I'm not a firefighter.

357
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,990
I can't help much.

358
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,680
Why go back?

359
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,280
May I ask

360
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,320
where exactly is your house?

361
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,200
Why?

362
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,870
I'm thinking of doing a report.

363
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,350
Could you tell me the name of the complex?

364
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:42,930
Hello,

365
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,630
Yifan.

366
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,830
I was just looking for you.

367
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,350
There's a fire in Central South Century City.

368
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
I'm heading there right now.

369
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,230
Wait for me there.

370
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,040
See you soon.

371
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,750
Central South Century City?

372
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,320
Yes.

373
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,630
Central South Century City.

374
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,470
Alright.

375
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,560
See you soon.

376
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,680
Mr. Yifan's high school classmate,

377
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,920
don't worry too much.

378
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,280
Our report this time

379
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,750
will be comprehensive and objective.

380
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,800
We'll help you defend your rights and recover your losses.

381
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,470
I think it should be this way.

382
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,320
Hello, Officer.

383
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,350
I'd like to ask

384
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,990
where are the affected households?

385
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,630
Over there.

386
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,110
- Those two? - Yes.

387
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,080
Alright, thank you.

388
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,320
Come this way.

389
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,040
You two go interview the rescue personnel first.

390
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,450
Don't disturb their work.

391
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,440
Okay.

392
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,200
Come on.

393
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,560
Hello.

394
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,320
Are you a resident here?

395
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,990
Yes.

396
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,040
We're from the First News program

397
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,200
of Nanwu TV Station.

398
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,830
Can we interview you?

399
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,630
Sure.

400
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,080
Which floor do you live on?

401
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,230
We live on the seventh floor.

402
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,560
I heard a loud bang outside.

403
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,350
It startled me.

404
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,400
I thought it was fireworks.

405
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,630
Someone said a resident on the eighth floor

406
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,320
charged an electric bike

407
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,590
and caused the fire.

408
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,630
The fire spread straight to the ninth floor.

409
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,950
The resident on the ninth floor

410
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,080
was really unlucky.

411
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,750
May I ask

412
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,280
is the resident on the ninth floor at the scene?

413
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,870
And the name?

414
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,150
I think...

415
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,430
it's...

416
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,800
a handsome guy named Sang.

417
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,830
Is he nearby?

418
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,350
- That's him. - Yes.

419
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,350
Got it.

420
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,350
Thanks.

421
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,000
Hello.

422
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,870
Sorry to disturb you.

423
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,720
Are you the affected resident from the ninth floor?

424
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,280
Yes.

425
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,410
I'm sorry to hear that your place

426
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,110
was hit the hardest

427
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,000
by the fire, correct?

428
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,080
So what?

429
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,110
Do you have any compensation claims?

430
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,150
Through our interview,

431
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,240
we can assist you in defending your rights.

432
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,040
What I mean is,

433
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,390
there's nothing valuable in my home,

434
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,150
so it's fine.

435
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,800
So,

436
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,720
do you have any requests?

437
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,960
No.

438
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,430
Sir!

439
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:42,960
Wait up.

440
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,480
Well...

441
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,040
I totally understand how you feel right now.

442
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,630
After all, it's a fire.

443
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,830
But it's fine you're safe.

444
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,590
I hope through our interview,

445
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,590
we can remind everyone

446
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,910
to be cautious about electric bike fires.

447
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,390
Is there anything you'd like to say now?

448
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,830
I'm happy.

449
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,320
I hope you can be as happy as I am.

450
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,630
What happened to him?

451
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,460
He's probably been shaken up.

452
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,630
Hello.

453
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,390
We're from Nanwu TV.

454
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,190
I heard that your place

455
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,830
was hit the hardest by the fire, correct?

456
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,720
So what?

457
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,800
What I mean is,

458
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,190
there's nothing valuable in my home,

459
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:26,910
so it's fine.

460
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,520
So, do you have any requests?

461
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,040
I'm happy.

462
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,430
I hope you can be as happy as I am.

463
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,620
[Sang Yan; Happy New Year! It's fine if you're not happy]

464
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,150
Yifan,

465
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,800
your classmate is both unlucky and amazing.

466
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,320
His house got burned down like that,

467
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,240
yet he's so calm.

468
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,000
Go comfort him.

469
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,910
Let him talk to the property management

470
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,040
and the insurance company about compensation.

471
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,080
Don't be too sad.

472
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,800
He doesn't look that sad though.

473
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,520
How do you know

474
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,560
what he is thinking?

475
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,040
By the way,

476
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,080
Ms. Qian's looking for you.

477
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,080
Go see her.

478
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,830
Hurry.

479
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,910
I'll go first.

480
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,430
Morning, Lin.

481
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,830
Morning.

482
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,040
You're up so early.

483
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,830
No, I just came back.

484
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,630
I was out all night, totally exhausted.

485
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,430
Do you still have the energy to work today?

486
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,390
Are you trying to kill me?

487
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,760
How could I have the energy to work?

488
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,280
So, you're not going to work today?

489
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,520
Not planning to.

490
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,560
Don't you think working every day is so tiring?

491
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,830
I'm okay.

492
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,720
You are No.1.

493
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,910
Fan.

494
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,080
Come sit.

495
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,320
I need to talk to you.

496
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,350
Promise me first

497
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,240
that you won't get mad.

498
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,000
As I just put it,

499
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,760
this job is really exhausting.

500
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,960
And the pay is so little.

501
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,240
A month's salary

502
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,480
doesn't even cover the cost of a bag.

503
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,870
I have been fed up with it.

504
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,350
I can't keep going like this.

505
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,320
I'm thinking of quitting today.

506
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,080
My cousin said

507
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,480
he's introduced me to a new job.

508
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,830
It's in Gaozikou.

509
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,040
So...

510
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,350
Just wait a second, Lin.

511
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,670
Fan!

512
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,560
Are you mad?

513
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,040
I...

514
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,110
It's a bit far from here, you know.

515
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,430
So, you're not planning to live here anymore?

516
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,110
I didn't know it was this far in advance.

517
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,430
If I could stay here,

518
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,590
I would definitely stay here.

519
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,320
I'll definitely find you

520
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,520
a very reliable new roommate.

521
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,000
But...

522
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,760
but I just moved in, and now you're leaving?

523
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,560
How am I supposed to handle the rent on my own,

524
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,040
Lin?

525
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,630
I won't take the deposit back.

526
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,960
Consider it as covering one month's rent.

527
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,560
You can live here without worries.

528
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
You want a female roommate, right?

529
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,040
I'll definitely ask for your opinion.

530
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,150
If you don't agree,

531
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,000
I won't let her

532
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,110
step foot in this house.

533
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,800
Little girl,

534
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,350
you're really something.

535
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,960
You've made such a big deal out of this.

536
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,670
You've forced everyone to cancel their leases.

537
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,520
Everyone's gone.

538
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,280
Did the fat uncle move too?

539
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,870
It must be related to that incident with you.

540
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,870
It's all your fault.

541
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,350
Was it my fault?

542
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,080
The police have the record.

543
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,480
You can check it out.

544
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,910
With the New Year approaching,

545
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,080
it's not easy to rent this place out.

546
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,520
Who's going to pay for the loss?

547
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,960
Our TV station

548
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,110
is very interested in reporting on housing safety.

549
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,240
If I hadn't kept quiet,

550
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,190
your house would have been in the morning news.

551
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,590
Or do you want your house to be in the news?

552
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,430
Getting a little publicity

553
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,280
might make it easier to rent.

554
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,590
I'm leaving now.

555
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,670
Why is the door unlocked?

556
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,910
Is anyone home?

557
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,430
Hello, I need to report a theft.

558
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,430
Someone's broken into my house!

559
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,800
Uptown Flower City.

560
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,870
Building 7, Apartment 1701.

561
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,110
I don't even know how many people are in there...

562
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,630
Sorry,

563
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,480
I mistook him for a thief.

564
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,110
Yes.

565
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,000
Sorry.

566
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,830
It's safe now.

567
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,630
So sorry.

568
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,190
Hey, why are you here?

569
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,000
Same here:

570
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,630
Why are you here?

571
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,630
This is my home.

572
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,670
What do you think I'm doing here?

573
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,140
Hey, Lin.

574
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,760
Who is it?

575
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,670
I've already gone to bed.

576
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,830
It's Wen Yifan.

577
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,080
What's the matter?

578
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,720
Make it short.

579
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,910
I want to ask you something.

580
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,040
Did you give the keys to someone else?

581
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,830
You mean Sang Yan?

582
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,320
I can hardly

583
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,110
find someone to replace me.

584
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,910
If it drags on until next month,

585
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,520
you'll have to pay the full rent.

586
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,760
I'm just worried about you.

587
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,830
Is that so?

588
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,040
Yes.

589
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
How will you thank me, bro?

590
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,720
Su Haoan, are you crazy?

591
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,800
It's your first day living with your Goddess Wen,

592
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,040
and you're this angry?

593
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,630
Is that really necessary?

594
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,110
Is your brain still underdeveloped,

595
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,390
or has it never developed?

596
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,870
She's a girl.

597
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,280
Is it appropriate for a guy like me

598
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,830
to live with her?

599
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,720
We agreed, right?

600
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,590
You're supposed to find me a female roommate, Lin.

601
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,040
What's the big deal about male or female?

602
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,910
You asked me to help you find a place,

603
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,830
so I asked you

604
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,720
what your requirements were.

605
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,390
You said just somewhere near Uptown Flower City would be fine.

606
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,670
Do you two have some history?

607
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,350
No.

608
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,960
Then could you ask your girlfriend

609
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,870
to let me know in advance?

610
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,800
And tell her too.

611
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,110
That way we can be prepared.

612
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,670
She treated me like a thief and even called the police.

613
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,320
Can you imagine that?

614
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,110
We agreed, right?

615
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,830
You're supposed to find me a female roommate, Lin.

616
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,720
Fan,

617
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,960
let's talk about it tomorrow morning,

618
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,800
alright?

619
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,390
I really need to sleep now.

620
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,130
Hello?

621
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,760
Can we talk?

622
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,590
Okay.

623
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,110
This...

624
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,110
might be a misunderstanding.

625
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,720
How about this?

626
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,560
I'll find a hotel nearby for you,

627
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
and you can stay there for one night.

628
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,720
You pay?

629
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,760
Of course, that works.

630
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,240
There should be plenty of budget hotels around here.

631
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,480
I can't stay in cheap places.

632
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,720
Then pick one that suits you.

633
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,520
I'll pay for it.

634
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,150
Just find a place as soon as you can.

635
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,320
You're handling this quite well.

636
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,350
Someone like you

637
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,870
probably isn't used to sharing a place, right?

638
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,000
Let's not make things worse.

639
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,350
Moving all your stuff back and forth would be such a bother.

640
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,670
How do you know I don't like it?

641
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,150
Isn't sharing a place all about lacking money?

642
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,520
Your financial situation is great.

643
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,870
You shouldn't settle for less.

644
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,910
My house burned down,

645
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,610
and I spent all the money on repairs.

646
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,350
So no, I don't have any left.

647
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,590
Don't you still own a restaurant bar?

648
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,630
Honestly,

649
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,830
it doesn't make much money.

650
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,320
My schedule's really irregular.

651
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,560
I often work overtime.

652
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,390
I'm afraid it might disturb your rest.

653
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,870
Then I hope you'll be quieter

654
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,800
when you get back.

655
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,390
I have a cat too.

656
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,350
What's wrong with a cat?

657
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,590
Cats shed fur.

658
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,560
They also meow a lot.

659
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,040
Plus, it's a stray cat,

660
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,800
not a house cat.

661
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,870
I'm worried it might scratch you.

662
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,080
You don't like cats, do you?

663
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,910
I don't like them, that's true.

664
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,390
See? I told you we're not suitable...

665
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,960
We're not suitable to live together.

666
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,800
We're of the opposite sex.

667
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,040
Living together isn't convenient.

668
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,350
You probably don't want

669
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,000
to overthink

670
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,830
everything

671
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,080
and feel uncomfortable

672
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,480
at home, right?

673
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,830
Wen Yifan,

674
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,280
your attitude is quite interesting.

675
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,480
What do you mean?

676
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:50,760
Do you think

677
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm still hung up on you,

678
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,870
still trying to cling to you like before?

679
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,240
I didn't mean that.

680
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,080
So, I'm that sentimental in your eyes?

681
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,760
You misunderstood me.

682
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,720
Anyway, I've already moved my things in.

683
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,560
I can't be bothered with it.

684
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,520
Give me three months.

685
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,150
After my house is done,

686
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:15,870
I'll move out right away.

687
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,190
But you have only one suitcase here.

688
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,830
During these three months,

689
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,800
please don't try to get close to me.

690
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,960
Alright, stop making excuses.

691
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,430
Could it be that I was wrong?

692
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,390
The person who can't let go

693
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,480
is you.

694
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,840
How could that be?

695
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,610
You're overthinking.

696
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,910
I wouldn't dare to try anything with you.

697
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,870
The reason I'm saying all this

698
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,800
is just to make things clear.

699
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,590
Got it.

700
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,830
Then don't overthink it.

701
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,080
How about...

702
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:53,910
Enough.

703
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,830
Got it.

704
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,670
How about this?

705
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,630
You stay here tonight.

706
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,240
We'll both think about it.

707
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,480
And we'll talk about it tomorrow

708
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,910
after I finish work.

709
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,240
When do you finish work?

710
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,800
Not sure.

711
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,110
I'll try to be back before eight.

712
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,150
Okay.

713
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,800
Then how about

714
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,390
you sleep with me tonight?

715
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,000
Did you say that wrong

716
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,480
or did you just speak your mind?

717
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,910
What I mean is,

718
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,390
you can sleep in the master bedroom.

719
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,520
Good night.

720
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,150
You really think

721
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,240
I am so mild and ordinary?

722
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,390
You'll soon see

723
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,480
how explosive I can be.

724
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,300
[Lin, let's see tomorrow?]

725
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,350
Sang Yan.

726
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,240
How could he leave the keys behind?

727
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,820
[Where did you sleep last night?]

728
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,720
Fan,

729
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,190
you've been waiting a long time, huh?

730
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,590
Did you order?

731
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,800
I'll order for you too.

732
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,110
Their ice cream is really good.

733
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:18,800
Lin.

734
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,000
Waiter, I want...

735
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,350
Let's talk about the new roommate situation.

736
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,720
I just don't get it.

737
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,080
What's wrong with sharing with Sang Yan?

738
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,670
I've said it I want a female roommate.

739
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,280
What's the big difference there?

740
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,560
How did you promise me at first?

741
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,190
Do you think he still likes you just because

742
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,110
of that "romantic interest" stuff?

743
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,240
Keep it to yourself.

744
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,000
I heard from Su Haoan

745
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,830
that Sang Yan never had

746
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,190
a girlfriend in college.

747
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,190
He hung out with a guy called Duan Jiaxu

748
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,150
all the time.

749
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,480
Doesn't that have anything to do

750
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,110
with our talk?

751
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,670
I just wanted to tell you

752
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,480
there are lots of advantages

753
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,670
to sharing with a male roommate.

754
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,830
He can help with heavy work.

755
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,480
He might even chip in more for rent.

756
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,760
If you use his things,

757
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,670
he won't make a fuss.

758
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,670
I don't need that, Lin.

759
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,910
I had a previous boyfriend.

760
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,910
We started dating after being roommates.

761
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,320
Even if it's not Sang Yan,

762
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,720
I think you should also find a male roommate.

763
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,110
Maybe...

764
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,280
you'll no longer be single.

765
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,720
Does the client in the ad department with the Ferrari

766
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,190
know about your new roommate?

767
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,560
Does he know that on New Year's Eve,

768
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,150
you went to the hot springs with someone

769
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,870
who drives a Porsche?

770
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,720
Or about your cousin who's helping you find a job?

771
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,590
They should all be pretty familiar with each other,

772
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,190
because they're all your cousins, right?

773
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,630
What do you mean by that?

774
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,150
What does that have to do with you?

775
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,350
Since you think sharing with Sang Yan is so great,

776
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
why not go live with him?

777
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
More cousins as roommates

778
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,350
wouldn't hurt you.

779
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,630
Fine, Wen Yifan,

780
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,830
I didn't expect you to be so sharp-tongued.

781
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,190
I'm done.

782
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,590
You can go ahead and order the ice cream now.

783
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,480
A male roommate?

784
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,590
You're acting so nervous.

785
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,960
Seems like there's something fishy going on.

786
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,400
What fishy thing?

787
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,840
I'm asking you!

788
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,360
Is he young?

789
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,480
Can I see a photo?

790
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,480
His Moments are empty.

791
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,400
No photos.

792
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,710
Is the profile picture really him?

793
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,270
Not really.

794
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,590
Plus, he hasn't confirmed

795
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,560
whether he will actually move in.

796
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,920
Well, let's try to get him to.

797
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,360
If he's a good person,

798
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,920
at least he'll provide some protection.

799
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,710
His character is definitely good.

800
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,040
At least, until I agreed,

801
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,310
he was very respectful toward me.

802
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,300
[Where did you sleep last night?]

803
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,710
Where should we talk today?

804
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,630
Should we find a place

805
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,190
or talk at the house?

806
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,190
[Where should we talk today?]

807
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,620
[Should we find a place or talk at the house?]

808
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:36,020
[8 p.m. at your place]

809
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,750
I'm dressing so casually.

810
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,040
Is it suitable?

811
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,040
The door wasn't locked.

812
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,710
Why didn't you bring the keys last night?

813
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,270
I saw you didn't sleep in your room.

814
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,840
Where did you sleep?

815
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,270
At a hotel.

816
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,270
A five-star one.

817
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,080
How much was it per night?

818
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,400
Aren't you here to talk?

819
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,520
Let's talk.

820
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,480
Have you made up your mind?

821
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,270
Have you thought it through?

822
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,590
I...

823
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,040
I agree for you to move in.

824
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,190
Honestly, my requirements for a roommate

825
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,960
aren't that high.

826
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,150
I only hope

827
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,630
its character is good,

828
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,880
and we won't interfere with each other.

829
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,750
Are you that trusting of me?

830
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,960
There's nothing I'm worried about.

831
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,880
But I'm a bit worried about you.

832
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,480
There's nothing that should make you worry.

833
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,670
If there's no problem, let's talk about the details.

834
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,310
For example?

835
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,360
Before leaving,

836
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,840
Lin gave me the landlord's WeChat.

837
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,630
The house is rented under her name.

838
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,670
The lease has six months left.

839
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,520
Got it.

840
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,360
Then, about this house,

841
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,560
the rent is 7,000 a month.

842
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,270
If you take the master bedroom,

843
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,000
the bigger room

844
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,480
with a private bathroom,

845
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,920
is 4,000 okay?

846
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,920
Sounds reasonable.

847
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,360
So, that works?

848
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,960
Yes.

849
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,560
Now, about the deposit,

850
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,000
it's one month's rent.

851
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,190
Right now, I'm covering it.

852
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,560
If you move in,

853
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,040
we'll split it evenly.

854
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,840
No problem.

855
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,710
Then, there are the utilities and other fees.

856
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,040
My idea is

857
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,590
we both contribute a little to the fund,

858
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,750
so we don't need to calculate it every month.

859
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,480
Just give me the total when needed.

860
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:45,880
Anything else?

861
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,310
That's about it

862
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,440
for the money part.

863
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,670
Okay.

864
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,520
Then I'll send you

865
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,190
the details and total later.

866
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:52,790
Alright.

867
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,590
Wait a minute.

868
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,190
Because I don't have much experience

869
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,630
sharing a place with a man,

870
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,840
and the past experiences

871
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,400
weren't that great,

872
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,190
even though you'll only be here for three months,

873
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,190
I think we should discuss

874
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,040
our expectations in advance.

875
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,670
Is that okay?

876
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,880
No problem.

877
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:11,920
You go first.

878
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,750
For example...

879
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
For example...

880
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,360
For example, keep quiet

881
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,960
when the other roommate is resting.

882
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:27,630
Alright.

883
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,630
The second is to maintain cleanliness.

884
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,750
Whoever makes a mess, cleans it up.

885
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,310
Got it, understood.

886
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,560
The third point is...

887
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,190
The third one is

888
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,310
no nudity in public spaces.

889
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,630
You really wish, huh?

890
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,190
The fourth?

891
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,880
The fourth...

892
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,790
and the last point is...

893
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,560
If you want to bring a friend home,

894
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,040
you must get the other roommate's permission,

895
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,520
whether they're men or women.

896
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

897
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,590
What I mean is,

898
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,840
if you have a girlfriend,

899
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,310
let her know in advance

900
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,440
about our co-living situation

901
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,670
to avoid any misunderstandings.

902
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,150
I don't have a girlfriend.

903
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,400
But,

904
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,670
don't get too happy yet.

905
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,310
I just don't want to date.

906
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:03,260
Fine.

907
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,560
Then if you start dating

908
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,790
during our time living together,

909
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,590
we'll talk about it.

910
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,000
Of course,

911
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,040
if I start dating,

912
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,000
I'll let you know too.

913
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,920
Not interested.

914
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,400
That's all I have to say. Anything to add?

915
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,400
We'll talk about it later.

916
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,590
I'll take this room?

917
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,110
Before Lin left,

918
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,400
this place was already cleaned.

919
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,110
Check if there is anything else

920
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,960
you're not happy with.

921
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,480
I'll fix it.

922
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,000
This is the kitchen.

923
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,880
There are lots of cabinets.

924
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,190
There are two levels here.

925
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,110
We can each take one level.

926
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:19,710
Alright.

927
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,440
You're taller,

928
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,630
so you can take the top level.

929
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,110
Sounds good.

930
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,080
This one here

931
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,670
is the dishwasher.

932
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,920
I'm familiar with dishwashers.

933
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,670
I know how to use the oven too.

934
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,440
Sorry.

935
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,150
That's the range hood.

936
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:34,750
I know.

937
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,960
No need to go into so much details.

938
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,000
I've checked this place before.

939
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,080
This is the guest bathroom.

940
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,360
Since your room has an en-suite,

941
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,400
this one is for me.

942
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,790
May I come in?

943
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,360
Sure.

944
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,630
But my room is a bit small.

945
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,230
Feel free to look around.

946
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,920
This room's pretty good.

947
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,000
I'll take it.

948
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:23,960
Why?

949
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,270
Your room has a balcony

950
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,360
and a private bathroom.

951
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,110
But this room is a bit small,

952
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,190
and the lighting isn't great.

953
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,480
Although it's smaller,

954
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,360
please move into that one.

955
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,920
Do you think 4,000 is too expensive?

956
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,440
But 3,000 is already my limit.

957
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,710
You're still at 3,000.

958
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,960
You don't need to pay more.

959
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,520
That's not right.

960
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,190
How can you pay more and get the smaller room?

961
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,150
This won't work.

962
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,110
Whether the room is good is my decision,

963
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,840
not the house's.

964
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,560
But even an idiot knows

965
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,040
to stay in a good room.

966
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,560
So I'm not an idiot.

967
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,270
Is he purposely

968
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,710
giving me the bigger room?

I heard that your place

973
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:15,190
was hit the hardest by the fire, correct?

974
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,230
So what?

975
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,310
What I mean is,

976

there's nothing valuable in my home,

977
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:24,520
