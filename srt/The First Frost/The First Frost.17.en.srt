Done.

191

just call me anytime.

194
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,200
Have you had lunch?

195
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,230
Yeah. I just finished.

196
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,030
Have you sorted the files?

197
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,510
Looks like...

198
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,920
not yet.

199
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,960
Okay.

200
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,400
Thank you.

201
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,320
Thanks for your hard work.

202
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,680
Sang Yan.

203
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,350
Where are you going?

204
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,590
Where else would I go?

205
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,800
Going home after work.

206
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,630
Going home?

207
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,750
Did you forget that you promised

208
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,750
to join me at Overtime tonight?

209
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,870
Do we have to do it today?

210
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,560
Of course, it has to be today.

211
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,590
Today's the shareholders' meeting.

212
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
I've already made plans with Qian Fei and Chen Junwen.

213
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,280
They're just waiting for us. Let's go.

214
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,160
Come on,

215
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,870
let's go!

216
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,960
The drinks and dishes are here!

217
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,710
The dishes, drinks, and Sang Yan are here!

218
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,840
You're here.

219
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,840
What a rare guest,

220
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,320
Mr. Sang.

221
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,920
Mr. Qian has been giving me a hard time recently.

222
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,280
It's definitely not that serious.

223
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,840
It's just that recently, the shareholders

224
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,750
can't get a grasp on your movements.

225
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,040
Tell us about it.

226
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,280
Seriously?

227
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,870
Seriously, tell us.

228
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,630
If I really tell you, I'm afraid you'll feel off.

229
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,630
You might get so jealous that you'd lose your cool.

230
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,630
You could even get really mad.

231
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,350
Hey,

232
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,800
what does he mean by that?

233
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,710
He said

234
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,350
there's a girl chasing him recently.

235
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,630
He doesn't have time for us.

236
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,870
What's the big deal?

237
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,960
Are you crazy?

238
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,800
It's not like this is the first time someone's chasing you.

239
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,840
We've never seen him show off like this before.

240
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,560
Right?

241
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,320
You like her too, don't you?

242
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,110
Yes.

243
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,960
So what?

244
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,040
Really?

245
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,920
Who?

246
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,870
Let me figure this out.

247
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,630
You like her too,

248
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,110
but you're waiting for her to come chase you?

249
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,230
That's kind of passive.

250
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,510
You're a man.

251
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,960
You can't just keep her hanging.

252
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,040
Qian Fei,

253
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,390
do I need you to teach me?

254
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,230
If you had even a fraction of my emotional intelligence,

255
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,750
you wouldn't be playing backup in college.

256
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,630
Stop!

257
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,800
I'll take the punishment.

258
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,870
Honestly, Sang Yan.

259
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,840
You always rub salt in others' wounds.

260
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,040
And this is from ages ago.

261
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,160
Every time there's a gathering,

262
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,200
you bring it up.

263
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,040
Is it that new intern from our company?

264
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
She's probably a junior or senior.

265
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,160
She's quite pretty.

266
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,320
Wow, you,

267
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,560
an old dog chasing a young pup.

268
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,990
She's still in college.

269
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,470
I got it.

270
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
He likes younger girls.

271
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,040
Get lost.

272
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,350
Love

273
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,590
has nothing to do with age.

274
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,560
Right, Jun?

275
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,350
You two together,

276
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,960
even if she's five to ten years younger,

277
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,920
it doesn't matter.

278
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,200
Looks like it's not that intern.

279
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,560
Is it

280
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,470
the girl who joined the company with you?

281
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,800
Wrong again?

282
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,840
What are your plans with that girl?

283
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,840
What plans?

284
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,680
She wants to chase me.

285
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,470
What can I do?

286
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,230
Just wait to be chased.

287
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,200
So shameless.

288
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,840
Too arrogant.

289
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,160
Why are you talking about me all the time?

290
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,470
Doesn't he have things going on?

291
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,510
Oh, you little brat have things going on too?

292
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,680
No, it's just...

293
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,800
Su Haoan.

294
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,960
You are gathering?

295
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,280
Is it inconvenient for me to come?

296
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,230
No, it's fine.

297
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,390
It's fine, whatever.

298
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,320
Who is it?

299
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,510
What are you laughing at?

300
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,390
Nothing.

301
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,440
I'm just really happy you're here.

302
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,470
Has she been here before?

303
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,230
How's Grandpa been recently?

304
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,590
He's good.

305
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,110
By the way,

306
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,870
I might have to move back home soon.

307
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,320
If you move back, Grandpa will be so happy.

308
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,840
Just don't find me annoying.

309
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,470
Have you told Grandpa

310
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,840
that you know about his condition?

311
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,510
I'll wait a few more days.

312
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,110
After all, Woodie just passed away.

313
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,990
I don't want to upset him right now.

314
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,110
How is this upsetting him?

315
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,200
It's just caring for him.

316
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,440
Fine.

317
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,080
I don't have the right to tell you what to do.

318
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,160
You can tell me what to do.

319
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,320
How are you so funny?

320
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,390
You even want that?

321
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,840
No wonder your ex-girlfriends had you wrapped around their fingers.

322
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,990
No.

323
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,280
What I mean is,

324
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,470
you've helped me a lot with this.

325
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,680
Your advice has been really useful.

326
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:56,920
And,

327
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,230
you've never asked for anything in return.

328
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,470
How can I be that kind of person?

329
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,750
Exactly because you're not like that,

330
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,840
I'm even more touched.

331
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,960
And,

332
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,110
I can feel your sincerity.

333
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,800
What are you babbling on about?

334
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,160
You almost made me forget why I came.

335
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Just forget it then.

336
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,200
How about I go visit Grandpa tomorrow?

337
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,230
Sure.

338
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,160
What's wrong?

339
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,920

During the Spring Festival,

356
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,080
I didn't think it through.

357
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,840
I should have known

358
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,390
that you don't like visiting my place.

359
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,560
I had you live here once,

360
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,710
then I had to make you leave shortly after.

361
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,350
It was really unavoidable.

362
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,840

do you think it was

because I couldn't fit into your current family?

368

369

did you come back?

404
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,280
So you were pushed out and slept here?

405
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,240

Will the gift I bring

461
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,760

470
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,630
I found it

471
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,080
at the animal shelter.

472
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,910
It's only one year old.

473
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,080
Could you adopt it?

474
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,870
Its name is really Woodie.

475
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,350
I shouted this name among all the dogs,

476
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,480
"Woodie!"

477
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,390
Only it turned around.

478
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,190
It was jumping around, trying to kiss me.

479
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,150
Trying to kiss you?

480
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,240
Is it that nice?

481
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,720
But, Grandpa,

482
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,870
It's not completely black.

483
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,150
It's only half black.

484
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,390
You won't be mad, right?

485
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,670
No.

486
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,480

487
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,190

00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,320
this Friday.

566
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,660
♪Like tears falling into the sea, escaping loneliness♪

567
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,780
♪If I can bring you even a moment of happiness♪

568
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,520
What are your plans for the weekend?

569
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,910
I have two tickets

570
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,350
for Mao Buyi's concert.

571
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,280
I'm just going to relax at home this weekend.

572
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,080
What?

573
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,590
You're still young.

574
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,190
That's why I need to chill.

575
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,060
Yifan,

576
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,320
hello!

577
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,760
Whose concert do you like?

578
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,910
I'll try to grab more tickets.

579
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:10,020
♪I want to take it slow♪

580
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,540
♪Wrapping my arms around your shoulders♪

581
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,180
♪Moonlight spills on your face♪

582
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,100
♪Tracing the shape of your smile♪

583
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,700
♪The desire for the one you love♪

584
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,380
♪Is stronger than happiness♪

585
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,660
♪Exchanging a bit of youth♪

586
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,780
♪For the best of times...♪

587
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,910
Have you been waiting a long time?

588
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,240
No.

589
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,320
Let's go.

590
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,940
♪Even without stars♪

591
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,060
♪We can be each other's light♪

592
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,760
By the way,

593
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,040
didn't you come back because of something?

594
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:04,950
What's wrong?

595
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,630
It's because the air

596
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,520
smells really good here.

597
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,080
Let me help you with the navigation.

598
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,150
Okay.

599
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,800
We're going to Spring Garden.

600
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,870
Spring Garden?

601
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,390
What's wrong?

602
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,480
You don't like it?

603
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:32,840
No.

604
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,390
I can pick another place.

605
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,800
No need.

606
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:38,950
Do you have any food restrictions?

607
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,760
Quite a few.

608
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,520
Hot pot?

609
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,110
Too hot.

610
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,950
Barbecue?

611
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,560
Too smelly.

612
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,390
Sichuan food?

613
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,080
Too spicy.

614
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,760
I asked you out for dinner before,

615
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,150
and you didn't like the dishes I suggested.

616
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,390
It's really hard.

617
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I just didn't like them back then.

618
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,630
Just didn't like them back then...

619
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,040
So now,

620
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,320
you do?

621
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,240
Isn't it noisy outside?

622
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,870
The breeze feels so nice.

623
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,590
Hello, would you like to dine?

624
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,840
We have a reservation by Miss Wen.

625
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,870
Okay, please come in.

626
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,630
Where would you like to sit?

627
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,950
Where do you want to sit?

628
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,590
Anywhere is fine.

629
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,350
Then let's sit by the window.

630
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,350
Okay.

631
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:38,720
Yan!

632
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,870
Yan!

633
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,080
Didn't you say you wouldn't come?

634
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,910
So you reserved here?

635
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,190
What do you mean?

636
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,480
We've had it reserved for a while.

637
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,590
Since we ran into each other,

638
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,430
let's just eat together.

639
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
As our department leader,

640
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,150
it wouldn't be right to miss the gathering.

641
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:51,670
Exactly.

642
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,630
Let's go.

643
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,950
Come on, let's go.

644
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,520
Your colleague?

645
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,430
It smells good.

646
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,080
Is it okay?

647
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,110
Sure.

648
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:00,800
Yan is here?

649
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,720
I can't wait.

650
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,760
- Yan. - Yan.

651
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,350
Yan, come sit!

652
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,870
Yifan.

653
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,280
You two know each other?

654
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,800
She's my sister.

655
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,720
What a coincidence!

656
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,390
She's your real sister?

657
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,560
You have a younger sister?

658
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,520
A stepsister.

659
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,800
Miss Zheng.

660
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,350
Her last name is Wen.

661
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,150
The "Wen" means "gentle."

662
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,560
Isn't she Kejia's sister?

663
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,870
We have a blended family.

664
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,630
I see.

665
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,280
Yan, introduce her.

666
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,350
This is...

667
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,720
your girlfriend?

668
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,000
No.

669
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,800
I'm just his...

670
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:50,870
friend.

671
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,800
Friend?

672
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,430
Yan,

673
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,240
is that true?

674
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,590
Are you deaf?

675
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,870
Didn't you hear it yourself?

676
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,760
Drinks are here.

677
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,430
If you want to leave, just let me know.

678
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,630
Who ordered an extra cup?

679
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,280
That's mine.

680
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Who doesn't have a drink yet?

681
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,150
Yan,

682
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,350
if you want some?

683
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,320
Give it to my sister.

684
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,430
She won't mind that.

685
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,760
She can drink anything.

686
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,670
Yan,

687
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,080
what do you want to drink?

688
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,350
We ordered early.

689
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,350
Do you want to add something?

690
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,390
Take a look

691
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,430
and see what you'd like to drink.

692
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,720
I'm fine with just water.

693
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,150
No need for anything else?

694
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,280
Okay.

695
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,320
It's rare for us to gather like this.

696
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,430
Let's cheer.

697
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,190
Come on!

698
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,390
You're right.

699
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,590
Trying to get a free meal from our leader

700
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,560
is not easy at all.

701
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,840
You can't schedule a meetup with him.

702
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,150
You have to run into him by chance!

703
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:49,950
Alright, enough.

704
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,350
I'm treating today.

705
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,280
Great!

706
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,910
Did you guys plan this gathering

707
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,120
a long time ago?

708
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,510
Yeah.

709
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,510
It's the end of the year.

710
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,070
Who knew that before getting off work,

711
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
Yan would say he already had plans?

712
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,990
And yet here we are,

713
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,510
all ending up together!

714
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,240
What's wrong?

715
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,720
Don't think you can just brush this off.

716
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,030
This meal doesn't count.

717
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,870
Come on, have some, Yan.

718
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,550
I didn't expect to run into you here.

719
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,910
I just started my internship at this company.

720
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,240
Turns out you know our manager?

721
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,030
My colleague just told me

722
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,320
that I disrespected our manager,

723
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,600
because I treated the person

724
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,840
he brought over too casually.

725
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,470
But that's not what I meant.

726
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,470
You never used to be picky, did you?

727
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,720
And I thought

728
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,800
we shouldn't waste the drink.

729
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,120
Why didn't you drink it yourself?

730
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,600
I don't like it.

731
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,320
But you used to...

732
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,280
Just put in a good word for me with the manager.

733
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,870
I don't want to offend him,

734
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,640
or I might not even pass my probation.

735
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,160
How is that my problem?

736
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,840
I'm just worried.

737
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,390
Help me say something.

738
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,280
What's wrong?

739
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,030
I don't have that kind of influence.

740
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,350
Wait for me!

741
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,120
Just hold on!

742
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,990
Listen to me before you leave.

743
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,240
Why are you in such a hurry?

744
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,800
Are you afraid of me?

745
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,990
Is Manager Yan chasing after you?

746
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,470
How could you get this wrong?

747
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,350
No.

748
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,550
Then that means...

749
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,030
he hasn't started chasing you yet?

750
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,470
You two

751
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,680
are still in the ambiguous phase?

752
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,240
Right?

753
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,470
Either way, he definitely likes you.

754
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,910
