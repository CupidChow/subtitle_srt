188
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:07,960
Outdoor interview?

189
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,080
Is there one today?

190
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,450
Yes. Let's go!

191
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,910
Honestly.

192
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,510
Let's go!

193
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,150
Don't forget to eat breakfast.

194
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,870
She's at home.

195
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,670
What's she doing?

196
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,670
Why isn't she coming out all night?

197
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,960
I'm here. Are you ignoring me?

198
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,030
Can't you sleep again?

199
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,960
Walking around like this in the middle of the night,

200
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,840
it's quite scary.

201
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Do you want me to turn on the light?

202
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,030
Wen Yifan.

203
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,080
If you're feeling down,

204
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,670
I can

205
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,720
I can tough it out

206
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,480
and chat with you.

207
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,870
What's wrong?

208
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,080
Say something.

209
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,440
Wen Yifan.

210
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,150
Hey...

211
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,910
What's going on?

212
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,600
I haven't changed my clothes?

213
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,360
Morning.

214
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,240
What time did you get back last night?

215
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,270
You don't know?

216
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,900
I went to sleep early last night,

217
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,490
so I didn't know when you came back.

218
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,730
I have an appointment. I'll go now.

219
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,750
Finally, you're on vacation.

220
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,120
I've been dying for these noodles for ages.

221
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,510
I think it's not that great.

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,240
Don't you think it's a bit too bland?

223
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,360
It's alright.

224
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,200
I can make these noodles for you anytime.

225
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,750
Are the buns good?

226
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,390
- They're good. - Hey, you kid.

227
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,790
Come here.

228
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,790
The kid doesn't know better.

229
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,790
Sorry to bother you.

230
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,440
Come.

231
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,870
- Dad's here. - Come.

232
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,480
Sit down.

233
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,840
Come.

234
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,600
Cui Jingyu?

235
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,140
Zhong Siqiao!

236
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,100
Long time no see!

237
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,150
How have you been?

238
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,720
Pretty good.

239
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,530
You came with a friend to have noodles?

240
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,440
Aren't you

241
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,390
Wen Yifan from Class 17?

242
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,360
We didn't see you

243
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,200
at the last class reunion.

244
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,200
I came back to Nanwu not long ago.

245
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,390
So,

246
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,080
how did it go with him?

247
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,670
Who?

248
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,130
Sang Yan.

249
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,890
I saw him that day

250
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,270
during the opening of Overtime.

251
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,870
How have you been recently?

252
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,960
I'm different from you

253
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,840
career-driven women.

254
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:26,770
I can only

255
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,080
revolve around my husband

256
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,240
and my kid.

257
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,110
After all these years,

258
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,690
you've changed quite a bit.

259
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,040
How about I introduce my husband to you?

260
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,800
Hubby, come here.

261
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,990
This is my husband.

262
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,110
We recently started a small company.

263
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,630
We plan to go public next year.

264
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,560
Are you still single?

265
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,950
I can have my husband

266
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,930
Introduce some of his rich bachelor friends

267
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,590
to both of you.

268
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,750
No need, thanks.

269
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,200
Yan!

270
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,400
- You kid! - What are you doing?

271
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,680
- Yan? - Come here.

272
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,990
Which "Yan"?

273
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,830
"Yan" from "Yan'an."

274
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,560
Continue eating?

275
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,560
Let's leave.

276
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,920
We're done eating.

277
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
We'll leave first.

278
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,160
Okay.

279
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,230
We'll make plans next time.

280
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,040
Okay, bye.

281
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,990
Bye.

282
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,590
Yan!

283
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,950
I didn't expect her to be so obsessed.

284
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,470
Is it really necessary?

285
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,630
Of course it is!

286
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,440
When she was in school,

287
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,950
she kept talking about Sang Yan every day.

288
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,950
Some people in our class didn't know about Sang Yan,

289
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,200
but because of her, they all found out.

290
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,590
No.

291
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,710
No.

292
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,800
Sang Yan,

293
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,040
Jing is looking for you.

294
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,280
Sang Yan,

295
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,230
I heard from someone

296
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,110
that you're chasing the dance student from your class.

297
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,350
Is that why you're ignoring me?

298
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,440
What does it have to do with you?

299
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,920
I'm just curious.

300
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,040
If that's not the case,

301
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,710
I want to tell you something.

302
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,990
Actually,

303
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,160
I really like you...

304
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,440
Does the school allow early romance now?

305
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,320
Then we can agree

306
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,470
to wait until university.

307
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,160
As for the rumor about you and Wen Yifan,

308
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,040
I simply heard it from others.

309
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,560
You don't need to be upset about it.

310
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,590
This rumor

311
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,200
has been spread so many times.

312
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,920
They're really boring.

313
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,220
I knew it.

314
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,400
It's definitely all fake!

315
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,830
I just mentioned it casually.

316
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,320
Have I denied it?

317
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,830
Also,

318
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,520
I don't like your type.

319
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,720
I'm passionate and lively.

320
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,560
You don't like me?

321
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,110
I call it pestering.

322
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,670
I saw my aunt again yesterday.

323
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,080
Back then, weren't you unhappy

324
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,430
staying at her place?

325
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,040
When I first moved to my uncle's house,

326
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,830
my aunt said something

327
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,000
one night.

328
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,590
What did she say?

329
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,760
At that time, my cousin was in college.

330
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,350
He'd only come back every once in a while.

331
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,330
Every time he came back,

332
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,410
my aunt would buy him chicken soup

333
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,280
to nourish him.

334
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,110
Then one time,

335
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,110
I was called in

336
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,960
because of an early romance.

337
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,560
My aunt scolded me.

338
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,520
After I got home, in front of me,

339
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,480
she told my cousin,

340
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,520
This is the expensive chicken soup I bought.

341
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,480
You have to drink it all

342
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,100
to nourish yourself.

343
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,020
I don't want that.

344
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,430
How can I finish all of it?

345
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,590
Jiang, drink it.

346
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,200
Why should she get to drink such good stuff?

347
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,960
She doesn't deserve it!

348
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,830
But I didn't take it too seriously.

349
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,270
I just considered it a stranger's comment.

350
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,790
But gradually,

351
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,400
I actually started taking that comment to heart.

352
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,680
Because at the time, I was someone...

353
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,640
Jiang, I really hate to scold you,

354
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,070
but look at you,

355
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,110
instead of focusing on study,

356
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,850
you're starting relationships!

357
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You know what?

358
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,070
You've completely

359
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,350
embarrassed me!

360
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:52,960
Enough.

361
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,720
Enough?

362
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,920
Looking at her just annoys me.

363
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,480
Yifan,

364
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,830
we really don't have the energy to manage you.

365
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,750
You need to behave.

366
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,790
Don't do anything out of line.

367
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:06,720
Otherwise,

368
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,510
how will I face your late dad?

369
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,200
I don't mean to blame you,

370
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,100
but you need to understand:

371
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,880
we're not obligated to support you.

372
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,720
Right?

373
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,400
Mom,

374
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,400
can you take me back home?

375
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,270
I promise,

376
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'll get along well with Zheng Kejia.

377
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,240
I'll also get along well with Uncle Zheng.

378
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,550
Can you take me back home?

379
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,440
Jiang, stop crying.

380
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,640
Listen,

381
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,680
no matter what,

382
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,680
you can't have an early romance, understand?

383
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,240
I didn't!

384
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,160
Mom,

385
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,880
I'm back.

386
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,920
Jiang, if there's anything,

387
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,880
you can talk to your uncle.

388
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,540
- I'll hang up now. - Mom...

389
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,440
I realized

390
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,550
I was a burden that everyone would try to avoid.

391
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,510
There really was no need

392
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,750
to give me such good things.

393
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,790
Dian,

394
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,720
you don't need to mind those words.

395
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,640
I still don't think

396
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,680
that statement was very accurate.

397
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,110
But when I see those

398
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,720
hundred-yuan skirts,

399
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,400
or those cheap little cakes,

400
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,480
I still hesitate for a long time.

401
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,830
I can't bring myself to buy them for myself.

402
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,920
It's not that I can't afford them.

403
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,030
It's just

404
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,730
that those expensive things

405
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,310
really feel like a waste when used on me.

406
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,240
What about Sang Yan?

407
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,720
Are you sure he doesn't like you?

408
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,750
Don't you think it's a bit strange?

409
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,200
With his personality,

410
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,440
and he's not lacking money,

411
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,480
why would he even consider sharing a place with someone?

412
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm pretty sure.

413
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,590
Because I've been really bad to him.

414
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,790
Did you get home?

415
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,400
I didn't expect

416
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,310
the teacher would call in the parents

417
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,830
because of this.

418
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,440
It's my fault. I affected you.

419
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,510
I'm sorry.

420
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,160
Have your family...

421
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,960
Sang Yan,

422
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,920
could you stop bothering me in the future?

423
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,640
There was a time

424
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,240
when I was very sharp-tempered.

425
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,350
Sang Yan was the only one

426
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,070
who treated me well.

427
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,550
But I hurt him.

428
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,310
With your temper,

429
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,200
are you sure you can hurt him?

430
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,070
Maybe you're overthinking it.

431
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,650
For him,

432
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,750
it might not be such a big deal.

433
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,850
If you apologize

434
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,800
and explain,

435
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,790
it will be fine.

436
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,680
Forget it.

437
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,160
It's been so long.

438
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,200
Apologizing is never too late.

439
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,550
Your mouth is on your own body.

440
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,270
You can say whatever you want.

441
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,350
It's your right.

442
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,640
Whether the other part accepts it,

443
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,160
that's their right.

444
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,030
I'm back.

445
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,880
Apologizing is never too late.

446
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,110
Your mouth is on your own body.

447
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,750
You can say whatever you want.

448
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,830
It's your right.

449
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,720
Did you check on the progress

450
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,880
of your house renovation?

451
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,070
How's it going?

452
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,440
The house isn't finished yet.

453
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,720
Even if it's finished,

454
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,920
it still needs to air out.

455
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,240
It'll probably take longer before I can move in.

456
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,480
So you won't move in a month later?

457
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,680
That's the plan.

458
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,240
You don't need to be so happy about it.

459
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,160
What's up with that woman?

460
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,270
Probably hungry.

461
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,680
By the way,

462
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,830
there's some extra chicken soup I made on the table.

463
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,920
Can you help me drink some?

464
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,440
What's up with that woman?

465
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,030
You think I'm scared of you?

466
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,550
You think I'm scared of you?

467
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,030
Maybe it's a case of dual personality.

468
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,720
But to me, it looks more like sleepwalking.

469
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,510
Maybe I don't fully understand,

470
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,200
but dual personality

471
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
is when a person

472
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,750
suddenly develops another personality.

473
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,750
Sometimes it feels like they're possessed,

474
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,070
acting in ways that are different from usual.

475
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,030
Even their expressions and behavior change.

476
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,680
But sleepwalking is different.

477
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,160
Sleepwalking

478
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,640
happens during deep sleep.

479
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,270
They perform meaningless actions

480
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,920
in familiar surroundings.

481
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,720
How do you know so much?

482
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,400
Because...

483
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,030
I used to sleepwalk.

484
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,590
Actually, I only started sleepwalking

485
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,000
after my dad passed away.

486
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,110
It also happened at my uncle's house.

487
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,720
I scared them.

488
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,750
It happened in my college dorm too.

489
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,640
But I stopped sleepwalking after that.

490
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,220
How do you know

491
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,510
you haven't sleepwalked again since then?

492
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,810
Because no one has ever mentioned it to me again.

493
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,030
Your roommate after that didn't bring it up?

494
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
I've rented with Lin for a short time.

495
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,510
Before that, at Urban Haven,

496
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,680
no one ever mentioned it to me.

497
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,980
Only after I came back to Nanwu

498
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,030
that I started sharing a place.

499
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,030
I never had such an experience before that.

500
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,110
Did I sleepwalk in front of you?

501
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,680
Did I?

502
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,510
So, after you came back last night,

503
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,240
you saw me sleepwalking?

504
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,920
Did I do anything?

505
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,750
You were just sitting here,

506
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,680
head down, not saying a word,

507
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,720
then constantly fiddling with your sleeves,

508
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,030
Then,

509
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,110
you went back to your room.

510
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,640
Sorry, I scared you.

511
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,510
Wen Yifan,

512
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,970
I'm a grown man.

513
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,000
What could you possibly scare me with?

514
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Besides,

515
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
I'm not scared of anything.

516
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,550
That's good.

517
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,880
Actually,

518
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,160
when I used to sleepwalk in my college dorm,

519
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,680
I once scared a classmate

520
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,240
who got up to use the bathroom.

521
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,690
After those nights,

522
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,890
I didn't dare to sleep much.

523
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,070
I was afraid I'd scare others again.

524
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,240
But she told me,

525
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,370
when I sleepwalk,

526
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,350
I don't do anything.

527
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,070
Don't worry.

528
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,160
If it happens again,

529
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,790
just pretend I'm invisible.

530
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,440
Actually, as long as I sleep well,

531
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,480
I won't sleepwalk.

532
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,030
It won't affect you either.

533
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,070
I think it's the first time

534
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,110
I've sleepwalked in front of you.

535
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,160
Of course...

536
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:01,920
no.

537
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,200
Is there another time?

538
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:03,920
There's one more.

539
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,200
What happened that time?

540
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,590
Let me think.

541
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,590
Ah, I remember now!

542
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,680
What happened?

543
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
You suddenly ran over,

544
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,830
hugged me,

545
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,030
and even...

546
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,270
kissed me on the cheek.

547
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,200
Why's your face turning red?

548
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,720
Are you feeling unwell?

549
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,510
Is your head hot?

550
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,160
Are you alright?

551
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,350
- Did it happen? - Are you sick?

552
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,680
No. Maybe the soup was too hot.

553
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,750
The soup was too hot? Oh, I see.

554
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,030
That's true. Who wouldn't blush after drinking hot soup?

555
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
Is this story

556
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,440
exaggerated by you?

557
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,400
Is it possible

558
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,300
that when I was sleepwalking,

559
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,160
I accidentally bumped into you

560
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,550
and there was simply some body contact?

561
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,440
Are you implying that I deliberately slandered you?

562
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,510
