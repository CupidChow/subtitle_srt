Can you stay with me always?

188
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,630
When you want to talk,

189
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,960
remember to call me.

190
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,080
I want to kiss you.

191
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,630
I'll go rest now.

192
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:19,960
Wen Shuangjiang.

193
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,910
Does this count as a kiss?

194
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
It's not the first time.

195
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
So,

196
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,120
I'm not being frivolous, right?

197
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,670
What kind of fate is this for me?

198
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,080
Being kissed and hugged by you in this early morning.

199
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,910
And you kissed but not properly.

200
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,910
Wen Shuangjiang,

201
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,630
if you want to flirt,

202
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,750
can you be serious about it?

203
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,440
How do I be serious?

204
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,910
Look at me properly.

205
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,910
Come closer and speak.

206
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,910
Then?

207
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:39,020
♪It was you, striding toward me through the storm♪

208
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:45,540
♪It was you, always cheering me on♪

209
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,460
♪The road is rough...♪

210
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,550
And I'm hooked.

211
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,220
♪But with you here♪

212
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,620
♪How could I give up?♪

213
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,180
♪I will never give up♪

214
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:07,260
♪You are my courage, my hope for the sky beyond♪

215
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:13,700
♪You are my light, shining through every night♪

216
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,020
♪Even if I have to walk alone someday♪

217
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,820
♪I'll never truly be on my own♪

218
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,860
♪'Cause knowing you're here♪

219
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:32,460
♪I can brave the dark ahead♪

220
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,320
What's wrong?

221
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,360
Why are you hiding?

222
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,200
I'm a bit shy.

223
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,000
Are you hungry?

224
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,440
I can't do both things

225
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,750
at the same time.

226
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,790
Do you want to drink porridge first,

227
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,510
or should I

228
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,150
kiss you a little longer?

229
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,270
Let's drink the porridge first.

230
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Go to rest after eating.

231
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,910
You still need to go to work later, right?

232
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,960
You want to continue?

233
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,240
Your kissing skills are so terrible.

234
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,000
My lips hurt.

235
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,680
Well, I just...

236
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,400
Need to practice more.

237
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,160
So, "Laughter" was Grandma's nickname.

238
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,680
Do you know where Grandpa has spent all the money

239
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,790
during these past six months?

240
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,480
He's been spending it

241
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,400
on those dancing aunties, right?

242
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,000
Grandpa missed the days

243
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,960
when he was with Grandma, living a simple life,

244
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,350
studying in Nanwu,

245
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,960
and pursuing their dreams.

246
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,640
So, he's spent money

247
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,350
to buy their old house back.

248
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,110
He even got those vintage pieces of furniture

249
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,070
and redecorated the house.

250
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,270
Why?

251
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,310
To recreate memories?

252
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,160
He must want to retire there with Grandma.

253
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,960
That place holds

254
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,680
their most beautiful memories.

255
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,510
He wants to preserve those memories

256
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,000
while he still has money.

257
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,550
He's always thinking about that stuff.

258
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,830
He's getting old,

259
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,030
coming up with all these odd ideas.

260
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,200
Su Haoan,

261
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,440
so this is how you see it?

262
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,350
But

263
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,730
he already let Grandma misunderstand,

264
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,750
and he won't clarify.

265
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,270
Some things can't be solved

266
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,510
just by talking.

267
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,110
I don't think

268
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,400
you've ever really cared about them.

269
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
It's not that I don't care,

270
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,000
but over the years...

271
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,480
I feel like our family

272
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,790
has this permanent wound

273
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,960
that no one dares to talk about

274
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
and no one dares to touch!

275
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
Do you know?

276
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,240
This is probably

277
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,480
why Grandpa refused to talk about his illness,

278
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,680
neglected it,

279
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,640
and even pushed Grandma

280
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,240
to go on a road trip.

281
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,750
Your family only has three people left,

282
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,000
yet no one

283
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,200
is willing to talk about the past properly.

284
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,160
How will you face the future?

285
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,790
The other day, Grandpa came to your house.

286
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,110
He asked me which side of the bed I slept on.

287
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,510
Do you usually sleep

288
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,350
on the left side,

289
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,240
or the right?

290
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,310
Right side.

291
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,350
Do you know,

292
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,750
now Grandpa always sleeps on the left side at home,

293
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,160
and Grandma always sleeps on the right side?

294
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,350
When Grandma isn't at home,

295
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
I go to her room

296
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,240
every day

297
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,510
to clean

298
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,110
and tidy up.

299
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,510
Then I sit here,

300
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,920
listening to old songs

301
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,270
and viewing old photos.

302
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,790
So many memories

303
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,160
suddenly flood back.

304
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,160
I have to hurry

305
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,310
and write them down.

306
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,920
Once I've written them down,

307
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,240
I'll head back to the old house

308
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,680
and add more things to it.

309
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,550
The person

310
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,880
you want to be with till the end

311
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,830
is Grandma, right?

312
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,920
Given my current physical condition,

313
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,790
I will definitely

314
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,110
leave this world before her.

315
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,510
A few years ago,

316
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,880
I was busy with work,

317
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,350
and I had no time to accompany her.

318
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,110
After she retired,

319
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,880
she spent every day

320
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,200
just staying at home.

321
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,440
And then,

322
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,310
that car accident

323
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,200
took away the happiness

324
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,830
of the whole family.

325
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,480
Why didn't you travel with Grandma?

326
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,750
The two of you would have been happier.

327
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,440
I wanted to,

328
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,750
but my health

329
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,640
didn't allow me to accompany her.

330
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,240
I always feel like I owe her.

331
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,350
So one time,

332
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,640
I intentionally had a big fight with her,

333
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,510
so she'd know

334
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,000
that she could

335
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,110
travel alone

336
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,200
without me.

337
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,350
They must both have been so uncomfortable

338
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,790
without each other.

339
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,960
They were just holding on.

340
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,720
You, too.

341
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,110
You're so young,

342
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,550
so you should bear the pain at home,

343
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,880
and help them move on.

344
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,350
No one has ever talked to me about all this.

345
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,680
Well, I'll be the first to wake you up.

346
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,160
What about you?

347
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,720
Does anyone listen to you properly?

348
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,590
This is a bridge again,

349
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,590
the place you go to

350
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,000
whenever you face pressure and want to escape.

351
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,160
So, you also have pressure,

352
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,790
but no one listens to you properly.

353
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,400
Isn't that right?

354
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,880
I have an order to take.

355
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,920
Zhong Siqiao!

356
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,400
You've helped Dian.

357
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,510
You've helped Xiang Lang.

358
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,440
You've helped all your family.

359
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,480
You've helped everyone around you.

360
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,310
You've helped me.

361
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,480
What about you?

362
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,400
Is there anything I can help you with?

363
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,750
No need to smile.

364
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,270
No need to force a smile.

365
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,270
What I've learned over the years

366
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,440
is that when you don't want to smile, simply don't!

367
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,830
I'm not as strong as you,

368
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,270
but I understand weakness!

369
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,200
Isn't it hard, holding on like that?

370
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,070
I just love them so much.

371
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,720
I don't want them to be separated.

372
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,790
I don't want to see my brother fail at everything.

373
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,920
I don't want Grandpa and Grandma

374
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,680
to be left alone when they're sick.

375
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,400
I don't want Dian, Xiang Lang,

376
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,750
or anyone around me to feel sad!

377
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,550
I also know that you kind of like me.

378
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,750
I'm not stupid.

379
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,440
But I don't want it to be

380
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,830
because I helped you out,

381
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,640
and you just happened to be heartbroken,

382
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,640
and then you thought

383
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,800
maybe we could try.

384
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,200
I don't want it to be like that!

385
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,960
So over these days,

386
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,240
have you thought about me?

387
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,790
I did think about you.

388
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,830
But I'm also really frustrated!

389
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,440
You've been out of touch for half a month,

390
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,400
and I didn't want you to know that I missed you.

391
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,590
I...

392
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,310
I guess I was too emotional.

393
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,480
I...

394
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,480
I'm okay.

395
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,750
That's because you're more experienced.

396
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,240
Hey...

397
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,030
Every relationship I have is different, okay?

398
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,050
Don't misunderstand me.

399
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,070
I haven't agreed to date you yet.

400
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,270
So, would you like to date me?

401
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,680
I...

402
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,880
I'll think about it.

403
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,310
Zhong Siqiao,

404
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,310
what you just said sounded like a bad girl.

405
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,030
But you kissed me first!

406
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,400
But you were more aggressive!

407
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,790
That's because you experienced guy seduced me.

408
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,480
Fine!

409
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,510
Let's start over!

410
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,680
From now on,

411
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,790
I'll officially chase you!

412
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,400
We'll have a shared future!

413
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,690
Is that okay?

414
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,240
Su Haoan, calm down.

415
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,270
Sit down!

416
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,220
♪My love for you...♪

417
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,960
Take your time chasing me.

418
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,590
Slowly discover my other good sides.

419
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,440
Gradually fall for me.

420
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,440
Is that okay?

421
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,110
Okay.

422
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,300
♪I'm in love♪

423
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,310
Your kissing skills are so terrible.

424
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,830
So embarrassing.

425
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:42,750
Where is he?

426
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,720
You...

427
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,640
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

428
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,640
You

429
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,830
went out this morning?

430
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,030
My sister came.

431
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,790
She took my graduation album before.

432
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,750
She just came to return it.

433
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,110
Why didn't you invite her here?

434
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,000
She's already gone.

435
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,310
Want to see what your boyfriend looks like

436
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,310
back in college?

437
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,750
Here.

438
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,200
How does he look?

439
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,000
Handsome, right?

440
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,720
This is Su Haoan.

441
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,200
He dyed his hair yellow

442
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
back in college.

443
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,000
This is Qian Fei.

444
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,720
By the way,

445
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,400
Qian Fei is getting married on the 8th.

446
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,270
Are you free then?

447
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,880
I'm not sure yet.

448
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,880
What's up?

449
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,720
Nothing, just asking.

450
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,160
This is Duan Jiaxu, right?

451
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,590
He's quite handsome.

452
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,920
He looks the same as before.

453
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,240
Is he handsome?

454
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,030
This picture is average.

455
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,200
He looks a bit silly here.

456
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,240
No way.

457
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,510
You can tell he's the campus heartthrob.

458
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,750
He should be popular with a lot of girls.

459
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,960
I've heard before

460
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,680
you two were the campus heartthrobs.

461
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,310
I've never heard of that.

462
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,270
Well,

463
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,590
in your eyes,

464
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,110
what's...

465
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,830
what's so handsome about him?

466
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
In what ways?

467
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,110
He looks very sunny.

468
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,110
He has a youthful vibe.

469
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,680
He's quite eye-catching

470
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,830
in the crowd.

471
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,680
Maybe it's

472
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,440
because I'm not in this photo.

473
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,790
Isn't this you?

474
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,160
He just

475
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,240
looks younger.

476
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,480
Actually, he's quite old.

477
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,240
He's older than all of us.

478
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,400
He belongs to the previous generation.

479
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,240
Isn't that a bit too much?

480
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,070
No.

481
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,240
He's really quite old.

482
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,880
I didn't notice that before.

483
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,110
Why are there so many scenes of him?

484
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,880
Are you tired?

485
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,350
I'm fine.

486
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,790
Well,

487
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,790
I'm tired.

488
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,240
Maybe I should get some rest.

489
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,920
I haven't finished viewing it yet.

490
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,480
Maybe another day.

491
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,920
Let's view it another day.

492
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,400
I'll go to sleep now.

493
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,720
Good night.

494
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,550
The door isn't locked.

495
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,110
Are you chasing me this relentlessly?

496
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,270
No need to knock in the future.

497
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,350
Just come in.

498
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,830
I was just afraid

499
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,350
you might be changing clothes.

500
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,240
So what if I am?

501
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,400
This is for you.

502
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,750
What's this?

503
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,070
Your early Valentine's Day gift.

504
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,350
Because I saw

505
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,880
others usually have

506
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,680
candlelit dinners for Valentine's Day,

507
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,640
but I don't want to do that.

508
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,200
Because...

509
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,030
you are special.

510
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,550
Can I look at it?

511
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,830
Why do you like giving me things

512
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,160
meant for little girls?

513
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,400
When you wear it, you don't look like a little girl.

514
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,350
What does the snowflake decoration mean?

515
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,750
It's Frost's Descent, pronounced as my name, Shuangjiang.

516
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,480
Come on,

517
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,510
put this on for your significant other.

518
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,550
What about this one?

519
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,160
This one is mine.

520
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,070
Done.

521
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,160
Is it a mulberry leaf?

522
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,440
It's a couple's version?

523
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,270
Alright.

524
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,960
Today, I'll gladly play the little girl.

525
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,830
I also have a gift for you.

526
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,440
It's in the first drawer.

527
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,640
This one?

528
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,350
Can I open it?

529
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,790
Of course.

530
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,070
Didn't you say

531
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,350
your voice recorder didn't work?

532
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,310
But I don't know how to use this.

533
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,830
Do I need to plug it into the computer

534
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,750
and listen to it?

535
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,400
No need.

536
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,750
Just press this button, and it works.

537
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,350
Try it in your room.

538
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,680
Why?

539
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,850
Just try it

540
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,440
in your place.

541
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,640
If there's a problem, we can exchange it.

542
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,350
Wen Shuangjiang,

543
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,480
please be safe at work.

544
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,310
Your boyfriend wants you to return home safely.

545
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,240
You

546
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,920
deserve the best.

547
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,440
Remember, there is someone lonely at home,

548
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,240
waiting for your safe return.

549
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,030
No matter what happens,

550
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,070
I will always be with you.

551
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,960
This is it.

552
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,630
I spent half a year

553
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,800
and finally managed to make this place

554
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,880
look a bit more presentable.

555
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:36,960
Your grandma

556
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,960
has always had great taste in life.

557
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,880
Our past life

558
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,400
wasn't very wealthy,

559
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,760
but our spiritual life

560
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,960
was still rich.

561
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,710
She loved pottery,

562
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,230
so I placed a lot of pottery here.

563
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,840
She also liked flowers and plants,

564
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,920
so I often came up here to tidy up the plants.

565
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,440
Also,

566
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
back in the day,

567
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,590
she had a habit of drinking coffee.

568
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,190
Now,

569
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,510
I've learned to brew coffee myself.

570
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,190
No wonder,

571
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,190
every time I take him here,

572
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,440
he doesn't let me come in.

573
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,110
Turns out

574
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,230
this place is his paradise.

575
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,400
I was afraid I'd forget our past life.

576
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,360
So,

577
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,150
while tidying up,

578
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,800
I tried to piece together

579
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,920
the old memories.

580
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,630
Even this sofa and cushion

581
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,440
look very similar to what we used before.

582
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,590
Laughter, you're back!

583
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,550
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

584
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,590
I didn't ask for your permission

585
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,710
before I told Grandma about your illness.

586
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,070
It's my fault, Grandpa.

587
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,030
I think Grandma has the right to know.

588
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,800
If you didn't tell her,

589
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,230
she would be really sad.

590
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,230
Let me ask you,

591
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,400
why didn't you tell me when you got sick?

592
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,070
I just wanted you

593
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,150
to go on a trip without any worries,

594
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,190
to enjoy it happily.

595
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,800
I didn't want you

596
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,670
to lose your dreams in life.

597
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,960
If my dreams don't include you,

598
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,550
then what's the point?

599
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,230
If you hadn't purposely argued with me,

600
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,360
making me angry,

601
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,070
how could I

602
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,110
have gone on a trip and left you alone?

603
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,960
That was because I'm sick,

604
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,880
I often forget things,

605
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,190
and get upset.

606
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,550
I'm also worried

607
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,150
that my condition is getting worse.

608
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,480
In the end,

609
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,280
I might forget even the people around me.

610
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,550
Don't be afraid.

611
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,920
We will all grow old.

612
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,480
We will all forget.

613
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,230
But some things won't change.

614
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,670
We are lifelong partners.

615
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,800
We've been together for so long.

616
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,150
Are you happy?

617
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,440
I really want you to be happy.

618
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,670
When I traveled alone,

619
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,480
I thought I would be happy.

620
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,670
But actually, a lot of the time I wasn't.

621
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,880
Because

622
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,030
I kept thinking about this family,

623
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,920
and I kept thinking about you.

624
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,070
When Woodie died,

625
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,710
Ma sent me a message.

626
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,960
I really wanted to rush back immediately.

627
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,400

628
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,000
you all

629
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,590
are my greatest happiness.

630
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,480
Grandpa,

631
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,070
don't work so hard anymore.

632
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,030

we'll help you remember.

You said you have a bad memory?

635
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,550
Look, I even forgot about this sofa.

636
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,030
But you remember the fabric of the sofa

637
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,920
and the color of these cushions.

638
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,320
You remember it all!

639
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,880
I'm not that amazing.

640
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,000
I brought our old photos everywhere,

641
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,400
looking for something similar.

642
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,360
I searched for a long time

643
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,110
before I found a sofa with this fabric.

644
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,550
Alright.

645
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,000
Now, I'm back!

646
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:18,920
Really?

647
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,710

649
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920

650
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,710
Yeah.

651
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,150
I thought you'd forgotten we used to dance together.

652
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,190
Sang Yan's college time

653
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,110
was a phase I never saw

654
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,150
and never participated in.

655
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,670
I clearly feel an emotion

656
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,400
that kept appearing in the past

657
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,110
but I never managed to capture it.

658
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,440
Yes,

659
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,230
I regret it.

660
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,840
I regret it very, very much.
