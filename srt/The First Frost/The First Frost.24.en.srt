00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,790
She told me she's only away for a day or two,

247
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,000
but why is the closet

248
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,200

I thought her room was too empty,

263
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,750
and I was anxious,

264
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,510

265
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,350

to forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye.

272
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,270

And before she left,

00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,550
did you have any heated arguments?

No.

So she

303
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,110
just left this letter and disappeared?

304
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,000
Can you try to contact her family?

305
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,830
I don't have their contact information, so...

306
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,590
We'll try to contact her family for you.

307
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,480
You can sit over there and wait.

308
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,790
Over there. You can sit over there.

309
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,550
Thank you.

310
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,960
We just contacted Wen Yifan's mother,

311
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,030
Ms. Zhao Yuandong.

312
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,750
She told us

313
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,640
that firstly,

314
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,640
she doesn't approve of your relationship.

315
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,480
Secondly,

316
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,440
Wen Yifan often disappears suddenly,

317
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,960
and they've had fights lately,

318
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,200
so she thinks this time,

319
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,000
Wen Yifan is throwing a tantrum.

320
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,830
Isn't her mom

321
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,880
anxious at all?

322
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,110
Based on her tone,

323
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,270
it seems like it is.

324
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,270
We also learned

325
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,750
that her father is deceased

326
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,440
and that she has no siblings.

327
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,110
To your knowledge,

328
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,440
does Wen Yifan

329
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,750
have any close relatives

330
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,030
or friends or anything like that?

331
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,440
She has a close friend,

332
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,960
but

333
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,000
she doesn't know

334
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,920
where Wen Yifan is either.

335
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,680
In fact, we often see

336
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
this kind of situation.

337
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,240

339
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,960
may not have any attachments.

340
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,070
How about this?

341
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,790
Give me your contact information.

342
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,510
We'll be in touch

343
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,070
if we hear anything.

344
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,510
Don't worry too much.

345
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,920
She's an adult,

346
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,880
so she has the right to stay or go.

347
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,590
Can't you do any more investigation for me?

348
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,070
Based on the information you've given us,

349
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,640
we don't know

350
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,030
if she's in danger,

351
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,240
so

352
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,440

I think, you,

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,310

359
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,310

571
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,270
Last time you said that her mom

572
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,920
lives in Building 7, right?

573
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,230
Thank you.

574

Sang Yan.

576
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,520
I'm Fu Zhuang.

577
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,110
It's really you.

578
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,480
Are you going to work?

579
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,110
Yes.

580
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,880
Yifan quitted.

581
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,630
You didn't know?

582
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,440
Is she quitting

583
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,110
because something good will happen to you?

584
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,550
Congratulate her for me.

When did that guy come here to work as a security guard?

587

That guy?

588
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,190
He's been here

589

for almost a month.

What's wrong?

591
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,000
Nothing.

592
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,480
Then I'll go to work.

593

And

597
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,320
congratulations.

Take it back.

599
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:05,800
Don't be sad.

600
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,960
I understand if she didn't tell me

601
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,880
during the entrance exam.

602
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,840
We were kids then,

603
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,840
so she didn't trust me.

604
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,440
But now, we've both grown up.

605
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,320
Am I terribly unqualified

606
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,480
to be her friend?

607
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,110
Actually,

everyone has something

609
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,590
they can't just say.

610
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,840
We don't have to beat ourselves up.

611
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,440
I just want to help her.

612
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,920
She's now alone again.

613
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,270
How lonely will she be?

[Dian: Qiao, is it convenient to talk?]

616

Hello?

617
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,550
Hello, Qiao.

618
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,040
Dian, where are you?

619
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,590
We've been looking all over for you.

620
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,150
I'm sorry

621
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,520
to have worried you.

622
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,750
What's going on?

623
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,550
Are you going to never come back?

624
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,800
When you left me,

625
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,110
it took me a long time to adjust.

626
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,110
Then I worked very hard

627
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,710
and kept myself busy

628
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,190
so I wouldn't feel so lonely.

629
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,110
You have to think

630
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,920
about Sang Yan, if not me.

631
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,550
You've just fallen in love.

632
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,710
Is he alright?

633
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,040
No.

634
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,150
Didn't you say

635
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,190
he was always so bright

636
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,550
and energetic?

637
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,520
But now,

638
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,230
he isn't bright at all.

639
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,800
Tell me where you are.

640
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,070
He's going crazy looking for you.

641
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:03,920
I'm sorry.

642
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,840
Dian, I'm begging you.

643
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,110
Come back.

Qiao.

645
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,110
I'm calling you

646
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,670
to tell you I'm safe.

647
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,630
Don't worry about me.

648
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,750
I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye.

649
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,840
I just want you all to be okay.

650
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,880
