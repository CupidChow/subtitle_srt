Quick, take a look.

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,760
That handsome figure from behind.

186
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,960
How could it be him?

187
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,630
Enough, stop staring.

188
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,240
Sorry!

189
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,080
How could you be so careless?

190
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,870
It's fine.

191
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,550
I'll go to the restroom to clean it up.

192
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,720
It could be washed off, right?

193
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm so sorry.

194
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,910
Sorry.

195
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,750
It's okay.

196
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,420
♪The dust of lies and your wounds♪

197
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,860

203
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,480
I saw you earlier.

204
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,440
Change into it.

205
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,390
I'm the boss here.

206
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,510
My surname is Sang.

207
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,200
He doesn't recognize me...

208
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm sorry, due to our mistake,

209
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,080
we caused you trouble and inconvenience.

210
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,670
If you ever need anything, feel free to tell me.

211
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,510
Also,

212
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
all of your consumption tonight

213
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,510
is on the house.

214
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,000
I hope it doesn't ruin your good mood.

215
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,870
Looks like he really doesn't recognize me.

216
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,360
No need, it's okay.

217
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,670
Then I'll take my leave.

218
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,000
Sang...

219
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,790
Well, I should pretend not to know him.

220
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,670
The Headliner...

221
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,790
Your coat.

222
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,390
Sang...

223
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,270
The Headliner?

224
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,720
Sorry,

225
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,440
we are a proper restaurant bar here.

226
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,960
That's quite a shame.

227
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,270
Aren't you happy wearing my clothes?

228
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,390
Seems like I'm more famous than Overtime.

229
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,600
Take it as a souvenir.

230
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,270
You're back.

231
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,440
I just met the boss in the restroom.

232
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,320
He said...

233
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,020
He really said that?

234
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,580
Why didn't he advise you

235
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,210
to frame it at your house?

236
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,000
That's exactly what he meant.

237
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,080
But don't mind what he said.

238
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,150
Handsome, we need to order.

239
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,270
After all, he's the star attraction here.

240
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,480
Let me take a good look at him.

241
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,220
- Really? - Of course.

242
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,120
Handsome, we need to order here.

243
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,510
What do you need?

244
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,670
Alright.

245
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,080
Why is there someone next to him?

246
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,440
He's got such good luck with ladies.

247
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,360
Hello, here's your drink.

248
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,790
And here's your refund.

249
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,910
What's this about?

250
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Sorry, it was my mistake earlier.

251
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,030
The boss said

252
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,200
that this table's on the house.

253
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,550
It's not that serious.

254
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Take the money back.

255
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,240
It's okay.

256
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,790
It's common for men to buy drinks for pretty ladies.

257
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,870
Thank you.

258
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,320
Where's the boss?

259
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,480
Give me a drink.

260
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,270
She didn't accept it?

261
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,910
Sir,

262
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,150
this might not be the money for the drink.

263
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,840
I just heard those two customers saying...

264
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,080
You've forgotten why you came here?

265
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,960
How could a simple "look"

266
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,150
do justice to his elegance?

267
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,360
This could be something for you...

268
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,150
What thing?

269
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,630
A tip.

270
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,910
Sir, are you accepting it?

271
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,840
I'll go get busy now.

272
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,200
Sir,

273
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,240
what's going on?

274
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,390
Our bar's not that desperate yet, are we?

275
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,150
You're really going the extra mile.

276
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,080
Yifan,

277
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,370
how's the house I found for you?

278
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,440
Are you settling in alright?

279
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,200
Although the environment isn't that great,

280
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,240
at least it's convenient for transportation.

281
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,910
This should make your commute a bit easier.

282
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,240
If I hadn't chosen to separate from him

283
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,150
back in high school,

284
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,870
what would I be like now?

285
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,600
Would I be happier than now?

286
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,670
And braver?

287
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,030
In this world,

288
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,200
is there really another me?

289
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,320
In a parallel universe,

290
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,790
she might walk a completely different path than mine.

291
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,670
If we met at this moment,

292
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,360
I wonder

293
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,480
how would the other me see me?

294
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,000
Yifan,

295
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,750
are you listening?

296
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,720
What did you say?

297
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,790
I said, are you settling in alright

298
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,960
in the house I found for you?

299
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,790
It's fine, I guess.

300
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,680
Then that's good.

301
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,960
I've arrived at the station.

302
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,960
Be safe and text me when you get back.

303
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,590
- Alright. - Bye.

304
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,400

can you stop acting like this all the time?

328
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,030
you threw your clothes in there too.

329
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,920
Isn't that disgusting?

330
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,270
What about the risk of infection?

331
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,440

Lady,

what would you like to drink?

344
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,680
When we came here for dinner last night,

345
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,510
We dropped a bracelet.

346
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,440
Did anyone find it?

347
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,080
Bracelet?

348
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,750
Last night,

349
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,460
which table were you sitting at?

350
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,070
That one.

351
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,400
The first table.

352
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,640
These past two days,

353
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,000
I've been checking lost items.

354
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,200
I really haven't seen a bracelet.

355
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,270
Zhuo,

356
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,200
come over here.

357
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,240
This lady was sitting at that table last night.

358
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,640
Did you see a bracelet dropped there?

359
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,200
I accidentally bumped into you that day.

360
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,070
Sorry.

361
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,550
Mr. Yan cleaned the place last night.

362
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,570
When he took the clothes,

363
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,200
he probably took the bracelet, too.

364
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,960
It's okay.

365
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,270
I'll leave my contact information.

366
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,320
Okay.

367
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,640
[Overtime]

368
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,310
You can write it down here.

369
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,200
I'm the bartender here.

370
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,830
My name's He Mingbo.

371
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,550
If there are any further questions,

372
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,590
you can contact me anytime.

373
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,960

Well, go find it.

Sir,

I check lost items every day.

No way.

You're welcome.

Are you sure I didn't install a camera?

Call the police!

They hit me.

If you're still worried,

563
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,920
how did you change the minds

564
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,110
of the couple running an illegal business?

565
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,440
Well...

566
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,480
At that moment, maybe it was another version of me

567
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,920
who acted that bravely.

568
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,640
Most of the time,

569
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,960
I didn't know where she was hiding.

570
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,680
It was just a gut reaction.

571
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,750
They were eventually moved by you

572
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,510
and turned themselves in.

573
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,550
It was instinct?

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,680

just a natural reaction.

This is the vibe New Year's Eve should have.

00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,200
I heard a lot of people are confessing today.

You can't say it like that.

Just because I haven't met someone new

619
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,030
doesn't mean I won't meet an old love.

What's going on?

751
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,710
Yifan,

752
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,360
if you had come later,

753
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,550
you'd only see

754
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,800
my frozen dead body.

755
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,860
Well, thanks then.

756
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,960
I'm actually short on topics.

757
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,580
It's so cold.

758
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,280
Warm up your hands.

759
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,550
Thanks, Yifan.

760
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,400
Let's interview some street performers later.

761
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,190
Okay, sure.

762
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,590
Our reporters are currently at True Love Square,

763
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,150
where the New Year's Eve fireworks

764
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,070
will be held.

765
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,030
It's getting closer to midnight.

766
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,840
The place is already packed with people.

767
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,480
Everyone's looking forward to the new year's arrival.

768
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,190
Today, we're lucky to interview

769
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,440
the director of Youguang Drama.

770
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,590
Can you explain

771
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,070
the meaning of this creation?

772
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,070
What's your New Year's wish?

773
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,070
Not failing my exams!

774
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,550
I hope my deskmate becomes my girlfriend!

775
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,070
You just said it to the camera?

776
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,480
Aren't you afraid your parents will see?

777
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,440
Miss,

778
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,960
can I redo this one?

779
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,280
New Year's almost here.

780
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,800
Can you tell us your New Year's wish?

781
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,550
Can you play fewer games and spend more time with me?

782
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,800
What kind of New Year's wish is that?

783
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,230
Fu Zhuang, did you hear that?

784
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,760
The countdown's about to begin.

785
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,550
Get ready to capture some close-up shots of the fireworks.

786
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,760
Alright, thanks to both of you.

787
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
