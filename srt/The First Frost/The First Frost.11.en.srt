I just saw that you've been replying to messages,

You two can choose one each.

I'm fine with both,

248
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,920
but Yifan,

249
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,520
you're afraid of ghosts,

250
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,520
so I'll take the cemetery one.

251
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,200
I can do both.

252
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,950
Okay. Then it's settled.

253
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,800
Obviously, she wanted to pick a topic

00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,920
that would attract attention,

255
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,040

about the cemetery?

260
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,630
It seemed more topical.

261
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,160
Or do you have no desire

262
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,160
at all to choose a topic?

263
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,560

00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,800
I'm Yifan's exclusive intern,

380
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,350
Mu Chengyun.

381
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,590
Want to get in, handsome?

382
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,520
Stop it.

383
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm just kidding.

384
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,320
Let's have dinner sometime.

385
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,870
Okay.

386
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:13,830
Bye.

387
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,560
Bye, Yifan.

388
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,390
Bye.

389
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,720
I think

390
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,670
that guy is interested in you.

391
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,910
Stop kidding.

392
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,280
He's just more active at work.

393
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,630
A man and a woman

394
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,430
working overtime in the same room.

395
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,520
With a little catalyst,

396
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,430
he'd be instantly enamored with you.

397
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,630
You seem to know well.

398
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,760
Why don't you drink?

399
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,590
Me?

400
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,590
I don't drink alcohol.

401
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,000
Actually, I want

402
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,280
to ask you a favor today.

403
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,390
What?

404
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,760
Do you want me to help you

405
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,560
get rid of that cute handsome guy?

406
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,080
I can do that.

407
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,280
I was wondering

408
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,760
if you had time to come over

409
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,760
and stay with me tonight.

410
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,830
What's wrong with you?

411
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,630
Did Sang Yan bully you?

412
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,280
Did he hit you or abuse you?

413
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,870
Did he do anything else?

414
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,080
No.

415
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,670
Then what's wrong with you?

416
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,190
I seemed to be sleepwalking.

417
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,960
Sleepwalking?

418
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,190
You haven't mentioned it before.

419
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,040
Actually,

420
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
I used to

421
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,150
and haven't for a long time,

422
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,520
but lately, it seems to have started again.

423
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,000
Just maybe.

424
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,630
So

425
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,110
how do you know?

426
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,560
Sang Yan told me.

427
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,080
Did he see it?

428
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,520
Probably.

429
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,480
So you don't remember

430
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,670
what you did when you were sleepwalking?

431
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,760
Since it was sleepwalking,

432
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,000
I surely don't remember.

433
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,520
Did Sang Yan say what you did?

434
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,080
Your sanity

435
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,870
was overpowered

436
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,040
by desire late at night

437
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,350
and attempted to possess me.

438
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,080
Anyway, tonight,

439
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,040
sleep with me

440
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,020
and check for me

441
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,320
if I'm sleepwalking again,

442
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,870
okay?

443
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,480
Okay.

444
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,350
Don't worry.

445
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,760
I'll definitely take care of you.

446
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,040
So,

447
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,630
to sleep better,

448
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,960
let's get a little drunk.

449
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:19,720
Okay.

450
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,320
Let's go.

451
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,000
Let's take a cab home.

452
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,350
Peeled.

453
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,910
I guess I'm the only one

454
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,110
who still keeps the promise to be home by ten.

455
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,280
Is he afraid to come back

456
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,080
because you're sleepwalking?

457
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,390
It's enough that you're not afraid.

458
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,350
Why would I be?

459
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,830
If I suddenly open my eyes

460
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,480
and sit up at night,

461
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,280
just punch me.

462
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,110
How can I do that do you?

463
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,160
Don't worry.

464
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,240
I'm a light sleeper.

465
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,960
When I'm at home,

466
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,440
even my dad's snoring and my brother's teeth grinding

467
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,400
can wake me up.

468
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,270
Then I'm counting on you.

469
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,680
Sit here.

470
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,590
Are you sleepy?

471
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,440
I'm not.

472
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,000
He's not back yet.

473
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,550
You're back.

474
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,750
Why you?

475
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,680
I'm sorry.

476
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,720
Are you

477
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,640
still up?

478
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,790
I sent you a message.

479
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,880
Didn't you get it?

480
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,920
We've both been together,

481
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,400
so I didn't notice that.

482
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,790
So

483
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,160
go ahead.

484
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,720
I'll stop interrupting.

485
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,730
So

486
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,680
it's her who took liberties with you, right?

487
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,830
Cut the crap.

488
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,920
Watch yourself.

489
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,350
I have a feeling it's her.

490
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,510
Right?

491
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,960
No wonder you agreed to let me live in your house.

492
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,480
You want me to protect you.

493
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,780
[Wen Yifan: Qiao will stay here tonight]

494
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,920
So why didn't you tell me in advance

495
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,350
that he was coming last night?

496
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,240
I had nowhere else to go yesterday,

497
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,270
so I could only ask him for help.

498
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,000
I had to find a way

499
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,920
to protect myself.

500
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,720
Protect yourself?

501
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,350
What does that mean?

502
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,200
Are you overthinking this?

503
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,720
Are you overthinking it too?

504
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,550
I'm not.

505
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,480
So did you guys sleep well last night?

506
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,480
How could I sleep well

507
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,510
with this guy around?

508
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,400
You didn't sleep well last night?

509
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,880
Of course not.

510
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,750
Never mind.

511
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,720
As long as you guys have fun.

512
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,550
What about you? Did you sleep well?

513
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,920
I'm sure we did.

514
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,500
I hope I didn't disturb you.

515
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:28,730
It was

516
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,550
an interesting meal.

517
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,200
How interesting can a meal be?

518
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,590
You are interesting, too.

519
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,350
So are you.

520
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,000
So are you.

521
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,640
Are you done?

522
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,440
By the way,

523
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,200
I'm not coming back tonight,

524
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,160
so you can be

525
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,920
more comfortable.

526
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,720
Where are you going?

527
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,270
Yihe.

528
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,070
To do what?

529
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,550
On a business trip.

530
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,070
The willows here look like snowflakes.

531
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:09,790
Yifan.

532
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,920
You're so predictable.

533
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,590
I wouldn't even be able to breathe

534
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,920
if you hadn't given me that mask.

535
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,590
I lived here for a while.

536
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,440
Hello. How many of you are there?

537
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,000
We're here to see someone. Thank you.

538
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,510
This way.

539
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:38,720
How are you?

540
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,060
We're reporters from First News.

541
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:40,890
I'm Wen Yifan.

542
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,920
Sorry to keep you waiting.

543
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,920
Thank you for helping me.

544
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,000
My daughter is at your age.

545
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,560
You're welcome.

546
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:48,800
Have a seat.

547
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,280
We can start.

548
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,480
My daughter graduated from college

549
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,390
and then went to work in Yihe.

550
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,240
For five years she worked,

551
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,240
she gave me some money every month,

552
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,480
but just before New Year's,

553
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,520
we suddenly cut off contact.

554
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,000
Neither during the New Year nor during the holidays,

555
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,960
she didn't send me a single message

556
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,390
or give me the money she was supposed to give.

557
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,520
What is the money

558
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,800
she is supposed to give?

559
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,110
It's only natural for a daughter to take care of her mother.

560
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,480
I'm worried something

561
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,480
might have happened to her.

562
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,240
Sweetheart.

563
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,520
If you see me on TV,

564
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,910
call me back

565
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,670
and tell me you're okay, okay?

566
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,390
How are you getting along with your daughter?

567
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,320
Have you had any conflicts or anything like that?

568
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,240
What mother in this world

569
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,240
would treat her daughter badly?

570
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,670
I lost my husband

571
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,390
and my job

572
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,870
to raise her.

573
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,190
How can she treat me like this?

574
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:09,970
Hello?

575
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,560
Can we talk, Jiang?

576
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,240
Go ahead.

577
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,430
Is it cold in Yihe?

578
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,190
Remember to eat well

579
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,240
and put on some clothes.

580
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,670
You haven't called me for a while.

581
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,630
I've been too busy lately.

582
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,910
I know you're busy,

583
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,830
so I didn't dare to call and bother you.

584
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,910
How will you

585
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,150
settle Yifan down?

586
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,960
Can you let her

587
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,480
stay at your place?

588
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,040
Or let her go to her grandma's.

589
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,000
After all, that's her grandmother, don't you think?

590
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,870
Think about it.

591
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,430
Am I right?

592
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,000
Jiang.

593
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,080
I know you blame me.

594
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,960
After your dad died,

595
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
I didn't fulfill my duty as a mother.

596
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,520
You can say whatever you want,

597
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,670
but can you not mention my dad?

598
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,480
These days, I've been dreaming about your dad.

599
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,280
He still blames me.

600
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,720
It's okay. Don't cry.

601
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,800
I'm fine.

602
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
Don't worry.

603
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,390
I'll come to you when I have time.

604
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,080
See you.

605
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,590
Don't worry.

606
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,430
We'll do our best to find your daughter.

607
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,560
Please keep your word.

608
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,590
It's too suffocating.

609
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,910
Yihe's spring is just like that.

610
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,760
I'm talking about the mother.

611
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,150
That kind of motherhood is suffocating.

612
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Why didn't you ask further just now?

613
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,800
I think there's a reason

614
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,150
her daughter doesn't want to see her.

615
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,110
She doesn't think she has any problems.

616
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,150
Right.

617
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,000
She's just pushing her daughter with affection.

618
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,970
Maybe that's why

619
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,480
her daughter disappeared.

620
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,960
How do you know?

621
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,150
The flight is tomorrow.

622
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,630
We're free for the rest of the day.

623
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,720
Aren't you coming with me?

624
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,800
No.

625
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,240
Haven't you lived here before?

626
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,320
Show me around.

627
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,430
Hey, Tian.

628
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,520
We found her.

629
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,670
Her daughter is in Hong Kong, China.

630
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,720
She's currently working as an admin at a dance studio.

631
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,190
Okay. I got it.

632
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:25,910
What's going on?

633
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,910
Did you bring your EEP?

634
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:29,960
And the endorsement?

635
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:30,870
Yes.

636
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,320
We have to bring all the documents when we travel.

637
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,480
They taught me all that in training.

638
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,480
Where are we going?

639
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,110
Hong Kong, China.

640
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,830
So

641
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,150
I'll be a day late.

642
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,150
Okay.

643
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,800
- Then. - Yifan, your card.

644
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,000
Okay. Thank you.

645
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,150
Who's that?

646
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,800
A coworker I came with.

647
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,000
Sounds like a kid.

648
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,960
That's the guy you saw in front

649
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,830
of the supermarket last time.

650
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,630
He's now doing an internship in our group.

651
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,590
Don't you have an umbrella?

652
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,760
Do you want me to take you home?

653
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,670
We have umbrellas.

654
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,560
You can leave now.

655
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,110
Are you jealous of me?

656
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,320
Jealous of you?

657
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,320
I don't need to be.

658
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:17,870
Take it.

659
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,190
No.

660
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:36,100
[Hong Kong, China]

661
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,580
[MSL Mall]

662
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:45,910
Let's go.

663
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
I'm starving.

664
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,830
- Maybe here. - Let's go buy something to eat.

665
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,590
I'm not hungry.

666
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,910
OK. I'll order takeout.

667
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,280
Hello.

668
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
Are you here to enroll?

669
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,630
Please fill out the form for the adult class.

can get 20% off.

672
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,360
Hello, sir.

673
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,590
We are reporters from First News

674
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,560
of Nanwu TV Station.

675
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,360
I'm Wen Yifan.

676
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,080
Mu Chengyun.

677
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,560
I'd like to ask.

678
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,670
Is there

679
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,750
a Ms. Lin Yuqing here?

680
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,080
I'm sorry.

681
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,710
We don't have anyone named Lin here.

682
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,590
Then I'd like to ask

683
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,710
if there are any other dance studios in this building.

684
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,310
I'm not sure.

685
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,190
You can ask somewhere else.

686
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,310
Is there anything else?

687
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,790
If not, I'll get back to work.

688
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:38,750
Thank you.

689
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,400
What now?

690
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,840
Find another way

691
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,710
or

692
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,310
see if there's anyone who knows her?

693
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:06,840
Wait a little longer.

694
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,560
I've got an idea.

695
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,360
I want to see Ms. Lin Yuqing.

696
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,000
I am.

697
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,880
Here's your takeout.

698
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,630
Who ordered it?

699
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,110
I don't know.

700
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,840
Thank you.

701
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,440
You're welcome.

702
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,000
I just heard you hadn't had lunch yet,

703
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,750
so I took the liberty of ordering one for you.

704
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,230
I'm sorry.

705
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,560
I don't do interviews.

706
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,190
We just want to talk to you.

707
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,670
Don't worry.

708
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,360
Your mother doesn't know we're coming.

709
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,000
You can turn on your cell phone's camera.

710
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,840
I'm happy now

711
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,520
and have a family of my own.

712
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,080
I'm asking you

713
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,520
to stop trying to find me, okay?

714
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:25,790
Okay.

715
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,190
Show her this video.

716
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,000
Is there anything else

717
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,480
you want to say?

718
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,080
What should I say?

719
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,110
Should I tell onlookers

720
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,080
that she married a man

721
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,310
and had a child

722
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,230
or that she realized

723
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,840
she had a daughter

724
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,110
after he disappeared with her son

725
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,590
and abandoned her

726
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,790
or should I tearfully

727
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,520
accuse her of using her affection to blackmail me

728
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,920
and treating me as her property

729
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,400
in order to receive monthly maintenance from me?

730
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,440
I can understand you.

731
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,000
How can you understand me?

732
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,080
You're not me.

733
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,560
My mother was a lot like her,

734
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,670
but she didn't look for me

735
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,150
or care for me

736
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,670
when I left Nanwu.

737
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,670
So if it were you,

738
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,590
would you forgive her?

739
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,230
No,

740
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,590
at least not now.

741
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,230
I don't want you to go back with nothing,

742
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:36,880
so

743
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,040
show her that video.

744
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,560
Go back.

745
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:57,880
What's wrong?

746
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,400
I'm fine.

747
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,790
I just can't handle them.

748
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,190
How can't you? They're cute.

749
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,480
I'll go see them.

750
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,310
Come on.

751
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,330
The kids.

752
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,860
He says he can't handle you.

753
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,040
What's going on?

754
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,670
Sit down.

755
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,710
Sit down.

756
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,190
What's going on?

757
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,080
Isabella.

758
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,590
What's wrong with you?

759
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,370
I'm so stupid.

760
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,840
I can't even do it.

761
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,670
I was spinning until I was dizzy.

762
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,590
What's going on?

763
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,790
It's just

764
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:31,880
hard.

765
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,040
Listen.

766
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,270

767
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,310
which move that was.

768

Are you tired?

769
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,710
Then let's take a break.

770
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,080
You'll be fine with more practice later.

771
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,710
Your name is Isabella, right?

772
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,840
You just did a great job,

773
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,520
but there's a little problem

774
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,480
you should pay attention to.

775
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,630
When you do the movements...

776
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,480
Come on. Stand up.

777
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,480
When you do the movement,

778
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,440
center your weight in this area.

779
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,710
We must not look at the ground

780
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,790
but ahead.

781
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,710
Forward.

782
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,750
OK?

783
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,840
I'll show you how it's done.

784
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,880
You don't seem so happy

785
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,710
for a long time.

786
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:40,880
Come on.

787
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,000
Try it.

788
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,920
Sir, can you do me a favor?

789
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,110
Let's just stare

790
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,360
at this teacher.

791
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,310
Look straight at him.

792
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,520
Keep looking at him, okay?

793
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,080
Straighten up.

794
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,150
Come on, try it.

795
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,920
That's good.

796
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,880

797
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,520
Miss, you're great.

798
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,710
So are you.

799
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,750
When you dance,

800
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,440
you have to relax. Having fun is the most important thing,

801
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,440
right?

802
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
You're not dizzy anymore, right?

803
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,360
Excuse me.

804
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,190
Are you a dance teacher?

805
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,230
No, I'm not.

806
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,710
We should probably get going.

807
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,110
Thank you very much.

808
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,920
Come on.

809
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,480
Say goodbye to them.

810
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,590
Bye.

811
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,440
Bye.

812
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,560
- Bye. - Bye.

813
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,750
Thanks.

814
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,440
Come on, let's go.

818
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,920
Didn't I tell you not to pick me up?

819
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,360
I'm not a kid.

820
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,190
Brat.

821
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,710
Grandpa's birthday is today,

822
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,710
so how could I not pick you up myself?

823
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,710
Oh...

00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:03,880
Yifan.

825
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,590
Let me introduce you.

826
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,270
This is my sister.

827
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,230
How are you?

828
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,110
Hi.

829
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,590
I've heard a lot about you from my brother.

830
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,710
He's always giving you trouble, isn't he?

831
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:14,960
By the way,

832
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,110
is someone coming to pick you up?

833
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,040
I don't usually have that.

834
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,040
Come on, then.

835
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,190
We'll take you home.

836
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,360
Yes. Come with us.

837
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,560

Wen Yifan.

839
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,440
Why are you here?

840
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,400
I'm seeing a friend off,

841
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,000
so I thought I'd pick you up on the way.

842
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,960
Such a coincidence.

843
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,960
Consider it a basic courtesy

844
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,960
from me as a roommate.

845
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:37,880
Yifan.

846
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,400
Is this your roommate you mentioned?

847
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,520
Yes.

848
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,630
Are you leaving now?

849
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,790
I'm leaving.

850
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,670
- Bye, Yifan. - OK.

851
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,230
Okay. Thank you.

852
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,230
Let's go.

853
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,960
She's gone. Don't look at her.

854
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,270
This guy looks familiar to me.

855
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,560
I think I've seen him somewhere.

856
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,790
Were you sleepwalking

857
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,710
in Hong Kong, China?

858
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,920
No.

00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,920
I think you may be happy.

861
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,110
You went to Yihe and then to Hong Kong, China.

862
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,630
Not bad.

863
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,000
What?

864
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,750
You don't look happy.

865
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,110
I wonder if,

866
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,960
as a journalist,

867
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,400
I should be more calm

868
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,040
and objective when it comes

869
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,110
to my work.

870
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,670
You're a human being,

871
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,400
not an interviewing machine.

872
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,730
However, I'm easily affected

873
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:58,230
by the interviewee's mood

874
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,440
when working.

875
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,960
Just be yourself.

876
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,960
Didn't you catch up

877
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,000
with your college friends

878
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:17,300
or hang out in Yihe?

879
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,000
I thought hard about it.

880
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,630
In my four years of college

881
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,590
and two years of internships,

882
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,790
there really wasn't anything in Yihe that I missed.

883
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,750
It was a place

884
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,270
with no memories for me.

885
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,150
Even on many occasions,

886
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,110
I wished I had never been there.

887
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,360
Because of the rumors about you and the director,

888
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,960
his wife came to cause trouble,

889
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,710
but you never did that,

890
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:39,590
so why do you care about her?

891
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
Are you really afraid of those people

892
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,360
talking about you behind your back?

893
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,480
I didn't do that,

894
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,670
so I'm not afraid of misunderstanding.

895
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:49,520
Then why do you leave your job?

896
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,710
Because there's nothing

897
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,190
left for me here.

898
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,150
Then will you take a break

899
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,590

By the way,

952
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,080
