I should have gone for my check-up two days ago,

188
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
but I forgot.

189
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,870
Sir,

190
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,750
I'm taking you to the hospital now

191
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,750
to see the doctor and get your medicine.

192
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,480
I'll go downstairs to get the car.

193
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,030
Okay.

194
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,120
Sir,

195
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,320
just stay here and wait for me.

196
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,910
I'll be back once I park the car.

197
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,980
Don't wander off.

198
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,390
What do you mean?

199
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,360
Where else could I go?

200
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,960
Go park the car now.

201
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,240
Go.

202
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,550
Madam,

203
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
be careful to avoid eating those things

204
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,390
the doctor mentioned.

205
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:28,910
I will.

206
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,000
Get plenty of rest.

207
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,550
If you feel unwell again,

208
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,120
feel free to contact me, and I'll accompany you to the doctor.

209
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,320
Sure.

210
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,550
Madam, please wait here for a moment.

211
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,030
Let me check it for you.

212
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,790
Thank you.

213
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,540
[Reception]

214
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,870
Lin.

215
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,240
Mr. Ma.

216
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,120
Have you seen Mr. Su?

217
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,870
Mr. Su, the grandpa?

218
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,600
Yes.

219
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,360
I haven't seen him.

220
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,440
Oh no,

221
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,840
this is not looking good.

222
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,480
What's wrong?

223
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,670
I went to park the car

224
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,000
and told him to wait at the door.

225
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,960
When I got there, no one was around.

226
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
I even checked upstairs.

227
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,080
Mr. Ma, don't panic.

228
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,360
Hi,

229
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,080
can we make an announcement to look for someone here?

230
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,390
Shall I help you with the announcement?

231
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,790
I'll check it for you.

232
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,240
You can go ask the guard ahead first.

233
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,960
He seemed a bit strange.

234
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
And he looked quite anxious.

235
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,960
He was probably trying to find someone.

236
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,960
What happened next?

237
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,440
After that...

238
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,440
He just hailed a taxi and left.

239
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,630
He hailed a taxi and left?

240
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,240
Yes.

241
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,910
Where did he go?

242
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,870
How should I know?

243
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,390
Do you think

244
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,080
Grandpa ran away with her?

245
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,630
No,

246
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,550
I didn't say that.

247
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,030
I just said it was possible.

248
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,390
But how could it be such a coincidence?

249
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,870
Fang called in sick this morning, saying she felt dizzy,

250
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,030
and then Grandpa disappeared.

251
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,270
Honestly, though,

252
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,080
I can't picture what it would be like

253
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,320
to catch someone having an affair.

254
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,270
Could you stop overthinking it?

255
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,480
She answered.

256
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,720
Fang,

257
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,360
how are you feeling now?

258
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,080
I got some fruit

259
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
and thought I'd come to visit.

260
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,960
Someone's already here to check on me,

261
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,030
so don't worry.

262
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,790
That's even more reason for me to visit you.

263
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,150
It won't be necessary.

264
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,320
Thank you.

265
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,360
Bye.

266
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,000
Did she hang up?

267
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Can we trust the address?

268
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,510
Of course.

269
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,390
I have many friends on Help Me,

270
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,000
so getting an address is easy.

271
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,390
I didn't know

272
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,120
you were so resourceful.

273
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,080
This is it.

274
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,270
Is it here?

275
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,550
All right.

276
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,790
I got this.

277
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,510
The door is not closed.

278
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,150
It's not closed.

279
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,780
Let's go.

280
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,840
Wait.

281
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,630
What if Grandpa is in there?

282
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,840
Aren't we here to find him?

283
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,000
Wait.

284
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,750
Have you ever done this before?

285
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,360
Yes.

286
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,550
What should I do then?

287
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,270
Play it by ear.

288
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,510
Okay.

289
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,440
Wait.

290
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,150
What now?

291
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,870
I need a deep breath.

292
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,150
Are you ready?

293
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,320
Yes.

294
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,750
I just don't want to see anyone...

295
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,150
- when I'm like this. - What's the matter?

296
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,480
- What are you doing? - Quick.

297
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,480
I'm scared.

298
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,000
You are already here.

299
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,030
Mr. Su,

300
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,790
I don't want to.

301
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,870
Listen to me.

302
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,750
Be good.

303
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,910
An?

304
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,440
Grandpa,

305
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,720
you're really here.

306
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,080
Fang is sick,

307
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,200
so I'm here to check on her.

308
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
What happened just now then?

309
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,080
Just now?

310
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,000
She's being stubborn

311
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
and won't take her medicine.

312
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,390
You were supposed to pick up the medicine at the hospital first.

313
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,670
I saw in the group chat later

314
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,870
that Fang was sick,

315
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,870
so I came to see her. Is that not allowed?

316
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,000
That was on purpose then.

317
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,150
What do you mean?

318
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,840
When did I need you to tell me what to do?

319
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,440
I'll do whatever I want.

320
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,000
Fang,

321
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,200
I'm leaving the medicine here.

322
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,750
Be good and take it.

323
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,270
Remember to take it.

324
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,390
Thank you,

325
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,200
and sorry for the trouble.

326
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,240
I... Wait...

327
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,200
Fang, I hope you get well soon.

328
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,600
I'll leave the fruit here.

329
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,030
Can you

330
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,960
take me for a ride on your bike?

331
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,320
Now I understand

332
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,870
why Grandma wanted

333
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,200
to find her own path in life.

334
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,510
When there's no more love between two people,

335
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,910
there's no point in staying together.

336
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,720
Qiao,

337
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,720
I'm all alone again.

338
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,670
How come

339
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,440
you've never talked

340
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,600
about your parents?

341
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,720
They're both gone now.

342
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,840
I have an older brother who's much better than me.

343
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,270
Since I was little,

344
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,720
I've always been the most disappointing one in the family.

345
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,840
I'm nothing like my brother.

346
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,360
When compared to him,

347
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,270
I just feel like a burden to everyone.

348
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,270
In 2008, during the Olympics,

349
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,390
I told my dad

350
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,000
I wanted to go to the Bird's Nest to watch the opening ceremony.

351
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,150
He said he'd take me there

352
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,440
as long as I made it into the top 15

353
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,200
of my class.

354
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,510
But in the end, I ranked 28th.

355
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,790
How many people were there in your class?

356
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,080
Thirty.

357
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,150
That's all right.

358
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,440
At least you weren't ranked last.

359
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,870
You'll never understand

360
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
what it's like to always be at the bottom

361
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,150
and feeling like

362
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,480
I was dragging everyone down no matter what I did.

363
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,030
I often wonder

364
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,960
if I had done better,

365
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,150
would my whole family

366
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,550
have gone to Beijing together happily?

367
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,670
When my dad saw my grades,

368
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,910
he got really upset.

369
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,000
He was supposed to take my mom, and my brother

370
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,120
to watch the Olympics,

371
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,790
but out of anger,

372
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,790
he changed the plans

373
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,720
and headed west instead of north.

374
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,630
Later, due to a rainstorm and slippery roads,

375
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,400
they got into a car accident and passed away.

376
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,240
The three most accomplished people in my family

377
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,240
disappeared from my life all at once.

378
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Do you love them?

379
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,790
Of course, I do.

380
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,880
How could I not love them?

381
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,680
Good then.

382
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,480
They must love you too,

383
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,030
but the lack of communication between you

384
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,750
has made it harder to express that love.

385
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,070
My name is Zhong Siqiao.

386
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,790
Perhaps because of the "Qiao" in my name,

387
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,510
I often find myself beneath bridges,

388
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,110
gazing at one after another,

389
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,750
wondering how many people

390
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,880
they've helped to connect.

391
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,000
And suddenly, I feel a sense of hope.

392
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,310
With a bridge,

393
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,640
you can reach another city

394
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,590
or the beginning of a new dream.

395
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,240
Isn't that how relationships work too?

396
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,640
You have a bridge hidden in your heart.

397
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,400
Once you cross it,

398
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,720
you'll realize that many people love you.

399
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,070
Really?

400
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,070
Absolutely.

401
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,590
Real love isn't earned by buying others handbags

402
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,750
or getting first place in class.

403
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,310
It's something you receive

404
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,680
by offering your genuine love.

405
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,440
It smells amazing.

406
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,680
Yum.

407
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,270
Someone rarely asks me to eat out,

408
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,480
and yet she seems so lost in thought.

409
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,750
I sleepwalked again.

410
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,270
Did the sleeping bag I gave you not work?

411
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,510
I accidentally forgot to use it last night.

412
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,000
So, what did you do this time?

413
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,030
Qiao,

414
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,350
can I ask you something?

415
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,160
Ask away.

416
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,830
Didn't you end up

417
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,350
in the same bed with Su Haoan

418
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,960
by accident?

419
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,240
Did he

420
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,960
apologize to you afterward

421
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,880
or

422
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,640
offer

423
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,160
any compensation?

424
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,310
Technically,

425
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,750
I was the one who got into his bed,

426
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,830
so it's me who owes him.

427
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,070
So, how do you intend to make it up to him?

428
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,030
It's not like a debt that needs to be repaid.

429
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,550
How am I supposed to make it right with him?

430
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,960
So that's how you make things even?

431
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,920
I still got the short end of the stick then.

432
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,830
It's pretty clear

433
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,960
who's into who here.

434
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,180
But he seems to feel like he's been taken advantage of.

435
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,110
What?

436
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:37,790
Who?

437
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,550
No one,

438
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,590
just a friend of mine.

439
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,480
So,

440
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,310
did Su Haonan ask you

441
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,640
for an apology or any kind of compensation afterward?

442
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,920
I'm a girl.

443
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,270
If he's making a big deal out of this,

444
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,790
that's kind of petty.

445
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,170
But during the Spring Festival,

446
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,120
I pretended to be his girlfriend

447
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,200
and had dinner with his grandparents.

448
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
I guess that makes up for it, right?

449
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,790
You even pretended to be his girlfriend?

450
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,590
It was only for show.

451
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,920
I was merely doing him a favor.

452
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,350
I won't get involved in his matters again.

453
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,440
How long do I have to keep making up for this?

454
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,960
[Su Haoan's grandpa]
See, here we go again.

455
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,690
Hello.

456
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,720
Oh, it's you, Mr. Ma.

457
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,350
What's the matter?

458
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,400
Mr. Su kept talking

459
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,920
about a car accident

460
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,160
and someone being in urgent care,

461
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,240
but he couldn't give

462
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,400
a clear location.

463
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,030
I tried calling Haoan,

464
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,440
but there was no answer.

465
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,680
Okay, I'm on my way there now.

466
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,070
What's wrong?

467
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,920
It seems like something's happened.

468
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,920
I'll let you know once I figure it out.

469
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,200
Ride safe.

470
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,790
Okay.

471
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,200
I'm off.

472
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,000
Stay safe.

473
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,790
Mr. Su,

474
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,880
do you know where Haoan had the accident?

475
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,590
Let's go pick up Grandma first.

476
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,400
Grandma?

477
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,070
Grandma,

478
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,450
where are you going?

479
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,550
You're not planning to drive off and travel again, are you?

480
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
If I don't go traveling,

481
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,750
am I supposed to just stay here looking after this old man?

482
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
I thought you had already left.

483
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,240
I was going to leave as soon as we finished

484
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
talking.

485
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,110
Grandma isn't in Nanwu.

486
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,440
Grandpa,

487
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,960
do you know which hospital Haoan is at?

488
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,820
Hey,

489
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,160
Grandpa said you were in a car accident.

490
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,400
Are you injured?

491
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,310
What?

492
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,110
I'm at work.

493
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,030
I've just finished a meeting.

494
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Grandpa,

495
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,830
Haoan says he's at work and has just finished a meeting.

496
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,160
It's not An,

497
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,640
but his parents.

498
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,920
They got into a car accident

499
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,110
and are now at the hospital.

500
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,960
Grandpa,

501
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,590
how about you talk to Haoan?

502
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,480
Hello,

503
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,680
Grandma.

504
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,510
Who is this?

505
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,640
Well...

506
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,880
Who's this?

507
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,960
Hurry up.

508
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,640
What is Grandpa babbling about?

509
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,720
Wait.

510
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,030
Grandpa's confused, and you're just following suit.

511
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,640
What's going on?

512
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,400
Maybe I should talk to you later.

513
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,350
All right.

514
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,070
Sorry

515
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,640
for making you worry.

516
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,720
When I was out with Wood,

517
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,720
I saw a car flip over.

518
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,790
Good dog, Wood.

519
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,310
There were many people

520
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,680
trapped under the car.

521
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,270
I suddenly remembered

522
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,030
the car crash

523
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,240
involving An's parents,

524
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,200
but

525
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,830
I was so confused

526
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,350
that I thought it was actually happening.

527
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,960
It hurts so much.

528
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,310
I need to help them.

529
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,720
It's all my fault.

530
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,480
The one who suffers the most

531
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,830
is An.

532
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,720
He's lost his parents

533
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,830
at such a young age.

534
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,000
An,

535
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,110
don't be afraid.

536
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,920
Grandpa and Grandma will take care of you.

537
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,070
Be good.

538
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,830
Grandpa.

539
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,440
Grandpa, what are you doing?

540
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,550
I'm all grown up now.

541
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,790
No need to worry about me.

542
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,350
I'm fine.

543
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,680
Who's worried about you?

544
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,480
I'm worried about this one here.

545
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,550
Why is it so sleepy in the middle of the day?

546
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,440
It's getting old.

547
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,720
Lately, it's always been sleeping when I see it.

548
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,720
How old is it?

549
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,440
I'm not sure,

550
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,270
but it's pretty old.

551
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Grandpa's the same.

552
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,790
When people grow old,

553
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,790
it's inevitable they'll have moments where they just don't make sense.

554
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,400
They will often behave like a child.

555
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,680
My dad isn't that old yet,

556
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,750
but he's also very stubborn now,

557
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,920
and it's hard to reason with him.

558
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,350
Wood,

559
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,270
she's badmouthing you.

560
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,110
Bite her.

561
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,880
Are you implying something about Grandpa?

562
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,440
2008

563
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
was also the year my parents

564
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,680
passed away in a car accident.

565
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,830
On the day my parents and my brother were being laid to rest,

566
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,680
Grandpa wouldn't let me go to the burial site.

567
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,960
That was the hardest moment of my life.

568
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,750
When I came back from the funeral,

569
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,720
I found it curled up alone by the door,

570
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,790
motionless like a block of wood.

571
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,550
Wherever I went, it followed,

572
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,640
and I couldn't chase it away.

573
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,640
At that moment,

574
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,160
I actually feel quite sympathetic toward it.

575
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,750
Just like me, it lost its parents

576
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,270
and its support.

577
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,350
So, I decided to adopt it.

578
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,350
Why didn't you let it stay with you then?

579
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,720
Every time I see it,

580
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,070
I'm reminded of how I felt back then.

581
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,720
Why are you back so late?

582
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,960
I have a lot of orders today.

583
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,110
We can grab

584
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,200
some supper together later.

585
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,030
I'm not hungry.

586
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,880
But I am.

587
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,920
The one who suffers the most

588
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,880
is An.

589
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,240
Don't be afraid.

590
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,070
Grandpa and Grandma will take care of you.

591
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,270
Qiao.

592
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,920
Sweetheart,

593
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,110
you're all grown up.

594
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,070
Why are you still acting like this?

595
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,480
Is there a certain age when you're not allowed to act like that?

596
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,750
No.

597
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,510
It's just you haven't hugged me in ages.

598
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,550
What, I can't hug you?

599
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,510
Of course, you can.

600
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,590
Hold on.

601
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,110
Were you

602
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,310
bullied out there?

603
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,240
Did someone bully you?

604
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,070
Tell me.

605
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,310
No.

606
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,240
Really?

607
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,590
I just wanted to hug you.

608
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,070
Why are you making such a fuss?

609
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,350
Now, I feel relieved.

610
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,790
You go home first,

611
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,310
and have your mom cook me a bowl of noodles.

612
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,830
I'll head back in a bit.

613
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,110
Okay.

614
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,880
Come back soon.

615
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,310
I'll leave now.

616
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,750
Stay safe.

617
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,920
You are back.

618
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
My dad says he's hungry and wants some noodles.

619
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,240
I was just about to go to bed.

620
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,720
You cook the noodles for your dad.

621
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,790
What happened?

622
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,590
You look so pale.

623
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,720
Are you sick?

624
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,960
It's nothing. I think I just caught a cold.

625
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,350
You think this is nothing?

626
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,790
Rest for a few days.

627
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,750
You're a girl,

628
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,000
yet you spend all day

629
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,590
buried in work,

630
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,160
never taking care of yourself.

631
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,000
How will you ever find a partner?

632
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,440
Mom, stop nagging me.

633
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,720
All right.

634
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,510
I'll make some noodles for your dad later.

635
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,680
Take this medicine

636
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,720
and get some sleep.

637
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:45,880
Okay.

638
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,160
Don't stay up late.

639
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,720
Qiao, you mustn't get sick.

640
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,440
I'm stuck on some homework,

641
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,440
and Mom won't let me sleep.

642
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,030
You've got to help me.

643
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,240
Guoqiang,

644
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,750
leave your sister alone.

645
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,480
Can't you see she's not feeling well?

646
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,440
Do your homework by yourself.

647
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,480
Mom, it's fine.

648
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,350
Which questions are you stuck on?

649
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,270
Let me take a look.

650
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,680
If you come any later, it'll be all gone.

651
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,480
Hurry up.

652
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,060
[Sang Yan]

653
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,400
When will you be back?

654
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,310
Wen Yifan.

655
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,790
Why are you here?

656
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,310
Explain yourself.

657
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,110
Honestly,

658
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,350
I'm a little scared.

659
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,440
I have no idea how far you'd go.

660
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,880
What if one day I wake up

661
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,350
and realize

662
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,550
you've ruthlessly stolen my innocence?

663
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,270
[When will you be back?]

664
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,790
I've got something to handle today,

665
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,310
so I won't be home early.

666
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,790
We'll talk

667
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,750
another time.

668
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,240
Mu Chengyun.

669
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,960
What is it, Yifan?

670
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Didn't you want me

671
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,590
to help you pick a gift?

672
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,750
Do you still need my help?

673
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,640
What?

674
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,510
We got off work early today.

675
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,680
Sure.

676
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,310
Thanks, Yifan.

677
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,440
Wen Yifan,

678
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,240
one must take responsibility for their actions.

679
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,400
Okay. Got it.

680
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,350
I'll try to be back as early as possible.

681
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,720
Does he really have to interfere this much?

682
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,350
You two are nothing more than roommates, right?

683
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,880
We have an agreement for co-renting.

684
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,510
Speaking of which,

685
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,270
the senior we're buying a gift for

686
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,200
was actually in the same class as Sang Yan.

687
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,030
He got married right after graduation,

688
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,720
and now he even has a child.

689
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,680
Yifan,

690
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,070
how did you and Sang Yan meet?

691
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,960
I remember you graduated

692
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,350
from Yihe University, right?

693
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,030
We were high school classmates.

694
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,680
High school classmates?

695
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,550
Not first love or anything?

696
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,720
No.

697
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,350
I heard that Sang Yan

698
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,830
had a girl he really liked in high school,

699
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,790
but he never managed to win her heart.

700
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,920
Even after graduating from university, he still couldn't forget her.

701
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,200
I'm not sure.

702
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,640
I'm really curious.

703
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,070
What kind of person

704
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,590
could make someone as outstanding as Sang Yan

705
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,920
like her for so long?

706
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,550
At the graduation gathering,

707
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,310
someone even asked

708
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,880
if he was heartbroken because the unattainable

709
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,680
always seems the best.

710
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,440
You remember what he said

711
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,240
at the gathering?

712
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,000
Yeah,

713
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,480
I remember now.

714
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,920
He said,

715
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,110
"Do you really think I'm that sentimental?"

716
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,350
Why would he say that?

717
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,400
Why wouldn't he?

718
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,590
He's too proud

719
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,510
to reveal his vulnerabilities

720
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,000
in front of others.

721
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,000
You seem to know him pretty well.

722
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,680
Maybe he was just joking

723
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,070
after drinking too much.

724
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,480
Couldn't it be that he drank too much

725
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,240
and used a joke

726
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,720
to say what he really felt?

727
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,750
Yifan, thanks for today.

728
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,440
How about strolling around a bit more?

729
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,310
Or is there something you'd like to eat?

730
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,070
My treat.

731
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,310
No, thanks.

732
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,960
I recall

733
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,000
that Sang Yan also said something else.

734
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,710
He mentioned

735
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,800
that if he ever met that person again,

736
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,000
he'd still be good to her,

737
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,440
but his attitude would be different.

738
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,510
So, whoever he's being nice to now

739
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,840
should watch out.

740
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,480
Maybe he has an ulterior motive,

741
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,630
like with you.

742
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,320
Me?

743
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,190
Yes.

744
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,070
Haven't you watched revenge dramas?

745
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
It's always the same plot.

746
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,070
They'll act like they care, treat you nicely,

747
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,840
and when you're deeply invested

748
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,060
and can't withdraw,

749
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,440
they ruthlessly abandon you

750
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,110
to complete their revenge.

751
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
Didn't you say he only said

752
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,440
one sentence that night?

753
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,480
Did I say that?

754
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,560
I don't really remember.

755
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,510
Maybe I was drunk and got it wrong.

756
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,630
In our line of work,

757
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,400
it's fine to joke around and gossip outside work.

758
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,800
But when it comes to journalism,

759
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,110
we can't have this kind of attitude.

760
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,670
Thanks for telling me this,

761
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,320
but when it comes to relationships,

762
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,920
I might not be less experienced than you.

763
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,590
I may not know much about relationships.

764
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,920
But I believe

765
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,630
what matters is sincerity,

766
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,880
not experience.

767
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,590
Just like a first love,

768
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,630
pure and sweet,

769
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,550
with a heart that only wants to bring joy to the other person,

770
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,920
without expecting anything in return.

771
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,070
Anyway, you got what you needed, so I'll head home now.

772
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,000
Bye, Yifan.

773
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,110
Well.

774
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,880
You are...

775
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,070
You still remember to come back?

776
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,320
Didn't we agree

777
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,550
to dress appropriately in shared spaces?

778
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,030
I've already accepted my fate.

779
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,670
What do you mean?

780
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,480
You've already kissed me

781
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,480
and touched me.

782
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,440
Does it even matter

783
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,510
whether I'm wearing clothes now?

784
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,230
Have you been drinking?

785
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,590
Then I'll keep it short.

786
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,400
After what happened this morning,

787
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,550
I realized I might have no sense of direction

788
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,920
when I'm sleepwalking.

789
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,920
Blocking the door with a chair won't help.

790
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,110
From now on, you'll need

791
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,110
to lock your door at night.

792
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,320
I'll also go to the hospital soon...

793
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,150
Are you

794
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,880
blushing?

795
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,920
And follow the doctor's advice.

796
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,710
Why are you blushing?

797
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:38,880
It's too hot!

798
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,590
Haven't you noticed how hot it's been lately?

799
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,670
I… I just haven't seen

800
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,920
a guy's body like that before.

801
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,280
Besides,

802
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
before we moved in together,

803
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,130
we made an agreement.

804
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,440
I said you couldn't wear

805
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,510
revealing clothes in shared spaces,

806
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,510
and you agreed.

807
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,880
You even said I must be dreaming.

808
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,960
I did say that,

809
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,360
but I'm in a good mood today,

810
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,760
so I'll indulge you a little.

811
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,480
I'll try to make sure

812
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,280
this doesn't happen again.

813
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,320
You should be more careful as well, okay?

814
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,960
You handle things

815
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,840
the same way every time.

816
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,510
But what's the result?

817
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,960
In the end,

818
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,550
you still end up doing it again.

819
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,230
