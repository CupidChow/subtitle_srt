2

A man wearing a mask, a hat and a hoody.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,680
Exactly the man that Miss Meena had described.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,320
Get down!
(Screaming)

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,480
We’ve got one suspect.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,360
His name is Narong, a forensic officer.
I’ve checked the access record.
He had accessed to the case files on rapes and sexual assault in the past month.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,800
He’s not running away.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,720
He’s going to finish his job on his last victim.
That is Songyod.
Can I tag along too?

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,800
- Of course.
- No.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,600
When you imagine something has happened...

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,080
when in fact it never happened at all.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,200
Did Tharn tell you about me?

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,440

The Sign

30
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:35,920
Yes, sir.

31
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,520
I’ll get it done as soon as possible.

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,560
Thongthai and Kem. Come with me to see Mr. Songyod.

33
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Singh, you stay here.
Try to track down Narong’s phone
and check all the CCTV cameras on every route that he takes.

34
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:53,040
Find out where he had been since the last day he came to work.

35
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,079
Phaya, Tharn and Yai. Go to Narong’s house near Suvannabhumi airport.

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,760
We might find a cellar there.

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,360
Let’s get to work.
Yes, sir.

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,680
We’re going after the culprit.

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,880
If you guys are still mad at each other like this, it might ruin the work.
Go and clear it up with him first.

40
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,560
Phaya.

41
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,760
Phaya!

42
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,000
Phaya, wait!

43
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,760
I’ve never told Doc about your dream.

44
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,360
Then how did he know?

45
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,520
I’ll ask him how he knew about it.

46
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,240
Then what? It wouldn’t make anything better.

47
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,840
Because you...

48
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,400
already betrayed me.

49
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,520
I never betrayed you.

50
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,160
Shut up! I don’t want to talk about it anymore.
Hey!

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,800
I don’t want you to misunderstand me.

52
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,040
If you think I’m nuts, then leave me alone.

53
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,920
Damn it! That’s too much!

54
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,800
It’s okay.

55
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,120
Let’s go.

56
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,600
(Door opening)

57
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,080
Guys.

58
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Look.

59
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,000
(Thrill Sound)

60
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,040
It’s really him.

61
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,000
What a psycho.

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,560
He planned everything for his revenge.

63
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,440
But all those cases have nothing to do with his sister.

64
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,880
Why did he do it then?

65
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,680
It’s a sign from someone who used to be a victim.

66
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,159
For what?

67
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,240
To retaliate.

68
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,280
Like the laws in the past.

69
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,640
An eye for an eye (and a tooth for a tooth.)

70
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,080
Those victims were tortured – whip lashing and hung by the neck. Their tongues...

71
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,920
and genital organs got cut off and finally they were shot in the head.

72
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,400
We’re at Narong’s place right now.

73
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,440
We’ve found evidence that he is the real culprit.

74
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,600
But there’s still no sign of Narong.

75
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,159
He might know that we’d be coming and probably ran away before we arrived.

76
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,560
How is it going over there?

77
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,720
What?

78
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay. See you at the office.

79
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,760
Songyod is at our office right now.

80
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,520
Let’s gather all the evidence and go back there.

81
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,680
- Okay.
- Um

82
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,240
(Door opening)

83
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,120
Hey!

84
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,760
Yai! What happened?!
Stop!

85
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,920
Shit! Why are there two of them?

86
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,720
- Follow him!
- Okay

87
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,240
Stop!

88
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,080
Stop!

89
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,800
Stop right now!

90
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,920
I said stop!

91
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,120
Stop!

92
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,680
Stop! Stop right now!

93
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,920
Where did he go?

94
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,800
Stop!

95
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,080
Shit!

96
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,400
Damn it!

97
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Stop!

98
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,320
Get up!

99
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,320
Get up!

100
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,240
You have the right to remain silent...

101
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,480
What the fuck are you babbling about?

102
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,360
Wit!

103
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
You’re wasting my time, Inspector.

104
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,480
When will you let me go?

105
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,080
I recommend you to cooperate with us and stay here for a while.

106
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,960
It’s for the sake of your own safety.

107
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,080
The man who wants to attack you is sitll on the loose.

108
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,880
Then go get him.

109
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,400
Your salaries are paid from the taxes we pay.

110
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,040
So, you’d better work hard.
Don’t just be a guarding dog...

111
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,240
Oops, I mean a security guard who’s keeping watch on my every move.

112
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,400
This man wants to hurt you...

113
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,680
because you raped his younger sister.

114
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,680
So, you’d better be careful. Or else you might end up as the next dead body.

115
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,640
Excuse me? What are you talking about?

116
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,600
My client is an innocent man.

117
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,640
Please keep in mind why Mr. Songyod has to be here.

118
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,880
He’s here as a prospect who might fall victim to the culprit.

119
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,160
I don’t understand why you keep trying to incriminate my client.

120
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,000
Are you sure?

121
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,120
I’ve looked at the record. It seems you’ve had a lot of charges filing against you.

122
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,080
Khem.

123
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,840
He actually has a lot of cases.

124
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,480
I admire you and your team for your fast and effiecient work.

125
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,120
And I’m greatly honoured to receive a protection from your team…

126
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,400
as an innocent man.

127
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,720
Okay then.

128
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,240
But let me warn you about something.

129
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,480
You’d better watch out and lay low during these days.

130
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,800
You’re the culprit’s real target --  the victim that he wants to kill the most.

131
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,080
Then I hope you and your team...

132
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,400
will catch this culprit soon so that I can finally feel at ease.

133
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,000
Please let me know if you need anything.

134
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,080
I’d be more than willing to help.

135
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,520
Yes, sir.

136
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,400
Thank you very much, sir. Everything went well.

137
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,520
Once I’m done with my business at the safe house...

138
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,960
please allow me to treat you to a meal.

139
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,720
Tharn, let’s go.

140
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,960
Mr. Songyod, please say something.

141
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,280
Please say something.

142
00:14:48,280 --> 00:15:01,440
What made you do it?
Why did you do it?
Listen up, everyone.
Please allow me to explain.
My client only came here to provide some information to the police...
so that they could use it to catch the culprit.

143
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,600
But is it true that you were once sued with the charge of sexual assault?

144
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:18,560
- Is it true, Mr. Songyod?
- Is it true?
- Is it true?
Excuse me?
We refuse to answer any questions that are not related to this case.
I’m afraid there’s nothing much I could tell you today.
It might jeopardize the authority’s investigation on the case.

145
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,600
But I’m so thankful to the special investigation unit...

146
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,000
for their quick and effective work.
They really make me feel safe.

147
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,040
As an innocent man, I feel so grateful to them.

148
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,640
Let’s go!

149
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,400
Block them.

150
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,200
Go, go!
Where are you going?

151
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,080
Go!

152
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,480
- Mr. Songyod!
- Please wait!

153
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,640
We almost got him at Narong’s place.

154
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,200
It was my fault that he got away.

155
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,760
We’re checking the CCTV cameras to track down the car and his escape route.

156
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,840
It’s all right.

157
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,320
Singh, what have you got?

158
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
I’ve hacked into the system...

159
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,920
and found out that Wit is the boyfriend of Rin, Narong’s younger sister who had killed herself.

160
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,400
I think Wit is probably helping the culprit.

161
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,200
He gave Narong a tip-off and kept informing him about our investigation.

162
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,400
I’m afraid Wit is not going to say anything.

163
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,680
He probably wants Narong to finish his job.

164
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,839
Drive me to the safe house. I’m going to clean up a bit.

165
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,599
Also, call the agent and tell them to send me those girls to kill my time.

166
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,440
Geez, those assholes. Now my suit stinks.

167
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,400
(Tap Sound)

168
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,560
What’s that sound?

169
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,080
Hey, why did you stop?

170
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,840
(Someone calling for help.)

171
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,360
Shit! What’s going on?!

172
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,520
Ouch!

173
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,640
(Sad Music)

174
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,760
Rin.

175
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,040
Why did you do this to me?

176
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,760
(Crying)

177
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,880
(Crying)

178
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,800
(Crying)

179
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,600
Rin.

180
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,760
(Crying)

181
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,600
Rin.

182
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,160
Inspector, the security guard at the entrance said that...

183
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,400
there’s a car without a license plate parked not for away from our unit.

184
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,040
The description matches with the one Narong uses to escape and commit a crime.

185
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,720
Inspector.

186
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,560
- Singh, check the CCTV cameras at the front.
- Yes, sir.

187
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,480
- Khem and Thongthai. Try to find the connection.
- Yes, sir.

188
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,080
Mayris, go and look at the case files.

189
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,440
The one we were looking at yesterday.

190
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,080
(Messaging Sound)

191
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,720
- Found it?
- Yes, I found it.

192
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,600
Look here

193
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,560
- Inspector.
- Yes?

194
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
Damn it!

195
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,200
- Phaya!
- Phaya!

196
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,040
Let him go.

197
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,800
Did you give Narong a tip-off on our investigation?

198
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,800
That’s why he could always get away from us.

199
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,960
Is this what you and him have planned all along?

200
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,920
If you really want to help the victim.

201
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,120
If you want to make it right.

202
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,600
You have to let him pay for what he did to Rin. You have to let him die.

203
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,880
Why would you help him?

204
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,480
Because I’m a cop!

205
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,680
Not even you or Narong has any rights to do this to anyone.

206
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,640
But those bastards can do it to other people?

207
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,760
Rin took her own life because of him.

208
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,200
Many people’s lives are ruined because of a fucking bastard like him.

209
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,360
The one who should be arrested is not me, but him!

210
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,640
This is why I have to get my hands dirty and do what you people are supposed to do.

211
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,520
This is what he deserves.

212
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,400
Whether he deserves it or not is not your job to decide. The laws will do it.

213
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,720
Narong and I only called out for those people who deserve a better justice.

214
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,840
Can’t you see how many people agree with me?

215
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,880
(Riots)

216
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,800
(Thrill Sound)

217
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,440
- Look into those paper again.
- Tharn, what else did you see?

218
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,760
What else did you see yesterday? Tharn!

219
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,360
Geez.

220
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,760
Inspector, we don’t have any time left.

221
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,680
Let’s go get him!

222
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,680
Singh, show us pictures from the CCTV at the crime scene.

223
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,200
- I’m trying.
- These are all we’ve got.

224
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Hurry up.

225
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,320
Show me again.

226
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,520
(Airplane Sound)

227
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,320
Why do you want from me?

228
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,680
Do you remember me?

229
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,280
No.

230
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,440
If you want to stay alive, you’d better let me go.

231
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,560
Ouch!

232
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,800
If you can’t remember me,

233
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,960
what about this girl? Do you remember her?

234
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,040
No.

235
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,720
No?

236
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,640
Don't you remember her?

237
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,760
She’s the girl you raped.

238
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,760
(Someone panting)

239
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Watch me, Rin.

240
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,680
I’m going to make him pay for what he did to you.

241
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,360
What are you doing?

242
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,600
What are you doing?!

243
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,240
Please don’t!

244
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,680
Please don’t hurt me.

245
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,040
(Thrill Sound)

246
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,920
What are you doing?!

247
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,880
Call for a backup.

248
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,800
We’ll seal off the wood and search for the cellar that Wit told us about.

249
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,800
That’d be where Narong took Songyod and kept him captive.

250
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,680
Inspector, this is the place where Rin killed herself.

251
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,480
It’s nearby those areas where we found the victims’ bodies.

252
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,360
It’s possible that Narong might go back to the place where his sister killed herself.

253
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,680
Inspector!

254
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,520
Someone annonymous called us and said that she has some clues about Narong’s whereabout.

255
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,240
I think she’s probably someone was raped by Songyod.

256
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,960
I’ve looked into all evidence.

257
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,520
Everything confirms that it’s the same place.

258
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,040
I’m sure Songyod is locked up there.

259
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,040
Are you sure?

260
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,720
Phaya, Tharn and Yai. Go to the wood and find out where the cellar is.

261
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,680
Thongthai and Khem, come with me.
We must find the location of Songyod’s safe house.

262
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,400
We’re running out of time.

263
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,000
We must find Narong and stop him.

264
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,480
But Songyod is...

265
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,560
We’re not going to stand by and watch anyone commit a crime...

266
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,000
eventhough the victim has done something unforgiving.

267
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,760
(Wailing)

268
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,680
Our job is to devlier them into the hands of the laws.

269
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,600
Got it?

270
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,680
Yes, sir!

271
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,880
Let’s go!

272
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,080
(Laughing)

273
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,240
(Thrill Sound)

274
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,480
Hey!

275
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,400
Ouch!

276
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,080
(Airplane sound)

277
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,240
The noise there was very loud.

278
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,640
I don’t know what it was but it was so irritating.

279
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,160
There’s a loud noise.

280
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,440
This is the place.

281
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,200
We’ll divide into 2 teams.

282
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,920
Yai.

283
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,480
(Wailing)

284
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,400
(Thrill Sound)

285
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,400
Hello, everyone.

286
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,880
What you are about to see...

287
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,920
requires parental guidance.

288
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,400
Those who wish to walk down this path,

289
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,560
this will be your punishment.

290
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,160
The adults should be more aware...

291
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,400
and pay attention to normal people who have no power.

292
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,440
People who have been bullied...

293
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,480
and the innocent ones who have fallen victims...

294
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,080
to an evil and disgusting act like what this rascal did.

295
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,200
What he deserves the most...

296
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:22,680
is the punsihment from hell that you are about to witness.

297
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,480
(Screaming)

298
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,720
I promise you...

299
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,040
that I will not let you die so easily.

300
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,000
(Screaming)

301
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
(Thrill Sound)

302
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,000
(Screaming)

303
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,720
Please...please don’t hurt me.

304
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,680
Look.

305
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,240
(Whip lashing)

306
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,400
(Whip lashing)

307
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
- (Whip lashing)   /   - (Wailing)

308
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,240
(Whip lashing)

309
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,760
- (Whip lashing)    /    - (Wailing)

310
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:42,160
(Screaming)

311
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,320
(Incoming call)

312
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,120
(Incoming call)

313
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,960
Stop what you’re doing right now.

314
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,600
Do you think you can bring justice to your sister by doing this?

315
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,840
It’s the justice that I can choose for myself.

316
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,280
And it’s about to be over.

317
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,160
Stop it right now.

318
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,640
Your sister probably didn’t want to see her big brother
become a criminal like the man who had hurt her.

319
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,280
I’m willing to sacrifice myself for those who once fell victims follow suit.

320
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,240
See you in the LIVE, Inspector.

321
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,480
H...help!

322
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,080
Wait! Hey!

323
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,800
Damn it!

324
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,280
(Crying in pain)

325
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,480
Fuck!

326
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,720
Inform Phaya and his team that the cellar is in that area.

327
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,640
They must hurry up and find the cellar. We’re running out of time.

328
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,680
-  Go.   /   - Yes, sir.

329
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,680
Ouch!

330
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,760
(Wailing)

331
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,160
What’s wrong?

332
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,240
He’s going to kill Songyod.

333
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,600
(Wailing)

334
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,880
Don’t worry.

335
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,720
I won’t let you die that easily.

336
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,360
Do you think you’re the only one who can escape the hands of laws?

337
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,880
I can do that too.

338
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,480
And this is…

339
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,160
Geez, why is it stuck now?

340
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,720
(Screaming)

341
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,760
Arghhhh!

342
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,760
Stop!

343
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,680
It’s over.

344
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,800
You can’t bring her back from death by doing this.

345
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,760
If you kill him, he won’t get to be punished any further.

346
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,800
But then no more people will have to fall victims to someone like him.

347
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,320
Rin should be happy to see him die slowly and painfully.

348
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,080
But you and your people are ruining my plan.

349
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,280
I know you’re disappointed that a scroundel like him hasn’t
served the punishment for what he did.

350
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,480
But that doesn’t mean you should become like him.

351
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,120
Let the laws handle these people.

352
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,400
The laws?

353
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,440
They are only for those who don’t have much enough power or money.

354
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,880
You know that too.

355
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,520
How many cases were sealed off and ended up in silence.

356
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,720
Like my sister’s.

357
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,680
And look what happened to these scumbags?
They can still start a new and live a happy life.

358
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,360
What about my sister?

359
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,880
She was having a bright future ahead.

360
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,840
She was getting married with the man she loved.

361
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,000
But then she was forced to take her own life...

362
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,160
because of what a scumbag like him did to her.

363
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,440
If you want him to serve his punishment...

364
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,240
you should keep him alive.

365
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,080
If you kill him, he’d no longer be a criminal but a victim.

366
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,720
And you would become the criminal instead.

367
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
I don’t care.

368
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,720
I’m going to make him pay for what he did to my sister.

369
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,680
(Gunshot)

370
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,160
(Gunshot)

371
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,880
(Gunshot)

372
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,640
(Gunshot)

373
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,320
(Gunshot)

374
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,960
(Gunshot)

375
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,760
Shit!

376
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,080
(Fighting)

377
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:04,880
(Fighting)

378
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,200
(Fighting)

379
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,680
Phaya!

380
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,600
(Fighthing)

381
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,040
Tharn!

382
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
Tharn!

383
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,320
Tharn!

384
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,440
Tharn!

385
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,680
Tharn!

386
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,560
Are you all right?

387
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,040
I’m glad you’re safe.

388
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,880
Tharn! Phaya!

389
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
This way!

390
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,000
Please be careful. Don’t let your wound come in contact with water.

391
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,560
Thank you.

392
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
Tharn.

393
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,960
Maybe you should go to the hospital.

394
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,680
I’m okay.

395
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,480
Thanks to the bulletproof vest,

396
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,040
or else my wound would be much deeprer.

397
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,240
Why didn’t you treat your wound?

398
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,520
It’s all right. I’m good.

399
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,120
Tharn.

400
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,920
Can I ask you something?

401
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,880
Tharn.

402
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,120
What happened to Narong…

403
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,480
in the cellar...

404
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,240
Those green eyes.

405
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,640
They are exactly what I saw in my dream.

406
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:41,280
I also saw those eyes when you were drowned.

407
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,240
How did you save me back then?

408
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,200
I can’t remember either.

409
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,160
I just knew that thing would save our lives.

410
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,200
Then everything just happened like a miracle.

411
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,200
Do you think that something which tried to attack me twenty years ago...

412
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,720
is now coming back?

413
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,440
That something...

414
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,600
might never stay from you at all.

415
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,680
This is like what happened at the camp.

416
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,360
And the training centre.

417
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,640
- Pull him up!    /    - Phaya!

418
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,200
You’re always there to rescue me.

419
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,120
What’s this all about?

420
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,320
I don’t know too.

421
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,480
Hey...

422
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,160
I’m...I’m sorry.

423
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,480
You got hurt because of me.

424
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,680
It was just a coincidence.

425
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,640
It wasn’t your fault.

426
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,000
I was just doing my job.

427
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,160
Tharn.

428
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,800
When you got hurt,

429
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,440
I was really afraid you’d die. I don’t want to feel like that anymore.

430
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,800
I promise...

431
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,040
that from now on I’ll always listen to everything you say.

432
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,880
Please don’t leave me.

433
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,240
I’m not going to leave you.

434
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,600
We’re on the same team.

435
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,920
How can I leave you?

436
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:49,680
What about...you thinking that I told Chalothorn about your dream?

437
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,160
Are you still mad at me?

438
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Tharn.

439
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,840
I don’t care about anyone.

440
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,120
I already told you.

441
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,440
I’ll listen everything you say.

442
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,200
I’m so sorry.

443
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,280
For being an asshole.

444
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,200
It’s okay. I’m glad you’re safe.

445
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,720
You said you couldn’t remember everything that happened in the cellar.

446
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,840
You said you put your fingers on the kettle...

447
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,600
in order to destroy your fingerprints.

448
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,240
That’s why we couldn’t find any fingerprints at the crime scene.

449
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,360
(Pouring out water)

450
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,720
(Boiling water)

451
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,240
You don’t have to ask me anything.

452
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,040
If you want to arrest me, just put me in jail.

453
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,840
You want to bring justice to your sister,

454
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,640
but you also killed those three victims.

455
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,920
The one who killed them...

456
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,240
is you.

457
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,920
And those bastards...

458
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,520
who use their power to bully someone defendless like us.

459
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,080
The laws that you cherish and look up to...

460
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,120
can never keep those scumbags behind bars for long.

461
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,200
They will get out and roam around happily.

462
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,160
But victims like me...

463
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,160
who have to carry those scars they had left on us,

464
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,440
can never live the life we used to have again.

465
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,240
Are you calling this justice?

466
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,360
Is it really fair?

467
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,000
You are not different from those scumbags.

468
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,520
Yes.

469
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,160
But I still believe.

470
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,600
I still believe that justice also takes time to proof itself.

471
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,480
But my sister’s time is done.

472
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,080
Let me ask you one thing.

473
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,400
Do you really think the job you’re doing...

474
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,960
is something that a hero would do?

475
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,520
You might not see yourself like that.

476
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,040
But when in trouble,

477
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,600
to those people out there, you’re a hero.

478
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,840
You’re their hope.

479
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,280
But then...

480
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,000
why a hero like you couldn’t do the right thing.

481
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,520
And help those who are in need.

482
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,440
Why?

483
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,320
Inspector.

484
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,400
We’ve arrested Songyod.

485
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,960
Khem and Thongthai have found another evidence...

486
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,040
which are video clips of him raping other victims. They were hidden in his house.

487
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,360
Mr. Songyod.

488
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,360
(Shoutings)

489
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,760
Please calm down.

490
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,720
That’s the justice you’re looking for.

491
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,400
It might show up late.

492
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,400
But it will always come in the end.

493
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,880
I’m not going to let the victims or those who get hurt...

494
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,400
falling into despair and giving up on justice like what you did.

495
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,080
I give you my word.

496
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,560
Inspector.

497
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,680
While we were searching Narong’s house,

498
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,080
we found a video clip of his sister before she committed suicide.

499
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,000
Thank you, my brother.

500
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,960
Thank you for always taking care of me.

501
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,240
I’m so lucky to be your sister.

502
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,800
When our parents left us,

503
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,320
I always thought my life would never be happy again.

504
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,120
But it’s not like that at all.

505
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,160
Although you’re the only family I have left,

506
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,760
I still feel so happy like when our parents were with us.

507
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,200
I want to live my life.

508
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,680
I want to enjoy it.

509
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,920
I want to stay happy like that forever.

510
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,320
But right now...

511
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,960
my happiness is gone.

512
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,040
(Crying)

513
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,800
All because of that bastard.

514
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,760
He took my whole life from me.

515
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,240
He took my happiness away.

516
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,640
He took my body and my soul.

517
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,080
These days…

518
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,200
I’m dying inside.

519
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,800
You told me to wait.

520
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,240
You told me to be patient.

521
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,240
But I’m too tired.

522
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,680
I want the laws to sentence him to death.

523
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,520
But the laws has given me death instead.

524
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,280
Me, who is the victim.

525
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,840
I’m sorry.

526
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,280
I’m sorry.

527
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,200
I’m so sorry.

528
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,720
Narong had tried to file a case against Songyod for many times.

529
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,480
But it never went far.

530
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,280
And the case eventually got dismissed…

531
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,800
because there wasn’t enough evidence.

532
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,280
A few days after Rin was released from the hospital,

533
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,680
she took her own life.

534
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:17,120
When Narong said that police like us are also responsible for his sister’s death,

535
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,960
I guess it’s true.

536
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,720
I don’t want someone who gives up so easily on my team.

537
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,920
Right now, we might not be able to bring justice to everyone.

538
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,960
But that doesn’t mean we won’t be able to make it happen.

539
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,640
If you are feeling discouraged just by hearing what they said,

540
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,400
I recommend you to quit.

541
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,600
I don’t want a loser on my team.

542
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,280
Even if I couldn’t help every victim,

543
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,240
I’m not going to run away.

544
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,560
I’m not going to leave those who are in need of help...

545
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,480
ever falling into despair like her.

546
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,880
Me too.

547
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:16,240
I decided to become a cop because I still believe that justice still exists.

548
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,320
Those who have done wrong will eventually pay for what they did.

549
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,920
I don’t want to.

550
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,960
I don’t know how to do it.

551
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,840
Singh.

552
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,520
Come here. I have something to tell you.

553
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,360
So,

554
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,080
What do you want to tell me?

555
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,600
Can you do me a favour?

556
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,400
What is it?

557
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,640
Your job is to gather information...

558
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,520
which also includes information about the cold cases, right?

559
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:39,920
Well, yeah, if it’s about the case then maybe I can help you.

560
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,920
Why are you asking though?

561
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,720
I want  you to dig up an old case.

562
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,920
I want to know the names...

563
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,200
of police officers who took care of that case.

564
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,000
Which case?

565
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,400
About my father.

566
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,760
I’m going to bring justice to my father.

567
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,280
Don’t worry, Grandma. I’m still all intact.

568
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,640
I’ll call you later. See you in a few days.

569
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:27,920
Yes.

570
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,200
I tried to ask Narong about what happened in the cellar today.

571
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:52,200
But it seems he wasn’t aware of what was happening.

572
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,280
As if everything got blacked out.

573
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,560
Singh said that the lie detector indicated that Narong was telling the truth.

574
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,240
Is there anyone who can explain what it is that we saw?

575
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,800
Damn it! Ouch!

576
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:12,440
Hey.

577
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,760
Let me see.

578
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,200
It’s just a graze.

579
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,080
Wait here. I’ll fix the wound for you.

580
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:39,480
(Funny Sound)

581
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,880
why didn’t you say anything now that I come crashing your place again.

582
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,680
If I were you, I wouldn’t have wanted my grandma to see myself in this state.

583
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,360
Forget it.

584
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:05,680
Are you done?

585
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,680
Yeah.

586
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,320
Thanks.

587
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,160
Wait.

588
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,560
(Heartbeat)

589
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,560
(Romantic Sound)

590
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,560
(The sound of Tharn blowing a wound)

591
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,960
(The sound of Tharn blowing a wound)

592
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,320
(The sound of Tharn blowing a wound)

593
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,480
(Romantic Sound)

594
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,560
Let me check on your wound.

595
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,240
Don’t worry.

596
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,560
The doctor already took care of it.

597
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,280
I want to do what you just did to me.

598
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,520
(Romantic Sound)

599
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,920
- What were you thinking?
- What’s wrong?

600
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,600
Umm, well...

601
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:52,720
When I was a kid, my grandma always blew over the wound after fixing it.

602
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,200
Can you...can you do it too?

603
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:05,920
What if my saliva happen to be in contact with your wound? It might get infected.

604
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,960
Didn’t they teach you this in school?

605
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,320
Geez!

606
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,760
Then let me check on your wound.

607
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,920
No need.

608
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,080
The doctor already took care of it.

609
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,480
I’m going to rest now.

610
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,520
I’m not feeling well.

611
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,040
The medicine is starting to kick in.

612
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,120
Okay.

613
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,360
Sleep well.

614
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,440
Okay.

615
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,760
Go rest. I’ll keep watch for you tonight.

616
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,160
(Doorbell ringing)

617
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,840
Huh? Who’s visiting this late?

618
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,040
It’s probably Yai.

619
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,680
I asked him to fetch me some of my clothes from my place.

620
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,400
I probably have to crash your place quite often.

621
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,600
Okay.

622
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,800
(Door opening)

623
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,880
I didn’t know you’d be here.

624
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,720
I have to finish off some work with him.

625
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,200
What are you doing here?

626
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,840
I’m here to visit Tharn as usual, just like what I always do.

627
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,000
We have to talk.

628
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:19,440
I don’t care how close you are to Tharn.

629
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,920
But I think you should know your place.

630
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,640
It’d be best for you to play the role of his big brother. Not something else.

631
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,400
Right now, Tharn and I...

632
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,720
and everyone in our team...

633
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,400
have a lot of things that we should keep...

634
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,680
confidential.

635
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,360
I don’t want him to see you so often like before.

636
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,040
- Why?   /   - You want to know why?

637
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,680
Because Tharn might accidentally slipped out something confidential about the investigation to you, like what he did last time.

638
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,960
- So?   /   - So...

639
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,560
it might badly affect the unity in our team.

640
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,840
Your reason seems nothing personal at all.

641
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:19,440
I’ll try my best to heed your advice.

642
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,520
Until your time is done.

643
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,000
Okay?

644
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,080
Phaya.

645
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,640
I will never let you take him away from me.

646
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,440
This necklace is probably yours.

647
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,280
Keep it. It will protect you.

648
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,960
Where did you get this amulet?

649
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,400
Exactly the same.

650
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:51,600
(Romantic Sound)

651
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:36,560
(Romantic Sound)

652
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,800
Mum.

653
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,240
Mum.

654
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:43,160
If you don’t let go when I count to three,

655
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,440
I’m going to sleep here.

656
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,200
1 2 3.

657
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,120
I already counted.

658
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,200
Well then...

659
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,480
I’m going to be your bolster for tonight.

660
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,840
What the...?!

661
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,359
Ouch!

662
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,479
Who are you?

663
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,359
How did you get in here?

664
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:55,399
It’s me, Phaya.

665
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:57,040
I’m Phaya.

666
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,760
My wound.

667
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,399
Ouch...

668
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:05,640
Ouch...

669
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,399
How did you get in here?

670
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,920
I shouldn’t have trusted you.

671
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,840
You had a fever last night.

672
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,840
I used a damp washcloth to cool it down.

673
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:18,600
When I was about to leave, you just held on to me so tight.

674
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,560
You should have thanked me.

675
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,279
For letting you hugging me all night.

676
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,920
Me? Hugging you?

677
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:26,880
Yeah.

678
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,080
You were hugging me so tight last night.

679
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:33,240
(Phone buzzing)

680
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,279
(Phone buzzing)

681
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,600
Good morning, Luangpor.

682
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,319
I’ve been quite busy with my first case so I didn’t have time to call you.

683
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,600
Oh, you had it rough since the first one?

684
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,320
Yes.

685
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,160
It’s the victim turned attacker.

686
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,720
When your mind is shrouded by hatre or anger,

687
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:09,440
you will become obsessed with that thing.

688
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,800
Remeber...

689
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,400
Mindfulness can help strengthen your mind.

690
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,840
Being mindful at all time...

691
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,840
will help strengthen your meditation and leads you to the enlightenment...

692
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,880
which would then help you to distinguish between the good and the evil.

693
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:32,160
But some people will always choose to do something evil.

694
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:36,560
Like those scumbags who never hesitate to take advantages on other people...

695
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:43,360
and push them into the darkness filled with despair, humiliation, and vengeance.

696
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,000
Those victims are left with no choice but to fight back in order to survive.

697
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:48,800
They have to kill.

698
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,840
The basic code of moral conducts for human beings like us...

699
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,960
is the 5 precepts.

700
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,560
One should be abstained from killing other living beings.

701
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:05,760
These precepts can bring peace and happiness to your family and the society.

702
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:13,200
Undertaking the five precepts will benefit not only yourself but also the people around you.

703
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:20,200
I used to believe that a person would be good or bad depends on what they did in their past lives.

704
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:24,120
But that’s not entirely true. Karma isn’t the only thing that shapes us.

705
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:33,080
Dhamma also helps refine and enlighten our mind to be able to tell the right from wrong.

706
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:36,920
It cannot cancel your karma.

707
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:40,360
Just because you did something good,

708
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:45,440
whether building a pavillion, a chapel, or even a temple, in hope that it would help erase your wrongdoings in the past.

709
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,840
That’s impossible. You cannot undone what you already did.

710
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:53,000
What you did will eventually comes back to you.

711
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,160
That’s right.

712
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,320
Karma is the sum of our own actions.

713
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,720
This morning, Tharn did something bad to me.

714
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,800
He hurt me.

715
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,440
So, he’ll pay for what he did soon.

716
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,120
Do you want another one?

717
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,440
(Incoming message)

718
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,200
[Nee: Grandma is sick. Come home ASAP.]

719
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,680
Shit!

720
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:27,960
Hey,

721
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:28,520
Yeah?

722
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,520
I’m leaving.

723
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,800
Goodbye, Luangpor.

724
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,160
What’s wrong with him?

725
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:49,440
Tharn, do you still receive a treatment from that doctor?

726
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:53,120
Not anymore.

727
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,960
But he still checks on me regularly.

728
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:03,160
But I don’t know why Phaya seems to hate him.

729
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:08,920
Those two should avoid each other if possible.

730
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,240
As if Phaya would listen to me.

731
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,640
He follows me everywhere like a dog’s flea.

732
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,600
Nee, where’s Grandma?

733
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,000
She’s upstairs.

734
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,160
Grandma!

735
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,320
Are you sick? Why didn’t go to the hospital?

736
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:11,240
Who’s sick?

737
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,400
I thought you said you’d come back in 2-3 days.

738
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:22,120
Nee texted me and said that you’re sick.

739
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,280
Come here.

740
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,280
- What is it?
- Just come.

741
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:38,000
Grandma could hardly eat or sleep. She’s always grumpy too.

742
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,560
So, I thought she might be a little sick.

743
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,840
Because she misses you.

744
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,600
You tricked me again.

745
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,640
I’m serious.

746
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,560
Since the day you left for a training at the camp,

747
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:55,640
she really thought you might stay home more often after the training was done.

748
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,960
Turns out you hardly came home.

749
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,200
So, she’s upset.

750
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,440
Go on your knees and beg for her forgiveness.

751
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,400
Hey, wait.

752
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,800
Well, Grandma...

753
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:27,960
I finished my work earlier than expected so I came straight home see you.

754
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:31,440
I thought you were not feeling well. I was really worried.

755
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,360
Don’t try to sweet talk me.

756
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,680
Grandma...

757
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,000
Please don’t be mad at me.

758
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,720
I’m really sorry.

759
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,400
Please forgive me, okay?

760
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,600
You’re really something.

761
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,280
Ouch.

762
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,640
What’s wrong?

763
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,480
What happened to your hand?

764
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,400
It’s nothing, Grandma.

765
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:54,040
Take off your shirt right now. I want to see why you are hurt when I touch you there.

766
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,240
Take it off.

767
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,440
Careful. Slowly.

768
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,120
Let me see.

769
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,880
Oh my goodness.

770
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:05,280
I never knew your job is this dangerous.

771
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,880
Oh dear. Nee!

772
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,120
Come and look at your brother.

773
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,960
- I’m coming.
- Why didn’t anyone tell me about this?

774
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:16,680
He told me to keep quiet because he was afraid that you might be worried.

775
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,120
It’s just a graze, Grandma.

776
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,240
It’s really nothing. I’m feeling great.

777
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,160
Please don’t worry too much. I’m really fine.

778
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:28,520
Phaya!

779
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:29,840
Don’t say that.

780
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,880
If you think I overreacted...

781
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,880
and don’t want me to mess with your life,

782
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,200
then I’ll leave you alone.

783
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,400
Grandma.

784
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,360
Please wait, Grandma!

785
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,520
Geez.

786
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,720
You’re such a lousy guy.

787
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,680
Now, she’s even more upset. Why did you say that?

788
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,880
I’m so doomed.

789
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,560
What to do now?

790
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:04,760
Stay home tonight, have dinner with her and talk to her.

791
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,440
Wait for the right timing and try to beg for her forgiveness again.

792
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,840
But right now, you better go take a shower first.

793
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,640
You stink. I can hardly smell my dessert.

794
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,400
Now, you’re overreacting.

795
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:16,920
Geez.

796
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,520
Grandma.

797
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:24,240
(Lovely Sound)

798
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,240
We finally meet once again.

799
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,280
Who are you?

800
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,640
Why are you in my dream?

801
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,160
Don’t you remember me?

802
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,360
Use your heart instead of your eyes.

803
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,880
And you’ll finally see.

804
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:47,280
idol Factory

805
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,760
Nee.

806
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,800
Is Wi still teaching at the Faculty of Archaeology?

807
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:56,480
She already quit to open an art gallery.

808
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,800
Phaya!

809
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,960
Try looking in that room.

810
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:06,440
It might have something that you want to know.

811
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:39,480
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

812
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:46,920
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵

813
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:55,320
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

814
01:21:55,320 --> 01:22:05,760
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

815
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:13,160
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵

816
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:17,680
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵

817
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:20,760
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

818
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:28,000
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

819
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:32,440
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

820
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:40,000
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
