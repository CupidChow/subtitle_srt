Lieut Tam’s and Kao’s cases are related to your parents’ case?

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,320
I only believe in evidence.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,280
If you want me to believe in what you said...

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,320
go find me the evidence.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,040
Chart!

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,080
Dammit!

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,640
Do you realise that your reckless actions will get us all into trouble?!

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,840
I will take responsibility alone for what happened last night.

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,720
If you guys really want to help me, then find out who the real culprit is.

11

The Sign

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,800
Are you saying that the answer you’ve been looking for about your dream...

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,560
has something to do with our past lives?

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,760
That you are the Garuda and I’m the Naga...

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,320
I’m that woman who often appears in your dream?

33
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:25,840
Yeah.

34
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,680
Wansarut, you and I have been in love since our past lives.

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,000
But the war between our kinds...

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,800
brought us to death as if we had been cursed.

37
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,920
The shadow that has been trying to attack me all this time...

38
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,920
is another Naga.

39
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,080
He tries to separate you from me so that we can’t be together.

40
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,800
So...

41
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,960
that Naga shadow also exists in this life.

42
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,080
Who is he?

43
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,680
Why do you want me to keep it a secret from Tharn? Why can’t I tell him about Chalothorn?

44
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,360
If Tharn knows, he will surely do something.

45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,320
He will try to stop Chalothorn.

46
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,040
And might try to settle things by himself.

47
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,560
The 15th night of the 11th moon is coming soon.

48
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,720
You must be careful and don’t let Chalothorn get close to Tharn.

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,600
Protect him from whatever that might make him in danger.

50
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,600
Once the 15th night of the 11th waxing moon has passed,

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,360
Tharn will then be free from the karma and those whom he has done wrong in the past. Am I right?

52
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,440
If possible,

53
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,040
- I want Tharn to come stay with me...
- Okay

54
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,640
until the Day of Judgement has passed.

55
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,480
So, every time when an unexplainable incident occured…

56
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,080
in every case that both of us were working on,

57
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,520
whether those incidents at the training camp...

58
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:48,680
or the ones during Narong and Art’s cases. Did all those happen because of that man?

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,280
Listen to me, Tharn.

60
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,040
No matter what is going happen.

61
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,320
I’ll always be by your side to protect you.

62
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,080
The prophecy that the Abbot used to tell us when we were young…

63
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,560
is about to happen inevitably.

64
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,960
You’ll be in danger because of me.

65
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,120
Just like my parents.

66
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,360
Hey, he can’t harm me.

67
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,240
I have this amulet with me.

68
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:51,040
Don’t you worry. I’m not going to leave you again.

69
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,159
If we can’t avoid what’s going to happen,

70
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,280
maybe running away is not the right answer anymore.

71
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,480
Yeah.

72
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,600
Since I still have to recover...

73
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,600
and you’re suspeneded from work,

74
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,960
should we go see the Abbot?

75
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,840
I can’t right now.

76
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
I need to find out the truth.

77
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,920
I need to know if Chart is related to the killer who murdered my parents.

78
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,400
Khem is taking care of it right now.

79
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,800
I want you to use this time during your suspension...

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,360
to take some rest for a while.

81
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,840
I’ll help you find out about your parent’s case.

82
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,680
Let’s go see the Abbot in Nongkai together, okay?

83
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,280
Please?

84
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,360
Okay.

85
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,520
Oh, there’s one more thing.

86
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,680
Yes?

87
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,200
If Chalothorn comes to see you or ask you to go anywhere with him,

88
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,680
you must tell me right the way.

89
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,440
Don’t go anywhere with him alone, okay?

90
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,800
Why?

91
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,640
I’m jealous. Is that reasonable enough?

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,560
Don’t go anywhere with him again, okay? I’m begging you.

93
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,840
Please, Tharn.

94
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,400
Fine, you don’t have to worry about that though.

95
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,680
I’m sure he’s quite fed up to quarrel with you.

96
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,360
He didn’t even call or text me during the past few days.

97
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,280
Did he tell you where he’d go?

98
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,040
He didn’t tell me anything.

99
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,280
I don’t know what he’s doing either.

100
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,040
Is that so?

101
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,120
Yeah.

102
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,760
Huh? Why is it not charging?

103
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,560
Geez, he forgot to plug it in.

104
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,680
Now we don’t know if Yai has called about the case.

105

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,800
Phaya, did you tell your sister and grandma...

116
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
when you left the hospital last night?

117
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,280
No.

118
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,040
Did you call them this morning?

119
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,120
Shit, I forgot.

120
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,080
I didn’t bring my phone with me.

121
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,840
Yai, Grandma, and your sister are looking for you right now.

122
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,840
Tharn! Tharn! Open the door!

123
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,000
Tharn! Tharn!

124
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,520
Phaya has been missing since last night.

125
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,400
His grandma and sister are looking for him.

126
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,800
Tharn! Phaya has been missing from the hospital since last night.

127
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,320
I still couldn’t contact him.

128
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,920
Do you know where he is?

129
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,360
Do you?

130
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,680
Umm, I’m here, Grandma.

131
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,200
Please drink some water first, Grandma.

132
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,240
You’ve just recovered.

133
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,760
Why did you rush out of the hopsital like that? Why did you run away?

134
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,320
Why did you run away?

135
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,200
Do you know your sister and I were worried sick about you?

136
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,840
I’m really sorry, Grandma.

137
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,480
I just...

138
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,080
had an urgent case to discuss with Tharn.

139
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,640
Where did you discuss it, on the bed or sofa?

140
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,000
You shouldn’t care about your work more than your care for your life.

141
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,480
Didn’t you know you almost got killed from drowning?

142
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,520
Grandma and I were so worried about you.

143
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,080
I’m really sorry for not thinking it through.

144
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,240
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you and Nee first.

145
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,760
I’m really sorry.

146
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,160
I have to apologize to Grandma and Paranee too...

147
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,760
for not telling you when I found out he had left the hospital last night. I should have called and let you know.

148
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,760
Grandma, I’m sorry for making you worried.

149
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,040
I promise I’ll be more careful from now on.

150
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,320
I will always think twice and not act on impulse.

151
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,360
And I will not do anything that’d make you and Nee...

152
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,440
worry about me again.

153
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,320
Please rest assured, Grandma.

154
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,600
I’ll help take care of him too.

155
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,680
Hey.

156
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,440
Why are you holding hands?

157
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,680
Are you guys lovers?

158
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,840
Really?

159
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,880
Since when?

160
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,560
Why didn’t anyone tell me that you guys are together?

161
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,400
So fake, Yai.

162
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,640
Grandma.

163
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,120
I have something important to tell you.

164
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Give me a second.

165
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Okay, go ahead.

166
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,760
Well...

167
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,840
Tharn and I,

168
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,760
we are...

169
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,400
we’re dating.

170
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,520
Give me a second.

171
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,720
So, if it weren’t because you ran out of the hospital last night...

172
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,720
and then I finally found you here,

173
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,040
you’d have still kept it a secret from me, wouldn’t you?

174
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,000
I didn’t mean to keep it a secret from you, Grandma.

175
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,400
I just didn’t get a chance to tell you.

176
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,880
I was afraid you might not approve of...

177
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,080
me dating a guy.

178
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Phaya.

179
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,000
Haven’t I told you before...

180
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,840
that whom you want to be with is your own choice to make?

181
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,440
Because it’s you who’d live that life.

182
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,040
Don’t you remember?

183
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,040
Tharn.

184
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,920
Thank you for always taking care of him.

185
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,400
Since that day when he was drowned...

186
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,400
and recently when you had brought him back from death.

187
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,360
If it weren’t because of you,

188
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,480
I would have lost him long ago.

189
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,560
Thank you, dear.

190
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,160
Thank you for understanding me, Grandma.

191
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,240
Please don’t worry, Grandma.

192
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,240
It is my job to protect him.

193
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,360
I will always be by his side.

194
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,960
You go on and talk to them.

195
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,680
Grandma.

196
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,080
Yes?

197
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,320
There’s one more thing.

198
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,120
Oh, more?

199
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,120
Give me a second.

200
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Now you can say it.

201
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,720
Well...

202
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
during this time that I’m still recovering,

203
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,040
Tharn has to go back to Nongkai.

204
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,400
Can I...can I go with him too?

205
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,080
So that we could take care of each other.

206
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,680
Awww, you’re so crazy in love, Police Officer.

207
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,960
Is that all?

208
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
You scared me.

209
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,880
You don’t have to ask for my permission.

210
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,280
After that drowning incident,

211
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,320
I still haven’t gone back to Nongkai since then.

212
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,720
Can I go with you? I want to go see the Abbot too.

213
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,880
Can I?

214
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,240
Of course, Grandma.

215
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,080
Thank you, Grandma.

216
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,000
Inspector, we’ve found a suspect. Do you want our team to arrest him?

217
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,880
Not yet.

218
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,280
Tell them to keep an eye on our suspect.

219
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,960
Hey, we must get as much infromation as possible today.

220
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,040
Singh

221
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,840
Can you hack into the police bureau database?

222
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,760
I want to know what Chart has been doing since he left the training camp.

223
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,240
You got it. I’ll take care of that.

224
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,640
And for me...

225
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,680
I’ll go check out the Inspector’s desk.

226
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,200
He might hide something in there.

227
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,760
Let’s go.

228
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,560
(Excited  Sound)

229
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,720
Geez, too many people here. What to do now?

230
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,080
I have a plan.

231
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,360
Hey, listen up!

232
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,960
There’s a meat ball vending stall in front of our building.

233
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,800
It’s Thongthai’s treat.

234
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,120
Don’t you want to grab some?

235
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,240
Hurry up or it’ll be sold out soon.

236
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,960
Enjoy eating.

237
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
You’re really something.

238
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,120
I told you.

239
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,120
Bingo!

240
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,760
Baby, are you done?

241
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Bingo!

242
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,440
Hey.

243
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,360
Where are you guys going?

244
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,800
To Tharn’s place.

245
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,960
He forgot something at the office. I’ll drop by and give it to him.

246
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,720
Um

247
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,800
- Let’s go.	    /    - Let’s go.

248
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,400
Singh has looked into Chart’s record.

249
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,880
After he failed the test, he didn’t go back to work with his unit.

250
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,440
But what’s strange is, he still hasn’t filed for a resignation as a police officer.

251
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,280
His work record has also been wiped out completely.

252
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,640
I tried to get some information from his police colleagues,
but no one knows his whereabout.

253
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,560
It’s quite similar to what happened to Lieut Tam.

254
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,800
And to Inspector’s older brother too.

255
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,520
Their record as a police officer were wiped out clean.

256
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,760
As for me,

257
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,880
I’ve checked the CCTV cameras at the club.

258
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,800
Everything was also deleted.

259
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,840
This is really strange.

260
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,880
It’s as if someone is cleaning up after Chart’s mess so that there’ll be no traces of him.

261
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,320
Khem and I sneaked in to search the Inspector’s desk.

262
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,720
We found a file containing a prisnor’s record.

263
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,800
It’s a record of Khom, Montree’s right-hand man.

264
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,360
Look at his right wrist.

265
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,600
The spider tattoo.

266
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,240
They are the same.

267
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,880
So, I looked into Khom’s record.

268
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,880
While he was still in jail, the one who bailed him out was Montree.

269
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,760
I also looked into old cases.

270
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,400
Turns out every Montree’s lackey who used to be in jail has this spider tattoo.

271
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,640
Tharn said he saw a spider tattoo on Chart’s wrist.

272
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,880
Does this mean Chart is also one of Montree’s lackeys?

273
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,960
Tharn.

274
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,720
Maybe what you told me…

275
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,480
about your parents’ case and also Lieut Tam’s and Kao’s cases,

276
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,480
is Montree the one behind all these?

277
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,400
Inspector already knew.

278
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,160
Why didn’t he tell us then?

279
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,320
Why trying to keep it a secret from us?

280
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,040
Oh!

281
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,280
Maybe, Inspector is also one of Montree’s people...

282
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,280
who helps taking care of things inside the unit.

283
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,440
Well, it was just an idea.

284
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,120
The most dangerous person is the one closest to us.

285
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,040
Like a plot from ‘Secret Crush On You The Series’.

286
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,040
Or ‘GAP The Series’.

287
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,520
You see? Such a plot twist, isn’t it?

288
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,960
Hey, where are you going?

289
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,000
I’m going to see the Inspector.

290
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,000
No, you’re not.

291
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,000
You’ll only upset him and make things worse.

292
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,920
What if you get suspensed longer?

293
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,920
I’m not going to argue with him.

294
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,000
I’ll just want to ask him about my father.

295
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,760
I promise I’ll behave.

296
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,200
See? I told you.

297
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,200
Like a scene in ‘Secret Crush On You The Series’.

298
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,960
And ‘GAP The Series’.

299
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,520
Exactly the same.

300
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,760
You’re still suspended. Why are you here?

301
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,200
I need to ask you about something, Inspector.

302
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,800
Do you know my father?

303
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:09,280
My father used to tell me that he planned to adopt a younger brother of his junior officer who died in line of duty as his son.

304
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,640
But that boy turned down the offer.

305
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,160
So, my father could only support him for his education.

306
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,040
The boy I’m talking about is you, isn’t it?

307
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,600
Yes, it is.

308
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,400
Then why didn’t you tell me you know my father?

309
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:42,000
Or is it because you’re still mad at my father for taking care of your brother’s case?

310
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,720
Your brother, Captain Itt, commited a breach of discipline.

311
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,040
He bribed Montree.

312
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,480
And chose to kill himself instead of serving his punishment.

313
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,960
My brother was innocent.

314
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,280
So was my father.

315
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,520
He was also innocent.

316
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,880
And I, too, believe that your brother was also innocent.

317
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:18,840
My father used to tell me that your brother was a good cop -- a very honest man.

318
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,560
If I have a chance again, I want to be a good cop like your brother, Inspector.

319
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,280
But why do you have to keep it a secret from me?
Why keeping information about the case and Montree to yourself?

320
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,320
Everything that I know up to now is nothing but the truth.

321
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,840
You want to know the truth about your brother’s case.

322
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,440
I also want to know the truth about my father’s case.

323
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,680
I don’t trust anyone in this unit. I can’t trust anyone.

324
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:02,040
On the day your father died, he got a hand on the evidence
about where Montree and his gang smuggled in drugs

325
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,680
But while he was on the way back to the unit, an accident occured.

326
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,280
I didn’t believe it was a coincidence.

327
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,600
So, I kept digging into this case.

328
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,480
Until I found out that your father was betrayed by someone in his unit.

329
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,280
Do you know who that person is?

330
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,440
Your father’s team leader.

331
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,800
That’s why I have to do it secretly.

332
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,840
The investigation must be done surreptitiously.

333
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,640
That’s why I couldn’t tell anyone about it.

334
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,840
You asked me why I didn’t tell you that I know your father.

335
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,920
It’s because I’m sure...

336
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
that if someone or anyone in our unit has found out about this,

337
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,440
you will be in danger.

338
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,840
Is there anything else that you want to know?

339
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,120
Tharn, maybe you should go back first.

340
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,680
Go and get yourself together.

341
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,680
About the case and everything that happened,

342
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:08,360
I’ll tell you everything that you want to know once you’re back to work.

343
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
Yes, Inspector.

344
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,560
How are you doing?

345
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,240
I’m doing well, Luangpor.

346
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,080
I hope you’re feeling well too.

347
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,480
I am. How long are you going to stay this time?

348
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,400
Where are you staying?

349
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,000
We’ll stay here for a week.

350
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,800
We’re staying at Tharn’s grandmother’s place.

351
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,040
Phaya told me that it’s very cozy and beautiful there.

352
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:10,960
Yes, the view around there is very scenic. It’s close to the forest and waterfall too.

353
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,560
It’s good that you go and stay with your grandmother so that you can also take care of her.

354
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,480
She’s very worried about you.

355
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,960
You never call and let her know how you are.

356
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,720
Tharn, can you take me to the waterfall after this?

357
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,560
Don’t trouble him any further.

358
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,560
We are already staying at his place.

359
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,000
It’s all right, Grandma.

360
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,680
I’ll be her personal tour guide and take her around.

361
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,720
Phaya and Tharn, come and give me a hand.

362
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,480
I want to give all of you the holy threads to help protect you from the danger. Let’s go.

363
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,320
Yes, Luangpor.

364
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,240
Here are the holy threads.

365
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,200
Make sure all of you wear it.

366
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,680
Thank you

367
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,160
How are you feeling now? Have you fully recovered?

368
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,560
I feel much better now, thank you.

369
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,080
Luangpor.

370
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,040
Do you know where Chalothorn is?

371
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,680
He seems to disappeared after the incident.

372
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,440
He didn’t call or come to see Tharn at all.

373
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,800
I couldn’t come into contact with his spirit in my meditation either.

374
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,680
He’s probably severely hurt.

375
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,240
You must stay close to Tharn and take a good care of him.

376
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,520
The Naga Fireball Festival is near.

377
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,840
Chalothorn will regain his power and become even more powerful.

378
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:08,520
one day before the 15th night of the 11th waxing moon.

379
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,520
Maybe, both of you should come stay with me...

380
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,440
- Okay, I’ll let Tharn know about his.
- Good.

381
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,960
Hurry up and go home before it’ll get dark.

382
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,080
Tharn.

383
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,600
We’d get going then, Luangpor.

384
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,960
Good luck to you all.

385
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,840
- Hello, Grandma.
- Hello, dear.

386
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,360
- Do you want to hug?
- Give me a hug first.

387
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,880
Hmmmm

388
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,720
Look who are here with me.

389
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,360
Oh, hello there.

390
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,600
- Hello.
- Oh my goodness! Long time no see.

391
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,000
- How are you doing?
- I’m good, thank you.

392
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,400
Welcome, all of you.

393
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,320
Let’s get inside. It’s quite hot right here.

394
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,640
Please come in.

395
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,080
Let’s go.

396
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,120
The Bael juice. I made it myself.

397
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,520
- How is it?
- It’s very tasty. Makes me feel fresh.

398
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,320
- If you like it, I’ll make it for you every day.
- Oh, please don’t bother.

399
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,520
Our grandmas are quite the same.

400
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,720
If you compliment on her food or tell her that you like to eat anything, she’d cook it for you every day.

401
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,960
Recently, I had to eat a green curry for a whole week!

402
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,480
I’ve been having Egg and Pork in Sweet Brown Sauce for two weeks.

403
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,440
My face is getting so round.

404
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,680
Let’s go.

405
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,040
Tharn told me that you own a wood processing plant.

406
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,440
That’s right.

407
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,360
It belongs to our family. Our main products are wooden furnitures.

408
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,160
These tables and cabinets are all my design.

409
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,800
Wow.

410
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,920
Really?

411
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,040
- Of course.
- You’re so talented.

412
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,200
Grandma, do you know that she was also very adventurous when she was younger?

413
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,840
She even went into the wood to supervise the workers herself.

414
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,199
I didn’t have any choice.

415
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,760
My son wanted to become a police officer.

416
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,120
And my only grandson, whom I hoped would take care of our business,
also decided to walk in his father’s footsteps.

417
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,080
Oh, Phaya is like that too.

418
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,040
He didn’t want to help me take care of the family business.

419
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,960
He just wants to become a cop. Now, he’s finally one.

420
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,080
This one is really something too.

421
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,360
He secretly sneaked out and applied for the exam. He didn’t tell me anything.

422
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,440
Quite a handful he is. I wonder if I’ve been raising up a boy or a monkey.

423
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,320
That’s what I’m thinking too.

424
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,480
Phaya is quite the same. He’s so stubborn. He never listens to anyone.

425
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,000
- I’m afraid both of your grandsons are surely monkeys.
- Yes, indeed.

426
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,640
(Laughing)

427
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,920
Seems like your grandma and mine can get along really well.

428
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,440
Did I make the right choice introducing them to each other?

429
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,560
Miss, the food is now ready.

430
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,840
Oh, okay then. Let’s eat, shall we?

431
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,320
The food is fresh from the oven.

432
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,800
Then you can take a shower later.

433
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,160
- Oh, that’s right. Phaya.
- Yes?

434
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,040
I’m afraid you have to sleep in Tharn’s room tonight.

435
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,400
Do you mind?

436
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,960
Not at all.

437
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,600
Okay

438
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,560
I’ll go and tidy up the room for you.

439
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,400
Then make it quick. Hurry up and come down for your meal, okay?

440
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,360
Yes, Grandma.

441
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,040
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

442
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:21,840
While we were still at the camp, you told me you’ve lived with the Abbot since when you were a kid.

443
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,400
The Abbot is someone that my family respects.

444
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,760
Since my parents passed away,

445
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,560
the Abbot told my grandma that I am bound to make my loved ones die.

446
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,080
So, he asked my grandma to let me stay with him at the temple.

447
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,520
I didn’t have anyone then...

448
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,480
apart from my grandma.

449
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,640
So, I decided to take the offer and lived with the Abbot ever since.

450
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,240
My grandma often came to visit me.

451
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,080
Do you have to stay with him for the rest of your life?

452
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,400
I don’t know.

453
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,280
I want to move back to live with my grandma.

454
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,480
I plan to do that after I’m done with my father’s case.

455
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,440
I’m going to quit my job and stay with her.

456
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,880
I want to look after her, to show her my gratitude for raising me up.

457
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,320
At least you got to stay with your parents for a while.

458
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,520
And shared wonderful memories with them.

459
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,480
Honestly, I don’t remember much about my father.

460
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,360
Growing up, I only saw him dedicated himself in work as a police officer.

461
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,520
Until his last breath, he died because he was a cop.

462
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,840
They’re probably looking at you from above.

463
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,240
I hope so too.

464
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,320
I want my parents to see...

465
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,600
when I can finally put the person who killed them behind bars.

466
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,720
Sir,

467
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,360
please don’t worry about Tharn.

468
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,800
I’m going to take care of him for you.

469
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,880
I’m going to arrest the killer who took your life.

470
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,760
Thank you.

471
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,560
Let’s go put your things in the room.

472
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,840
Okay.

473
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,800
Hello, Yai.

474
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,680
I have good news.

475
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,680
Ning agrees to be our witness.

476
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,200
Really?

477
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,560
She told us she found a flash drive that Kao kept as an evidence.

478
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,680
Inspector and our team are on their way to see Ning at her place.

479
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,520
Call me as soon as you get anything new, okay?

480
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,680
Okay. Are you at your grandma’s place?

481
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,320
Yeah.

482
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,760
Please take care, okay?

483
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,880
Okay. Say hi to the Abbot for me.

484
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,680
And tell him I’ll go visit him after the case is done.

485
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
I have to go.

486
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,080
Okay.

487
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,560
I hope the evidence we get from Ning will be solid enough to arrest Montree.

488
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,920
Hey, any update from Yai?

489
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,840
No.

490
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,160
Don’t worry, he will call you if there’s anything important.

491
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,520
Ouch.

492
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
(Strangling / Gasping for breath)

493
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,040
Tharn! What’s wrong?

494
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,480
Did you have a vision?

495
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,600
Yes, Korn is going to kill Ning.

496
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,960
(Incoming call)

497
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,520
Hello, Tharn.

498
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,760
Hello, Yai.

499
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,360
I saw a vision where Khom was going to kill Ning.

500
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,680
What? Khom is going to kill Ning?

501
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,400
(Crying)

502
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,160
How did he know Khom is going to kill Ning?

503
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,760
I’ll explain it to you later, Inspector.

504
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,880
But he’s never been wrong  with his information.

505
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,840
How do you know Khom is going to kill Ning?

506
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,160
Please trust me, Inspector.

507
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,640
Don’t question me anything right now.

508
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,760
Hurry up and go to Ning’s place first. I’m begging you.

509
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,920
You can go now. I’ll take if from now on.

510
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,480
(Commotion outside the house)

511
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,720
All clear.

512
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,120
Okay.

513
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,520
Just run a red light, Khem.

514
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,240
Yes, sir.

515
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,560
Ouch!

516
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,280
(Screaming in fright)

517
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,840
Who are you?

518
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,560
Why are you here? Get out!

519
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,120
(Screaming)

520
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,520
(Screaming in pain)

521
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,760
That’s Ning’s house. Hurry up.

522
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,480
Okay.

523
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,120
I’m sorry, Inspector.

524
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,240
You can’t go in there.

525
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,040
Please stop.

526
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,080
You can’t go in there.

527
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,760
You can’t go in there.

528
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,840
Hold on.

529
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,480
Ning

530
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,000
Inspector.

531
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,040
She’s dead.

532
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,080
Commander, the witness is dead.

533
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,520
What should we do?

534
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,760
If we don’t do something, they will have this case closed soon.

535
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,560
Montree is definitely behind this.

536
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,600
Go find the evidence that Ning wanted to give to us.

537
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,080
- Go!    /    - Yes, sir.

538
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,120
Ouch!

539
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,800
Who are you?

540
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,800
Why are you here? Get out!

541
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,720
Yes.

542
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,640
Yes.

543
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,560
Yes, sir.

544
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,960
You and your men should leave, Inspector.

545
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,120
This case is no longer your responsibility.

546
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,840
What?

547
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,840
What do you mean?

548
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,320
You and your team are removed from this case.

549
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,520
- What do you mean?
- You can’t do that!

550
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,360
We’ve been on this case since the very beginning.

551
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,440
- The victim is also our prime witness.
- That’s enough!

552
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,200
Follow your order.

553
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,200
Yes, sir.

554
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,720
Let’s go.

555
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,440
What did you say?

556
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,880
Ning is dead?

557
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,360
Dammit!

558
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,600
She did leave us any evidence.

559
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,080
But we still couldn’t help her!

560
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,160
How many times do I have to face something like this?!

561
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,760
Tharn, please calm down.

562
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,200
The one who should feel sorry is Montree, not you.

563
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,520
Once you get back to work, you can help make her soul rest in peace...

564
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,600
by arresting the one who killed her.

565
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,320
M’Lady!

566
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,440
M’Lady!

567
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,280
M’Lady! We’ve got a problem!

568
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,280
What’s going on, Tong?

569
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,600
Our workers who’ve gone into the woods to collect wild products.

570
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,680
They were eaten by the tiger-man.

571
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,000
A tiger-man?

572
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,880
That’s right.

573
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:54,920
Careful!

574
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,400
What happened, Kham?

575
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,520
Joe and Kai went across the border into the woods in Laos to collect wild products

576
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,240
Kai got eaten by the tiger-man.

577
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,840
What?!

578
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,200
A tiger-man is not real.

579
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,240
What would you know?

580
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,880
It is real.

581
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,880
If you don’t believe it, then don’t distrepect it.

582
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,320
I’m not disrespecting it.

583
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,680
Where’s the body of that worker?

584
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,400
Joe said it was aleady taken by the tiger-man.

585
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,520
It took the body and ate it up.

586
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,080
The, the, the...the tiger-man took Kai’s body away.

587
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,880
Singh, play it.

588
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,120
Yes, sir.

589
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,240
Gather as many artworks as you can.

590
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,120
This time is going to be a big lot.

591
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,160
Okay.

592
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,400
But I will have to increase the price this time.

593
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,400
Can you help talk to the Minister for me, Khom?

594
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,160
You’ll see him tomorrow anyway.

595
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,000
Tell him yourself then.

596
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,120
Once you get all the artworks, send them to the warehouse in Nongkai.

597
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,960
Nongkai?

598
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,000
(Incoming message)

599
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,880
[Montree is heading to NongKai, where the NongKai forest produces medicine along the Mekong River.]

600
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,760
Montree.

601
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,480
You won’t get away this time.

602
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,040
idolfactory

603
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,920
I want to know why Tharn knew Ning was going to be killed.

604
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,480
I want someone who knows the route that Joe and Kai took.

605
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,960
They don’t believe that Kai was eaten by a tiger-man.

606
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,400
Why did you call Chalothorn?

607
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,280
Phaya.

608
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,440
This is my family’s matter, let me handle it.

609
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,680
Am I not the one you love?

610
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,080
What did he do to you? Why do you hate him so much?

611
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,520
Because he’s the Naga!

612
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,440
(Gunshot)

613
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,080
Hey!

614
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,760
(Gunshot)

615
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,120
Watch out!

616
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,280
Shit!

617
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:41,400
