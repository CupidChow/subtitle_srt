00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,600
Let’s finish your work.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,600
I know you’ve always wanted to do it.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,840
Hello, Mr. Montree.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,320
I finally get to meet you, Mr. Art.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,120
- What did you do to Kao? What did you do?
- Stop.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,560
You didn’t mean it.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,880
I didn’t do it.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,040
He’s not the culprit.

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,880
Found the bloodstain.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,760
Can we release Art?

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,880
He has nothing to do with Kao’s disappearance.

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,280
No use to keep being persistent.

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,400
Better let them live together happily. Don’t get in the way.

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,440
But if I really love someone, I’m willing to waste my time, Phaya.

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,360
Tharn, I’m going to do everything to have you by my side.

17
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,479
Please stop.

18
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,560
If you keep doing this, your soul will be destroyed one day.

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,040
He messes with what is mine.

20
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,800
He has to die!

21
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,240
Nothing ever belongs to you, you are well aware of that.

22
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,840
Tharn didn’t choose you.

23
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,880
The worst sin in life is to think only about oneself.

24
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,200
This love full of selfishness that you’re trying hold on to...

25
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,680
will eventually burn you to hell.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,520
I don’t care.

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,640
I will never let them be together.

28
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,200
Tharn has to be with me, and I will make them parted for eternity.

29
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,120
Tharn, wake up.

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,120
Tharn.

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,440
Wake up.

32
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,200
Phaya!

33
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,480
Hey!

34
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,640
What happened?

35
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,200
Are you okay?

36
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,840
Yeah.

37
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Did you have a bad dream again?

38
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,480
Yeah.

39
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,440
In that dream, someone was trying to strangle me.

40
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,680
It was so real.

41
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,680
I think you should wear this necklace while you sleep.

42
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,440
Okay.

43
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,520
I’m all right now. Let’s go back to sleep.

The Sign

61
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,640
What you saw isn’t a dream.

62
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,680
It’s your karma.

63
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,120
What I saw in the dream is acutally my karma?

64
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,400
Tharn, that doctor you’re getting a treatment from…

65
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,240
Better keep these two people away from each other.

66
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,440
Don’t let them meet.

67
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,000
Hello, Luangpor.

68
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,040
Tharn.

69
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
I need your advice on something.

70
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,360
Okay.

71
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,520
Wake up, Tharn.

72
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,200
It wasn’t just your voice that I heard.

73
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,640
I also heard someone else’s voice.

74
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,480
That person was screaming in pain.

75
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,200
The voice sounded so familiar.

76
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,680
Bounded by a chain of karma and the ego that knows no end,
he is coming back to reclaim what once belonged to him.

77
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,080
What do you mean by that?

78
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,920
Tharn, you and Phaya must be more careful during these days.

79
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:35,520
Always be mindful. The danger can occur in any moment.

80
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,960
What danger, Luangpor?

81
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,520
You both will face a serious problem.

82
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,960
Stay mindful and use your wisdom.

83
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,720
Remember, your good deeds and merits will always protect you.

84
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,880
Also, try to stay away from the river.

85
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,880
Because it’s where he lives.

86
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,640
Yes, Luangpor.

87
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,080
[Phaya: I already put your clothes in a washer.]

88
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
[Phaya: You can wear my clothes to work today.]

89
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,120
[Phaya: Hurry up and get dressed then come down for breakfast.]

90
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,320
Hey.

91
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Does it fit? I think it’s a little too big.

92
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,360
It’s okay.

93
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,880
I made you a sandwich. Try it.

94
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,160
Go on. I want to know if you like it or not.

95
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,480
Where is your Grandma?

96
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
I want to say goodbye to her before we go to work.

97
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,200
My sister took her to see a friend.

98
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,360
Do you want sugar?

99
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
I’ll have two of that.

100
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,800
Two?

101
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,200
Hmm

102
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,120
Why did you kiss me?

103
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,840
Well, you said you wanted two of that.

104
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,160
So, I just gave you my sweetest kisses. Do you want more?

105
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,400
Quit it. I meant the sugar.

106
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,400
If you keep eating like that, you’ll get diabetes soon.

107
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,360
Better have my sweet kiss instead. It’s good for your health.

108
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,480
Whatever, I don’t want it anymore.

109
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,400
Aww

110
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,400
By the way, I just talked to the Abbot.

111
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,640
I told him about your bad dream.

112
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
He asked me to warn you...

113
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,360
to try to stay away from the river.

114
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,640
But can I stay close to you then?

115
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,760
Quit fooling around. I’m being serious.

116
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,040
It might have something to do with why you had a bad dream last night.

117
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,840
But it’s just a dream after all. Don’t worry too much.

118
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,400
Or maybe, it might be because I decided to be with you.

119
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,360
Hey, stop that. It’s totally unrelated.

120
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,000
I already told you, haven’t I? That I’ll always be by your side.

121
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,360
Well, if you’re that worried,

122
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,920
why don’t you move in with me  so that we can be together all the time?

123
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,160
Wanna do that?

124
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,840
No.

125
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,080
I’ll let you say it again.

126
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,680
No.

127
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,760
But my bed is so soft. You had already tried it last night.

128
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,520
Ouch.

129
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,680
What are you doing?

130
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,400
It’s a mess now.

131
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,440
Hurry up and finish your breakfast so that we can go to work.

132
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,120
I know that.

133
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,400
Stop smiling like a fool.

134
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:27,040
(Boxing)

135
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
Wooo

136
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
(Boxing)

137
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,720
Wooo

138
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,040
Hmmmm

139
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,320
Just give up, Babe.

140
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,120
You can’t beat me.

141
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,520
If you don’t let me win, then let’s break up.

142
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,680
Oh...

143
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,560
I lost.

144
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,080
Not like this. Get up.

145
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,480
(Laughing)

146
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,680
Ouch!

147
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,480
- You won.
- Hey.

148
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,760
There you are. Why didn’t you pick up my call?

149
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,320
Why didn’t you pick up my call last night?

150
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,920
Are you working today?

151
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,040
I thought you’d take a day off.

152
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,520
Hewwww

153
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,920
I’m not sick. Why should I take a day off?

154
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,840
Well, I thought you’d go on a honeymoon...

155
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,760
since last night...

156
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
you slept at Phaya’s place, didn’t you?

157
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,840
Hey!

158
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,160
That’s right.

159
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,400
How did you know?

160
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,640
I had dinner around your flat last night. I wanted to drop by your place to give you some snacks...

161
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,200
but you didn’t pick up my call.

162
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,680
I went to your room and rang the bell but no one answered it.

163
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,360
So, I figured out you might not be home.

164
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,640
And then I saw you two coming to work together.

165
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,960
It was so obvious.

166
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,080
Yeah.

167
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,080
You’re also wearing an oversized shrit.

168
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,960
It must be Phaya’s.

169
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,000
Hooo

170
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,720
It’s pretty obvious. Just admit it.

171
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,400
Come on. Just say it.

172
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,520
From what I’ve analysed,

173
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,840
our suspect seems to be lying. He tries to avoid our gaze and is also stuttering.

174
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,600
(Laughing)

175
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,680
- Yeah, stuttering indeed.
- Ouch.

176
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,160
- Stuttering, you said?
- Ouch.

177
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,960
Stuttering my arse.

178
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Babe, help me. I was just making fun of him a bit.

179
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,440
- Ouch!
- Ouch!

180
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,200
That’s enough.

181
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,800
Yes, he slept at my place.

182
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,320
My grandma and my sister wanted to thank him and treat him for dinner.

183
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,920
Thank him for what?

184
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,360
For loving me...

185
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,040
For every time that you hug me...

186
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,160
- Hug you?
- Ouch.

187
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,080
Babe, help me.

188
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,040
Help!

189
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,360
Give it to me.

190
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,320
Here, let me help.

191
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:02,560
- I’ll help you.
- Ouch.

192
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,160
I’m glad to see you smile like that again.

193
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,319
And to have someone by your side.

194
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,599
Phaya.

195
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,760
What?

196
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,400
Take care of my bro for me.

197
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,040
Me too.

198
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,040
You too, what?

199
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,200
Please take care of my body too.

200
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,480
Your body? Okay.

201
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,680
Come, Tongthai.

202
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,920
- Your body?
- Ouch.

203
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,320
- One more.
- Ouch.

204
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,760
Make it two.

205
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,840
- Two more?
- Okay.

206
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
You got it.

207
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,240
Ouch! Ouch!

208
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,480
Hey, guys!

209
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,120
Hey!

210
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,480
Inspector has called for a meeting about Kao’s case.

211
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,880
- Hey!
- Hey!

212
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,000
This morning, the bank called to confirm they had detected a new transaction on Kao’s credit card.

213
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,680
But the person who used it isn’t Kao.

214
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,800
It’s a teenage boy who is around 20 years old.

215
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,920
He told us he went there to find some fish.

216
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,560
And found Kao’s wallet in the swamp.

217
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,240
Where’s this swamp?

218
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,680
6km away from where Kao got off the taxi.

219
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,280
We’ve checked via the satelltie.

220
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,120
It’s a deserted forest with no residences nearby.

221
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,120
Just a forest and the swamp where the wallet was found.

222
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,000
What was Kao doing there?

223
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,760
Phaya, Tharn, and Yai. Go find more evidence at the swamp.

224
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,000
Tongthai and Kem, go to Ning’s place.

225
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,760
Make her talk more about Kao.

226
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,680
Ask her if Kao has any sibling or relative that he can rely on.

227
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,080
Someone he really trusts that he can stay with them.

228
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,360
Yes, sir.

229
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,240
Found anything?

230
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,320
Not yet.

231
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,280
We haven’t seen any residence in this area.

232
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,080
Why would Kao come here?

233
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,600
Or did he come here to meet that person he was talking to on the phone?

234
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,800
The taxi driver also said that Kao asked to get off after he hung up.

235
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,920
At a place like this? It’s probably not something good.

236
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,240
Let’s split up and look around the swamp.

237
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,360
We might get more evidence from there.

238
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Okay.

239
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,840
I tried to interview those people but still didn’t get anything new.

240
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,120
Phaya! Phaya!

241
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,520
Tharn, what’s wrong?

242
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,080
You’d better get out of here.

243
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,520
Why?

244
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,280
Don’t you remember what the Abbot has warned you?

245
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,640
That you should stay away from the river.

246
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,000
Go and wait outside.

247
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,520
Yai and I will take care of it here.

248
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,280
I don’t want anything to happen to you.

249
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,920
I’ll be fine. You’re here with me.

250
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,960
You’ve seen a lot of visions where I was supposed to be dead.

251
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,240
But I’m still alive.

252
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,400
I trust you that you’d be able to take care of me.

253
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,800
And I want you to trust me too.

254
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,800
So what?

255
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,880
I’m not leaving you.

256
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,000
Promise me...

257
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,480
that you won’t go anywhere.

258
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,000
Okay.

259
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,240
Now, I wish my wife were a cop too.

260
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,440
So that I would get some romantic scene like this.

261
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,480
(Shutter sound)

262
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,080
(Coughing)

263
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,840
Oh, that one was mine.

264
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,480
I’m sorry.

265
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,120
The tide is quite stable now.

266
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,320
Let’s have the divers go look under the water again.

267
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,720
Yes, sir.

268
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,920
Where should we start?

269
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,520
(Incoming call)

270
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,640
Hi, Doc.

271
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,840
Oh, I’m working.

272
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,280
Hello?

273
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,960
Hello? The signal isn’t quite good here.

274
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,240
Hello? Can you hear me?

275
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,280
Yes.

276
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,560
I went there to discuss about the case.

277
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,640
It was quite late so I just slept there.

278
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,640
That’s good.

279
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,800
Let’s start.

280
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,680
Okay.

281
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,400
Yes.

282
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,840
Divers, please get ready.

283
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,840
เฮ้ย

284
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,800
I’ll go see you after my work is done.

285
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,040
I have something to talk to you.

286
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,880
See you.

287
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,040
That way.

288
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,360
Come quick!

289
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,600
Tharn!

290
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,400
Tharn! Where are you?

291
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,360
Tharn!

292
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,760
Tharn!

293
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,240
Tharn!

294
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,960
What’s he doing?

295
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,880
Tharn!

296
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Tharn!

297
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,600
Tharn! Tharn!

298
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,480
Tharn! Tharn!

299
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,920
Tharn! What are you doing?

300
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,920
I’m glad we meet again.

301
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Who are you?

302
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
Where is this place?

303
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,920
How did I get here?

304
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,160
You were here before.

305
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,800
Don’t you remember?

306
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,200
I was here?

307
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,840
I have been waiting for so long to meet you.

308
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,160
To make amends to what I have done wrong to you...

309
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,800
and Wansarut.

310
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,600
Do you know Wansarut?

311
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,560
She is my younger sister.

312
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,920
And also your lover.

313
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,280
Today, you will know all the truth about your past.

314
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,120
Master Garuda.

315
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,680
Garuda?

316
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,720
Argh!

317
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,120
Why does it hurt so much?!

318
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,120
Arghh!
You’re being constricted by the Naga like that Garuda.

319
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,600
Arghhh!
You can also feel his pain...

320
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,880
because you and that Garuda...

321
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,480
is one and the same.

322
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,240
(Crying in pain)
Arghh!

323
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,120
That damn doctor.

324
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,200
He is Prince Chalothorn.

325
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,480
The ruler of Naga city.

326
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,160
And also your enemy of love.

327
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,880
You were injured from your fight with Chalothorn and then you met my sister.

328
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,800
Ouch!

329
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,960
Ouch!

330
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,040
Ouch!

331
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,600
Ouch!

332
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,240
That's my sister Wansarut.

333
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,080
My sister felt sorry for you

334
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,240
so she brought you to her place in secret so that she could treat you.

335
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,880
Why did you help me?

336
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,800
Because you were still alive.

337
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,960
Once you’ve regained your strength,

338
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,640
get out of this place as soon as you can.

339
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,200
Ouch!

340
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,560
Don’t touch me!

341
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,840
Thank you.

342
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,520
I will repay you when I can.

343
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,680
Can you repay it now?

344
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,720
What do you want?

345
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,320
Can you and your kind stop hunting us?

346
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,840
Can’t we just live our separate lives?

347
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,480
Ouch!

348
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,800
If Chalothorn hadn’t attacked us first,

349
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,720
then we wouldn’t have to hurt you and your kind.

350
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,920
I don’t want to argue with you.

351
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,920
Get well soon.

352
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,160
And leave.

353
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,680
Ouch!

354
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,920
Is this the cause of vengeance between the Naga and the Garuda?

355
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,640
In the past, Naga and Garuda were siblings.

356
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,920
But due to a serious controversy and also jealousy, it escalated into a war between bloodlines.

357
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,280
I haven’t visited the human world for quite some time.

358
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,160
Have you come down to visit here lately?

359
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,360
The human world?

360
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,600
Long before I was born,

361
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,880
there was a legend told about a Naga...

362
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,320
who disguised itself as a man in order to become a monk.

363
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:43,240
One night while that Naga was asleep and revealed its true self,

364
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,720
the Buddha asked it to leave the monkhood…

365
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,880
since it was not a human creature and couldn’t be ordained to become a monk.

366
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,280
Later on, when the Buddha came down from the second heaven where Indra dwells...

367
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,800
after visiting his mother for one whole season,

368
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,200
all the Nagas and Naginis as well as their attendants…

369
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,560
had brought their offerings and breathed out fire to pay respect to the Buddha...

370
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,200
on his return to the human world on the 15th night of the 11th waxing moon.

371
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,760
There...look at that.

372
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,920
Beautiful, isn’t it?

373
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,560
Yes.

374
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,680
So beautiful.

375
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,719
But in the end,

376
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,560
everything was ruined because of me.

377
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,360
Because of my jealousy...

378
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,679
for wanting Master Chalothorn for my own.

379
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,360
So, I set up a plan...

380
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,120
and made it look like Wansarut was poisoned to death.

381
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,360
Then I would take her to you.

382
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,040
But then...

383
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,320
nothing ever escaped the eyes and ears of Master Chalothorn.

384
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,639
You tried to take Wansarut away.

385
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,880
But you were caught by Chalothorn.

386
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,840
Wansarut! Wansarut! Where are you?

387
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,920
Wansarut!

388
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,480
Wansarut! Where are you?

389
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,880
Wansarut!

390
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,240
Wansarut!

391
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,560
Wansarut!

392
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,040
Where are you?

393
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,120
Wansarut!

394
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,440
Wansarut!

395
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,760
Wansarut!

396
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,640
Master Garuda, what are you doing here?

397
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,120
You would be in danger if you are seen.

398
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,920
I’m worried about you. Where have you been?

399
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,800
This is my home.

400
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,520
Do not worry about me.

401
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,760
Please go.

402
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,760
No.

403
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,240
You have to come with me.
You can’t be here.

404
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,320
I can’t go with you.

405
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,480
Can’t you see...

406
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,120
what a war caused by your brother has destroyed?

407
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,040
I don’t want anyone to die because of me.

408
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,080
No, you have to come with me.

409
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,560
You can’t be here.
Please go back.

410
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,440
Nobody is going anywhere.

411
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,640
(Fighting)

412
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,800
(Fighting)

413
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
(Fighting)

414
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,680
(Fighting)

415
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,200
Stop it!

416
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,280
Ouch!

417
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,120
Please stop, Master Chalothorn.

418
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,080
(Fighting)

419
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,240
(Fighting)

420
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,680
Stop!

421
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Master Chalothorn.

422
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,320
I will stay with you.

423
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,520
Please let Master Garuda go.

424
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,800
I’m not going anywhere.

425
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,440
No...don’t do that.

426
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,400
Master Chalothorn.

427
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,640
Return Nagini to me!

428
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,200
No.

429
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,760
She is mine.

430
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,240
You should let her go.

431
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,560
She doesn’t love you.

432
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,080
I don’t care. Whether she loves me or not, she must stay with me.

433
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,800
Not with someone like you.

434
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,040
You are Nagini.

435
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,320
Garuda and Nagini can’t be together.

436
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,440
What we have between Wansarut and I...

437
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,800
is pure love and affection.

438
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,680
Why do we have to create a condition or boundary for our love?

439
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,120
Love has no right or wrong.

440
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,440
I will prove to you...

441
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,000
that a Garuda like me...

442
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,520
can also love Wansarut.

443
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,440
(Fighting)

444
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,520
Wansarut!

445
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,160
No!

446
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,800
No!

447
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,360
Wansarut!

448
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,040
Wansarut!

449
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,600
Wansarut!

450
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,520
Sorry...

451
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,520
I’m sorry.

452
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,600
Garuda,

453
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,000
I might not be able to be with you in this life.

454
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,000
But in my other next lives,

455
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,360
I only wish to be right next to you.

456
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,760
And I will always take care of you.

457
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,680
I promise you.

458
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,760
If our next lives do exist,

459
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,640
I will keep looking for you...

460
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,720
until my last breath.

461
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,080
Arrrrrh

462
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,960
Arrrrrh

463
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,200
Wansarut!

464
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,400
Wansarut felt so guilty for being the cause of your death.

465
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,880
So, she decided to cough out her own soul…

466
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,120
to save your life.

467
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,240
But she was so weak.

468
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,680
And wasn’t able to help you.

469
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,280
Still, she had made a wish before losing her last breath.

470
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,000
What does all this have to do with me?

471
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,240
I didn’t take Wansarut from Chalotorn.

472
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,080
I didn’t even know your sister.

473
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,080
No matter how many lives have passed, you and my sister will always find each other.

474
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,960
Even now, you and my sister are still in love with each other.

475
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,080
I don’t love your sister anymore.

476
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,000
I already have someone else that I love.

477
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,240
His name is Tharn.

478
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,120
That Wansarut you used to love...

479
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,480
is Tharn.

480
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,680
You and Wansarut are destined to meet in every life…

481
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,160
but never be able to be together...

482
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,320
because Master Chalothorn will always be there to obstruct you.

483
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,040
And kill you.

484
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,720
But he’s also unable to do so because you have the soul of Naga with you.

485
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,440
The one that my sister gave you.

486
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,880
The soul of Naga?

487
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,600
It’s that necklace Wansarut gave you.

488
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,800
Never remove it.

489
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,120
(Wind sound)

490
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,280
Master Chalothorn must have known already...

491
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,280
that I am here to see you.

492
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,920
And tell you everything.

493
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,000
On this 15th night of the 11th waxing moon, you must protect my sister.

494
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,680
Do not let Master Chalothorn take her away.

495
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,160
Otherwise you and my sister...

496
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,360
will be parted...forever.

497
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,800
Wait! Wanwisa! Wait!

498
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,400
Wait!

499
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,520
Ouch!

500
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,960
Ouch!

501
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,960
It’s really Kao

502
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,680
Judging from his body,

503
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,760
he must be killed somewhere else and dumped here.

504
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,800
[Phaya: Lieut Tam didn’t tie this knot on his ankles by himself.]

505
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,880
The knot is at the back. This means someone tied it for him.

506
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,680
That’s right.

507
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,120
Excuse me?

508
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,320
Tharn.

509
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,160
The knot on his ankles...

510
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,160
looks exactly like the one on Lieut Tam’s body.

511
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,600
These two cases must be related.

512
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,600
(Raining)

513
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,600
Ouch!

514
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,640
Help! Help!

515
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,520
Hey!

516
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,800
I’d like to inform IDF unit...

517
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,400
that we’ve found Kao’s body.

518
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,520
Hey!

519
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,640
Stop!

520
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,480
Hey!

521
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,840
Stop!

522
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,000
Put your hands up!

523
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,520
Turn around slowly.

524
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,440
(Gunshot)

525
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,400
(Gunshot)

526
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,800
(Gunshot)

527
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,240
(Gunshot)

528
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,400
(Fighting)

529
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,200
(Gunshot)

530
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,600
(Fighting)

531
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,440
Hey!

532
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,680
Stop!

533
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,120
(Gasping for air)

534
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,560
Are you all right?

535
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,120
Follow him!

536
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,480
Ouch!

537
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,160
Phaya!

538
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,800
Phaya!

539
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,600
Phaya!

540
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,160
Phaya!

541
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,040
Phaya!

542
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,480
Phaya!

543
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,440
Help!

544
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,240
Help!

545
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,760
Anybody, please help!

546
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,560
Help!

547
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,880
Phaya!

548
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,800
Anybody, please help!

549
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,440
Idolfactory

550
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,560
Phaya, please stay with me.

551
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,080
Pipop!

552
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,160
Um

553
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,160
Are you saying that Lieut Tam’s and Kao’s cases are related to your parents’ case?

554
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,960
Our suspect tried to fight back

555
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,880
(Fighting)

556
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,600
So, I got a glimpse of the tattoo on his arm.

557
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,640
If you want me to believe you,

558
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,840
show me an evidence.

559
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,560
I’ll let you choose whether you’d take us with you,

560
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,880
or I’ll tell the Inspector.

561
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,680
If you can’t separate work from your personal matters,

562
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:48,760
🎵Things made me realize🎵

563
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:57,520
🎵That the love we had made you leave🎵

564
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:04,080
🎵I didn't want it to be this way🎵

565
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:13,160
🎵Because I have a heart, that is kept only for you🎵

566
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:26,920
🎵I don't want that, so what should I do?🎵

567
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,240
🎵Or should I just disappear?🎵

568
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:44,120
🎵From now on, there's no one left to have to stay and watch you walk away🎵

569
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:53,320
🎵Or is it me who has to say goodbye? From now on, there will be no more tears🎵

570
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:59,400
🎵No more time for us to be together🎵

571
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:11,840
🎵Ending the word'you and I'right here🎵
