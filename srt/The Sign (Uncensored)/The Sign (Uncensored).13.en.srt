00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,480
(phone ringing)

3
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,960
(phone ringing)

4
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,520
(phone ringing)

5
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,200
They’re here?

6
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,360
That’s fast. Your men really did a great job, Inspector Akk.

7
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,360
Where are they?

8
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,440
If you want your friends back, you must do as I say.

9
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,320
What do you want?

10
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,400
Michael’s daughter.

11
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,680
How do I know you wouldn’t betray me?

12
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,640
I’ll let 3 of them go.

13
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,320
But if you don’t do as I say,

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,080
the rest of them won’t go out of here alive.

15
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,800
Where do you want me to meet you?

16
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,080
At the border.

17
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,800
How’s Michael?

18
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,440
Guys! Inspector! Singh!

19
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,840
Thongthai

20
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
Thongthai. Thongthai.

21
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,800
Thongthai.

22
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,920
The Sign

23
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,760
Tharn, are you alright?

24
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,200
I’m okay.

25
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,400
I might have been working too hard lately.

26
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,040
I even dreamt about the case we’re working on.

27
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,880
Oh, poor you, my bolster.

28
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,000
Next time, if you don’t want to have a bad dream, just dream about me.

29
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,160
Got it?

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,920
Yeah.

31
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,560
Morning kiss.

32
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,440
Ummm

33
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,640
Ummm

34
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,600
That’s enough.

35
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,120
Go shower now.

36
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,720
We have to go to work.

37
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,040
Ummm

38
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,760
Hmmm

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What do want?

40
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,880
The first one was just a morning kiss.

41
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,360
But this is a morning sex.

42
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,120
What you just saw is a video clip about Michael’s case.

43
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,800
He’s a programmer who looks after the system for an online gambling website.

44
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,800
A foreign mafia gang is after him right now…

45
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,880
due to a conflict about the online gambling site.

46
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,880
So, he ran away to hide out here.

47
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,560
Two days ago, Michael was abducted from the hotel on Sukhumvit road.

48
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,720
We found evidence as a video clip on his daughter’s phone.

49
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,400
She must have filmed it secretly.

50
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,400
It has led us to the culprit.

51
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,680
Have the police found out who took him?

52
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,960
They believe the mafia gang has hired Saeng to do this dirty job.

53
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,760
One of the culprits has a spider tattoo.

54
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,159
This confirms that he’s one of Saeng’s gunmen.

55
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,440
But aren’t all cases about (Village Chief) Saeng under Captain Achara’s responsibility?

56
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,520
Yeah, why transfer it to us all of the sudden?

57
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,800
Isn’t her team working on the online gambling website and (Village Chief) Saeng cases?

58
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,720
I never thought you’re a thief in disguise,
Captain stealing other people’s cases like this.

59
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,400
I thought we’ve already settled this in the meeting.

60
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,800
Leave the case.

61
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,040
I’m the one who started this case, so I’ll be the one who close it.

62
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,880
I’m just doing my job doing what I’ve been assigned to do.

63
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,440
If you want this case back, go file a petition to the authority.

64
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,000
If the authority approves, then I’ll leave the case immediately.

65
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,800
But right now, this case is mine.

66
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,400
It’s under my responsibility.

67
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,760
I heard the authority is worried that you’d ruin this case

68
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,280
because you’re unable to separate your personal matter from work.

69
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,920
I guess that must be true.

70
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,600
I never do that.

71
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,360
What about when you disobeyed the unit’s order…

72
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,320
and arrest Saeng without permission?

73
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,600
Wasn’t that aroused by your personal matter?!

74
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,480
Instead of acting like a child and trying to get your candy back,

75
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,200
you should rather go take care of your team and apologize to them…

76
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,720
for almost getting them killed.

77
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,200
(phone ringing)

78
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes, Miss Mayris?

79
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
Yes, I’ll inform the Inspector right the way.

80
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,680
Inspector, the witness in Saeng’s case has arrived.

81
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,440
Should we go now?

82
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,920
I have a job to do.

83
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,680
- Looks like Captain isn’t going to take it easy on us.
- None of your business.

84
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,280
Your job is to work on this case and protect the witness.

85
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
(Crying)

86
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,480
Is she a witness in this case?

87
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,640
Yes, her name is Deeni. She’s Michael’s daughter.

88
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,200
Wait. According to the case file,
it says his daughter had run away and got killed by a car.

89
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,400
That’s what the police wants everyone to believe. It’s for her own safety.

90
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,360
On the way here, Deeni said that she wants to see her dad.

91
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,000
She wants to help him rather than staying here.

92
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,120
All right everyone, please don’t worry.

93
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,640
Inspector, can I go talk to her?

94
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,360
She must be so scared. Luckily, I’m good with kids.

95
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,960
It’s all right, Deeni.

96
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,160
(Crying)
It’s okay.

97
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,720
(Crying)

98
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,640
(Crying)

99
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,080
(Crying)
It’s all right.

100
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,240
(Crying)

101
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,800
(Crying)
I shouldn't be here, just let me go.

102
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,080
(Crying)
It’s okay.

103
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,200
(Crying)
Okay.

104
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,600
Do you understand what she just said?

105
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,160
(Crying)
Hmm, no.

106
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,960
Deeni, don’t worry. We’ll take your father back safely, okay?

107
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,000
(Crying)

108
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,720
(Crying)

109
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,040
Phaya and Tharn, take Deeni to your place and look after her.

110
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,240
Don’t let her out of your sight until this case is solved and we can get Michael back.

111
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,200
I’ll put both of you on vacation.

112
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,760
- But…       /      - Yes, sir.

113
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,320
(Crying)

114
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,280
(Crying)

115
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,040
Hey Deeni,

116
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,440
my name is Tharn.

117
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,320
You are going to be safe, you don’t have to worry.

118
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,840
- Ouch!     /     - Tharn.

119
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,360
What’s wrong?

120
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,080
Tharn.

121
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,800
You haven’t had a vision for quite some time, have you?

122
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,760
Why start seeing it again all of the sudden?

123
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,080
I don’t know why it’s happening again.

124
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,880
But I can feel there must be something very dangerous about this case.

125
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,920
I want you guys to be very careful.

126
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,880
Don’t worry about me.

127
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:19,320
Apart from the Abbot, I also have my wife as my guardian angels.

128
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,600
Look at you.

129
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,720
Why are you so worried about me?

130
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,320
Geez, that’s enough. Let him go.

131
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,640
I can take care of him. He’s my man.

132
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,880
Hey, I’m your bro.

133
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,480
- But he’s mine.     /      - Fine.

134
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,800
Tharn, I think you’ve been working on a lot of serious cases lately.

135
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,720
That’s why you’re getting tensed up so easily.

136
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Guys!

137
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
I’ve got some interesting news.

138
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,600
It’s about the bad-ass Inspector and the hot-tempered Captain.

139
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,560
I found out why they don’t like each other.

140
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,160
Why?

141
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,480
Well, it’s because…

142
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,240
- Let me tell them.
- Go on, Baby.

143
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,680
These two have been rivals since when they were still in college.

144
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,280
When they first became a team leader here,

145
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,160
they even fought over the team members.

146
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,480
But I heard that no one wanted to be on Captain’s team.

147
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,120
Probably because she’s a lady.

148
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,640
I can’t believe there are still people who think that men are better than women.

149
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,680
What a discrimination. Why judging others by their gender…

150
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,400
rather than by their abilities?

151
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:46,600
It’s so irrational to judge others by their appearance or by their gender.

152
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,360
Because we live in a pretentious society.

153
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,440
That freedom and equality that you’re dreaming of…

154
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,760
So, Captain Achara wants to take Saeng’s case back so badly…

155
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,520
because she wants to prove that she is also capable to work on the case like the Inspector.

156
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,040
That’s not it. Village Chief Saeng is involved in her father’s death.

157
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,360
Here’s the story.

158
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,680
Captain’s father comes from a hill tribe family.

159
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,440
One day,

160
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,760
her father went into the woods to find food.

161
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,320
There, he saw the village chief and his men illegally cut down the trees.

162
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,240
So, he went to inform the authority.

163
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,840
When Saeng and his men found out,

164
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,920
they burnt down the Captain’s village.

165
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,160
Only the Captain survived.

166
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,960
That’s why she wanted to become a cop.

167
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,680
She wants to arrest Saeng with her own hands.

168
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,840
What are  you guys doing? Get to work now.

169
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,640
Yes, sir.

170
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,040
(Sigh)

171
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,920
(Sigh)

172
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,120
Please take good care of Deeni for me.

173
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,080
When she’s feeling better, try getting something out of her.

174
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,880
Deeni might have some information that’s useful for the case.

175
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,480
Yes, sir.

176
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,960
Go get ready now.

177
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,000
Mayris, can you lip-read what the culprit is talking to Michael?

178
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,920
- Fa…
- Fashion Island.

179
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,920
I’m sorry.

180
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,480
Where’s my flash drive?

181
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,720
Flash drive?

182
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,000
What flash drive?

183
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,839
Don’t lie.

184
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,359
Where’s my flash drive?

185
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,359
Michael said, ‘I don’t know’.

186
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,440
This is the conversation between Michael and the culprit.

187
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,120
Who gives you permission to watch this clip?

188
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,720
It says in there that I have to help your team on this case.

189
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,320
I’m just doing my job what I’ve been assigned to do.

190
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,240
I hope you wouldn’t mind, Inspector.

191
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,600
First round, Captain won.

192
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,960
You’ve never changed.

193
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,040
Stubborn, hotheaded, and never follow the rules.

194
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,760
I think the Inspector won in this round.

195
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,320
That’s right, I’m still the same.

196
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,760
Just like you, who are still heartless the devil of our unit.

197
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,240
What a hook. I’d say it’s a knockout.

198
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,440
Now, please tell me everything you know so far.

199
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,600
- Thongthai.      /      - Yes, sir.

200
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,400
After a thorough investigation at the crime scene,

201
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,120
we found out that a room next to Michael’s…

202
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,920
had been reserved 2 days prior to Michael’s check-in date.

203
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,120
So, I checked the security camera.

204
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,080
and it turned out the guest in that room was Saeng.

205
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,120
About the flash drive…

206
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,000
It probably contains data about the online gambling sites.

207
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,640
And a list of money laundering accounts.

208
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,320
Michael must have kept it as evidence to protect himself and his daughter.

209
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,800
Go check the case file if there’s any flash drive found at the crime scene.

210
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,120
She doesn’t eat anything.

211
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,200
And doesn’t say anything.

212
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,800
Tharn, when you’re around Deeni…

213
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,200
do you see any vision?

214
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,480
Not at all.

215
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,160
Then I guess we won’t be able to get anything useful for the case from her.

216
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:23,200
She is probably still in a trauma so she fears to trust others.

217
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,240
It’s like when I lost my parents.

218
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,720
I was like this too.

219
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,080
When I grew up and lost my loved one,

220
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,080
I thought I had overcome it.

221
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,400
But then it came back.

222
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,120
Fortunately, I had Chalothorn to save me.

223
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,760
Hey.

224
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,640
What?

225
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,000
What’s wrong with you?

226
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
What was that last sentence you just said?

227
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,960
I said, ‘Luckily, I had Chalothorn to save me.’.

228
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,760
Haven’t we talked about this?

229
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,640
That we won’t mention him ever again.

230
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,760
If you do,

231
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,280
I’ll punish you like this.

232
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,360
Hey.

233
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
It’s all in the past.

234
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,920
Why are you still being so jealous?!

235
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,800
Well, you have your own sixth sense.

236
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,000
I also have mine.

237
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,760
But it only works with you.

238
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,760
I can’t help. I’m jealous.

239
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,520
I’m jealous because I love you.

240
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,320
Tharn.

241
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,320
Promise me that you want mention him again.

242
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,400
Say after me.

243
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,320
I won’t mention him again.

244
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,720
Fine.

245
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,800
I won’t mention him again.

246
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,800
Phaya.

247
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,320
Hey!

248
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,360
What is it, now?

249
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,200
What if Grandma and Nee see us?

250
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,640
They won’t.

251
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,840
I told them…

252
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,440
to go get some fresh air at Huahin.

253
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,840
So, it’s just us now.

254
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,960
(Screaming)

255
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,720
Deeni!

256
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,600
(Crying)

257
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,440
Let’s go!

258
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,800
Where’s she?

259
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,880
(Crying)

260
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,400
(Crying)

261
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,240
Do you want to drink something warm?

262
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,640
Don’t worry, Deeni.

263
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,320
It’s just a dream.

264
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
(Cat meowing)
Namani wants to be your friend.

265
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,760
You can give him a hug, okay?

266
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,200
(Cat meowing)

267
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,680
(Cat meowing)

268
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,760
(Cat meowing)

269
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,400
Namami.

270
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,280
(Cat meowing)

271
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,920
Do you think my dad is still alive?

272
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,440
I’m sure your dad will try to do everything to stay alive.

273
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,200
He must miss you so much.

274
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,320
So, he will definitely come back to see you.

275
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,240
I know my dad did the wrong things but no matter what he’s still my dad.

276
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,160
Even he’s a bad person for someone else,

277
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:52,720
but for me he’s the only person I have in my family.

278
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,840
It’s true that your dad does something wrong
and for that he must be punished by the laws.

279
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,080
But now he’s the one who needs help.

280
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,800
And as a police officer,

281
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,960
it is our job to protect your father as he’s also one of the citizens.

282
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,160
Don’t worry, Deeni.

283
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:39,000
I’ll do everything to get him back.

284
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:56,000
That’s right. Don’t you worry. We will be right outside.

285
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,240
Okay?

286
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:27,000
When I was young, Mummy and Daddy would hold me if I couldn’t sleep.

287
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,360
Can you both please stay with me?

288
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,360
Hey, if Mummy is sleepy…

289
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,680
then just go to bed first.

290
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,840
Daddy will take care of her.

291
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,000
Aren’t you a bit too full of yourself?

292
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,640
I can be a Daddy too.

293
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,960
You’re a Mummy.

294
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,920
Okay.

295
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,600
Mummy will do everything as Daddy says.

296
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,840
Hmm

297
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,600
By the way, Daddy.

298
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,360
I think I’m falling in love with Deeni.

299
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,640
What if Mummy wants to have a cute baby like her…

300
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,760
what would you say?

301
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,520
Maybe in the next life.

302
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,080
- You, evil Mummy jellyfish!
- Ouch!

303
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,920
Keep it down. She’s sleeping.

304
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,840
Shut up.

305
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,160
Mummy. Daddy.

306
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,200
Umm

307
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,560
Why am I still dreaming of this place?

308
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,000
It’s been a long time, Sakuna-nopparuj.

309
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,600
How did you know my name?

310
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,600
Can’t you remember me?

311
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,520
Who are you?

312
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,160
You should be more polite to your older brother.

313
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,240
Brother?

314
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,440
You died because you stole a lover from Chalothorn.

315
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,480
So did Wansarut.

316
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,720
She died because she tried to save you.

317
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,720
I’m here to congratulate you.

318
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,000
That you can finally be with Wansarut.

319
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,440
If you’re really my brother,

320
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,200
why didn’t you help me back then?

321
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,400
I have always helped you…

322
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,520
as much as the time loop would allow me to come through to this world and help you.

323
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,080
But it’s you who have created all these problems.

324
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,400
So, you must be the one to fix them.

325
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,360
All the bonds and promises you have made with Wansarut…

326
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,120
prevent me from helping you as much as you might want to.

327
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,600
But why now? What brings you here this time?

328
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,560
I’m here to warn you.

329
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,680
You must be careful.

330
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,440
Warn me?

331
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,960
Garuda and Naka are not supposed to live together.

332
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,480
Those who try to go against the law of nature…

333
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,040
must sacrifice something in return.

334
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,160
If you’re away from Wansarut,

335
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,920
your power will decrease.

336
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,040
So, no matter what happens…

337
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,200
don’t stay away from each other.

338
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,920
Phaya.

339
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,640
Hey!

340
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,680
Answer the call.

341
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,720
Yeah.

342
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,719
Phaya.

343
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,760
Yes, Inspector?

344
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,560
Saeng abducted Michael because he wants the flash drive that contains data about the online gambling sites.

345
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,400
Flash drive?

346
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,000
Who has the flash drive right now?

347
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,199
We haven’t found it.

348
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,400
Try asking Deeni if she ever saw her father keeping a flash drive anywhere in his house.

349
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:34,920
Yes, sir.

350
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,360
Let me know as soon as you find out.

351
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,199
I’m taking our team to Chiangmai.

352
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,480
Wait, Inspector.

353
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,920
Where are you and your team going?

354
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,560
Chiangmai.

355
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,960
Our informant said they have located Saeng’s hideout.

356
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,120
I’m taking my team there.

357
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
Let me go with you.

358
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,760
I might be able to help you find the route to get to Saeng’s hideout.

359
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,240
It’s a place I’m familiar with because I grew up there.

360
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,320
Please, Inspector.

361
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,920
You should know how I feel.

362
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,640
You also tried to give your brother justice, didn’t you?

363
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,080
Then, wait until I have my man disguised as one of Saeng’s henchmen.

364
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,720
For now, I want you to send some officers to keep their eyes on Phaya’s place. It’s where Deeni is right now.

365
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,920
Saeng is looking for a flash drive.

366
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,920
That kid is still in danger.

367
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,600
But I…

368
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,280
Hey

369
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,920
Are you still worried about your dream?

370
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,360
Yeah.

371
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,360
But deep down, I don’t want to believe it.

372
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,880
It’s been a while since I last dreamt of something strange like this.

373
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,360
Then this one might be true.

374
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,920
We better be careful anyway.

375
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,360
But right now, I think we better ask Deeni about that flash drive.

376
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,280
Drink as much as you want, Deeni.

377
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,000
After this, let’s go shower and go to bed.

378
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,520
Deeni, can I ask you something?

379
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,080
Have you ever helped your day…

380
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,080
when he’s working at home?

381
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:24,280
Yes. I help making coffee for him in the morning.

382
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,160
Sometimes, I also help tidy up his work desk.

383
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,000
What about when you were at the hotel?

384
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,720
Did you also help tidy up his work desk there?

385
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,400
Did you ever see him keep something important in that desk?

386
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,600
Something like a flash drive.

387
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,800
Flash drive?

388
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,200
Can you remember it?

389
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,800
No, nothing like that.

390
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,040
I’ve never seen him kept a flash drive anywhere.

391
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:07,640
What about an item or something important that your dad has asked you to keep it for him?

392
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,000
Can you remember it?

393
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,920
Come here, come here.

394
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,560
I need you to keep that all the time. Keep it with you all the time, okay?

395
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,640
Do you understand?

396
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,080
Where’s my flash drive?

397
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,360
Where’s my flash drive?

398
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,720
Deeni.

399
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,240
Go and get his daughter.

400
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,680
That side needs a flash drive.

401
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,040
(Shouting)

402
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,720
Please let me in.

403
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,160
Hey, I told you not to go inside.

404
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,520
(Fighting)

405
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,600
(Fighting)
Let me go!

406
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,960
(Fighting)

407
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,120
Let me go!

408
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,000
Let me go!

409
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,960
Hey!

410
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,680
What’s going on?

411
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,880
It’s these two, sir.

412
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,000
What is it?

413
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,840
They are trying to come in.

414
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,720
Who are you?

415
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,880
I’m asking you. Answer me.

416
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,120
Chief Saeng.

417
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,320
Chief Saeng.

418
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,160
I’m a boxer.

419
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,160
I want money.

420
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
I’m a swimmer.

421
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,400
Can we try it? Please…

422
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,960
Are you really a boxer?

423
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,160
Yes, sir. I want to box.

424
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,120
Please, Chief Saeng. Please…

425
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,720
Then show me how you box first.

426
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,160
Right the way, sir.

427
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,120
(Fighting)

428
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,800
(Fighting)

429
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,200
Alright, that’s enough.

430
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
Enough!

431
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,480
Not bad at all.

432
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,840
Do you want to box for my gym?

433
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,400
Yes, sir. Thank you, Chief.

434
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,400
Thank you, Chief.

435
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,040
Inspector, the fish has eaten the bait.

436
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,200
Let’s go.

437
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:38,160
(Crowd cheering)

438
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,600
Why are there security cameras in here?

439
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,360
So that I can see which boxer is good enough to fight for me in the ring.

440
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,160
(Crowd cheering)

441
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,520
- How many matches today?
- Four, sir.

442
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,120
- Let these two fight with boxers from Pong’s gym.
- Yes, sir.

443
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,640
Hey

444
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,680
Go.

445
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
Go on. Just go in there.

446
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,120
(Crowd cheering)

447
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,680
Go in.

448
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,000
Go in.

449
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,520
Hey, where are you going?

450
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,280
This is really his hideout, just like what our informant said.

451
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,000
But how are we going to contact our team outside?

452
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,760
That’s not important. What we have to do now is find Michael.

453
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,080
But we’re locked up here.

454
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,920
Damn it!

455
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,560
Shit! Which way should we go?

456
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,000
I need to talk to your boss.

457
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,160
I said stop talking!

458
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:26,880
Shit!

459
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,800
Say it.

460
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,160
Hey, that’s Michael.

461
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,800
Shit.

462
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,120
It’s really him.

463
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,760
Yeah. What to do now?

464
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,200
We have to get out of here.

465
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,840
He’s so close.

466
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,520
Can you get out?

467
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,400
Khem, try looking for a way out on that side. I’ll take care of this side.

468
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,480
Damn it.

469
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,600
You two can get out. It’s time to box.

470
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,200
- Well, the thing is…
- Out.

471
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,480
We don’t want to box now.

472
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,320
Can we go back?

473
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,800
Too late now. Go!

474
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,960
Hang on. Give me a second.

475
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,800
Go, go.

476
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:42,520
I said go. Come here.

477
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:52,400
(Crowd cheering)

478
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,680
Who’s paying?

479
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,280
Deeni. Deeni.

480
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,320
Deeni

481
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,120
It’s all right.

482
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,520
It’s all right, Deeni.

483
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,520
It’s just a glass shattering.

484
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,400
Your doll is dirty. I’ll clean it for you.

485
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,880
No, it’s okay.

486
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,520
My dad bought it for me.

487
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,680
He told me to take good care of it.

488
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,480
And don’t let anyone touches it.

489
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,720
Listen, Deeni.

490
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,720
Phaya is going to wash it and give it back to you.

491
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,520
It’s very dirty now.

492
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,080
Come.

493
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,440
Please trust me. I’ll wash it for you.

494
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,760
Come and sit over here, Deeni. Let me clean up here first.

495
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,320
Go fight.

496
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,120
Fight!

497
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,480
(Crowd cheering)

498
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,960
Saeng abducted Michael because he wants a flash drive which contains data about the gambling websites.

499
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,720
Try asking Deeni about it.

500
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,800
When you’re at home, have you ever seen your dad kept a flash drive anywhere?

501
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,080
My dad bought it for me.

502
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,200
He told me to take good care of it.

503
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,080
And don’t let anyone touches it.

504
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,560
Tharn.

505
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,000
This must be the flash drive that Inspector is looking for.

506
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,680
(Crowd cheering)

507
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:37,800
Deeni.

508
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,840
Protect her.

509
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,040
(Fighting)

510
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,080
(Coughing)

511
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:57,120
(Crowd cheering)

512
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,840
Come on. Get up.

513
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,840
(Crowd cheering)

514
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,920
Yay…

515
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,480
Turn off the live.

516
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,560
This is bad, Inspector.

517
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,280
What?

518
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,920
He already knows that Yai is a cop.

519
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,240
Shit.

520
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,560
What to do?

521
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,000
Why are you here?

522
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,200
To box, sir.

523
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,360
Is the cop salary not good enough?

524
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,680
Is that why you have to box?

525
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,720
Stop! I said stop!

526
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,320
Stop!

527
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,520
Stay still.

528
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,360
Tell every team…

529
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,720
to track for a black van with plate no. อธ3417.

530
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,280
They’ve got Deeni.

531
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,920
Deeni. Tharn, Deeni!

532
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,280
What should we do?

533
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,160
Let’s go in.

534
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,280
I’m asking you, why are you here?

535
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,120
Chief Saeng.

536
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,040
Chief.

537
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,360
The police are coming.

538
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,960
Put your gun down.

539
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,000
Put your gun down.

540
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,760
Move away, if you’re not involved.

541
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,600
Put your gun down.

542
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,240
Oh, hello, Inspector.

543
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,160
Do you really thing you can get out of here alive?

544
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,040
Inspector, Michael is here.

545
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:27,640
Ah, now I know why you’re here.

546
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,960
You better turn yourself in.

547
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,560
Your people might be more in number here.

548
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,040
But my men have already surrounded this place.

549
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:36,720
Really?

550
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,840
Let me go!

551
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,160
Let me go!

552
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,120
I think you better put down your guns.

553
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,080
Or else they are dead.

554
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,720
Don’t do that, Inspector.

555
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,120
No, Inspector.

556
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,760
Put your gun down!

557
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,520
Put it down.

558
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,240
Good.

559
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,320
Good.

560
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,400
Better send us the hostage.

561
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,120
The police already know that you’re hiding out here.

562
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,680
You won’t get away this time.

563
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,760
Oh, really?

564
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,760
Even in this situation, you still dare to negotiate with me?

565
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,200
Fine then.

566
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,400
Do you want to play a game?

567
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,480
I like playing games.

568
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,720
Let’s do this.

569
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:53,040
I’m going to live broadcast these two fighting each other. They must keep fighting until I’m satisfied.

570
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,080
I lost a lot of profit today because of you two.

571
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,760
So, you must do something worthwhile to repay the loss.

572
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,240
Turn on the live.

573
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,120
What do you mean?

574
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,760
Shut up and start fighting.

575
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,120
Either you…or you, will have to die here tonight.

576
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,680
Or else all of your friends die.

577
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,720
So?

578
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,520
Do you think I was just kidding?

579
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,720
Thongthai. Thongthai.

580
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,160
Thongthai. Thongthai.

581
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,160
Let me go.

582
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:45,920
Do you want to play this game?

583
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,800
I’m asking you nicely.

584
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,560
Thongthai.

585
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,040
Do you want him dead?

586
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,480
One.

587
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,400
Don't, Chief Saeng.

588
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,320
Two.

589
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,720
So?

590
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,640
Let her go!

591
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,160
Get down.

592
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,680
No way!

593
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,680
I said let her go!

594
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,480
Stay still.

595
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,760
Hurry up.

596
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,520
Yai, I’m sorry

597
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,080
Khem.

598
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,320
I’m so sorry.

599
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,160
Khem.

600
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:53,640
I’m sorry.

601
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,120
Khem.

602
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,280
Listen to me.

603
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,200
Damn it!

604
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,400
Stop! Khem, stop!

605
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:37,800
Please help me!

606
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,840
Lucky me. I get to see police officers fighting each other today.

607
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,200
Wow, nice move.

608
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,920
Get up.

609
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,640
(Gunshots)

610
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,200
(Gunshots)
Go!

611
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,400
(Gunshots)

612
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,840
Go! Go!

613
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,880
Follow me!

614
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,640
Captain, where’s Deeni?

615
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,960
They took her away. I was too late.

616
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,480
Damn it!

617
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,040
Yes?

618
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,200
What? Can’t get a hold of Inspector’s team?

619
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,800
Are you sure?

620
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,160
Okay.

621
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,120
What happened to Inspector, Captain?

622
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,120
Our people there also don’t know…

623
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,120
They can’t get a hold of him and his team.

624
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,200
I’ll leave the flash drive at the unit.

625
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,880
I’ll let you know if there’s any update.

626
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,280
According to the latest record before we lost connection with the Inspector team,

627
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,680
it says that their last location is at a deserted warehouse in Nahkon Sawan.

628
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,600
We suspect that it’s the route used for transferring illegal items to the North.

629
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,680
It matches with the information Captain Achara has obtained.

630
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,360
There’s an order for both of you to bring in the forces and go raid the warehouse.

631
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,760
Please be careful.

632
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:01,360
They’re here? That’s fast. Your men really did a great job, Inspector Akk.

633
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,960
Where are they?

634
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,200
If you want your friends back, you must do as I say.

635
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,840
What do you want?

636
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,000
Michael’s daughter.

637
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,240
How do I know you wouldn’t betray me?

638
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,280
I’ll let 3 of them go.

639
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,000
But if you don’t do as I say,

640
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,760
the rest of them won’t go out of here alive.

641
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,360
Where do you want me to meet you?

642
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,520
At the border.

643
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,320
How’s Michael?

644
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,600
Guys! Inspector! Singh!

645
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,000
Thongthai.

646
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:17,760
Thongthai.

647
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,000
Thongthai, Thongthai.

648
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,080
Doc, I said I’m okay.

649
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,320
Thongthai.

650
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,440
Let me go! I’m going to help Khem.

651
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,000
Thongthai, calm down.

652
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,360
- Look at yourself.
- Let me go!

653
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,680
- Calm down, okay?
- Let me go!

654
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,120
Phaya

655
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,040
Calm down, okay?

656
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,160
You want me to calm down?

657
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,440
What if it were Tharn who got captured, will you be able to stay calm?

658
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,800
Damn it!

659
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,000
Inspector, Saeng has contacted back.

660
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,240
He said both Michael and Deeni are with him.

661
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,600
He wants us to trade the flash drive with those two.

662
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,440
I’m going to take my team to the border and rescue the hostages.

663
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,280
Then I’ll hand-deliver Saeng to you.

664
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,040
No need.

665
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,720
They are my team. I can take care of it.

666
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,760
You and your team are injured. It would only obstruct the mission.

667
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,840
Even if I have to die,

668
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,200
I will get them out of there alive.

669
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,120
It’s not just about Michael and Deeni.

670
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,080
We have to make sure our team can get back safely too.

671
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,080
I’ll cooperate with you for once.

672
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:48,960
I’m safe, sir.

673
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,440
My team and the Inspector’s team are on our way to the border to rescue the hostages.

674
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,960
I’ve already requested for a backup force.

675
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,040
When it’s time, I’ll send them a signal.

676
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,480
Copy that, sir.

677
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,320
Where are my people?

678
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,360
And where are Michael and Deeni?

679
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,200
Walk.

680
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,720
Where’s the flash drive?

681
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,200
Let’s change our agreement a bit.

682
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,680
What are you talking about?

683
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,880
All you want is the flash drive, don’t you?

684
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,920
So, I’ll give you your flash drive.

685
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,200
But you have to release Michael and his daughter too.

686
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,400
No. You can only have your men back.

687
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,240
Let me guess, you have to deliver something to your boss after this.

688
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,920
Without this flash drive, everything is over.

689
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,000
Such a fair exchange, isn’t it?

690
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,360
I’m not going to negotiate with you.

691
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,920
I can only release your people.

692
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,480
Take them out.

693
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,640
Go.

694
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:08,480
I’ll count to 5. If you don’t give me the flash drive,

695
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,520
then you can carry their dead bodies out of here.

696
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,200
One.

697
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:17,120
Two.

698
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,359
Three.

699
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,240
Four.

700
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,319
Just give me the flash drive!

701
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:29,120
Inspector.

702
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,600
On my signal, get rid of them all.

703
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:51,600
Okay.

704
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,920
What the heck?! Why is it so big?

705
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,560
Titcharuj.

706
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,680
Move! Move!

707
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:42,640
His boss just ran off.

708
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,640
Come, Tew. Let’s go.

709
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,080
Go after the hostages.

710
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,399
I’ll take care of here.

711
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,479
Yes, Captain.

712
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:56,920
Stop.

713
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,560
Khem, are you okay?

714
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,240
Sure, Babe.

715
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,200
Are you alright?

716
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,280
Let’s go.

717
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,040
Hang on.

718
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:21,600
Move

719
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:44,880
Quickly

720
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,640
Take Michael with you. I’ll handle here.

721
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,560
Move, move. Quickly.

722
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,360
Tharn, go look after Deeni.

723
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,360
But…

724
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,920
Our mission comes first. Go!

725
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,240
Come here

726
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,240
Hurry up!

727
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:18,560
Quickly

728
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:52,560
Stop!

729
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,160
This is for destroying my family.

730
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:22,800
Captain

731
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:56,160
Thank you for your team’s hard-work and sacrifices.

732
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,920
They are all so wild like you.

733
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:24,920
Honey.

734
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:31,320
I told you I’m safe and sound. Talk to you later, okay?

735
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:57,120
Thank you for saving my dad and my life, Mummy and Daddy

736
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,080
Hey…

737
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,160
It's time to go.

738
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,240
Thank you, IDF.

739
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:43,760
Guys.

740
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,480
Miss Mayris shouldn’t have been the head of forensic team.

741
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,520
With her body, she should’ve been the winner of Durian beauty pageant.

742
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:04,120
Babe, my arms ache a lot. Can you feed me, please?

743
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,200
Can’t you eat it yourself?

744
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,000
So pampered.

745
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,040
It hurts, bro.

746
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,040
What the heck, Khem?!

747
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:12,480
What is it?

748
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,440
There.

749
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,360
Look over there.

750
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:29,600
Phaya, cheers!

751
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,280
Bring it on.

752
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:34,800
Hey, how come you are all wet?

753
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,520
Thank you guys. Thank you so much.

754
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,760
For saving me and Khem.

755
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,760
Of course, we have to save you. We’re a team, aren’t we?

756
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,760
Tharn. Phaya. Thank you so much for saving us.

757
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,160
Yeah.

758
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,640
Being a police officer like us…

759
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,000
we really don’t know where life would take us to.

760
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,320
Being a cop is about being risky.

761
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,440
At least what we do…

762
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,720
can help protect the ones we love, right?

763
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,120
But you have to promise me one thing.

764
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:23,040
No matter how risky it is, you must take good care of yourself.

765
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,520
Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of you too.

766
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:34,240
I had to go through a lot of hard times in order to have you by my side.

767
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,440
You will be stuck with me for a long time, Tharn.

768
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,280
Don't worry

769
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,120
Understood?

770
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,200
Yeah, I got it.

771
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:48,080
Understood?

772
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:54,000
Hey, I’m still right here. Now, I’m jealous. I wish my wife were here too.

773
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,000
So noisy.

774
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,960
So what?

775
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:06,280
Guys, Captain Achara said there’s a new case.

776
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,280
She wants our team to go help.

777
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,560
Can we see it, Miss Mayris?

778
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,240
Aah, the fun time is over.

779
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,920
Being with you guys is always fun.

780
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:27,880
Let me have a look.

781
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:28,400
Here

782
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:41,120
IDF Team, are you ready?

783
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,840
Just bring it on!
