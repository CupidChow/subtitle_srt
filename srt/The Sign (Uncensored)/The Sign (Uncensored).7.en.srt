00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,720
But I kept dreaming about the same thing...

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,560
and you were always there in those dreams.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,160
Don’t you think it’s the same as when you have your vision?

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,720
Do you remember what I told you earlier?

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,200
That you are in danger.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,560
That’s why I want you to stay by my side so that I can protect you.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,960
But it’s Doc that I’m going with.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,120
I will take him away from you if even he has to die.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,440
What the fuck are you saying?!

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,800
Let me go!

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,880
Are you going to the art exhibition too?

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,760
Yes.

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,280
Please go to the exhibition with me.

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,640
Yes, Grandma.

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,760

Let’s finish your work.

36
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,160
I know it’s what you’ve always wanted to do.

37
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,520
You don’t have to do this.

38
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,800
I want you...

39
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,840
to cherish the feeling we have for each other...

40
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,159
and keep it alive within this collection of your work.

41
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,960
So that one day...

42
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,040
when I see it, I’d think of you.

43
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,880
Okay.

00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,280
(Music)

45
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,400
I love how you look at every piece of your artwork.

46
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,440
Your eyes are filled with passion,

47
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,240
mystery,

48
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,240
strength,

49
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,640
and tenderness.

50
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,640
Love. It’s love.

51
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,880
I put my soul into my work.

52
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,680
I am your art.

53
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,240
I belong to you.

54
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,200
Yes.

55
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,760
Yes.

56
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,240
Please promise me.

57
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,520
Even when everything changes,

58
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,840
never change the way you look at me.

59
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,640
You are getting married.

60
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,080
You are getting married.

61
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,280
You are going to have a new beginning in your life.

69
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,080
Please promise me that you will never forget me.

70
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Never forget the time we have spent together.

71
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,920
Why did you do this to me?

72
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,360
- Why?
- Because I love you.

73
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,840
Do you know you’re torturing me?

74
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,280
I need you.

75
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
I don’t want to lose you.

76
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,600
I don’t want to lose you.

77
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,000
I’m here, Art.

78
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,640
I’m here.

(Thunder Sound)

85
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,240
Inspector, the VIP guest will arrive in less than an hour.
Tharn and Yai, go back to your position.

86
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,160
Yes, sir.

87
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,320
Tharn, I think you should stop looking for that man.

88
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,960
What else can you do when you’ve found him?

89
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,200
Are you going to tell him that you saw a vision that he is the culprit...
and then arrest him?

90
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,280
I’m not going to arrest him.

91
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,920
I just want to ask him something so that he might come to his sense.

92
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,680
Can’t you just let it go?

93
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,760
But we are a police officer, Yai.

94
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,960
Are you going to let innocent people get hurt or die?

95
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,960
But I can’t let you die either.

96
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,360
How many times have you risked your life to save the others because of your vision?

97
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,480
Just do your best and let it be.

98
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,840
Don’t you remember what the Abbot told us?

99
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,320
That sometimes you have to let the karma does its work.

100
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,280
I can’t do that.

101
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,000
Now that I know what’s going to happen, I have to help him.

102
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,480
What about the VIP guest? You agreed to take this job...

103
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,320
because you want to see him, didn’t you?

104
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,280
Think about it and choose wisely, Tharn.

105
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,160
Who are you looking for?

106
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,040
Oh, just my friend.

107
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,920
Hmm, a friend?

108
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,320
Oh, is that Wi? We’re here!

109
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,760
I haven’t seen you for ages. I thought you already disappeared.

110
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,880
- Good evening, Grandma.
- Good evening.
How are you doing?

111
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,320
I’m doing well. I haven’t seen you for so long. You hardly come visit me.

112
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,920
I just open my art gallery so I’m a little busy.

113
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,560
Hello, Phaya.
Hello.

114
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,440
And this is...

115
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,680
Oh, her name is Dujdao. She’s my junior friend when I studied in France.

116
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,520
Hello, I’m Dao. You must be Wi. He often told me about you.

117
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,520
Really? What did he tell you?

118
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,160
She’s my friend too.

119
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,880
You can ask me if you want to know anything about her.
I know a lot more than he does.

120
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,320
I’ll tell you later then.

121
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,960
Hold on. Before you’re going to disclose my personal info, have you asked for my permission?

122
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,840
Serve you right, cheeky monkey.

123
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,880
Grandma, please help. They are ganging up on me.

124
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,240
I also agree with them.

125
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,360
Awwww

126
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
Why is everyone ganging up on me?

127
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,200
Wait, is that Phaya?

128
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,800
Why is he here?

129
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,280
I don’t know.

130
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,560
Is she the girl who came to see him at our unit?

131
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
But who’s the other girl?

132
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,840
No idea too.

133
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,400
Maybe she’s also his friend.

134
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,520
I don’t think so. As a relationship guru,
I’m sure both of them are not his friends.

135
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,640
One is probably his girlfriend. The other must be his fling.

136
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,320
Let’s get to work.

137
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,920
Please excuse me,
I have to get ready for the exhibition. It’s going to start soon.

138
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,840
- See you later then.
- Okay

139
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,720
See you.

140
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,160
Tell everyone to get ready in their position.

141
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,160
Yes, Inspector.

142
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,000
The VIP guest is going to arrive in 10 minutes.
Yes, sir.

143
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,000
Tharn, stay focus. Don’t try to do something silly, okay?

144
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,400
Don’t worry. If I could, I would’ve already done it..

145
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,120
I know better than to mix work with personal matters.

146
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,640
I never thought the Commisioner would send you to take care of me.

147
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,800
How I’m glad to meet you again, Inspector.

148
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,800
I’m sure we’ll meet again more often.

149
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,200
My condolences to you and your team, Inspector.

150
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,840
For losing your favourite assistant.
I’m really sorry that our country has lost another decent man.

151
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,520
He died in the line of duty.

152
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,160
I pray for all of them to rest in peace.

153
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,360
They all lost their lives to serve the law.

154
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,480
I also hope the law would be powerful enough to punish those who have done wrong.

155
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,520
Yes. I too hope their sacrifices wouldn’t be a waste.

156
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,360
Please excuse me, Inspector.

157
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,160
Okay.

158
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,280
Good evening, Mr. Montree.

159
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Have we ever met before? You look very familiar.

160
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,840
Probably my father. He was also a police officer.

161
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You probably met my fathre before.

162
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,920
Hmm, a police officer?

163
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,160
He was an inspector. He and my mother died...

164
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,560
after being framed in a car accident 10 years ago.

165
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,680
Ladies and gentlemen, please come inside. The exhibition is about to start in 5 minutes.

166
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,040
Well then, if you need any help, please let me know.

167
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,000
Hey, didnt I tell you to calm down?

168
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,600
Tharn, can I have a word with you?

169
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,880
Yes, sir.

170
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,960
What is it, Inspector?

171
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,360
Let me remind you again that our job today...

172
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,640
is to protect the safety of the VIP guests.

173
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Yes, sir.

174
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,120
I just didn’t expect that the VIP guests also include the Minister.

175
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:17,080
Inspector knows, right? The story behind Mr. Montree and the drug trade.
Our job requires us to strictly follow the rules and code of conduct.

176
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,040
He attends this event as a guest.

177
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,640
Or have you found any evidence which points out that he is the suspect in this event?

178
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,720
No, sir.

179
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,800
Then just do your job.

180
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,200
Yes, sir.

181
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,080
Phaya, where are you going? The exhibhition is about to start.

182
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,400
Where are you going?

183
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,160
Are you going to see your colleague?

184
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,160
But today you’re here as a guest.

185
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,240
Let them do their job.

186
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,880
She’s right. The most important moment of the exhibition is about to start too.

187
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,960
I heard that this is going to be the last solo exhibition of the artist.

188
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,240
Really?

189
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,600
That’s a pity. This is going to be the last solo exhibition of Mr. Art Phakin too.

190
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,080
No, that’s too evil.

191
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,000
Ouch!

192
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,440
(Crying)

193
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,000
That man.

194
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,360
Are you sure you don’t have it?

195
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,200
Yes. I’m sure. My gallery has never purchased any of your artwork.

196
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,080
Love has a great way to find you.

197
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,320
It might push lovers...

198
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,920
to walk on a different path.

199
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,640
But with undenying faith,

200
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,760
love...

201
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,560
will always bring us together.

202
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,560
(Screaming)

203
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,480
Bounded by...

204
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,520
destiny...

205
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,880
and burning flames of passion and yearning for each other.

206
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,880
Love Eternity.

207
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,800
Written by Paulo Coelho, a Brazillian writer.

208
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,080
(Applause)

209
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:50,120
The Sign

210
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,160
Thank you for coming

211
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,520
Can I please have an autograph?

212
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,320
Sure

213
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,480
Here you go.

214
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,160
Thank you

215
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,480
Thank you for coming

216
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,520
Finally, I get to meet you, Mr. Art.

217
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,800
Mr. Montree.

218
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,240
(Pushing someone off)

219
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,920
(Crying in pain)
Arghhh!

220
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,840
(Pushing someone off)

221
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,520
- Kao!   /   - Get out!

222
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,400
Kao! Where are you?!

223
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,160
Ouch!

224
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,000
What did you do to him? Where did you take him?!

225
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,280
What the heck are you talking about?

226
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,600
Where did you take Kao?

227
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
I don’t know.

228
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,960
(Crying)
Liar!

229
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,960
Stop fooling yourself that he’s yours.

230
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,600
He’s going to marry me

231
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,480
Stop fooling yourself!

232
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Fooling myself?

233
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,840
Fooling myself?

234
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,200
How dare you said that to me?
Who is it?

235
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,920
Who is it that’s actually fooling other people?!

236
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,000
Kao told me he went to see you that night.

237
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,680
He went to tell you that he was going to marry me

238
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,760
We’re going to build a family together.

239
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,480
(Crying)

240
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,040
(Crying)
I’m begging you. Can you please leave us alone?

241
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,200
Can you get out of my life?

242
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,800
What about my life?!

243
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,440
My life that you both have already ruined!

244
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,320
Who will pay for it?!

245
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,200
You will? What’s wrong with you?

246
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,800
Do you think you’re the only one who is hurt?

247
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,920
I want it too, a happy life and a family with the one I love.

248
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,440
I want it too!

249
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,520
Go look for your boyfriend somewhere else.

250
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,240
He’s not with me anymore

251
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,240
To me, a guy named Kao…

252
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,760
is already dead

253
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,000
- Ouch!!
- What did you do to him?!

254
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,240
Ouch!! Stop!!

255
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,800
- Stop!
- What did you do?!

256
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,280
I’m sorry

257
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,320
- Did you kill him?!
- Calm down.

258
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,520
- Get off me!
- Stop!

259
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,800
Tell me!

260
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,440
Turn right and go straight for the exit.

261
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,080
All is clear here.

262
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,280
Okay.

263
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,320
Can’t believe something like that would happen. So scary

264
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,600
Let’s not talk about it. The elders might worry about us.

265
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,040
Okay.

266
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,760
Every time when I saw Kao and Art together,

267
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,840
I could tell that Kao really loved Art.

268
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,640
I never knew he already has a girlfriend. How could he do this to Art?

269
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,200
(Sigh)

270
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,040
Girls, you go and take Grandma back home first.

271
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,400
I have to stay behind to help my colleagues.

272
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,080
Phaya

273
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,720
Grandma, please go home first. Don’t worry about me.

274
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,760
I think you should go with her

275
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,480
I’ll take care of it here

276
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,160
But then I’d worry about you

277
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,640
I’d rather stay

278
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,680
Then please take a good care of yourself. I’m worried.

279
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,640
Please take care of him fo rme, Tharn.

280
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Yes, Grandma

281
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,560
Come, let’s take her back home.

282
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,480
- Grandma
- I’ll see you back home, Grandma

283
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,640
I already wrote down the names and contact numbers of all the guests

284
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,480
Mr. Art has already been taken to our unit.

285
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,280
Miss Ning’s wound has already been attended to.

286
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,320
Okay.

287
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,240
Miss Ning’s wound has already been attended to.

288
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,000
He said he’d only agree to give us an interview if we go to his place.

289
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,080
Khem, you and Tongthai go interview him at his place tomorrow.

290
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,480
Yes, sir.

291
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,080
Can I go with them too?

292
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,880
No.

293
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,800
You and Yai have to come back here to gather evidence tomorrow.

294
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,920
And try to find more evidence at Art’s house too.

295
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,080
Why do you want us to go to Art’s place?

296
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,600
I suspect that he might have something to do with Kao’s disappearance

297
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,120
I’ll go with him

298
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,200
Why don’t you just go home?

299
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,360
I’d like to be put on this case too.

300
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,280
Inspector

301
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,960
it seems like Mr. Art is losing his mind right now.

302
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,480
Let's go.

303
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,400
- Get off me!   /  - Stop!

304
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,000
Get off me!

305
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,160
- Get off me!   /   - Stop!

306
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,120
- Let me go!   /    - Stop!

307
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,160
- Get off me!   /   - Stop!

308
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,840
- No!   /    - Stop!

309
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,720
- No!   /    - Please calm down.

310
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,440
No!!

311
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,560
Let me go!

312
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,760
Ouch!

313
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,080
Ouch!

314
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,600
Ouch!

315
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,040
Please let me help

316
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,200
The situation is in chaos right now

317
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,000
Better let us handle it

318
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,280
He used to be my patient

319
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,640
Please let me talk to him

320
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,520
Arghhh!. Ouch!

321
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,720
Mr. Art, please look at me

322
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,680
Everything that happened today...

323
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,600
you didn’t mean to make it happen

324
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,880
No, no. I didn’t

325
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,280
- You didn’t mean it
- No, I didn’t

326
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,000
- That’s right    /     - No.

327
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,440
Please calm down and look at me, Mr. Art.

328
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,040
You did not mean it.

329
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,960
I was just an accident

330
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,320
(Crying)

331
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,080
Ouch!

332
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,000
(Crying)

333
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,840
It’s all right now, Mr. Art

334
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,720
(Crying)

335
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,840
Don’t be afraid

336
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,600
I will be right next to you

337
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,480
I’m sorry

338
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,760
No one is going to hurt you

339
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,760
I’m sorry

340
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,240
I promise

341
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,520
Please calm down

342
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,720
Calm down

343
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,240
Take him

344
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,360
Mr. Art used to come see me for a Hysteria treatment

345
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,600
He tried to involve art as a tool in line for his medical treatment

346
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,920
In the end, he informed us that...

347
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,800
he wanted to stop the treatment with us and tried to cure the sickness by himself.

348
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Being sick is not an excuse to be exempted from a punishment

349
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,160
No mental patient would ever want to tell everyone about their mental sickness.

350
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,520
I think the reason he’s experiencing this disorder again...

351
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,200
is probably becauase he was aroused by something.

352
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,040
So much that he could hardly control himself.

353
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,640
You used to experience something like that too, didn’t you?

354
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,720
Being unable to control yourself

355
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
But in your case,

356
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,480
I’m afraid it might not be because of the sickness.

357
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,520
It’s more likely because of your traits...

358
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,600
and personality

359
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,040
Phaya.

360
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,760
Thank you so much for your kind assistance, Doctor.

361
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,360
My pleasure, Inspector.

362
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Please let me know if there’s anything I can do

363
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,640
That’d be all.

364
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,240
I’m leaving then, Tharn

365
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,840
Okay

366
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,480
Tharn

367
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,800
Tharn

368
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,840
Can we talk?

369
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,280
What is it?

370
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,040
I called you so many times. Why didn’t you answer your phone?

371
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,320
I don’t have anything to talk to you

372
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,160
Hey, wait.

373
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,040
Can you stop sulking and act like a grown-up?

374
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,440
Me? Sulking?

375
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,560
Fine. I’m sorry

376
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,440
I’m wrong. I’m an idiot

377
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,280
I’m sorry

378
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,000
Suit yourself

379
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,880
Listen to me

380
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,000
I’m like this because I’m too worried about you

381
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,560
I don’t know how to say it. Something makes me feel that...

382
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,719
you are going to leave me, Tharn

383
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,080
I just don’t feel good about it

384
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,159
I keep having more bad dreams

385
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,719
Hearing voices from the girl who looks so much like you.

386
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,800
And all those things that the Abbot used to tell us.

387
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,199
All those things make me feel that...

388
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,880
you and I have been bonded for a very long time

389
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,400
Now that something bad is about to happen to you

390
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,040
I have to do something otherwise I’d lose you

391
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,920
And I can’t bear to lose you, Tharn

392
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,880
Calm down

393
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,920
Hey, calm down

394
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,239
It’s going to be all right

395
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
Easy there

396
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,600
You’re losing control of yourself

397
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,280
Just tell me you forgive me

398
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,640
And all these symptoms would probably go away

399
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,640
Please forgive me

400
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,760
Yeah. Let’s get to work

401
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,800
(Sigh)

402
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,280
This is Mr. Art’s patient record

403
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,920
per your request, Inspector.

404
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,800
Thank you

405
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,000
He has an anger management problem

406
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,880
He cannot deal with anxiety

407
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,320
And also has a problem in controlling his behaviours...

408
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,320
unlike normal people like us

409
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:02,520
So, what is the cause of this illness?

410
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,880
It depends, Inspector

411
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,520
Hysteria is caused...

412
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,600
mainly when patients feel that they are being neglected

413
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,120
The feeling might start to form since when they were still very young

414
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,880
Or when they have experienced a big disappointment

415
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,360
It can also occur due to the genetic problem

416
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,000
Or a lack of care and attention when they were being raised up

417
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,960
Patients with Hysteria tend to demand more love

418
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,280
and attention from people around them than usual

419
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,160
I see

420
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,640
Well,

421
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,480
the reason I’ve asked you to come here today...

422
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,440
is because I’m going to interrogate Mr. Art

423
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,840
I’d like you to help observe his behavior

424
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,640
during the interrogation

425
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,560
To observe his mental condition

426
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,280
Whether he’s able to be interrogated

427
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,400
Or whether he has any unusal behaviour during the interrogation.

428
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,200
That’d be my pleasure, Inspector

429
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,120
Thank you

430
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,520
Inspector, Mr. Montree urgently flew out of the country. He won’t be back for our interview until next week

431
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,400
From what I’ve investigated,

432
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,600
it looks like Mr. Montree has bought a lot of Mr. Art work...

433
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,960
and also sent them abroad

434
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,720
The strange thing is...

435
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,760
Mr. Montree didn’t make a purchase with Mr. Art directly

436
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,720
He bought all the work from someone called Ning

437
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,240
She’s a girlfriend of Kao’s, the one who is missing right now

438
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,000
Montree probably sensed his danger and tried to run away

439
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,880
He’s definitely running away

440
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,120
I find the relationship between these two very strange

441
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,520
Ning and Art seem to hate each other

442
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,600
But why Ning is the person who sells Art’s work?

443
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,360
Have you found Kao?

444
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,880
Not yet.

445
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,880
Then why did you call me here?

446
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,360
I have some questions to ask you.

447
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,080
They are only for our references in this case.

448
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,000
Do you know Mr. Montree?

449
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,200
Montree?

450
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,520
Which Montree? I don’t know him.

451
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,600
Mr. Montree whom you met at the exhibition yesterday.

452
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,720
yesterday

453
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,560
I was only there to look for Kao.

454
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,000
If you don’t know Mr. Montree,

455
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,680
then how come there’s a record of you selling Mr. Art’s work to Mr. Montree through his secretary?

456
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,840
Miss Ning?

457
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,480
I already asked the bank to send me all transactions incurred on your bank accounts.

458
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,640
A few months ago, there was a deposit of many hundred thousand baht in your account.

459
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,360
I don’t know about that.

460
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,360
I don’t know anything.

461
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,840
Kao just took care of everything.

462
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,280
He is the one who deals with Art

463
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,240
He asked me open an account under my name.

464
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,200
He said he’d deposit some money in there...

465
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,400
for our wedding.

466
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,840
(Crying)

467
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,520
Are you sure?

468
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,200
If you lied to us,

469
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,360
it wouldn’t do you any good.

470
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,680
I’m...I’m not lying.

471
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,320
If you want to know anything,

472
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,920
you should go find Kao and ask him.

473
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,080
You might get all the answers you’re looking for

474
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,880
Find him.

475
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,160
(Shutter sound)

476
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,760
(Shutter sound)

477
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,840
(Shutter sound)

478
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,320
(Shutter sound)

479
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,480
I think Art and Kao...

480
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,200
aren’t just friends or colleagues.

481
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,120
I found some clothes and personal belongings that might belong to Kao’s.

482
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,320
So, what Ning said

483
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,920
about Kao and Art being together...

484
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,640
might be true.

485
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,440
Yeah.

486
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,400
And what the inspector has suspected about Art...

487
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,280
having something to do with Kao’s disappearance, might also be possible.

488
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,280
Hey

489
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,600
Tharn.

490
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
What did you see?

491
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,840
I can feel something about this picture.

492
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,920
Hey.

493
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,480
I think we’ve found a key evidence.

494
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:55,640
We have done the lab test on Art’s DNA and the bloodstain that Phaya found at Art’s place,
the bloodstain doesn’t belong to Art.

495
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,920
Whose is it?

496
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:05,560
We don’t know yet.
But it matches with the dried bloodstain on the pen.
The one Art used to hurt Ning.

497
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,280
From our interview with Ning,
she said Kao has disappeared 3 days ago.

498
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,280
So, I asked Sing to track down Kao’s phone.

499
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,480
The last place where he went...

500
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,920
is Art’s house.

501
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,040
Here.

502
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,080
This is the file from a CCTV camera in the alley where Art’s house is.

503
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,280
Three days ago, Kao did go to see Art.

504
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,560
This is not just a simple assault case.

505
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,520
It might also be related to Kao’s disappearance.

506
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,600
The traces of evidence, the bloodstain,

507
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,200
and the crime scene…

508
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,320
Everything that points out to what happened on that night.

509
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,760
Where is Kao?

510
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,040
Only Art knows.

511
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,320
Mr. Art.

512
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,560
Do you recognize this pen?

513
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,440
You used it to hurt Miss Ning.

514
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,920
Did you also use to hurt anyone else?

515
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,280
I am talking to you, Mr. Art.

516
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,440
Can you please cooperate?

517
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,000
Did you use this pen to hurt anyone else?

518
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,040
(Sad Music)

519
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,800
You don’t have to say anything.

520
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,680
You didn’t do anything wrong.

521
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,440
It’s all my fault.

522
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,200
(Crying)

523
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,960
(Crying)

524
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,680
(Crying)

525
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,240
(Crying)

526
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,920
I’m sorry.

527
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,800
I didn’t mean it.

528
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,880
Kao.

529
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,400
I’m not mad at you.

530
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,120
From now on, we’ll be together.

531
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,680
We’ll never part again.

532
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,520
That night, he went to your house, didn’t he?

533
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,440
He wanted to break up with you because he was going to marry Miss Ning.

534
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,920
We’ve already found...

535
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,600
a bloodstain of someone else’s on this pen...

536
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,200
other than that of Miss Ning’s.

537
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,840
Did you kill Kao?

538
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,280
No.

539
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,200
I didn’t do it.

540
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,280
- You knew all along.
- I didn’t do it!

541
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,760
You knew, didn’t you?

542
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,760
That Kao secretly sold your work to Mr. Montree behind your back.

543
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,680
That night, what did Mr. Montree whispered to you?

544
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,920
Did he threaten you?

545
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,880
Are you sure you’re not going to sell it to me?

546
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,680
Hmm, is this the pen that you used to hurt Kao?

547
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,160
Love?

548
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,640
That’s sick.

549
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,000
I didn’t do it.

550
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,400
You were angry that Kao betrayed you.

551
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,040
He used your love for money.

552
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,560
He sold all the works you gave him.

553
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,560
No.

554
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,160
No.

555
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,640
No, I didn’t do it.

556
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,560
It was an accident.

557
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,240
I didn’t do it.

558
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,400
No.

559
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,520
- Is Kao already dead?
- I’m sorry.

560
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,200
I’m sorry.

561
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,360
Can you stop calling me?
I’m trying to get everything done.

562
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,880
That’s right.

563
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,720
I don’t love him.

564
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,160
I just want to use him.

565
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,280
Is that what you want to hear?

566
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,520
Art, please let me explain.

567
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,600
You’re an asshole.

568
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,800
- Art.    /    - Get off me.

569
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:29,920
Get off me!

571
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,760
Have you ever been honest with me?

572
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,720
Have you?
Just for once.

573
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,840
Was that also true?

574
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,160
Or was it just another lie?.

575
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,560
No, Art.

576
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,560
I really love you.

577
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,880
I do.
Love?

578
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,400
Please listen to me, Art.

579
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,960
Please.

580
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,960
Please calm down.
- No. / - Art.

581
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,160
- Please listen to me. / - No.
- No! / - Please listen to me, Art.

582
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,320
Ouch!

583
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,960
I thought I’d be able to give you a chance.

584
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,920
I thought if you really loved me, I might be able to give you a chance.
But this is too much.

585
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,400
I’m going to take back all my works.

586
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,120
I’ll press charges...

587
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,880
against you and your girl.

588
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,640

You have to pay for what you did.

600
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,800
For all those lies.

601
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,880
You have to pay.

(Crying while laughing)

603
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,600
Love?

604
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,280
There is no love.

605
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,800
There’s only lies.

606
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,160

(Opera, Classical Music)

611
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,360
Tharn, why do you think Art has nothing to do with Kao’s disappearance?

612
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,600
Do you still remember when Art talked about love during the openining at the exhibition?

613
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,680
I think he said it because he missed him. He felt sad.

614
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,160
He was yearning for someone he loved.

615
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,600
I couldn’t feel any anger or hatred from him at all.

616
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,880
Are you saying that...

617
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,760
Art still loves Kao?

618
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:46,520
There are many lovers who have to stay apart.

619
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,280
I know that.

620
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,600
But for me, if I love someone...

621
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,200
I’ll never let that person go.

622
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,360
I’ll keep looking for him.

623
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,840
And do everything that I can to make him stay with me.

624
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,560
No matter what it takes.

625
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,680

Don’t do that, Ning.

639
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,840
I already told you.

640
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,320
It’s all my fault.

641
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,680
This has nothing to do with Art.

642
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,240
That’s right.

643
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,920
I didn’t love him.

644
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,200
I just want to use him.

645

Is that what you want to hear?

646
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,600
I chose to be with you, to marry you.

647
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,720
So, you should stop now.

648
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,760
- Art, please listen to me.
- You’re an asshole.

00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,720
You call this, love?

661
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:54,360
I was blind to believe that you loved me.

662
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,200
I thought despite you already having someone else...

663
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,640
despite how little you’d be able to share those love with me...

664
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,360
I thought it was still love. However little it was didn’t matter to me as long as you loved me.

If this blood matches with the one on the pen,
then we’d know if Kao is still alive.

707

Or whether Art has already killed him.

It matches with the one on the pen

715
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,120
Does it belong to Kao’s?

716
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,200
- Yes.   /   - Oh!!!

717
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,840

the DNA matches

00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,960
It belongs to Kao’s.

720
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,720
A camera on the taxi also showed that Kao called for a cab and took this taxi.

721
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,720
But the driver said that Kao was on the phone

722
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,600
I’ll do everything exactly as I said

723
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,200
Then he got off in the middle of the road

724
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,160
Excuse me? Can you please turn right at this junction?

725
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,160
(Raining)

726
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,160
I asked Sing to check around that area. It’s an abandoned land with no residences nearby.

727
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,640
So, we had no idea where he went after that since there aren’t any CCTV camera around there.

728
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,760
Oh, just in time. The inspector has called for a meeting.

729
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:04,560
Okay

730
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,960
Wait.

731
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,760
Can we release Art now?

732
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,760
He doesn’t have anything to do with Kao’s disappearance anyway.

733
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,320
Let the inspector decide

734
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,960
Let’s go for a meeting first

735
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:32,760
(Classical Music)

736
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,920
(Classical Music)

737
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,480
How serious is it?

738
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,960
It might escalate from one level to another

739
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,880
Oh, hello Doc

740
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,160
Doctor...

741
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,560
Can he be cured?

742
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,640
If so, how long will it take?

743
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,880
He has experienced a severe breakdown

744
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,880
I’m afraid it might take quite some time, Inspector

745
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,320
Is Mr. Art going to be in trouble because of Kao’s disappearance?

746
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,640
Although he might not be involved with Kao’s disappearance,

747
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,960
he would still be charged with physical assault

748
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,440
If Mr. Art chose to walk away when he knew that Kao already had a girlfrirend,

749
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,440
this tragic incident wouldn’t have happened

750
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,560
Love is like that. You don’t always get what  you want

751
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:53,720
But you’ve already fallen for someone,
it’s probably not that easy to give up on it.

752
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,440
Even if it’s not easy,

753
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,120
but if it’s necessary, then you should do it

754
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,320
Because what’s not ours will never be ours

755
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,520
There’s no use to keep being persistent
That’s right

756
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,320
No use at all.

757
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,240
You better let them live together happily. Don’t get in the way.

758
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,040
Walk away now so that you won’t waste your time

759
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,440
But if I really love someone,

760
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,320
I’m willing to waste my time, Phaya.

761
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,040
And I’ll do everything...

762
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,960
to make the one I love stay by my side.

763
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,960
Even if that person doesn’t love you?

764
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,760
Isn’t that too selfish?

765
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,520
Calm down, Phaya.

766
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,280
I’m sorry, Inspector.

767
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,960
I got a little carried away.

768
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,800
Someone is trying to take away something dear to me

769
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:48,400
Well, lucky for me that I obey what the Abbot said and live my life by the Five Precepts.
That’s why my love life is so happy as it is.

770
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:55,240
Kamesu-micchacara – one should abstain from a sexual misconduct.
And also, Musavata – to abstain from false speech

771
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:00,720
- Sathu.    /  - Sathu.
(Laughing)

772
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:09,240
(Thrill Sound)

773
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,480
Are you going home? Do you need a lift?

774
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,080
Don’t bother, Doctor.

775
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,840
Tharn, we need to gather more information and find more evidence

776
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,680
It would take some time

777
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,040
So don’t let him wait

778
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,640
I’ll drop you off.

779
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:22,400
Then you go ahead and head back home

780
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,480
I’ll go back with him

781
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,520
Did you hear that?

782
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,040
He will go back with me

783
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,960
So, don’t worry

784
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,560
I’ll see him to his bed

785
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,920
Thank you, Phaya

786
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:37,920
My pleasure

787
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,760
Let’s go

788
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,880
(Phone Ringing)

789
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,480
Yes, Doc?

790
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,000
[Chalothorn's voice: Hi Tharn, I'm at home now]

791
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,480
Okay.

792
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,080
Please rest well.

793
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,800
Does he really have to keep checking on you?

794
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,280
So annoying.

795
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,200
Let’s talk about Art’s case tomorrow

796
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,880
I want to go home and get some rest

797
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,160
Let’s call it a day.

798
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,360
Hey, wait

799
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:30,440
Huh? Do you really forget it?

800
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,720
You said you will go back with me.

801
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,440
I said that so that you two would stop fighting

802
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:43,520
Let’s go

803
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,520
- Hey. / - Come with me.

804
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,640
No.

805
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,160
Hey, I really want you to come with me

806
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,880
I have a surprise for you

807
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,880
What is it?

808
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,720
It won’t be a surprise if I tell you

809
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,480
Please.

810
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,280
(Oh yes!)

811
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,960
Hey, wait for me

812
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,280
Why did you take me to your home?

813
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,320
I just want you to come visit my place

814
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,960
I’ve already been to your place for so many times

815
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,320
Is this how you invite someone to your house?

816
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,640
Yeah.

817
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,160
Oh, wow! Your house is so grand

818
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:55,840
Oh, hello. What’s your name?

819
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,680
It’s Namami.

820
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,760
I see
(Meow)

821
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,720
Hello

822
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:03,760
Namami.

823
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,400
No, I mean the cat’s name is Namami

824
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,240
I’m Paranee

825
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,600
(Laughing)
Ah, hello Paranee.

826
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,160
Hello, Tharn.

827
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,280
Is she your little sister?

828
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:20,760
No.

829
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,000
My mother.

830
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,960
Welcome to our house

831
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:33,480
- Hello, Grandma.
- Hello.
You arrive just in time for dinner

832
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,480
Your family knows that I’d be coming?

833
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,480
Meow

834
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,600
How is it going with the case? Is everything all right now?

835
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,600
I’ve been watching the news about it. You guys are so great

836
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,600
- Right, Grandma?
- Yes.

837
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,360
People are losing their minds more and more these days

838
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,080
In the old days when I watched the news,

839
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:02,240
I could still understand the reason why those people did something evil like that

840
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:11,360
They probably experienced something so terrible...
that caused them to act on impulse.

841
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:17,240
But people these days are different. Their minds are beyond understanding.

842
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:19,560
I totally agree with you, Grandma.

843
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:23,920
They are nothing like Namami, right?
Namami...

844
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,200
Actually, it mostly revolves around only just one or two things

845
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,040
Being dishonest

846
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,760
or lying.

847
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:40,080
And also a sexual misconduct driven by obsessions and desire.

848
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,279
Wow!

849
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,960
You’re so cool. You know about all those things too.

850
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,840
The Abbot taught me well.

851
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,680
(Laughing)

852
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,960
Now that I’ve already invited him to our place

853
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,279
Are you going to let him stand here all night?

854
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:02,840
I’m so hungry, Grandma.

855
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,279
Well, so am I.

856
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,560
I’ve prepared something delicious for your friend

857
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,439
You, stay here. Don’t move.

858
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:16,279
Tharn, let’s go and have dinner with me.
I’m so glad you finally came.

859
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,880
I often heard Phaya

860
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,920
talking about you.

861
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:23,160
Wait, not talking actually.

862
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:25,240
He often dreamt about you.

863
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:27,359
Let’s go. Don’t you dare move.

864
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,000
Come, let’s eat.

865
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,640
- Leave him be.
- Okay.

866
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,359
Serve you right. You’re no longer her favourite nephew

867
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:40,120
Namami, scratch her.
Let’s go eat, Namami.

868
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:50,040
Hey, are you really going to leave me here?

869
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,680
Fine, I’ll go there myself.

870
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,120
I made

871
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,440
this myself.

872
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,120
Oh, I was about to give you that.

873
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,160
- Grandma.   /    - Yeah

874
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:14,840
- Tell me, has he ever done something funny to you?
- Huh?
(Laughing)

875
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,480
Wow, this is so good.

876
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,480
I made it myself.

877
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,080
(Lovely Sound)

878
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:13,520
Go on.

879
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,720
I often come here to draw.

880
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,600
I’ve been afraid of water since then.

881
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:53,400
So, I tried to stay close to it – to get used to it.

882
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,000
I’m trying too.

883
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:07,280
(Eternity Remembrance Melody)

884
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,840
Tharn.

885
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:22,680
Here.

886
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,640
Ow!

887
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,840
Do you remember...

888
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,520
the first time we met at the camp?

889
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:49,840
Do you know...

890
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,520
that I really wanted to hug you then?

891
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,000
Liar.

892
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,840
You couldn’t even recognise me.

893
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,160
But it was such a coincidence.

894
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:14,320
But the end, wasn’t it me who took your hand and led you out of that place?

895
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,040
Do you really think

896
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,800
all this is a coincidence?

897
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:32,480
Tharn.

898
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,720
I like you a lot.

899
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,640
I really do.

900
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:53,960
I don’t know

901
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,560
why I’m like this too.

902
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,800
But then I’ve come to realise about it.

903
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,760
Even though I’ve just met you...

904
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,120
the closer I get to know you,

905
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,640
the more I feel that...

906
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,760
I’ll never be able to lose you.

907
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:31,440
I really want to have you by my side in every day of my life.

908
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,360
It’s as if...

909
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,040
I’ve felt like this for so long.

910
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,640
Very long.

911
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,560
I can’t love anyone, Phaya.

912
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,040
If I love someone,

913
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,080
I’ll lose that person in the end.

914
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,160
And I don’t want to lose you.

915
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,520
I want to have you by my side.

916
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,200
But this is the best I can do.

917
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,800
Please don’t force me.

918
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,440
Because I really don’t want to lose you.

919
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:44,880
Tharn.

920
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,280
I’ll do everything to be with you.

921
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,080
I’m not going anywhere.

922
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,480
I’ll stay by your side.

923
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,240
I’ll do whatever it takes so that you won’t be sad or lose me.

924
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:09,880
I promise.

925
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:15,240
(Romantic Music)

926
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:41,760
(Romantic Music)

927
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:33,840
(Thrill Sound)

928
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,840
(The sound of the wind blowing)

929
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,040
(Book flipping open)

930
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,920
Idolfactory

931
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:03,680
You and Phaya should be more careful during these days.

932
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,320
The Abbot asked me to tell you...

933
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,280
to try to stay away from water.

934
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,680
Tharn! Tharn!

935
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,080
(Thrill Sound)

936
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,280
(Praying)

937
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,520
Tharn! Wake up!

938
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,560
I'm so sorry.

939
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,600
Tharn.

940
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:26,080
Ouch!

941
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:58,560
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵

942
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:24,800
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵

943
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:39,640
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

944
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:44,040
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

945
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:51,840
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
