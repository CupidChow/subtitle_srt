He is Rin’s boyfriend,

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,560
Narong’s sister who committed suicide.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,760
Stop!

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,160
The laws that you respect and look up to...

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,000
can never keep those bastards behind bars for long.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,560
Songyod is arrested.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,080
I tried to ask Narong about the thing that happened in the cellar today.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,320
It seems he had no idea what was happening to him.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,120
Is there anyone who can tell us about what we saw?

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,160
You should know where you stand
and better stay by his side as a big brother.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,640
I’ll try to keep that in mind.

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,600
Until your time is done.

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,200

32
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,920
We finally meet again.

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,960
Who are you?

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,320
Why are you always in my dream?

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
Don’t you remember me?

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,040
Use your heart instead of your eyes.

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,440
And you’ll finally see.

38
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,200
Phaya.

39
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,240
Phaya, are you okay?

40
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,120
I’ve been calling for ages.

41
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,360
Grandma said dinner is ready.

42
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,680
If you don’t want her to get even more upset, you better hurry up and come down.

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,640
Okay, I’ll be right behind you.

44
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,120
Tharn.

45
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,200
Yes?

46
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,440
Where are you?

47
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,000
Swimming at my condo.

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,840
With whom?

49
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,280
Khem and Thongthai. Yai is on the way.

50
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,880
What’s the matter?

51
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,440
I had a bad dream about you so I was just worried.

52
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,680
Don’t worry. I can take care of myself.

53
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,040
But I’m really worried this time.

54
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Maybe you should take some days off for a while.

55
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,320
Think of it as a rehab for your injury.

56
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,960
You can get back to work once you’re fully recovered.

57
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Are you saying that I should tell the Inspector...

58
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,880
that I need to take leave because of your bad dream?

59
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,560
Are you nuts?

60
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,920
Tharn.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,200
This is not different from when I doubted about your vision.

62
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,080
But right now I won’t deny what you are seeing.

63
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,760
Yes, it might be just a dream.

64
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,920
But the fact that I keep dreaming about it again and again...

65
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,520
and you are always in those dreams,

66
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,920
don’t you think it’s actually the same as your vision?

67
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,600
You don’t need to worry about me.

68
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,960
I’ll take a good care of myself, okay?

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,880
Bye.

70
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,040
Wait. Tharn! Tharn!

71
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,200
Hey, where are you going?
Grandma will bite your head off if you leave now.

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,280
I have something urgent to take care of.

73
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,200
Hang on. You’re acting weird.

74
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,280
Is it about someone? Who is it?

75
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,200
Just a friend.

76
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,640
- My colleague.
- Hmmmm

77
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,800
He probably needs my help with his work.

78
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Are you sure he’s just a friend?

79
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,840
Why do you have to rush out like this? Why can’t you just give him a call?

80
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,200
I already did but he didn’t pick up.

81
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,400
- Why are you being so nosy, cheeky monkey?
- Ouch!

82
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,680
I’m leaving.

83
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,920
Hello, Phaya.

84
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,840
And this is...

85
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,720
This is Nee, my little sister. Do you remember her?

86
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,440
I see...

87
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,800
I haven’t seen you for a while. You’ve grown into a beauty.

88
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,640
Hello, Dao.

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,400
Oh, you’re here? That was quick.

90
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,560
Hello, Grandma.

91
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,280
I can’t believe someone like Phaya...

92
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,120
would be so superstitious about his bad dream like this.

93
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,280
Hey, are you and Phaya together?

94
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,760
What?

95
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,240
Of course, not.

96
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,200
Well, he seems to worry about you a lot.

97
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,960
Probably a lot more than just a colleague would do.

98
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,280
He was having a bad dream about you and it worries him to death.

99
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,360
I’m sure the power of love he has for you is very immense, my bro.

100
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,240
Shut up, you jerk.

101
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,760
Listen.

102
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,799
Phaya and I are just colleagues. That’s it.

103
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,799
If you don’t like him that way...

104
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,039
why do you always have to protect him?

105
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,400
You even took the stab for him.

106
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Before you’d say anyting,

107
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,040
I want to use your heart rather than your head.

108
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,920
Awww….

109
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,400
Stop. I already told you guys and we are just friends.

110
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
- Swear?	 /    - Would you swear?

111
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,600
- Go on. Swear it.
- Would you swear?

112
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,360
What?

113
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,520
I’d rather not.

114
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,000
What if Phaya likes you then? What would you say?

115
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,200
Yeah, what would you do?

116
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,760
Will you give him a chance?

117
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,560
Come on, say it.

118
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,640
I think you’re imagining things.

119
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,280
The way Phaya behaves when he’s around you…

120
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,640
I used to be like that too.

121
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,160
Geez, what’s wrong with you?

122
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,760
For Baby and I,

123
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,560
our relationship also started from me always caring for him.

124
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,080
Geez, stop it. It wasn’t an act of caring at all.

125
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,240
It actually started with a chaos.

126
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,720
The first time I saw you,

127
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,760
I almost wanted to quit the university.

128
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,600
What happened?

129
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,000
Tell us then. I really want to know.

130
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,720
Well, our relationship began to bloom...

131
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,200
on the day when our young hearts were still yearning for love.

132
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,520
With my bicep muscle under the warm sunlight.

133
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,800
It was the beauty of my young and muscular body…

134
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,160
that made him fallen for me.

135
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,000
You have a pose as well.

136
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,320
Can you get to the point now? I’m listening.

137
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,400
Well, it all started like this…

138
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,440
[A university in the north]

139
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,280
[2009]

140
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,200
(Screaming)

141
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,680
(Screaming)

142
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,360
Definitely me.

143
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,640
Shit!

144
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,920
Is there anyone?

145
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,920
Hey, are you done? Do you need a hand?

146
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,480
Wow, they look cute on you.

147
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,760
I’ll wash them and return them to you later.

148
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,560
No worry. I’ll take care of your wet clothes too.

149
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,040
Think of it as my apology.

150
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,160
I’m leaving then.

151
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,760
Hey, wait.

152
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,760
I have a question.

153
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,840
Do you believe infinity?

154
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,200
What?

155
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,920
Infinity. Isn’t that what you call something like fate?

156
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,960
You know?

157
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,600
That’s ‘Destiny’.

158
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,560
Huh?

159
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,760
Look at my lips.

160
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,320
- Des...   /   - Des...

161
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,600
- Ti...   /   - Ti...

162
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,080
- Ny.   /   - Ny.

163
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,360
- Destiny.
- Tishni.

164
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,360
No. DESTINY.

165
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,400
Tishni

166
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,040
Stop it.

167
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,400
Then what does that sentence I just said mean?

168
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,320
How can you not know the meaning of what you said?

169
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,480
It means whether or not you believe that destiny exists.

170
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,560
I see.

171
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,920
Actually, I know what it means.
I just want you to ask me the same thing too

172
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,760
But if you ask me, I do.

173
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,040
Because it was my bicep muscle under the warm sunlight…

174
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,880
and the beauty of my young and muscular body,
that have brought us together.

175
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,320
Wow, that sounds so romantic. I’m so good at it.

176
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,360
Well done to myself.

177
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,720
Don’t you find it romantic?

178
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,600
Please excuse me.

179
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,480
- See you.   /   - Bye.

180
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,200
Oh, wow.

181
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,200
Romantic , wasn’t it?

182
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,040
So cheeky.

183
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,760
I thought I was watching ‘Secret Crush On You The Series’.

184
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,120
You two seem to get off on the wrong foot.

185
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,040
How come you ended up dating each other?

186
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,400
Well, after that day...

187
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,160
I kept following him to offer my sincere apology.

188
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,880
But the more time I spent with him,
the more I started to have feelings for him.

189
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,840
So I decided to go after him.

190
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,880
Hi, baby.

191
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,240
Are you...?

192
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,720
Yes. I mean you, baby.

193
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,400
Here you go.

194
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,280
I already washed them. They smell so nice.

195
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,560
If you don’t believe me, then I’ll show you.

196
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,280
You idiot! That’s my underpants. Why did you smell it?

197
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,840
What is it?

198
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,480
Your clothes. Please take them back.

199
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,120
I’d be going then.

200
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,000
Wait.

201
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,880
Let’s find something to eat. It’s on me.

202
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,360
When will you stop bothering me?

203
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,280
How can I do that? We’re not even together yet.

204
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,040
I’m sorry but I don’t like men.

205
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,560
Why don’t you go after those junior girls who admire you?

206
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,240
Hey, wait.

207
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,240
I just want to know you as a friend.

208
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,840
I already sent you an invitation. Will you accept it?

209
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,680
If not, you’d be so rude though.

210
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,240
Judging from your look,

211
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,840
you seem to be quite educated.

212
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,960
So, I guess you won’t be so rude to me.

213
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,600
Do you really want to get to know me that much?

214
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,160
Why don’t you give me a chance to get to know you?

215
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,120
Maybe, if you do...

216
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,680
and we have some time to get to know each other,

217
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,560
you and I might turn out to be a perfect match.

218
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,280
As friends, I mean.

219
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,720
Or maybe when we get to know each other more,

220
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,160
you might fall head over heels for me.

221
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,120
Why are you being so persistent?

222
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Because I am Khem.

223
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,880
I’m Thongthai.

224
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,760
Woo-hoo!

225
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,000
What are you doing?

226
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,560
I don’t like wasting time. Can we skip some steps?

227
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,440
We’re now close.

228
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Let’s go find something to eat.

229
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,640
Tonight, I’m going to make you get to know me even more.

230
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,280
Every part of me.

231
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,000
Okay. But let me warn you that my standard is pretty high.

232
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,000
If it turns out to be below my standard, you have to leave me alone.

233
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,640
Well, if you say so.

234
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,400
You got it.

235
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,720
How was it, baby? Sexy?

236
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,200
Respect, respect, respect.

237
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,840
So, you guys just skipped the talk and went straight to sex.

238
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,080
Why so hurry?

239
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,480
Well, if we’re going ot be in a relationship,

240
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,720
we’d have a lot more time to talk later on anyway.

241
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,160
I’d rather do that thing first.

242
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,360
So that I’d know if we both are on the same page. I don’t want to waste time.

243
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
By the way,

244
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,400
I won’t mind if you’d also adopt my method.

245
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,440
You’ll find out right the way...

246
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,040
whether you two are made for each other or not.

247
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,560
I don’t need to do that.

248
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,880
Because I still insist that I don’t like Phaya that way.

249
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,960
Awww, he’s stubborn.

250
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,000
He just ran.

251
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,120
Or maybe he probably meant it, that he doesn’t really have feelings for Phaya.

252
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,080
He might already like someone else.

253
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,640
Is it me?

254
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,320
Obviously not.

255
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,440
That was hard.

256
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,040
Let’s brainstorm.

257
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,000
We hardly have any case to work on these days.

258
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,160
Yeah.

259
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,760
Let’s find some time and go on a trip together.

260
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,160
Maybe it would help Tharn and Phaya...

261
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,200
to get closer to each other when they are both naked.

262
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,720
Eat this! So that you can keep your mouth shut.

263
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,000
Geez! What the fuck!

264
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,560
Damn you.

265
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,000
Yai.

266
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,120
Has Tharn ever have a boyfriend or girlfriend before?

267
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,160
Yes, but that person was dead.

268
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,480
- Dead?   /   - Yes

269
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,120
So, he’s afraid. He doesn’t want to get hurt like that again.

270
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,520
These fruits are fresh from the market.

271
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,320
My aunt asked me to send her best regards to you.

272
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,160
Thank you.

273
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,800
- That one is for Phaya.
- Thanks a lot.

274
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,720
Phaya is injured from work again.

275
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,280
So, my aunt told me to pay a visit as soon as I can.

276
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,800
It seems like you had already known beforehand that he’d be injured.

277
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,840
Well, that day when I went to see him at the unit,

278
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,560
I remember he was also injured from work.

279
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,760
I had a hunch that someone hot-tempered like him
would eventually get himself injured again.

280
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,200
Well, I’m fine now.

281
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,760
That’s why I didn’t tell you. I don’t want to bother you or anyone else.

282
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,800
Whether it’s a big or small injury, our parents will always be worried about us.

283
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,000
Grandma, I think we should ask him to quit being a cop.

284
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,080
He has just started working and look how often he got injured.

285
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,600
I’m afraid I won’t be able to stop him since it’s the job that he likes.

286
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,240
I don’t like to force anyone to do something against his will.

287
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,800
He’s free to do whatever he loves...

288
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,640
as long as it’s not so dangerous that he has to risk his life for it.

289
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,400
I totally agree with you.

290
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,480
You can do any job you like.

291
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,040
But you must also have a work-life balance.

292
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:11,720
Don’t devote yourself to work so much that you forget
to care about those around you, or someone close to you.

293
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,680
Do you agree?

294
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,960
If you really love your job as a police officer,
maybe you should find someone to take care of you.

295
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,360
So that he or she can look after you when you get injured again.

296
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,440
Well, he has both Grandma and I to look after him.

297
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,160
So, you don’t have to worry about that.

298
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,920
Nee, listen to me.

299
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,800
You also need to live your own life.

300
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,840
You can’t spend your whole life looking after your big brother.

301
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,480
Unless you don’t want to have anyone.

302
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,880
Please excuse me for being rude.

303
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,600
But I was wondering if you’re already taken?

304
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,640
Well...

305
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,280
Taken? A naughty girl like her?

306
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,920
Obviously, not.

307
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,960
Thank you so much for your concern about me though.

308
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,840
All right then. Let’s start eating. We’ve been chatting for quite some time.

309
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,000
Okay.

310
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,800
Eat this too, Grandma.

311
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,760
You should eat more so that you’d get better soon.

312
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,520
Thank you.

313
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Thanks.

314
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,960
You should eat more too.

315
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,200
You probably didn’t get to eat Thai food that often when you were abroad.

316
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,400
Oh, but I actually did. I worked part-time at a Thai restuarant.

317
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,720
Grandma.

318
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,520
My aunt told me that you will also attend the art exhibition. Is that right?

319
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,840
Yes. Your aunt called and invited me by herself.

320
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,080
Will Phaya be there too?

321
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,760
My aunt said you’ll also take him with you.

322
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,040
Ah, that’s right.

323
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,480
Can you please come with me? My friends really want to see you.

324
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,080
You hardly go anywhere with me these days.

325
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,800
All you do is work.

326
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,200
Well...I...

327
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,040
Of course, Grandma. I’ll go with you.

328
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,120
I’m also free.

329
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,000
Can I go too?

330
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,160
Of course.

331
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,400
Can’t he just at least send me a sticker?

332
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,160
(Door scratching)

333
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,280
(Door scratching)

334
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,400
Nee?

335
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,040
What’s the matter?

336
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,280
I bring you some fruits that Dao gave us.

337
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,760
Hmm, are you really my sister?

338
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,280
Why are you so kind today?

339
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,680
This is all you’d get to eat. The rest is mine.

340
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,280
Thanks a lot. Put it over there. I’ll eat them soon.

341
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,560
Aren’t you done? Go back to your room then.

342
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,600
I’m not in a hurry.

343
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,120
Your room looks so comfy today.

344
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,040
What?

345
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,120
Eat this first.

346
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,120
Eat it.

347
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,960
What is it?

348
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,160
I’ll get to the point then.

349
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,920
Okay.

350
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,280
How close were you and Dao when you two were studying abroad?

351
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,040
Grandma asked me to take care of her because she’s the favourite niece of her best friend. That’s all.

352
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,360
Have you and Dao ever been together?

353
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,640
You are quite a player. So, I think it’s possible.

354
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,120
- Geez, you monkey.   /    - Ouch.

355
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,640
That’s enough.

356
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,440
Just answer my question so that I can be at ease.

357
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,520
No, Dao and I are like brother and sister.

358
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,280
Okay, I feel better now.

359
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,720
What’s wrong with you, Miss Paranee?

360
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,320
Why are you so interested in Dao?

361
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,360
Well, she is beautiful and seems to know you well.

362
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,360
Our Grandma seems to like her a lot too.

363
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,560
So, I just want to know more about her.

364
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,360
That’s all.

365
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,200
She and you would probably make a perfect couple though.

366
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,920
I mean, consdisering all other factors.

367
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,040
She’s actually too good for someone like you.

368
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,400
But good enough for you, right?

369
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,040
What?

370
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,240
What?

371
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,920
Don’t try to be a shipper.

372
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,040
I’m leaving.

373
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,840
You’re changing the subject.

374
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,000
Namami. Where’s Namami?

375
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,120
Where’d he go?

376
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,760
Who’s this girl?

377
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,960
And this guy too.

378
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,520
Hmm, that girl is the one I often dream of.

379
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
That guy is my colleague.

380
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:32,640
Ahh, is he the one you were rushing out to see this evening?

381
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,120
Yeah.

382
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,920
I just feel that these two have something in common.

383
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,440
Huh? But this girl is just someone from your dream.

384
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,640
That’s right.

385
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:56,520
Hang on. Are you saying that you’re worried about your colleague whose name is Tharn?

386
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,520
So much that you try to relate him with a girl you often see in your dream?

387
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,760
Is this the answer you’ve always been looking for?

388
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,120
To find out who or what it is that you saw when you were drowning.

389
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,200
Nee.

390
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,120
Is your friend, Wi, still teaching at the Faculty of Archaeology?

391
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,920
The one you used to say she was cute?

392
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,360
Yeah.

393
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:33,360
When we last talked, she said she would quit to open an art gallery.

394
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Why?

395
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,120
Are you sure?

396
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,800
Yes, I am. My gallery has never bought or displayed this kind of art.

397
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,720
But I was told that it was sold here.

398
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,720
I’d still insist that my gallery has never bought that kind of art.

399
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,240
You can search the gallery if you want to.

400
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,280
You’re not lying to me, aren’t you?

401
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,640
No, I’m not lying.

402
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,600
Hey.

403
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,120
Phaya.

404
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,320
Wi.

405
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,080
How are you doing?

406
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,280
I’m good.

407
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,280
Long time no see.

408
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,440
It’s been over a year, I think.

409
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,480
I’m sorry for a sudden visit. I also come empty-handed.

410
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,080
By the way, that man looks very suspicious.

411
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,920
He’s looking for his artwork.

412
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,800
He said his girlfriend sold it to my gallery.

413
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,240
But I’ve never bought any artwork from his girlfriend.

414
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,240
This happens a lot in the art industry.

415
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
Stealing someone else’s works and sell them.

416
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,600
Some are rare antiques which the owners have no idea how valuable they are.

417
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,280
Those with a keen eye would buy them and resell at a much higher price.

418
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,480
When the owners of the work found out, they often came out to claim their rights of ownership.

419
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,040
But some of them are forged. They are fake ones.

420
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,080
You can hardly tell them apart from the original works though.

421
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,360
It sounds quite complicated but I got it somehow.

422
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,640
There’s always a story hidden behind each artwork.

423
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:10,200
Each has its own unique value, method, and expertise...

424
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,960
depending on the artist who has created that piece of work.

425
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,800
Those are what make the artwork valuable.

426
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:22,640
Is this why you decided to quit teaching at the university and open an art gallery instead?

427
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,120
Not really.

428
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,040
Why do you come to see me? Is there anything I can help?

429
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,200
If it were told by someone else, I wouldn’t have believed a word.

430
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,160
That all your dreams seem to be connected.

431
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,000
Do you have any idea now that you have seen my sketches?

432
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:08,040
Archaeology is the study of human past through landscapes, architectures, and other material remain...

433
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,840
with traces of culture in the past.

434
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,199
These are, however, what you saw in your dreams.

435
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,440
I can’t believe they can be connected into a story like this.

436
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:24,920
But what about the legend about Naga or the fireballs
which you can see on every 15th night of the 11th waxing moon?

437
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,800
There are records and traces found that it actually happened, aren’t there?

438
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,560
But those are proves for a living creature which is not human being.

439
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,639
It’s just a legend told among the locals.

440
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:43,440
Even for the Garuda. There’s hardly any record on this half-human and half-bird creature.

441
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,560
Most are just stories found in the religious mythology…

442
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,199
which cannot be proofed whether it’s true or not.

443
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,320
So, I’m afraid I can’t help you much with this.

444
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,800
I only say it from my point of view.

445
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,800
It might actually exist.

446
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,640
Like energy forces, souls, or miracles.

447
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,400
They are things that science can’t proof.

448
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,160
But there are stories told about them.

449
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,200
Someone had witnessed those things and record what they saw.

450
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,120
Can you tell me where to find more information about it?

451
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:32,800
There’s a corner in my gallery where I keep all the records on ancient history.

452
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,920
You can try looking in that room.

453
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,520
You might find something useful there.

454
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:33,920
(Mysterious Sound)

455
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,120
(The sound of bookshelves shaking)

456
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,640
King Garuda, why are you here?

457
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,680
Why did you help me?

458
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,320
You were still alive so I decided to help.

459
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,280
On the 15th day of the 11th month...

460
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:50,520
all the Nagas and Naginis as well as their attendants will present their offerings and breathe out the fireballs as an act of worship.

461
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,000
Beautiful, isn’t it?

462
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,600
Yes.

463
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,280
So beautiful.

464
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,360
I can’t go with you.

465
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,640
I don’t want anyone to die because of me.

466
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,760
Master Sakunanoparuj, this way.

467
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,720
Phaya!

468
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,520
Phaya!

469
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,200
Phaya!

470
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,600
What happened?

471
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,440
Ouch.

472
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,680
I was trying to get the book and the pile just tumbled down.

473
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,960
Are you all right?

474
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,920
Yeah.

475
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,600
I ran here as soon as I heard the noise...

476
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,600
and saw you lying unconcious on the floor.

477
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,960
It took quite some time to wake you up. I was so worried.

478
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,040
I’m so sorry. Your room is a mess now.

479
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,960
- Let me help you tidy up.
- It’s all right.

480
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,680
Ouch!

481
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,040
(The Son of Naga City Governor)

482
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,000
Wi, can I borrow this book for a while?

483
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,040
Sure.

484
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,080
Thank you.

485
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,720
Oh, hello Doc. Why didn’t you tell me you’d be here today?

486
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,320
My patient just cancelled the appointment.

487
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,040
So, I’m thinking maybe we could go out for dinner.

488
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,040
Do you want to join me?

489
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,680
Sure. Please come and wait in my room first.

490
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,480
I’ll go get changed.

491
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,520
Okay.

492
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,640
Please come in.

493
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,120
Where are you going?

494
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,640
He’s going to have dinner with me.

495
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,680
Do you need anything?

496
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,360
I’m afraid he can’t go with you now.

497
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,800
Because he’s coming with me.

498
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,240
Come with me, Tharn.

499
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,480
Hang on.

500
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,720
Did I say I’d go with you?

501
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,080
But I have something important to talk to you.

502
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,160
You have no rights to force him.

503
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,520
This is outside of your working hours.

504
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,480
My job is to take care of him.

505
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,000
But I don’t want to go with you.

506
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,080
Do you remember when I warned you that you might be in danger?

507
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,880
I told you to stay beside me so that I can protect you.

508
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,800
But I’m going with Doc. It’s not dangerous at all.

509
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,640
Tharn.

510
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,120
If you are really worried about him...

511
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,160
you’d better stay away from him.

512
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,680
The closer you get to him,

513
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,800
the more danger he’d be in.

514
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,960
The one who actually puts him in danger...

515
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,320
is probably not me.
But I think it is.

516
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,640
Since the day you met him, he has to risk his life to save you for so many times.

517
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,880
If he were to die,

518
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,920
you’re most likely to be the cause of it.

519
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,160
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Ouch!!

520
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,320
Just because he thinks of you as his big brother...

521
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,360
doesn’t mean that I’d be afraid of you.

522
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,920
I don’t really give a fuck about anything!

523
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,200
Phaya!

524
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,440
You mark my words.

525
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,760
I will do everything to keep you two apart.

526
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,200
I will take him away from you.

527
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,080
Even if he has to die.

528
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,200
What the fuck!!
(Punching)

529
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,240
Are you all right?

530
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,200
Tharn, come with me.

531
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,800
Come with me, Tharn.
Let me go!
(Punching)
Ouch!

532
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,760
What’s wrong with you?!

533
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,600
Let’s go.

534
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,000
Damn it!

535
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,960
I’m so sorry that he hurt you.

536
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,320
It’s okay. He’s probably very worried about you.

537
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,640
I don’t know what’s got into him.

538
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,360
But it makes me want to stay away from him from now on.

539
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,880
This is the floor plan of the art exhibition at the BACC.

540
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,960
It’s for the mission that I’ve informed you earlier.

541
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,880
I need a volunteer for this mission.

542
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,440
Our job is to protect the important people who would attend the event.

543
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,360
This is a special mission.

544
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,680
It’s not an order from the authority.

545
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,560
That’s why I’m looking for a volunteer.

546
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,600
Raise your hand if you want to volunteer.

547
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,040
Are you listening?

548
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,440
I asked if you were listening.

549
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,400
He asked if you were listening to what he just said.

550
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,440
I didn’t. But I was reading your lips.

551
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,600
You want some volunteers to work on a special mission which is not an order from the authority.

552
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,840
Their job is to protect the important people at the exhibition.

553
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,440
Those who want to volunteer please raise their hands.

554
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,960
(Clapping)
Wow!

555
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,440
You’re like a bugging device.

556
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,280
Then I’ll assume everyone already understood what the mission is.

557
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,840
Give me the name list once it’s done.

558
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,920
I want to do it.

559
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,240
I don’t think it’d be just a simple bodyguard job.

560
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,760
I agree.

561
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,960
It’s very strange.

562
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,280
Our unit has never taken any job like this before.

563
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,960
I’m sure there must be something behind this.

564
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,760
We are not allowed to reveal our identity as an IDF officer too.

565
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,160
It’s going to be so interesting.

566
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,360
You get to dress up nicely.

567
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,080
And work at a nice building.

568
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,560
After work, I will keep the suit on and take Sand to dinner at...

569
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,400
the food stall in the gas station.

570
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Yeah. And order a spicy minced pork salad with lots of blood.

571
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,360
Geez, you eat it yourself then. You got me carried away.

572
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,400
You seem to be in a lovey dovey mode.

573
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,640
Obviously.

574
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,720
- Are you in then?
- Of course.

575
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,720
- Singh, are you in?
- Yeah.

576
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,320
- If my babe is going then I’ll go too.
- (Sigh)

577
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,200
Are you going, Mayris?

578
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,360
No, Inspector probably wants me to find out more information on the Lieutenant Tam’s case.

579
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,240
Okay.

580
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,560
Lieut Tam’s case?

581
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,160
I thought the authority has ordered to have this case closed.

582
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,600
They have.

583
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,000
But the Inspector wants us keep investigating.

584
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,440
Because Lieut Tam’s body might lead us to the major drug trafficking network backed up by politicians.

585
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,600
Lieut Tam died in the line of duty.

586
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,840
Huh?

587
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,120
You guys didn’t know about this?

588
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,000
Ahh, you came later.

589
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,440
Apart from being a coach at our unit,

590
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,720
Lieut Tam also had another important job in our IDF unit.

591
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,040
He was one of the best spies we’ve ever had.

592
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,960
And he was also the Inspector’s right-hand man.

593
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,120
His mission was to track down the international drug trafficking network...

594
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,840
of which Minister Montree is believed to be the man behind it.

595
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,040
Songyod is also one of his minions.

596
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,480
He’s actually the Minister’s hand and foot.

597
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,800
Then why can’t we just go question Songyod and force him to tell us...

598
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,120
information that could help destroy Minister Montree’s network?

599
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,440
Our IDF unit’s main job is to investigate.

600
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,120
The execution of judgement…

601
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,760
or determination of punishment is the authority’s job.

602
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,560
- Which we cannot...
- We cannot cross the line, right?

603
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,760
Just like many cases in the past that were treated unfairly.

604
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,960
Yeah, including your the case about your parents too.

605
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,480
It’s a way to force us to go forward…

606
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,800
but with a rope around our neck.

607
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,400
They only allow us to walk in the direction that they are approved of.

608
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,480
Fake freedom, you mean?

609
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,160
Well then, I won’t be joining you guys this time.

610
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,040
I have a more important job to do.

611
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,360
(Sigh)

612
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,200
I’m in.

613
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,160
Then go and ask Phaya too.

614
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,600
I think he probably wants to join us too.

615
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
You go and ask him yourself.

616
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,400
Yai.

617
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,360
When did they quarrel?

618
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,760
Was it at his condo?

619
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,800
Do you really want to know?

620
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,160
It’s my job to know about other people’s businesses.

621
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,480
Then you go and ask him. I don’t want to mention it.

622
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,480
Geez! You two are the same.

623
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,600
I’ll ask baby then.

624
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,160
Baby, Tharn and…

625
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,920
Stop. You’re bothering me. Go away.

626
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,120
- That’s a lot.
- Yeah.

627
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,760
Inspector never disappoints us. His special mission is so cool.

628
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,680
I don’t want to hold a gun tonight.

629
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,800
I’d rather hold her instead. Oops!

630
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,680
If you don’t want to spend a night in a coffin, you’d better quit playing around.

631
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,680
- Baby.
- Good luck.

632
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,240
- I’ll go check on the other side.
- Okay.

633
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,520
If you are mad at him, you should clear it up with him when he comes to work tomorrow.

634
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,080
I don’t have anything to say to him.

635
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,360
Nothing to say? But your face already said it all.

636
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,880
He did that because he was worried about you.

637
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,200
Hey, Yai. Tharn.

638
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,880
You guys are here too?

639
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,560
Phaya? What on earth are you doing here?

640
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,120
I’m a guest.

641
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,600
This is my grandmother and my little sister.

642
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,960
- Hello.    /   - Hello.

643
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,920
Inspector has asked our team to help taking care of the security at the event.

644
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,520
Excuse me? Are you Tharn?

645
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,560
It’s been a long time since we last met. Do you still remember me?

646
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,920
Of course, I do.

647
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:56,720
Phaya only told me that he met a friend who saved his life when he was a kid.

648
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,160
I didn’t know that you also work at the same unit. The world is round indeed.

649
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,480
Well, it might not be because the world is round...

650
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,560
but rather a destiny that brought these two together.

651
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,200
Ouch.

652
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,200
- Um...   /   - Ouch.

653
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,120
I can remember your face but not your name.

654
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,840
- This is Yai, Grandma.
- You’re...

655
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,280
- Yes.
- Another kid at the temple who also saved me that day.

656
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:31,360
Oh, I see. Now that all of you live in Bangkok, we should see each other more often.

657
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,800
Please come to my place for a meal whenever you’re free.

658
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,680
I’d like to treat you both to a meal as a thank you for saving my grandson.

659
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,680
Thank you very much, Grandma.

660
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,640
I’m afraid we have to get back to work now.

661
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,200
Go on, dear.

662
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,760
- Goodbye.   /   - Goodbye.

663
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,640
See you.

664
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,760
- Grandma, please wait here for a second. I’ll be right back.
- Okay.

665
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,720
Tharn.

666
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,440
Can we talk?

667
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,360
You guys talk then.

668
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,480
You can do it!

669
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,600
What is it?

670
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,720
Well, about that night...

671
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,120
I’m sorry.

672
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,720
The one you should apologise to is him not me.

673
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,520
But the one I care about is you.

674
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,160
Why do you have to mention him?

675
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,520
Phaya.

676
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,560
When did you arrive?

677
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,040
My aunt is looking for you.

678
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,920
Where are Grandma and Nee?

679
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,680
Is this your colleague?

680
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,080
- Hello.   /   - Hello.

681
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,200
- I’ll go then.    /   - Hey.

682
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,440
Tharn!

683
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,160
Grandma and Nee are over there.

684
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,520
Please excuse me. I’ll go talk to my colleague first.

685
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,000
Tharn.

686
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,720
Doc? You’re here too?

687
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,880
I got invited.

688
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,440
It’s an exhibition displaying artworks which reflect on the human’s state of mind.

689
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,880
- Let’s go inside then.
- Okay.

690
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,680
Whom is Phaya talking to?

691
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,720
Is that the girl who came to see him at the unit?

692
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,240
Doctor Chalothorn.

693
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,040
Yes?

694
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,120
Someone wants to see you over there.

695
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,800
Okay.

696
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,280
I’m leaving then. I’ll call you after the event.

697
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,120
Okay.

698
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,800
This way, please.

699
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,960
Probably just a friend.

700
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,880
He’s still single, isn’t he?

701
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,440
It has nothing to do with me anyway.

702
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,440
Hmm, are you sure?

703
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,360
Look at your face first.

704
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,760
Your face and eyes just say it all.

705
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,440
Tell me honestly,

706
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,280
why would you resist your own feelings?

707
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,000
Love is love.

708
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:40,560
I want to see you happy again, Tharn.

709
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,720
I want to see you smile like you used to.

710
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,360
If you’re afraid that loving him would put him in danger,

711
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,680
I’ll also help you protect him.

712
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,600
No need.

713
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,360
I’ll do it because I want to see my brother happy.

714
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,440
Got it?

715
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,200
Don’t forget to remind the others to keep an eye on the artworks too.

716
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,440
(Something drops)

717
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,000
I’m sorry.

718
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,520
It's OK.

719
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,000
What a pleasure to meet you again, Inspector.

720
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,920
Hello, Mr. Montree.

721
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,800
Have we met before? You look so familiar.

722
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,640
Let me remind you again that your job today...

723
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,520
is to protect the safety of important guests who attend the event.

724
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,160
Arghhhh!!!

725
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,440
Love doesn’t exist. They are all lies.

726
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,400
You must pay for what you did.

727
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:02,920
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

728
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:10,360
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵

729
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:18,720
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

730
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:28,880
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

731
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:36,600
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵

732
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:41,040
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵

733
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,200
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

734
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:51,640
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

735
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,880
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

736
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:03,800
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
