(Exciting sound)

3
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,640
The chicken have been released. Over.

4
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,120
(Exciting sound)

5
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,840
Listen up, you only have 15 minutes.

6
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,680
Team A will rescues the hostage.

7
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,039
While Team B will try to defuse a bomb. And most importantly,

8
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,720
remember we have a hostage…

9
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,880
do not fire your guns if not necessary.

10
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,440
Got it?

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,720
Go!

12
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:31,120
(Exciting sound)

13
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,920

Section 1, cleared.

22
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:35,280
(Bomb ticking sound)

23
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,120
Cleared.

24
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:51,400

25
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,280

(Shooting sound)

28
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,640
Hey, cover me.

29
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,600
go!

30
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,000
(Shooting sound)

31
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,640
Phaya

32
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,400
Phaya, go!

33
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,560
Okay.

34
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,640
(Bomb ticking sound)

35
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,400
You go and handle upstairs.

36
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,600
I’ll take care of them here.

37
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,600
Okay.

38
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,840
Bastard!

39
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,280
Need any help?

40
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,120
Shut up.

41
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,880
(Door breaking sound)

42
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,800
A dummy.

43
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,080
Son of a bitch!

44
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,080
Where’s the hostage?

45
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,120
He’s not here.

46
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,520
We were fooled.

47
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,720
You two try to defuse the bombs here and in that room.

48
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,080
I’ll go rescue the hostage.

49
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,720
Got it?

50
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,400
Let’s go with the yellow one.

51
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,080
Hey!

52
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,400
(Fighting sound)

53
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,880
Hey!

54
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,120
Hey! Yai!

55
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,320
I’m here.

56
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,160
Cleared.

57
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Section 3, cleared.

58
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,760
Let’s go and rescue the hostage.

59
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,200
Okay.

60
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,520
There are two bombs on this floor.

61
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,240
You two stay here then.

62
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,760
I’ll go rescue the hostage. Go!

63
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,120
Khem.

64
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,920
What?

65
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,000
How much time do we have?

66
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,680
7 minutes.

67
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,720
Got it.

68
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,440
Cleared.

69
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,120
(Door breaking sound)

70
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,280
(Shooting sound)

71
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,800
Fuck! The hostage isn’t here.

72
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,880
Okay.

73
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,640
(Shooting sound)

74
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,640
(Shooting sound)

75
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,160
(Shooting sound)

76
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,680
Phaya!

77
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,880
How much time do we have left, Tharn?

78
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,000
5 minutes.

79
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,880
What to do?

80
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,400
Tharn.

81
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,400
Tharn.

82
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,040
Tharn.

83
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,920
Tharn.

84
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,320
Tharn!

85
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,120
(Shooting sound)

86
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,120
What the fuck, Chart?

87
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,040
The hostage is mine!

88
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,000
(Shooting sound)

89
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,280
Shit!

90
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,480
(Fighting sound)

91
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,080
(Fighting sound)

92
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,440
(Fighting sound)

93
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,400
Stop it, Chart!

94
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,520
Hey!

95
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,560
Stop!

96
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,400
(Fighting sound)

97
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,200
That’s enough!

98
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,320
Time’s up.

99
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,920
Team A and B, both of you failed to rescue the hostage.

100
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,480
So, both teams will be punished.

101
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,040
The main goal of this training is to create unity among both teams.

102
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,400
If any of you fail,

103
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,840
Everyone on the team also fails.

104
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,040
No one will take the responsibility alone.

105
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,720
Working as a team…

106
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,680
…means that you have to stick together.

107
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,080
And help watch each other’s back.

108
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,800
No one stands out.

109
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,040
No one is better than the others.

110
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,960
You both lose…

111
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,000
…because you don’t know how to work as a team.

112
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,920
But if we were competing, there must be a winner.

113
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,880
Shouldn’t we play by the rule?

114
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,160
Yes.

115
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,880
But not by doing something nasty like what you did today.

116
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,960
Although the mission always comes first…

117
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,800
…especially when you are on a real mission.

118
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,960
But I taught you how to fight to protect yourself and others.

119
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,760
Not to destroy one another.

120
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,880
Prepare for push-ups!

121
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,640
Ready!

122
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,040
Hooya!

123
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,480
300 push-ups! Go!

124
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,920
Hooya!

125
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,520
One

126
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,320
Two

127
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,440
Three

128
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,560
Four

129
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,800
Five

130
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,760
Six

131
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,000
Can you feel the unity among the team now?

132
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,360
If not…

133
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,600
…then we’ll keep training like this without any sleep.

134
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,760
Two

135
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Three

136
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,440
Four

137
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,680
Five

138
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,440
Six

139
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,120
- Do you get it now?
- Seven

140
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,120
- Eight , Nine
- Can you feel the unity among you now?

141
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,200
Ten

142
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,320
If not…

143
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,120
Let me help you.

144
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,840
Prepare for push-ups!

145
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,920
Ready!

146
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,680
Hooya!

147
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,880
Ouch!

148
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,240
What’s wrong?

149
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,000
Baby, my back hurts.

150
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,040
You cry like a dog.

151
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,840
Ouch!

152
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,320
Baby, wait for me.

153
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,600
So annoying.

154
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,520
Baby

155
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,440
Did you go to help Phaya…

156
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,560
…because you saw that he would be stabbed with the iron rod?

157
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,880
Let’s not talk about it.

158
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,960
Tharn.

159
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,480
If you don’t clarify yourself,

160
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,360
our team might misunderstand…

161
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,040
…and think that you betrayed us.

162
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,480
Misunderstand?

163
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,880
That’s better those who think I’m crazy.

164
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,400
Like when I was still in school.

165
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,760
- Hey!
- Hey!

166
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,839
What the fuck is wrong with you, Chart?

167
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,680
It’s your fault.

168
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,319
My team lost because of you!

169
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,520
You shouldn’t even be here!

170
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,400
- Hey!
- Hey!

171
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,880
What the fuck?

172
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,120
Tharn.

173
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,840
Hey!

174
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,280
Stop it, Chart!

175
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,560
Get off me!

176
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,040
That’s enough!

177
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,360
It’s over. Why can’t you admit it?

178
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,840
I never lose!

179
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,840
Tharn butted in to save you.

180
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,200
You told him to do that, didn’t you?

181
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,240
- Did you?!
- What are you talking about?

182
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,280
Then don’t butt in.

183
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,440
Let me go!

184
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,560
Just stop it!

185
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,080
Hey! The instructor is coming.

186
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,840
(Showering sound)

187
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,440
(Showering sound)

188
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,960
Ouch!

189
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,480
Every part of my body hurts. Ouch!

190
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,720
Will I make it to the end?

191
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,200
- Hey!
- Ouch! My leg.

192
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,480
Are you okay, Khem?

193
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,480
Baby, please help me.

194
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,440
Go help him, Yai.

195
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,920
Fine.

196
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,280
He forgot his shoes.

197
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,360
Geez.

198
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,920
What the fuck are you looking at?

199
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,120
Bastard.

200
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,000
Hey, leave him.

201
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,600
Let’s gets some sleep.

202
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,360
Ouch.

203
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,040
My leg hurts so much.

204
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,920
And we still have to do that training from hell tomorrow.

205
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,160
Will I survive it, Tharn?

206
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,680
Come on, Yai.

207
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,840
When Sand found out that you sneaked out to have fun…

208
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,880
…you ran over 10 km. without complaining about your legs.

209
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
I wasn’t afraid that my legs would fall off.

210
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,040
I was more afraid that my wife would chop my head off.

211
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,280
(Laughing sound)

212
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,920
Where is he now?

213
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,920
It’s all because of him…

214
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,520
…that makes us in trouble like this.

215
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You shouldn’t have helped him.

216
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,640
Then what? Should I just stand there and watch him die?

217
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,560
Well…

218
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,800
But did he even thank you?

219
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,840
Tharn.

220
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,120
I’m starting to wonder…

221
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,960
Why do your visions often involve Phaya?

222
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,360
You’ve never…

223
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,960
…had a vision about me at all.

224
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,720
You already have that amulet you got from the abbot to protect you.

225
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
You don’t need my protection.

226
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,160
Fine. But I’m still your brother.

227
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,760
You hardly care about my well-being.

228
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But you seem…

229
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
to care about him a lot.

230
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,120
(Sigh)

231
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,480
Ouch!

232
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,960
Hey.

233
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,560
Can we talk?

234
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,520
How did you know I was going to be stabbed with the iron rod?

235
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,440
It was surely not a coincidence.

236
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,800
You came to rescue me at the right moment.

237
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,600
You know…

238
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,480
…that it would happen.

239
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,400
I wasn’t going to help you.

240
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,160
It was a mistake.

241
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,680
I was going to rescue the hostage to end the game.

242
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,680
But then I saw you two fighting like cats and dogs.

243
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,240
I couldn’t help cutting in since both of you are my friends.

244
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,040
Otherwise, I would have won.

245
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,000
Are you sure?

246
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,440
I already told you.

247
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,080
So,  you’re saying that it was a coincidence.

248
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,120
I was saved from getting stabbed by the iron rod…

249
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,960
because you made a mistake?

250
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,640
What’s done is done. Why don’t you just leave it be?

251
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,480
(Whistle sound)

252
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,680
Hey.

253
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,800
Hurry up.

254
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,400
I’ll give you 1 minute.

255
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,400
We’ll go swimming today.

256
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,280
Hooya!

257
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,080
Swimming at 3 in the morning?

258
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,840
Hurry up.

259
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,160
You are about to receive a training from hell.

260
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,240
120 hours from now on…

261
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,320
or 5 days and 5 nights from now on…

262
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,040
we’d be training non-stop.

263
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,240
Got it?

264
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,560
Hooya!

265
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,880
If you think you can’t do it…

266
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,560
and want to quit,

267
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,520
you can always come out and ring that bell behind me.

268
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,640
Got it?

269
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,120
Hooya!

270
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,720
Does anyone want to quit now?

271
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,280
If not…

272
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,080
Let’s start with some activity to cool down your hot temper.

273
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,640
Take off your clothes. Now!

274
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,240
Hooya!

275
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,200
Fill this tank with ice.

276
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,360
This one too.

277
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,960
This one is good.

278
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,320
So is this one.

279
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,720
This is only one of the scenario you will face in the future.

280
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,000
On a real mission, it would be a hundred or thousand times tougher.

281
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,800
What you have to do is endure it.

282
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,120
Use your patience and strength.

283
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,640
And get through it.

284
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,720
Got it?

285
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,160
Hooya!

286
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,960
Baby,

287
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,120
I’m cold.

288
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,120
Hang in there.

289
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,320
(Breathing sound)

290
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,680
Instructor.

291
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,480
(Bell sound = Someone quit)

292
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,640
(Breathing sound)

293
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
Stab the neck!

294
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:05,960
Aye!

295
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,600
Slice!

296
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,280
Aye!

297
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,000
Slice!

298
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,840
Aye!

299
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,360
Chest out!

300
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,720
Out!

301
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,880
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

302
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,000
If you can’t do it, just go home!

303
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,040
(Whistle sound)

304
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,720
Hooya! Hooya!

305
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,240
Line up!

306
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,800
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

307
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,880
Slice!

308
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,560
Aye!

309
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,160
Slice!

310
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,840
Aye!

311
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,680
One.

312
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,360
Two.

313
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,960
Three.

314
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,760
Four.

315
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,760
One.

316
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,520
Two.

317
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,200
(Bell sound)

318
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,640
(Exciting sound)

319
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:58,120
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

320
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,000
Hey!

321
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,160
Hold it.

322
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,760
Ouch.

323
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,920
What happened?

324
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,640
If you can’t do it, throw the log away and all of you can leave.

325
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,760
What’s wrong, Tharn?

326
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,600
I saw it again, the vision.

327
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,600
What did you see?

328
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,640
Are you okay, Chart?

329
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,520
Fuck off.

330
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,800
You’re trying to slow us down so that Phaya would win, right?

331
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,320
Asshole.

332
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,800
Enough. Let’s move. Go!

333
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:54,760
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

334
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,160
- Hooya! Hooya!
- Oh!

335
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,560
Oh!

336
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,120
Instructor! Someone fell down the hill!

337
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,320
Move!

338
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,640
Stand back!

339
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,400
- Shit!
- Get out of the way!

340
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,960
Stay still. Don’t move.

341
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,160
Anyone hasn’t got it?

342
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,360
Hey, don’t look so serious.

343
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,240
This is not the first time, isn’t it?

344
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,480
That you saw a sign in your vision but couldn’t prevent it.

345
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,440
But Chart had to leave the training because of me.

346
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,280
Why couldn’t he just endure it until after tonight.

347
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,000
Tharn, can’t you remember what the abbot said?

348
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,160
You can’t help save everyone from facing their own karma.

349
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,320
Too bad we couldn’t stay and watch the fire balls with the abbot this year.

350
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,000
He’d probably feel lonely without us.

351
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,120
Captain, how is Chart?

352
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,200
Time’s up. Go stand in a row of 3.

353
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,560
- Hooya!
- Quick!

354
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,480
One, two, three! One…

355
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,560
- Lift up the log.
- Hooya!

356
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,040
One, two, three!

357
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,160
Take your log back to the unit.

358
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,160
- Go!
- Hooya!

359
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
Pull him up.

360
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,920
(Sigh)

361
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,280
(Sigh)

362
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,760
- Is everyone on board there?
- Yes, sir!

363
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,520
- What about that one?
- Yes, sir!

364
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,320
One person is missing here.

365
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
Phaya.

366
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Phaya!

367
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Phaya!

368
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,240
Hang on, Tharn!

369
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,640
We can’t help him. We’re still on a training.

370
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,360
But I saw it.

371
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
What did you see?

372
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,440
Master Sakuna-naparuj, come this way.

373
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,760
Pull him up!

374
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,000
Phaya.

375
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,239
Phaya.

376
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,680
Geez! I thought I was watching Jack and Rose.

377
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,880
Stop joking around.

378
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,160
The training is over.

379
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,640
You all are the survivors who passes the training.

380
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
Congratulation.

381
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:42,160
Whoopy! Yay!

382
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,680
Yah!

383
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,480
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

384
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,960
Congrats, Tharn.

385
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,320
You finally become a police officer like you’ve always wanted.

386
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,600
Apart from becoming a police officer,

387
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,200
there’s one more thing that I’ve always wanted to do.

388
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,520
But I don’t know if I’d be able to make it happen.

389
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,880
Yes, sweetie. I’m going to turn in. I’m so exhausted.

390
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,680
Okay. I’ll give you a call tomorrow.

391
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,720
- Hey, careful.
- Bye Bye. Sweet dream.

392
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,880
Careful. Easy there.

393
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,280
Geez, what are you doing?

394
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,840
Are you playing game? Sorry, babe.

395
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,560
What are you looking at?

396
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,040
I was just looking around.

397
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,920
I don’t think so.

398
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,640
Hey, who is this girl you’re drawing?

399
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,960
She looks so much like Tharn.

400
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,960
- Let me see.
- Look.

401
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,360
- Shit! It’s the same.
- Wow, it’s the same.

402
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,720
Look, Tharn. She looks exactly like you.

403
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,400
- Let me see.
- Oh.

404
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,240
Wow

405
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,080
- She’s beautiful.
- They look the same.

406
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,600
- Exactly.
- It’d be good to look this nice with my hair long.

407
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,360
Wansarut?

408
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,400
Let me see.

409
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,640
Hey!

410
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,160
I still haven’t seen it.

411
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,160
Booooo.

412
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,120
What’s wrong with him?

413
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,160
Wansarut? If she has a name, that means she exists.

414
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,480
Hold on, Wansarut?

415
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,000
Wansa.

416
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,840
Why is her name similar to Tharn’s?

417
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,480
What?

418
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,760
She also looks like him.

419
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,000
The name is quite similar too.

420
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,880
Do you like Tharn?

421
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,320
Awww.

422
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,480
Is your name Wansa?

423
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,640
Yes.

424
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,360
Awww.

425
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,640
You like him so much that you even draw his picture.

426
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,920
Seriously, why did you draw a picture of him?

427
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,440
Why do I have to tell you guys anything? It’s personal.

428
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,880
Awww, personal? I see.

429
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,560
This should be the talk of the town.

430
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,920
(Whistle sound)

431
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,880
Go to bed!

432
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Wait for me.

433
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,040
You won’t get away that easily.

434
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,160
Phaya.

435
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,120
Phaya would probably have a wet dream tonight.

436
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,400
Geez, just quit it.

437
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,480
Maybe he really likes you. That’s why he drew that girl who looks so much like you.

438
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:28,440
You and him were probably soul mates in the past life.

439
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,560
I knew it. It all began from the incident that day.

440
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,720
(Car horn sound)

441
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,720
Let’s go.

442
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,880
Woohoo! We’re finally here.

443
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,000
Off you go.

444
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,040
I think it’s that way, Tharn.

445
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,200
Let’s get something to eat. It’s over 2 hours before the car will arrive.

446
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,440
Okay.

447
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:17,240
Hi, babe. We’ve just arrived. I haven’t laid my eyes on any girls, trust me. I’m with Tharn.

448
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,640
Do you want to speak with him?

449
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,880
Tharn, go and find something to eat first.

450
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,960
I have a hunch that someone might get into trouble before we become a police officer.

451
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,960
Just go.

452
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,760
Hello, sweety. No, I swear I didn’t look at anyone.

453
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,720
Oh, there’s no signal here.

454
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,920
Babe, the signal is really bad here.

455
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,680
Can I have Stir-fried Pork with Holy Basil but without basil leaves and chilli please?

456
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:52,040
Oh, no MSG too. And only add half a spoon of salt and sugar. No cooking oil.

457
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,920
No long beans, carrot, or any mushrooms.

458
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,840
If you’re going to have it like that, why don’t you just cook it yourself?

459
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,000
Every single year, I have to deal with those pain-in-the-ass PTO like you.

460
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,840
I guess this year it’s you guys then.

461
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,120
Here, just write it down, you rascals.

462
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,400
Excuse me? Is there a table for one?

463
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:20,240
Open your eyes and look around. If you can’t wait, then go eat somewhere else.

464
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,920
Go find some place to sit down or else you’d get in the way of the food riders.

465
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
Um, you can sit with me if you don’t mind.
- quick

466
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:33,560
Are you done? So that I can take the order from other tables. Make it quick.

467
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:39,080
Hurry up. Other people are waiting. They are hungry too.

468
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,000
You rascals are so annoying.

469
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,720
Here you go. Just write down whatever you want to eat.

470
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,840
Be good though. Don’t be a pain like those rascals.

471
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,640
Ma’am, is Order no.138 ready?

472
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,400
Just a second. I’m going to do it now.

473
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,160
Why is it so busy today?

474
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,840
Auntie, can I order something to drink?

475
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:15,480
Hey, lower your voice. Can’t you see that drinks are self-service?

476
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,960
- So stupid.
- He’s probably blind.

477
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,160
Or can’t read.

478
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,840
There’s an update on a murder case where the victim was found dead with his hands and feet bound.

479
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,840
The victim is a male Caucasian with the age of around 30 years old.

480
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:38,600
He was found dead with his hands and feet bound. The police suspect that he was killed…

481
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,760
…before his body was hung up in this area of the woods.

482
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,080
The police are now gathering witnesses and evidence for the special investigation unit…

483
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,720
…to track down the killer behind this brutal murder.

484
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,800
- Oops!
- Hey!

485
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,360
- I’m so sorry.
- It’s all right.

486
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,440
He probably wanted to know whether his jacket is waterproof or not.

487
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,720
Why did you do that?

488
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,560
Why did I do what?

489
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,360
You stuck out your foot and made me tripped.

490
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,320
Do you have any evidence?

491
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,120
I can sue you for falsely accusing me.

492
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,160
Sue me my foot.

493
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,840
Did you just push me?

494
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,120
- Eat this.
- Hey!

495
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,160
Fuck off.

496
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,480
Ouch!

497
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,560
Damn you.

498
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,280
Hey!

499
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,080
Ouch.

500
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,840
Hey!

501
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,520
Let’s go.

502
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:14,840
Go!

503
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,640
My shop is ruined, you rascals!

504
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,080
Scumbags! Why did it have to be at my shop?!

505
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,840
I have a hunch that my little brother is about to fall in love.

506
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,360
Ouchhhh.

507
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,600
You guys seem to be destined for each other.

508
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,200
Let’s ask the abbot to look at your birthdate tomorrow, shall we?

509
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,960
- Just go to sleep.
- Ouch. You rascal.

510
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,000
Guys.

511
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,040
The instructor told me that Chart is all right now.

512
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,760
He’s coming to pack his things today.

513
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,960
Too bad he has to leave the training.

514
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,160
He’s quite skillful.

515
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,640
He’d have been a great asset to our police force.

516
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,400
He isn’t only skillful but also pretty nasty.

517
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,880
I agree.

518
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,160
Yeah.

519
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,960
Let him be.

520
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,960
Just chuck it. We’re here to train so there must be those who pass and fail.

521
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,760
Yeah, chuck it.

522
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,480
I think…

523
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,320
There’s something more interesting.

524
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,120
Tharn

525
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,400
Do you want to know more about the picture that Phaya drew?

526
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,320
Do you want to know where he got the idea from?

527
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,080
Hey.

528
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,440
Aha

529
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,280
- Hey.
- What?

530
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,160
Let’s throw him into the sea.

531
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,360
- Okay.
- I’ll take the arms.

532
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,960
- I’m in.
- Me too.

533
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,440
Shhh!

534
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,640
(Stretching)

535
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,440
It’s so hot.

536
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,960
What are you guys up to?

537
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,960
(Stretching)

538
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,880
(Stretching)

539
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,080
Let’s go!

540
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,400
What the hell are you doing?! Let me go!

541
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,800
- Yai! Let me go!
- Yai!

542
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,840
Let me go!

543
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,960
- Stop it!
- What the fuck’s wrong with you?!

544
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,600
- Go, go!
- Let him go!

545
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,440
- Let’s throw him!
- Let me go!

546
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,640
- Let’s go!
- Stop!

547
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,960
Stop it!

548
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,840
Yai, let me go!

549
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,080
-Then you have to tell Tharn where you got the idea for that picture you drew.
- Yeah.

550
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,960
That’s right.

551
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,640
I have nothing to do with this.

552
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,560
- Let him go right now, Yai.
- Fine! Just get off me!

553
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,680
- Get off me!
- Okay.

554
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,760
- You got what you asked for.
- Let’s go.

555
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,400
(Laughing sound)

556
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,720
What the fuck?!

557
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,640
Awww.

558
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,840
What’s wrong with you guys?!

559
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,320
Guys…

560
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,840
Is that a corpse?

561
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,400
Shit!

562
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,440
Don’t touch it.

563
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,400
Have you informed the authority?

564
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,640
Call the authority.

565
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,280
Are you sure? I don’t think so.

566
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,600
Yai, what’s wrong?

567
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,680
I know the identity of that corpse.

568
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,360
Who is it?

569
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,400
Lieutenant Tam.

570
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,000
Really?

571
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,320
Didn’t he take leave to visit home in Phuket since last week?

572
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,840
Dio you know how he died?

573
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,200
I’ve known it for quite some time. I’m about to tell you guys too.

574
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,200
- Eww, Khem!
- Oops! Sorry.

575
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,880
Go and finish your business first!

576
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,040
Geez.

577
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,320
(Flushing sound)

578
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,400
I overheard Captain Akk and the instructors talking that it’s a suicide.

579
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,040
When they informed his wife, she said she found a suicide note there.

580
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,680
It said that he was stressed because he couldn’t pay back the gambling debt. So, he killed himself.

581
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,800
Lieutenant Tam had a gambling debt?

582
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,120
That’s weird.

583
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,520
Why did he have to come all the way to the camp kill himself here?

584
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,960
Stop chatting

585
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,200
and get ready for the class!

586
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,120
Later then.

587
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,800
- Let’s go.
- Yes, sir.

588
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,040
From now on, the training will be divided into 2 parts.

589
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,560
In the morning, you’ll learn some techniques and skills in fighting, and how to use special weapons.

590
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,320
You’ll also have to do a field investigation.

591
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,280
In the afternoon,

592
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,240
you’ll learn the theory of special investigation.

593
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,040
The whole training program will take 200 hours.

594
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,720
There’ll be an exam to evaluate your performance at the end of the training.

595
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,040
I want you all to pay attention and do your best.

596
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:41,080
Your score will affect your chance to be on the special investigation unit.

597
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:46,240
We’d only take 5 of you this year.

598
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,600
Yes?

599
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,200
What about those who couldn’t pass the exam?

600
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,920
They’ll be allocated to other units.

601
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,360
Any questions?

602
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,400
Yes?

603
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,520
I have doubts about Lieutenant Tams’ death.

604
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,800
Do you really believe that he killed himself?

605
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,600
What makes you think he didn’t?

606
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,480
I think it doesn’t make sense.

607
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:43,520
You can’t rely on your feelings during the investigation.

608
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,560
You need evidence.

609
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,720
Find the evidence to confirm or contradict your feelings.

610
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,520
Okay

611
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:00,560
I’ll find the evidence to confirm whether he killed himself or not.

612
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,600
Phaya.

613
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,800
Wait up

614
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,000
I want to talk about what happened this morning.

615
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,080
Which one?

616
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:03,160
The one where Yai threw me into the sea, or the one where you stole a kiss from me.

617
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,560
I didn’t kiss you. It was an accident.

618
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,920
Do you really think I want to kiss you so badly?

619
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,960
Hey!

620
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,600
Why didn’t you tell me you’d stop?

621
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,360
My butt hurts because of you.

622
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,640
Do you want me to help carry you back? Looks like it really hurts.

623
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,120
Come on.

624
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,600
I can walk by myself.

625
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,000
You’re such an ass!

626
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,680
You know what? When you’re whining like a kid like this…

627
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,720
you actually look cute somehow.

628
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,640
Cute my foot.

629
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:48,000
I don’t give a damn if you’re angry with me because of what happened this morning.

630
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,760
I forgave you since when you stole my kiss

631
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,040
Hey!

632
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,280
Asshole.

633
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,120
Where are you going, Phaya?

634
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,240
Hey!

635
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,560
Hey!

636
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,320
Wait up!

637
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:22,240
Hey, stop stop!

638
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,880
Why are you in a hurry? Where are you going?

639
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,560
Tharn.

640
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,240
We’re going to celebrate surviving the training from hell tonight. Do you want to join us?

641
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,520
Do you want to join us?

642
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,920
Yeah. Are there boozes too? I want to drink.

643
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,800
You? You want to drink?

644
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,640
Wow

645
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,040
Why? Did you have a quarrel with someone?

646
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:57,360
I had a quarrel with a jellyfish. It stung me by getting on my nerve.

647
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,040
Hey, what the heck? What’s wrong?

648
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,800
Whom did you quarrel with? Just tell me.

649
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,800
How can you quarrel with a jellyfish? Do you think he’s nuts?

650
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,640
The one who’s nuts is you. How can you believe what he said?

651
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,280
- Is there a brain in there?
- Ouch.

652
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,160
It hurst as if I was stung by the jellyfish.

653
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,000
How do you know? Have you ever got stung by a jellyfish?

654
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,560
No, but I have tasted it. Boo!

655
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,080
Boo, my foot.

656
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,680
Why do you have to be so serious?

657
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,840
You’re starting to like me again, aren’t you?

658
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,400
Stop fooling around.

659
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,800
I can’t because my life is like a fool.

660
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,040
Baby, wait for me.

661
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,880
Shrimps, shells, crabs…where’s fish?

662
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,760
Squid?

663
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,000
Look how he smells them.

664
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,320
Thank you!

665
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,800
Just sit down!

666
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:02,440
I was wondering why Sergeant granted us permission to come out.

667
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,480
It’s actually because he wants us to eat at his wife’s restaurant.

668
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,040
Shhh! Keep your voice down.

669
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,720
Yai, take care of him.

670
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,640
- Got it, Sergeant.
- Just smack him in the head.

671
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,200
Hang on. Let me do it.

672
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,640
- Yai
- Just smack him in the head.

673
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,320
Hang on. Let me do it.

674
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,960
- Okay then.
- Please enjoy your meal.

675
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,040
Why are you bickering? How nice it is that we can get out of the camp tonight?

676
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,040
Okay, guys. Cheers!

677
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,160
For the survivors of the training from hell!

678
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,440
Let’s stand up!

679
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,760
Cheers!

680
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,280
- I’m all wet.
- Ahh, feeling so fresh.

681
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,480
This is what I call life.

682
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:53,400
By the way, where is Phaya? Didn’t we invite him too?

683
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,360
- We did. We invited everyone.
- I already told him.

684
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,440
He was playing hard to get. Leave him be.

685
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,720
- Baby, do you want to eat anything? I’ll get it for you.
- No need.

686
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,200
Can I ask you guys something? Are you two broken up?

687
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,720
- No.
- Yes.

688
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,000
Huh?

689
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,400
So, what is it? Are you guys still together?

690
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:21,680
Of course not. I was so tired while we were still together.

691
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:25,600
Tired of getting hurt because I was cheated.

692
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,560
If you know anyone who is single, please recommend him to me.

693
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,760
Okay.

694
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,600
Maybe I might not want to stay single any more.

695
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,840
Don’t listen to him, Yai. Forget it.

696
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,560
- What’s that?
- Baby, don’t be like this.

697
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:43,360
Tharn is my type too. But I’m not sure if you’re still single.

698
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,600
My bro is not only single. He’s a virgin too.

699
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,240
He’s never done it with anyone before.

700
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,040
Really? You’ve only done it with your hands, right?

701
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:55,840
Hey,

702
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,600
watch your mouth.

703
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,280
Ouch, baby.

704
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,560
Are you really single? Why?

705
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,720
I haven’t met the right one yet.

706
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,160
I like being alone too.

707
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:16,480
It’s okay, bro. Don’t look so sad. You’re having it quite bad, huh?

708
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,320
Let’s not talk about love.

709
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,320
Let’s talk about something else.

710
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,480
He’s quite unlucky in love.

711
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,920
As if he were cursed.

712
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,240
It’s you who have cursed me.

713
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,080
I was just kidding.

714
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,320
- Hey.
- Where’re you going?

715
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,320
I was just pulling your leg. Are you really going to leave?

716
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,200
I’m going to wee.

717
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,880
Let’s drink to that then.

718
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,720
- Down in, Thongthai.
- Yeah.

719
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,360
Okay.

720
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,040
Geez, what’s wrong with the zipper?

721
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,000
Let me help you.

722
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,000
What the fuck are you doing?

723
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,040
If you don’t need my help then do you want me to zip it back down?

724
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,680
- my help then do you want me to zip it back down?
- No.

725
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,720
What took you so long?

726
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,320
I’ve been here for a while. I went smoking outside.

727
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:52,040
Is it true that you are still single?

728
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,120
Why are you interested?

729
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,840
I didn’t at first.

730
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:08,160
But when I found out that you’re still single, you suddenly become interesting to me.

731
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,680
(Tharn’s thought: What are you saying, Phaya?)

732
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,760
(Tharn’s thought: Stop looking at me like that.)

733
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,200
(Tharn’s thought: And why am I blushing?)

734
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,360
Why are you interested in me?

735
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,800
Well, I just wonder…

736
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:37,480
that you’re quite grown up but still single and virgin too.

737
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,800
I never know that a virgin would look like this.

738
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,000
Hey!

739
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,400
Asshole!

740
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,840
You evil nasty jellyfish!

741
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,520
I’ve got a lot queuing up for me. I just don’t want to be with them.

742
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Damn it!

743
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,320
What’s up, guys?

744
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,320
Phaya, where have you been?

745
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,080
I just went to the loo.

746
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:15,920
Cheers!

747
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,880
- You’re late. I’m so drunk already.
- Cheers!

748
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,840
Serg! Bravo!

749
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,600
Awesome, Serg!

750
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,680
- He’s so drunk.
- Serg! Hey, hey, hey…

751
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,200
Khem!

752
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,920
- Khem!
- Yai, look at him.

753
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,120
Khem!
- Yai, get him back here.

754
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,880
You guys, come out and dance with me.

755
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:42,720
Geez!

756
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,640
Yai, get him back here.

757
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,760
Geez,

758
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,640
he’s so drunk.

759
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,800
- Go back to your table.
- Oh, come on.

760
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,480
Go sit down.

761
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,560
Hey, cheers.

762
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,560
Okay.

763
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,520
Come on, Yai.

764
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,640
- You’re too loud.
- Just sit down.

765
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,280
- Sit down, Khem.
- Sit down.

766
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,720
Let’s play a game.

767
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,840
- What game?
- Clear the table.

768
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,600
- Move that away.
- What game?

769
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,800
It’s called ‘Spin the Bottle’ game.

770
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,040
Spin the bottle?

771
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:26,000
If the bottle points towards anyone,

772
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,840
that person must answer the question asked by the others.

773
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,120
If that person refuses to answer,

774
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,840
he must down the glass.

775
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,800
Down it?

776
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,760
- Got it?
- Okay, let’s play.

777
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,440
- Bring it on.
- Yeah.

778
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,840
First, let’s fill up your glass.

779
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,960
What? Again?

780
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,360
- Fill up his glass too.
- You go first.

781
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,440
Now, we’re all even.

782
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,360
You’re so wasted, Khem.

783
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:57,520
Come, come.

784
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,000
Tharn.

785
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,160
Who’s going to ask?

786
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,440
Khem, you ask him.

787
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:17,440
Do you like anyone in this table?

788
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,920
- Answer me.
- Answer, answer, answer!

789
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:30,080
Oh, come on.

790
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,200
Then you spin it.

791
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,240
- Down it.
- Spin it.

792
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,280
Spin it, Tharn.

793
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,120
- Oh, Yai.
- It’s your turn.

794
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,560
Why me?

795
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,560
- I’ll ask you.
- Okay.

796
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,480
What is he like when he’s drunk?

797
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,800
Why are you laughing?

798
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,120
- Do you really want to know?
- Yeah.

799
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,640
- I don’t want to imagine it.
- You know?

800
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:59,360
I just went out with him. He got drunk and jumped into the canal naked.

801
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,200
Ohhh!

802
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,800
- Naked?
- Yes.

803
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,200
Do you want to see it today?

804
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,240
Then, let’s get him drunk!

805
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,160
- Mine is empty.
- Let’s fill it up.

806
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,360
Cheers!

807
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,760
It’s Yai again.

808
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,560
Down it.

809
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:36,760
Shhh! Keep it down.

810
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,280
Are you okay?

811
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,720
Let’s go.

812
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,760
Let’s go.

813
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,800
Aren’t you going to help?

814
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,880
He’s your brother, not mine.

815
01:05:55,600 --> 01:06:01,320
But he’s so drunk because you encouraged him to drink and play that stupid bottle game.

816
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,640
Why are you so interested in his life?

817
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,520
Everyone already left but you still stuck around and encouraged him to drink.

818
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,160
Everyone already left but you still stuck around and encouraged him to drink.

819
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,960
- Phaya.
- Shhh!

820
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,400
Keep your voice down, Yai.

821
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,200
Geez, is he going to be all right?

822
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,560
The instructor’s coming this way.

823
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,960
Shhh!

824
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,600
About Lieutenant Tam’s case, what are you going to do next?

825
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,000
They told us to close the case and treat it as a suicide.

826
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,640
They already took away all the forensic evidence.

827
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,440
Tell our men to collect more data and evidence.

828
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,920
Both around the place where the body was found, and the surrounding area.

829
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:03,200
Thoroughly check all the surveillance cameras, both in land and water.

830
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,440
Make sure you send all the data to me first.

831
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,440
What about the request from the authority to explore the area for gathering more evidence?

832
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:18,480
Tell them that we’d gather all the info and evidence and will forward it to them.

833
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,400
But not right now.

834
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:28,640
I’m going to keep it confidential first.

835
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,720
Please gather all the data for me.

836
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,000
Yes, Captain.

837
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,000
I’m not going to force any of you to go with me.

838
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,640
But if I turn a blind eye to this matter, I don’t think I’d deserve to become a cop

839
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:07,960
I’m in.

840
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,200
If you’re in, I’ll do it too.

841
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,640
Me too.

842
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,640
What are they doing here?

843
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,319
They said they lost something at the beach,

844
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:19,000
so they want to look at the surveillance camera dated 2 days back.

845
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:25,200
Master Sakuna-naparuj, come this way.

846
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:51,560
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

847
01:08:51,560 --> 01:09:07,520
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

848
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:17,479
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

849
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:32,880
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

850
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:40,160
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

851
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:44,359
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

852
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:52,279
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
