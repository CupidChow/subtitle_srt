00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,840

- Thank you for looking after him.

You can leave him with me now.

We might have met before but I couldn’t remember it.

49
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,760
But we’d probably meet more often after this.

50

Please excuse us.

Of course.

52
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,280
- Yai.
- Yeah?
Do you think Phaya and Tharn are now...

Let’s drink for my bro then.

- Down it.
- You've finished your last drink.

57
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:16,800
Hey, I thought you were dropping Tharn off. Why are you back so early?
Yeah.

58
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,079
Or did I give you a wrong location?

59
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,839
That’s why you’re back here so fast.

Slowmotion? Is that even a name?

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,160
Hey! Listen to me.

63
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,120
Whatever. He just parked in front of us and said...

64
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,280
that he’s Tharn’s big brother.
So, Tharn just left with him.

65
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:48,880
Ahhh, Dr. Chalothorn.
Yeah, that Chalothorn. Who is he?
Tharn and I have known him since when we were kids.

66
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,320
He’s always looking after Tharn.

67
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,280
Good for him. Now he’d have someone to look after him whenever he’s drunk.

68
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,560
Isn’t a doctor supposed to take care of a sick patient?

69
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,840
How come he has to take care of a drunkard too.

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,120
- A doctor takes care of a drunken man.
- How would he take care of him?
So do I.

71
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,040
How would he take care of him?

72
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,000

73
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,800
- Take a shower
- Yeah

How can you let him taking a shower with a stranger?

75
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Why not?
We did that a lot too.
A lot? Did you say ‘a lot’?!

76
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,760
So often?

77
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,200
What’s wrong with you?

78
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,960
Calm down, man. You’d break all the glasses.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,320
- I’m more worried about the beer.
- Be careful, P'Yai, be careful.

80
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,240
Hey, where are you going?
I’ll be back!

81

Whatever. Go ahead and down it, Yai.
Yeah. Bottoms up.

- Not yet.

00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,720
He has a beautiful face like a girl.

175
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,120
- Grandma.
- Yes?

176
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,840
Can I ask you something?

177
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,800
Please remember this picture.

178
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,040
And this picture.

179
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,960
Are they twins?

180
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Are they both your friends?

181
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,000
I knew it. I’m not the only one who thinks like that.

182
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,080
- This one is Tharn. He’s my friend at the training camp.
- Um

183
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,880
This one is the girl I often saw in my dream.

184
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,840
I don’t know why I dream of her quite often these days.

185
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:58,560
That’s strange. Usually, you’d only dream of her on the 15th day of the 11th waxing moon.

186
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,680
How come it happens very often these days?

187
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,840
I have no idea. I don’t why it happens too.

188
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,440
I think you’re probably tired and stressed from work.

189
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,560
That’s why you keep dreaming about it so often.

190
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,360
Huh

191
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,360
Grandma.

192
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,480
I think maybe it’s time for me to find out...

193
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,800
what those dreams actually mean.

194
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,040
How will you do that?

195
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,680
You’ve been researching and studying about them for so many years, haven’t you?

196
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,640
I’m going to start from where it begins – where all those dreams started.

197
00:17:52,080 --> 00:18:01,120
(Phone buzzing)

198
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,400
(Big bro Yai)

199
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,520
(Phone buzzing)

200
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,160
Did I do anything weird last night?

201
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,640
Hey, what’s up?

202
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,800
Are you a sober now? Did you just pass out last night?

203
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,360
Yeah.

204
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,840
I have no idea how I got home.

205
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,840
I only remember that I was with Phaya.

206
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,160
That’s right.

207
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,840
Phaya was supposed to drop you off at home.

208
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,920
But the doctor came and took you home instead.

209
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
I can’t remember a thing.

210
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,160
When Phaya came back to the table...

211
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,840
he was really upset and kept asking me about you and the doctor.

212
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,280
What did you tell him?

213
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
Well...

214
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,600
I told him that...

215
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,720
I can’t remember either.

216
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,640
I got so wasted last night.

217
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,000
(P'Yai laughing)

218
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,320
Oops, am I too loud?

219
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,640
I’m sorry, babe.

220
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,840
We both got so wasted last night.

221
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,760
I know, right? It was so much fun though.

222
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,920
By the way,

223
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,000
why didn’t you tell Phaya the truth?

224
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,520
The truth?

225
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
What truth?

226
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,680
That you like him.

227
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,880
Geez, who likes him?!

228
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,240
You do.

229
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,120
I thought you like him, don’t you?

230
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,560
Like him, my arse

231
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,520
(Bell sound)

232
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,160
I gotta go.

233
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,200
Okay. Bye.

234
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,160
Ouch!

235
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
(Bell sound)

236
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,160
(Sound of door opening)

237
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,800
Hi, doc.

238
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,000
It’s ready, Tharn.

239
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,480
Boiled rice, fresh from the oven.

240
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,920
Let me do that.

241
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,720
Eat with while it’s still hot.

242
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,600
So that you’d feel better from the hangover.

243
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,080
Thank you.

244
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,560
Is everything all right?

245
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,080
Does it taste that bad?

246
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,720
Oh no. It’s really good.

247
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,560
The food you buy for me always tastes really good.

248
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Thank you so much.

249
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,960
And...

250
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,360
thank you about last night too.

251
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,520
Tharn.

252
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,040
Who’s that friend who was looking after you last night?

253
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,560
I’ve never seen him before.

254
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,960
His name is Phaya. He’s my friend at the unit.

255
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,480
Seems like you two are quite close, aren’t you?

256
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Because last night I noticed that.

257
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,080
He was really worried about you.

258
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,360
Not that close.

259
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,680
He just likes to annoy me and get on my nerve.

260
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,280
Go on and finish your food.

261
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,440
Then I’ll drop you off.

262
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,560
What!

263
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,720
Drop me off? Do I have to go somewhere?

264
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,960
Did you forget that you have to fly to Nongkai today?

265
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,360
Oh, that’s right!

266
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,840
If you hadn’t remind me then I’d have missed the flight for sure.

267
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,080
Go pack your things then.

268
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,520
Yai!

269
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,040
Wake up right now!

270
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,960
Did you forget that you have to go to Nongkai?

271
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,600
Nongkai.

272
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,120
Look at her.

273
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,200
She was giving me all ears while we were on the plane.

274
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,360
She’s still mad with me.

275
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,920
So, my dear brother.

276
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,680
Help me make up with her.

277
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,720
Or else I’d be cleaning the toilet at home during the festival this evening.

278
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,200
Seriously…

279
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,120
Sand isn’t that kind of girl. She’ll forgive you soon enough.

280
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,800
Before you said that...

281
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,360
make sure you look at her face first.

282
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,640
She’s gorgeous.

283
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,560
I know that. But she’s also very scary. I’m afraid of her.

284
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,960
Are you guys talking about me?

285
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,320
Of course, not.

286
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,200
He was telling me how nice you are.

287
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,040
And that you look really beautiful today.

288
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,240
But you’d look even more beautiful...

289
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,320
if you stop being mad at him.

290
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,960
Incredibly beautiful, my baby.

291
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Do you want some water? The weathe is quite hot.

292
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,080
But you look even hotter.

293
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,320
Tonight at the festival...

294
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,280
should we go try something delicious?

295
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:13,600
Okay.

296
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,520
Like Spicy Papaya Salad...

297
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,480
And grilled river fish with chilled beer.

298
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,160
My mouth is watering just by thinking of them.

299
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,400
How would you like that, honey?

300
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,040
Yes, I really love chilled beer.

301
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,040
Those are all your favourites, huh?

302
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,040
I still haven’t lectured you about last night.

303
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,640
That you got so drunk and almost made us both miss the plane.

304
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,560
Oh, so you remembered? Why didn’t you tell me then?

305
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,760
Are you blaming me now?

306
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,240
Is it my fault?

307
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,800
What? Of course, not, sweetie.

308
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,880
I was just kidding. Please forgive me. It’s all my fault.

309
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,280
It’s my fault. Please tell me what you want me to do tonight, my baby.

310
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,000
Please behave. We’re at the temple.

311
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,600
Let’s go see the Abbot.

312
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,360
Honey, wait for me too. Don’t you want some water?

313
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,360
I bought it from over there.

314
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,720
Isn’t she adorable? That’s my wife.

315
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,560
Goodmorning, Luangpor.

316
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,600
Morning.

317
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,360
Come a little closer. I’m happy for you two.

318
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,200
You’re now on the special investigation team just like what you’ve wanted to.

319
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,720
It’s all because of you, Luangpor,

320
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,560
that we could finally did it.

321
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,520
You’ve always taken a great care of us.

322
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,680
We are who we are because of you.

323
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,560
We are so grateful to you.

324
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,200
You did it because you already have it in you.

325
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,480
Please take a good care of yourself from now on.

326
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,120
Be mindful in everything you do.

327
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,040
Never lose your awareness.

328
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,560
Always be calm.

329
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
Don’t be a hotheaded.

330
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,280
As long as he has me with him, I’ll always make sure he behaves.

331
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,280
I’ll always make sure he behaves.

332
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
You can rest assured that he’ll always be mindful.

333
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Maybe you should tell that to yourself first.

334
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,280
Whenever they are together, there’s always trouble.

335
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,360
I agree.

336
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,080
Totally agree.

337
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,040
Without you...

338
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,360
harn would surely be more calm and always think twice.

339
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,320
You are quick-tempered and act on impluse.

340
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,080
Please mercy me.

341
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,800
Darling, I got scolded again.

342
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,240
There you go.

343
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,840
Ouch! It really hurts, babe.

344
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,880
Does it?

345
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,680
Does it hurt a lot?

346
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,760
Ouch!….

347
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,240
Go that way.

348
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,920
While you’re staying here.

349
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,200
Let me warn you about something

350
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,280
Make sure you often meditate and dedicate the merits to those whom you have wronged in the past.

351
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,280
So that it would help lighten the consequences of your karma.

352
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,360
Got it?

353
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,200
Is he still not free from them?

354
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,160
They’ve been after him since when he was born.

355
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,320
That’s why he had to live at the temple.

356
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,040
What do they want from him? Why are they so vengeful?

357
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,920
Are you going to Rocket Festival tonight?

358
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,840
Absolutely. They won’t miss the chance.

359
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,280
Do you want to go home to visit your grandma first?

360
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,440
We can meet again this evening.

361
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,840
’m going to stay here tonight.

362
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,640
So that I can help take care of the Abbot.

363
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,280
You and Yai go back first.

364
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,720
I’ll give you a call later.

365
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,880
Okay.

366
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,440
We’d get going then. Goodbye, Luangpor.

367
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,680
Stay safe, both of you.

368
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,000
Tharn, can you do me a favour?

369
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,320
Luangpor,

370
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,520
Why do you ask me to bring an extra set of bedding?

371
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,040
Someone will also sleep here tonight.

372
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,880
Go and make your bed in the pavillioin first.

373
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,040
Okay.

374
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,920
Phaya!

375
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,160
Tharn!

376
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,120
What on earth are you doing here?

377
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,680
Goodevening, Luangpor. Do you remember me?

378
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,480
Oh, I haven’t seen you for a long time. How are you?

379
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,240
I’m good.

380
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,720
You two spent a lot of time together during the training, didn’t you recognised each other?

381
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,880
Do you mean, Phaya and I...

382
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,720
have met before we went to the training camp?

383
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,800
That’s right.

384
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,800
You used to give him the amulet when he was young.

385
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,920
What?

386
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,320
You’re that boy who gave me the amulet?

387
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,840
Thank you so much, Luangpor.

388
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,320
For always taking care of Tharn since the day he lost his parents in an accident.

389
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,400
You and this temple...

390
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,760
have always been a sanctuary for Tharn and I.

391
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,080
He often told me that all he has is his grandmother.

392
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,640
So, he doesn’t want anything bad to happen to you.

393
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,560
That’s why he asked if he could live here.

394
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,680
I don’t want him to blame himself.

395
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,960
I could only hope that...

396
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,000
he will eventually forget about that terrible accident when he gets older.

397
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,080
Everything has already been destined.

398
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,480
His life is written by the karma he did in his past life.

399
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,400
Is there a way to fix it?

400
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,200
Well, there is somehow.

401
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:55,600
His destiny has been entwined with someone since his past life.

402
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,480
That person will lead him to experience bad things.

403
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:07,520
But it is also that person who would be able to free him from his karma.

404
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,320
Tharn, let’s go to the festival.

405
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,360
Tharn, it’s the 15th day of the 11th waxing moon today. Are you going to the Rocket Festival with Yai?

406
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,640
Yes, grandma.

407
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,520
Please don’t worry.

408
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,200
I’ll take a good care of myself.

409
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,680
When the festival is done, I’ll go visit you at home.

410
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,920
Take care of each other, okay?

411
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,520
Yes, grandma.

412
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,040
- Let's help pack up
- Okay.

413
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Tharn, I need a little favour from you.

414
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,480
Make sure you track down the owner of this amulet by tonight.

415
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,440
Once you’ve found him, give him this amulet.

416
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,640
Who is the owner of this amulet, Luangpor?

417
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,880
If you meet him, your feelings will tell you.

418
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,080
Who is the owner of this necklace?

419
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,760
But you must find him.

420
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,080
Whether you’d be free from those whom you have wronged in the past...

421
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,560
depends on whether you’d be able to find the owner of this amulet tonight.

422
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,920
Let’s go.

423
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,720
Goodbye, Luangpor.

424
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,640
Tharn! Yai! Come quick! What took you so long? I’ve been here for a while.

425
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,560
Let’s go.

426
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,240
Who are you looking for?

427
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,640
The person that the Abbot asked me to give this amulet to.

428
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,400
Geez, I thought you and I could just have fun at the festival.

429
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,240
Too bad the Abbot also gave you a mission for tonight.

430
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,160
Now, I’m bored.

431
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,840
The Abbot said there’ll be a sign and I’ll know once I see him.

432
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,960
The owner of this amulet.

433
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,760
What sign?

434
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,560
What are you two talking about?

435
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,160
Some nonsese stuff.

436
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,080
Let’s light up these firecrackers. I bought tons of them.

437
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,640
After we finish eating, let’s go watch something at the outdoor cinema.

438
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,760
Yeah, let’s do that.

439
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,240
- You take the meatballs to eat first.
- Okay

440
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,640
What’s this for?

441
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,720
Help! Help! My nephew is drowning!

442
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,040
Help! My nephew is drowning!

443
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,960
Tharn, what’s wrong?

444
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,679
I saw a boy drowning.

445
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,840
Geez, nonsense.

446
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,679
Are you going to tell me that you have a vision?

447
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,320
But I really saw it.

448
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,800
Nonsense. Let’s go watch a movie.

449
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,760
Help! My nephew is drowning!

450
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,199
Help! Help! My nephew is drowning!

451
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,000
Help! My nephew! He is drowning!

452
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,640
Phaya!

453
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,360
Phaya!

454
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,960
Phaya!

455
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,360
Wake up

456
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,040
- Wake up
- Phaya

457
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,040
- Wake up
- Phaya

458
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,040
(Choke)

459
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,120
(Crying sound)

460
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,000
Thank you

461
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,520
It’s okay. You’re safe now.

462
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,040
Here are your clothes. Let’s go and get changed.

463
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,600
- Thank you all of you so much for saving his life.
- You’re welcome.

464
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,680
Tharn.

465
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,000
You should go and get changed too.

466
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,560
We’d get going then.

467
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,200
Goodbye.

468
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,400
Without him, my nephew would have been dead.

469
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,120
Thank you so much indeed.

470
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,800
Oh, it’s all right. I was quite worried when I heard about it.

471
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,760
But what a relief to know that they were all safe.

472
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,960
It’s probably like what you said.

473
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,400
Your nephew is a very fortunate boy.

474
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,200
So, he would probably live for a very long time.

475
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,240
But you have to be careful though.

476
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,120
If both of your destiny are entwined like what I think...

477
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,720
you would eventually find each other again.

478
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,320
Please take this as a thank you gift for saving my nephew’s life.

479
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,520
Thank you, ma’am. But my grandma and the Abbot have taught me to always help those who are in need.

480
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,600
Hey, but you did something good so you should take it.

481
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,120
I’ll take it then.

482
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,920
Thank you.

483
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,760
Ouch!

484
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,800
Well, then...I’ll give it to the Abbot instead.

485
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:57,160
I’d like to donate this money for the temple and those who live here.

486
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,360
So that you could use it as an education fund of these kids.

487
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,320
I'm so close to getting the money,The Abbot.

488
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,480
Are you here for the Rocket Festival?

489
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,240
You don’t look local though.

490
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,160
We came from Bangkok.

491
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,680
My nephew often dreamt about the Naga.

492
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,800
So, he insisted that I must take him to the festival.

493
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,880
He wants to witness it by himself.

494
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,040
But I had no idea why he almost got drowned.

495
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,360
He doesn’t know how to swim.

496
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,880
But he still wants to go and play near the riverbank.

497
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,880
Grandma, I really heard someone calling me there last night.

498
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,680
I want to go home now.

499
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,120
Well then, please excuse us.

500
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,160
Thank you so much once again.

501
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,000
For saving my nephew’s life.

502
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,480
You’re welcome. Please travel safe.

503
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,800
Thank you.

504
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,800
Please take care.

505
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,240
Okay.

506
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,360
If you have a chance to visit here again in the future,

507
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,760
I hope we’ll meet again.

508
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,520
Thank you.

509
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,280
Let’s say goodbye to the Abbot.

510
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,880
Have a safe trip.

511
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,360
Please wait!

512
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,400
Here, take it.

513
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,600
Why?

514
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,560
The Abbot used to tell me...

515
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,480
to find the owner of this amulet.

516
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,440
I think you’re that person.

517
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,920
But I don’t want it.

518
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,160
Take it.

519
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,880
It will help protect you.

520
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,040
Until we meet again.

521
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,000
ou’re that boy I saved from getting drowned?

522
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,960
Geez.

523
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,600
I shouldn’t have done that.

524
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,080
Then we wouldn’t have to see each other again.

525
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,800
But I’m glad

526
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,960
to know that you were the boy who saved my life.

527
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,280
Why are you glad?

528
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,360
Well, because...

529
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,800
you might be the one who can help answer the questions I have about my dreams.

530
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,120
What you saw wasn’t a dream.

531
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,120
It was your karma

532
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,920
Are you saying that...

533
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,480
they are those whom I have wronged in my past life?

534
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,720
That’s right. But they are not just yours.

535
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,840
Why are you looking at me like that?

536
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,080
Do you remember what I used to tell you?

537
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,200
hat you must find the owner of that amulet.

538
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,240
Once you’ve found him, you must protect him with your life.

539
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,120
Because he could help free you from your karma.

540
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,400
It’s all up to the owner of this amulet.

541
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,800
All these years,

542
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,920
I’ve been trying to find the meaning of my dreams.

543
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,640
I want to know what exactly it was...

544
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,800
that I saw when I was drowning.

545
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,240
After that incident...

546
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,280
on every 15th day of the 11th waxing moon,

547
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,680
I’d always see those pictures in my dream.

548
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,800
A pair of green eyes.

549
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,440
These pictures became clearer and cleaer every time I saw them.

550
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,640
From just a pair of green eyes to seeing the Naga?

551
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,640
Yes.

552
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,240
Have you ever seen any of them?

553
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,560
No.

554
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,040
I only saw it once when I was down there to rescue you.

555
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,960
But those green eyes that I saw...

556
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,960
might have been the Naga fireballs.

557
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,200
Everything that happens to both of you...

558
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,960
is a result of your karma.

559
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,520
You’d only know the answer...

560
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:52,840
through the act of meditation which will enlighten you and lead you to the truth.

561
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,120
Your destiny have been entwined since your past lives

562
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,360
มันผูกกันมาหลายภพ

563
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,480
You both are destined to help each other

564
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,760
Trust each other.

565
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:10,280
Only then, you would be able to free yourself from your karma.

566
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,640
Your kind hearts are your best weapon.

567
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,920
And remember to always trust each other

568
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,760
Help each other.

569
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,040
And you both would live a happy life,

570
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,880
like you’ve always dreamt of.

571
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,760
(Thunder sounds)

572
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,920
I was only doing my job.

573
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,120
Your job? Or you just wanted to intervene.

574
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,120
I don’t want to hurt anyone.

575
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,640
I just want to get what is mine back.

576
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,000
(Thunder sounds)

577
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,920
You already know what you’ve always wanted to know.

578
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,240
Why are you still after me?

579
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,920
But that’s not everything that I want to know.

580
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,720
Tharn.

581
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,360
Phaya.

582
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,880
-Yai.
What on earth are you doing here?

583
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,960
You doing here?

584
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,040
I’m here to sort out something.

585
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,040
Oh, you’ve come quite far.

586
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:21,520
(The sound of laughter)

587
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,520
How did he get here?

588
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,040
I don’t know.

589
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,280
Oh, this is my girlfriend, Sand.

590
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,240
Hello.

591
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,280
Wow, you’ve got a beauty as your girlfriend, huh?

592
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,920
Of course. A handsome guy like me only deserves the best.

593
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,320
Right, honey?

594
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,320
It was quite dark so I didn’t know he actually looks like this.

595
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,920
(Everyone laughs)

596
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,320
That was harsh, honey. I’m hurt.

597
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,440
So, welcome to Nongkai.

598
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,920
It’s always crowded on this day of every year.

599
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,360
Once, the traffic jam went all the way to Udon Thani.

600
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,880
Those people probably wanted to come witness the Naga fireballs with their own eyes.

601
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,800
So,

602
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,400
Are you here for the first time?

603
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,160
No, this is my second time.

604
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,240
I used to come here once when I was a kid.

605
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,880
I see.

606
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,400
If you want to come here more often, then you should get yourself a lover in Nongkai.

607
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,000
Right, Tharn?

608
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,480
Do you want me to recommend someone?

609
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,400
My junior is still single.

610
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,000
Thank you.

611
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,080
Maybe Tharn, the single one...Oops! I mean...

612
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,960
Tharn might want to see the Naga fireballs now.

613
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,360
Let’s go find somewhere to sit.

614
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,040
Okay.

615
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,240
We’ll see you at the festival then.

616
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,240
I’m going to eat the grilled fish at my favourite restaurant first.

617
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,480
I already made a reservation. The place is packed with people from the festival today.

618
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,400
See you!

619
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,600
See you.

620
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,440
Want some?

621
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,480
- See you then.
- See you

622
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,480
- Okay.
- Bye.

623
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,880
Are you ready, my guide?

624
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,720
Lead the way.

625
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:08,360
(Music)

626
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,480
It’s beautiful.

627
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,920
It’s so crowded this year.

628
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,880
Hey, the pork here is really good.

629
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,680
Really?

630
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,080
Can I have one, please?

631
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,600
This one and this one too. The crispy pork skin too.

632
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,720
Thank you.

633
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:44,800
Let’s go.

634
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,640
Thank you.

635
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:50,480
(Fun music)

636
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,440
(Fireworks sound)

637
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,320
Let’s go eat something after this.

638
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,080
Okay.

639
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,760
Are you okay?

640
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,840
Are you afraid of the Naga statue?

641
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:39,960
No

642
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,960
But you look so pale right now.

643
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,080
It’s nothing. Let’s get going.

644
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,120
(Fireworks sound)

645
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,280
Did you see that, honey?

646
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,480
Yes.

647
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,040
There are lots of them this year.

648
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,280
But I only saw the first one.

649
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,960
Aww, why didn’t you pay more attention?

650
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,520
It’s amazing.

651
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,360
Look over there!

652
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,040
Did you see it?

653
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,720
Yes,

654
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,880
Amazing.

655
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,760
But not as amazing as you.

656
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,280
Where?

657
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,440
- Sure?
- Yeah.

658
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,960
- Really?
- Yeah.

659
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,000
It was huge

660
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,840
Why couldn’t you see it?

661
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,440
Did you see that one Tharn was talking about?

662
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,600
- No.
- Did you fool me?

663
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,840
We both saw it.

664
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,040
Sure?

665
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,400
Yes. See that?

666
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,000
Phaya, did you see it? Over there.

667
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,240
Yes.

668
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,320
Right in front of me

669
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,800
Saw that, honey?

670
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,560
Yes.

671
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,760
-Yes.
-It was big.

672
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,640
Are you feeling better?

673
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,200
Yeah, sort of

674
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,640
But you don’t look okay at all.

675
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,120
I don’t know.

676
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,600
I couldn’t breathe all of the sudden.

677
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,920
And I felt the burning pain all over my body.

678
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,560
You go enjoy the festival then.

679
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,040
I’ll go back to the temple first.

680
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,760
It’s okay. I’ll go back with you.

681
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,560
Thanks.

682
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,000
You’re so beautiful.

683
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,200
Once upon a time, a Naga disguise itself as a man.

684
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,560
It was long before I was born.

685
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,600
There is no way you can help him, Wansarut.

686
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:13,840
(Gasping)

687
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,000
(Gasping)

688
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,240
Why is it that every time I got near you,

689
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,160
I’d always have a bad dream?

690
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,120
Phaya,

691
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,720
Sand and I will give you a tour in Nongkai today.

692
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,040
Think of it as my apology

693
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,080
For last nigt.

694
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,080
It was too crowded. I couldn’t find you guys so I just stayed with my girlfriend.

695
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,200
If you’re going to give him a tour,

696
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,960
why do I have to tag along?

697
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,640
I’m want to stay at the temple to take care of the Abbot.

698
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,800
Ouch!….

699
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,480
He wouldn’t want you to stay.

700
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,200
Otherwise, why would he tell me to take you with me too?

701
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,520
I’m going to take you to the cave.

702
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,360
What cave?

703
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,320
I’m sure you’ll like it.

704
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,320
It’s said that this cave is the gateway to the city of Naga.

705
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:11,600
There are lots of stalactites and stalagmites in the cave. It would surely give you a creep.

706
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,400
I’m having goosebumps right now thinking about last night.

707
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,840
Why didn’t you want to tag along with us?

708
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,040
Or do you still want to sleep at the pavillion?

709
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:27,640
Ouch!….

710
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,720
Watch your mouth. We’re at the temple.

711
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,960
Watch my mouth?

712
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,520
Tharn

713
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,080
I have to thank you though.

714
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,160
If you hadn’t saved me on that day,

715
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,760
I would have been dead.

716
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,400
It was a good thing.

717
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,720
That I got drowned?

718
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,560
If I hadn’t saved your life back then,

719
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,120
we wouldn’t have met like this.

720
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,120
Are you trying to hit on me?

721
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,120
Let’s go.

722
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,840
I’ll take you to some other places.

723
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,000
Where?

724
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,520
[Wat PhraThat Bung Puan]
Nong Khai Province

725
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,920
(Fun music)

726
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,080
Let's go

727
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:14,400
(Fun music)

728
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,120
[Wat Tham Din Phiang]
Nong Khai Province

729
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,280
I think there are numerous photographs of me.
Take pictures of the Buddha there.

730
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:00,640
Here we are.

731
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,320
We got here

732
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,120
The Dinphiang Cave (aka Srimongkol Cave).

733
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,480
The local people believe that this is the path where the Naga’s daughter has to pass through.

734
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,920
One day, she fell in love with the human prince.

735
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,880
But on the End of Buddhist Lent Day,

736
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,280
She must go back to the Naga city.

737
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,280
However, the prince had secretly followed her back.

738
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:24,280
And finally found out that the woman he loved was a Naga.

739
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,840
The prince couldn’t bare with this truth.

740
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,120
So, he decided to leave her forever.

741
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:32,600
(Music)

742
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,720
Phaya

743
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,000
This is where the people here believe to be the coffin of Indra Naga or the King of Naga.

744
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,640
It is the coffin of Pu Innakarat.

745
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,840
They believe that these poles help support the city of Naga.

746
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:54,040
They were the pillars of the Thousand Halls that sustained the undersea city.

747
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,760
They look amazing.

748
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,400
Incredible.

749
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,280
There’s more. Let’s go.

750
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,720
- Is there anything else?
- There is more to come.

751
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,120
Do you like it?

752
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,120
Incredible.

753
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,800
Any more places like this?

754
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:22,960
You want to see more?

755
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,440
Wait.

756
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,200
What is it?

757
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,520
If you want to freshen up, have it with this.

758
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,560
Thanks.

759
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,400
I’m going to find something to eat. So hungry right now.

760
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,960
Try this and you’ll feel fresh.

761
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,440
Do you think I can drink it now?

762
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,760
Yeah.

763
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,240
Ah, so fresh.

764
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,920
Here, try it.

765
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,800
Why would you put the cap on?

766
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,800
By the way,

767
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,920
I had a bad dream again last night.

768
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,240
Again?

769
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,000
Yeah.

770
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,680
What was it like?

771
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:36,200
Same old story. But this time, you were there in my dream too.

772
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,800
Are you saying it was because of me

773
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,000
that you had a bad dream?

774
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,560
Of course, not. Forget it. Let’s go then.

775
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,960
Where to, next?

776
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,280
Wat Hai Sok (Nongkai province)

777
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,120
Wow, is this your house?

778
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,200
It looks really classy.

779
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,600
I thought you said you grew up with the Abbot at the temple.

780
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,600
This is my grandma’s place.

781
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,960
I often come to visit her.

782
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:42,760
Why didn’t you stay here then? The house is big. Why did you have to trouble the Abbot?

783
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,000
I have my own reason which I don’t have to tell you.

784
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:53,520
- But if you keep pesterting, I’d say you’re being rude.
- He means you’re nosy.

785
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,960
Guys,

786
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,840
please watch your mouth. We’re at his grandma’s place

787
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,720
Not your own home.

788
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,520
Like you’d let me talk like that in my own home.

789
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,600
You knew that too? But you hardly do what I ask you to do though.

790
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:07,480
Sorry

791
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,280
Welcome home. You’ve arrived in time for dinner.

792
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,360
I’ve prepared a feast for all of you.

793
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,400
Hello, grandma.

794
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,240
Hello.

795
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,360
I miss you so much.

796
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,240
Really?

797
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,320
I’m sorry I didn’t call you that often.

798
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,840
The instructors at the camp was very strict about us using our phones.

799
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,360
So, I....

800
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,800
completely forgot about me?

801
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,360
Grandma.

802
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,920
He was right. It was very strict there.

803
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,800
I could hardly find a time to call my girlfriend.

804
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,720
Because I had to call my mistress no.1,

805
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,760
no.2 and then no.3 first.

806
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,760
By the time I had to call Sand,

807
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,760
my break time was over.

808
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,720
Is that so? You rascal.

809
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,000
Ouch!

810
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,760
Didn’t you just tell us to watch our mouths while we are here?

811
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,320
How dare you cursed in front of her like that.

812
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,640
You’re a bad girl.

813
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,840
Look at him, grandma.

814
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,880
Why didn’t you say anything to defend me?

815
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,320
Why should I?

816
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:11,560
I was actually going to ask her to do it on another side too.

817
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,640
- Another side?
- You got it.

818
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,320
On this side.

819
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,200
Hold on. She was just kidding.

820
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,480
She really meant it.

821
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,600
Is this your new friend?

822
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,640
Why does he look so familiar?

823
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,840
Hello, grandma.

824
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:32,080
I’m the boy who almost got drowned, the one that Tharn had rescused on that day.

825
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,440
Huh?

826
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,640
Oh my goodness. It’s really you.

827
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,400
I wouldn’t be able to recognise you if you hadn’t told me so.

828
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,280
It’s such a coincidence.

829
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,440
that we finally meet again after that day.

830
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,640
After over a decade,

831
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,280
we finally met again at the training camp.

832
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,160
Yes,

833
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,480
what a coincidence. Fascinating indeed.

834
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,520
Are you all right, grandma?

835
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,680
I’m okay.

836
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,440
Welcome, all of you.

837
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,200
Let’s go inside.

838
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,200
You all must be famished.

839
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,920
Let’s eat while the food is still hot.

840
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,080
Let’s go then.

841
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:18,920
Let’s go.

842
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,440
Darling, that area where you pinched me hurts.

843
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,720
So, what are you and Phaya?

844
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,920
What do you mean?

845
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:50,720
I can tell, you know? Your eyes just say it all.

846
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,400
We’re just colleagues.

847
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,760
- Hmm, colleagues? / - Yeah.

848
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,640
But Yai told me that while you were at the camp,

849
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,760
you were quite worried about Phaya.

850
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,720
That you cared about him a lot.

851
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,760
Probably a lot more than friends do.

852
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,680
Haven’t I told you...

853
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,200
that I don’t want to feel hurt like that anymore?

854
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:23,360
Why? Is it because he’s a guy?

855
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,240
Look at me and Yai.

856
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,640
I don’t give a damn on what other people say about us.

857
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:37,080
So, no matter how crazy or how annoying he is...

858
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,160
I still love him.

859
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,640
It’s not what you think.

860
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:52,000
Be honest. If you like him, just admit it.

861
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,480
Just tell him how you actually feel.

862
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,640
Why do you have to complicate things?

863
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,880
Just be a man and say it.

864
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:09,480
I don’t want to put those around me in danger.

865
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,800
Geez, you should stop blaming yourself.

866
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,040
Your parents’ death was an accident.

867
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,960
It wasn’t because of you.

868
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:26,680
If what you said is true, Yai and I both love you like our own brother...

869
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,720
but we’re still safe and sound.

870
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,520
It would only happen to the one I love.

871
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,040
It has always been like that.

872
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,200
I don’t want it to happen again.

873
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,760
I think you’re being paranoid.

874
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:54,080
I think you should forget all those bad things that happened to you and enjoy the present moment.

875
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,000
Got it?

876
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,120
I don’t know.

877
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,320
Since I met Phaya again,

878
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:08,800
I stared to see things.

879
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:14,800
It’s a vision or a sign about something that will occur in the future.

880
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:20,080
As if I’m supposed to know when he’s in danger.

881
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:23,560
- So that I can... / - Can what?

882
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,399
So that I can protect him.

883
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:32,240
Geez, that sounds like you’ve been cursed.

884
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,080
That’s what I thought so.

885
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:48,439
Someone wants me to see those visions...

886
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:51,000
for some unexplainable reasons.

887
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,960
Come on, drink up. Stop thinking too much about it.

888
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,160
- Are you serious?
- P'Yai

889
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,359
Please protect your son.

890
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,399
Don’t let anything bad happen to both of them.

891
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:38,760
Don’t let what the Abbot has predicted come true.

892
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,200
Hey, are you still up?

893
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,520
A new hut is easier to live than an old castle.

894
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:22,160
It’s actually ‘a happy hut is better than a gloomy castle.’

895
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:28,800
I was just kidding. I’m thinking about something.

896
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
About what?

897
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:40,160
I came here because I wanted to find out more about the Naga.

898
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,320
Whether it’s true or not.

899
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:48,440
About those legends I read from the books, or even about the Naga fireballs.

900
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,400
Do what you believe. Believe in what you do.
(A famous saying from the movie, ‘Mekhong Full Moon Party’)

901
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:01,480
I watched that movie for so many times.

902
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And other movies about the Naga too.

903
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,280
The more I kept watching them...

904
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:12,280
the more I started to feel familiar with those stories.

905
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,400
It’s really weird.

906
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,200
I even dreamt about it too.

907
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,520
And drew that picture in your diary.

908
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,320
And believed that I were that girl you drew, right?

909
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:33,640
It’s not like that. I just feel something every time I get near you.

910
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,520
You mean, as if we’ve met long before we did at the traning camp?

911
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,000
Long before you had saved my life when I was drowning.

912
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:55,040
I feel as if we have met long before that.

913
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,200
Did you use this kind of story to hit on the girls in France?

914
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,520
Merci Beaucoup. (Thank you in French)

915
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,040
I didn’t use it with every girl that I try to hit on.

916
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,680
I only use it with someone that I really like.

917
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,360
And that someone is you.

918
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,240
You evil jellyfish.

919
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:17,920
Go get some sleep.

920
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,400
French people do this to say hi and goodbye.

921
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,880
I got it. Can I go to sleep now?

922
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,240
And this is called a ‘goodnight kiss’.

923
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:58,840
I’m off to bed.

924
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,520
(Yawning)

925
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,360
(Phone buzzing)

926
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,360
(Phone buzzing)

927
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,120
(Phone buzzing)

928
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,560
(On phone screen)
Evil Jellyfish

929
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,360
If you love him, just let him know.

930
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,760
Tell him how you feel.

931
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:46,680
I don’t want those around me to be in danger.

932
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:51,960
Geez, stop blaming yourself.

933
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,600
Hey, I gave you a call so many times after we came back from Nong kai,

934
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,320
why didn’t  you answer them?

935
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,600
Nothing serious.

936
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,520
Just too lazy to take the call.

937
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,760
Are you avoiding me?

938
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,840
Why would I do that?

939
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,320
What the fuck?

940
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,720
Hang on.

941
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,320
Why are you blocking my way?

942
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,800
Do you want to get hurt?

943
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,280
Yes, I want to get hurt.

944
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,960
I want to get hurt so badly.

945
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,880
So, can you tell me now why you’re avoiding me?

946
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,280
I’m not avoiding you.

947
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,040
Fine.

948
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,200
Let’s do this.

949
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,320
Let’s have a match. If I win,

950
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:48,560
you must admit that you’re avoiding me.

951
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,160
- Okay? / - Do you really think you can beat me?

952
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,840
Do you want to try?

953
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,800
I’m going to kick your ass.

954
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,640
- Ready? / - Bring it on.

955
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,280
How does it feel?

956
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,440
- Let me go!
- Do you give in now?

957
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,840
I won.

958
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,880
- One... / - Let me go!

959
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,400
- Get off me! / - Two...

960
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:25,920
Three...

961
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,600
Four...

962
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,080
Five...

963
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,480
Six, Seven...

964
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,720
- Eight, Nine...
- Okay, you won!

965
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,560
you won!

966
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:39,760
You lost.

967
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,840
So, next time when I give you a call...

968
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,120
you have to answer it. Okay?

969
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,320
Bolster.

970
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,840
- Got it?
- Yeah.

971
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,680
You’re a good boy.

972
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,480
You’ll meet the leader of Unit 1 today.

973
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:16,320
This person will supervise the investigations under your team.

974
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,320
Is it a he or a she?

975
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,680
This morning, I saw that the leader of Unit 3...

976
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,760
is a woman.  She looks so cool.

977
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,360
You guys are considered very lucky.

978
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,040
Because your team leader is very experienced.

979
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,960
Never failed to arrest the criminals in every case.

980
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,960
Is that why we are Unit 1?

981
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,680
Yes. There he is, your team leader.

982
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,800
Attention!

983
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,000
Inspector.

984
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:08,800
Nice to meet you all.

985
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:14,160
I’m Police Major Akkanee Assawawaisoon, your team leader.

986
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,480
Shit, we’re so doomed.

987
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:24,640
You didn’t mention anything about being our team leader when we parted, Captain. I mean Inspector.

988
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:31,640
If I had mentioned it earlier, I wouldn’t have been able to find out whether you’d be true to your words about your determination...

989
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,480
when you told me on the last day of the training.

990
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,920
I can still remember it word by word.

991
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,440
What did I say to him?

992
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,840
You gave him an earful.
Shit.

993
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,680
Please keep in mind...

994
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,320
that this is a real workplace.

995
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,080
You’re no longer at the traning camp.

996
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,400
I only have three simple rules if we’re going to work together.

997
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:06,080
First is teamwork.

998
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,600
There’ll be no solo investigation.
Or doing anything without permission or approval from others.

999
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:16,640
Second, the supervisor’s order is considered final...

1000
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,840
and cannot be challenged or disobeyed.

1001
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,560
Those who do will get kicked out of the team immediately.

1002
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:29,240
Third, never mix business with your peronsal affairs.

1003
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:33,120
Every time that you are out on an investigation...

1004
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:36,160
there must be no mistake.

1005
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:41,440
Just one false step and that would mean...
you’re throwing away justice and the truth of the case.

1006
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,800
- Got it? / - Hooya!

1007
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,720
No need to say ‘Hooya’. This is not a training camp.

1008
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,440
I hope we’d be able to work together for a long time.

1009
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,120
And that no one would get kicked out soon.

1010
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,600
Shit. What did I say to him back then?

1011
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:08,720
You were giving him an earful.

1012
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,520
- Geez, Yai.
- You too.

1013
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,920
I can’t remember what I said to him.

1014
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:15,920
But I’m so happy.

1015
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,200
Happy my foot.

1016
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,200
I’m so dead.

1017
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:25,280
- Put all the information on the screen. / - Yes, sir.

1018
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,560
Come in.

1019
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,800
- Please take a seat. / - Yes, sir.

1020
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:52,840
Inspector, the information you’ve asked for is ready.

1021
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,160
Give it to the team.

1022
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,800
This is Lieutenant Singh. He’s one of our team.

1023
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,680
He’d help support you on the IT part.

1024
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,040
Hello.

1025
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,880
I’m Lieut Singh, the IT officer.

1026
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,160
Pleased to work with you.

1027
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,760
That one is Wit.

1028
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,000
He’s the forensic officer.

1029
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,120
This is your first case.

1030
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,440
The rapist murder.

1031
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,840
I heard about his case whileI was at the camp.

1032
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:39,560
Both victims were charged with rape.
Their bodies were shot and hung up by the necks.
Their genitals were also cut off.
That’s what I heard.

1033
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,400
That’s right. Now, we have the third victim.

1034
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:49,120
The first victim was a 45-year-old male. The name is Ohm.

1035
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:57,280
He was beaten up and his tongue got cut off.
We found evidence of torturing with candles. His genital was cut off.
He was charged with raping his stepchild and was released less than 2 weeks before he got killed.

1036
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,280
The next victim...

1037
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,120
is Chin, a 30-year-old male.

1038
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,960
Similar condition to the first victim.

1039
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,480
This one was charged with harrassing a woman who dressed up sexily.

1040
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:11,280
The investigation was still on going but he got killed first.

1041
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,560
The third victim’s body was found yesterday.

1042
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:20,280
A 55-year-old male. The name is Korn.
His charge for sexually assault was dismissed because there wasn’t a solid evidence.

1043
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,800
The cause of death was similar to that of the first two victims.

1044
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:28,080
They all have the same cause of death.

1045
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:32,200
Is this a serial murder case then?

1046
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:37,120
But the police still couldn’t find the genitals that were cut off.

1047
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:41,640
So, they decided to forward this case to us for further investigation.
In hope that we could have this case closed as soon as possible.

1048
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,240
The time limit is within one week.

1049
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,320
We don’t want to alarm the citizens about this case.

1050
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,160
Inspector.

1051
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,880
The police spent months investigating on this case and they still couldn’t close it.

1052
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,480
Will we be able to do it just within one week?

1053
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:01,040
We still have no idea who the killer is.
The killer just turned himself in this morning...

1054
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,360
and already confessed to everything.

1055
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,760
Oh, so the killer is caught.

1056
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,800
Why bother giving us this case?

1057
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,440
There are three of them who turned themselves in.

1058
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,280
Each claimed that they were the killer.

1059
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,600
But that they didn’t do it intentionally.

1060
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,240
They were forced to kill.

1061
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:46,000

Why don’t you go back home and sleep on your bed? Wouldn’t it feel more comfy?

1063
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,960
I want to sleep on the same bed with you.

1064
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,040
Or do you not like that?

1065
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:56,600
Be careful, boy. The person you have wronged in the past is coming after you.

1066
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:04,120
They are somewhere close to you.  Don’t let them take him away from you.

1067
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:09,640
Stop!

1068
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:38,120
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

1069
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:54,080
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

1070
01:26:54,080 --> 01:27:04,040
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

1071
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:19,440
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

1072
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:26,720
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

1073
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:30,920
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

1074
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:38,880
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
