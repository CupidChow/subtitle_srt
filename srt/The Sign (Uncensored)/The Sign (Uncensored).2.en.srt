You are about to receive a training from hell.

We’d be training non-stop.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,080
- Got it?
- Hooya!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,480
We’re missing one person.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,680
Who’s this girl you’re drawing? She looks so much like Tharn.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,960
Wansarut?

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,440
Why is it similar to Tharn’s name?

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,920
Is your name Wansa?

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,400
Yeah.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,680
Is that a corpse?

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,440
About Lieut Tam case, what are you going to do next?

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,680

I’m going to keep it confidential first.

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,480
Please give me the file.

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
Yes, Captain.

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,360
Tharn, take Yai to back to our dorm first.

34
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,960
I have to find out about something.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,480
Where are you going?

36
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,840
What are you doing here?

37
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,840
What about Yai?

38
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,040
He already passed out.

39
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,560
Are you curious about Lieut Tam case?

40
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,680
So am I.

41
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,320
Fine, you keep watch then.

[Door unlocking sound]

45
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,600
Why are you getting so close?

46
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,640
I can’t see it.

47
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,200
Why didn’t you find a better place, somewhere with more space?

48
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,800
Shh! Do you want Captain to find out and sack us out of the camp?

49
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,040
The cause of death is drowning because there were trace of water found in the lungs.

50
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,720
He probably died from suffocation because of the water in his lungs.

51
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,480
High possibility of suicide.

52
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,760
But Captain Akk thought he was silenced.

53
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,680
So, Captain Akk definitely knows what operation Lieut Tam was doing.

54
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,360
But in this case file, it says that…

55
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,720
there are bruises around his body, arms, and legs. There’s a mark that looks like he was hit by a solid object too.

56
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,400
But it doesn’t say what the actual cause is.

57
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,400
If Lieut Tam was killed…

58
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,600
why did the culprit dump his body around our camp?

59
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,880
Wasn’t that too risky?

60
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,720
It might be a warning…

61
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,520
to let us know that they knew about Lieut Tam’s real identity, that he disguised himself as a drug dealer.

62
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,159
Yeah.

63
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,760
What did you find?

64
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,720
I think this knot on his ankles…

65
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,960
Lieut Tam didn’t tie it by himself.

66
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,280
How do you know?

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,040
I just know.

68
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,280
Tell me.

69
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,280
[Sound of door opening]

70
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,360
Where are you going? Come back here.

71
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,640
I’m sleepy. Go back to your bed.

72
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,400
No, I’m not leaving…

73
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,080
until you’d tell me.

74
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,640
Then sleep here tonight.

75
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,960
I happen to be in need of a bolster.

76
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,760
Let me go.

77
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,679
Let me go.

78
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,760
Let me go.

79
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,559
Sleep here.

80
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,720
The instructor is coming!

81
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,560
Are you going to be my bolster?

82
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,960
Just get your sleep.

83
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,560
Where are you going, bolster?

84
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,760
Sleep!

85
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,560
(Whistle sound)

86
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,280
Hooya!

87
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,640
Go!

88
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,400
Tharn.

89
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,320
I dreamt that you and Phaya were cuddling on his bed.

90
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,920
As if you guys were doing something intimacy.

91
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,120
It was just a dream.

92
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,080
Cut it out and get ready for the class.

93
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,800
Fine, fine.

94
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,600
Sit down.

95
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,600
Open your book and turn to page 24.

96
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,360
Section 4: Criminal Liability.

97
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,120
Let’s see the definition of deliberated or intentional act or behaviour.

98
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,160
It’s the act or behaviour committed intentionally while being well aware of such act or behaviour.

99
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,800
If such act or behaviour is committed by negligence, it is not considered as deliberated act or behaviour.

100
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,360
Left, left, left, left…

101
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,720
- 8, 9, 10.
- Together.

102
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,680
That kick was really awesome.

103
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,880
I almost couldn’t get back up.

104
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,760
Tharn.

105
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,120
Water.

106
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,160
Thanks.

107
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
No problem.

108
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,080
Hey.

109
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,360
You guys are getting better.

110
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,800
Let’s hear it for yourself.

111
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,040
- Thank you, sir. / - Thank you.

112
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,160
Keep trying

113
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,040
I’m sorry about earlier, sir.

114
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,880
It’s all right. You did good.

115
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,880
Geez, I thought we’d be able to relax a bit after that hellish week of training.

116
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,240
Nothing has come into my head since the morning class.

117
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,680
Holding a gun and hunting down criminals is enough for a police officer.

118
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,080
Can we talk?

119
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,640
What do you want?

120
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,440
Don’t you want to find out more about Lieut Tam case? About that knot?

121
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,520
Sit down.

122
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,320
Sit.

123
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,240
- I’m leaving.
- Sit down, Tharn.

124
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,360
Sit.

125
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,640
Sit still.

126
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,720
Put your legs together.

127
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,880
What are you doing?

128
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,280
Just stay still and watch. Don’t you want to know the truth?

129
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,480
If Lieut Tam really wanted to kill himself, he’d have tied a knot like this.

130
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,160
But look.

131
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,080
This is the photo I took from the case file.

132
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,840
The knot tied by yourself and by the other will look completely different.

133
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,640
If Lieut Tam committed suicide, the knot must be at the front.

134
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,560
But in this photo, the knot is at the back.

135
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,960
This means someone else must tie it for him.

136
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,160
Exactly.

137
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,880
Let’s tell Captain Akk about this.

138
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,360
We still don’t have enough evidence.

139
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Didn’t you hear what Captain said? The authority ordered him to have this case closed.

140
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,720
This means the one behind Lieut Tam’s death must be very powerful.

141
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,560
We must gather more evidence.

142
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,520
But if we need more evidence, will just the two of us capable enough?

143
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,360
It’s five of us.

144
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,040
Spill everything out right now.

145
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,840
Did you know Lieut Tam before coming to this camp?

146
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,960
He was my senior at the university.

147
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,800
When I heard that he killed himself because of the gambling debt, I didn’t believe a single word of it.

148
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,600
Before Lieut Tam joined the special investigation team,

149
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,680
he was one of the best in arresting the criminal gangs for operating online gambling and drug trafficking.

150
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,240
And from what I heard from other instructors,

151
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,800
on the night before his death, he was seen around his lodging.

152
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,880
But he didn’t report himself at the camp.

153
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,720
Khem, are you investigating about this case too?

154
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,720
Thongthai and I sneaked out to

155
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,240
The door was locked. There was lots of dust on the lock too.

156
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,920
If Lieut Tam was really seen around there that night, he should be back in his lodging, shouldn’t he?

157
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,160
What if it wasn’t Lieut Tam who was at the lodging?

158
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,600
It was probably someone who tried to fabricate the false evidence.

159
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,240
Then we have to start from finding out who that person is.

160
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,400
But it’s not easy at all.

161
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,079
How are we going to find some time to investigate on this?

162
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,119
We barely have enough time to rest with all those trainings and classes.

163
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,960
Also,

164
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,560
If Captain Akk finds out, we’d probably get sacked.

165
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,320
I’m not forcing anyone to do it.

166
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,560
But I’m going to do it.

167
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
I’ve decided to become a cop.

168
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,360
If I ignore this,

169
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,080
I won’t deserve to be called a police officer.

170
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,640
Then I’ll do it too.

171
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,400
If he’s in then I’m also in.

172
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,120
Me too.

173
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,000
Tharn, are you sure?

174
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,840
Just one false move,

175
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,080
your dream for joining the special investigation force in order to investigate about your dad’s death would all be shattered.

176
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,560
If you do something good, some good things will surely happen to you.

177
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,720
Think of it as a test before we’d officially become a cop.

178
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,480
What are they doing here?

179
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,840
They said they lost something at the beach.

180
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,000
So, they asked if they could check the CCTV camera dated 2 days back.

181
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,920
2 nights ago?

182
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,880
I’ve checked the CCTV camera.

183
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,920
I couldn’t see Lieut Tam anywhere.

184
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,600
What did you say? Thongthai and Kem wanted to see the island map?

185
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,160
Yes, sir.

186
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:20,240
Baby
Baby and I got new information.
Baby, tell them what we’ve got.

187
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,960
Don't you see it?

188
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,880
I did some research on the tidal pattern of the sea level.

189
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,800
There are 2 tidal patterns in the Gulf of Thailand
Diurnal tides and Mixed tides.

190
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,680
In the Andaman, it’s only Semidiurnal tides.

191
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,440
Wow, you’re so good at this, Baby.  How come I never knew it before.

192
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,320
Because you were always falling asleep in class.

193
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,160
Absolutely right.
Geez.

194
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,480
I checked the CCTV on the day
that Lieut Tam was said to be seen near his lodging.

195
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,960
I couldn’t see him anywhere.

196
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,160
Let’s compare the info you’ve got with the night
that Lieut Tam was said to commit suicide.

197
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,920
There was a depression that night.

198
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:34,080
Suppose Lieut Tam did commit suicide on the beach,
it was impossible to find his body on the shore.

199
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,000
Unless…

200
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,920
he killed himself at the other side of this island.
The tide would then carry his body back to shore.

201
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,920
Then we need to find more evidence there.

202
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,840
Do you really think there’d be anything left for you to find out there?
Well, in case the evidence lies under the sea.

203
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,720
The body was carried by the tides, wasn’t it?
It didn’t fall down from the sky.

204
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,720
Why are you surprised?

205
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,040
I did learn about it, you know.
Shut up, Khem.

206
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,080
I need to think.

207
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,200
Master Phaya.

208
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,120
Master Phaya.

209
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,720
Master Sakunanopparuj, this way please.

210
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,880
Phaya!

211
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,280
Phaya!

212
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,320
What the hell are you doing, Phaya?

213
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,720
Phaya.

214
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,280
Phaya.

215
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Th…Tharn.

216
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,080
That voice…

217
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,840
Was it you?

218
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,640
What are you talking about?

219
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,000
Get yourself together.

220
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,800
Tharn.

221
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,280
Why do you look like that person in my dream?

222
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,480
What are you trying to do?

223
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,080
Do you think you’re a real officer now?

224
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,560
No, sir.

225
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,920
But isn’t it our job as a police officer to find out the truth?

226
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,720
Is it?

227
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,960
But I don’t see any police officer here.

228
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,040
Being a cop isn’t just about showing off or being mister smarty pants.

229
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,840
Do you really understand the meaning of ‘duty’?!
Or ‘rules and regulations?! Or even ‘discipline’?!

230
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,240
Just do your job and mind your own business!

231
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,280
But we did all that
because we wanted to proof Lieut Tam didn’t kill himself.

232
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,840
You also think the same too, don’t you.

233
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,040
What I think about this case is none of your business.

234
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:38,160
If you want to become a real cop,
you must learn to be responsible for your job.
Know your job and do your best with it.

235
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,240
What you did tonight is a serious breach of discipline.

236
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,680
If I find you doing anything like this again,

237
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,440
you will not get another second chance.

238
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,000
you will be expelled immediately!

239
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,200
Got it?

240
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,200
Hooya!

241
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,680
Do you get it?!

242
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,800
Hooya!

243
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,800
And not just the two of them.

244
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,840
But including everyone who takes part in this silly game too.

245
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,400
If you know that your name is in here,

246
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,440
come to the front.

247
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,120
NOW!

248
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,680
You all have committed a shameful act
by violating the camp regulations…

249
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,480
and disobeyed your superior’s orders.

250
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,200
It is considered a serious breach of discipline.

251
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,360
You have no rights to stick your nose
into the official authority’s business.

252
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,600
If you really think you are good enough…

253
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,080
and want to bring justice to Lieut Tam,

254
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,320
just do your best in what you’re assigned to do.

255
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,640
Pass the exam and become a real cop.

256
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,080
I’ll keep watching to see…

257
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,800
if a smartass who is crying for justice like you…

258
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,280
Would only bark but not bite.

259
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,080
And since you’ve done something wrong tonight,

260
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,200
you will be punished so that the others will not follow suit.

261
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,480
Prepare for stress position!

262
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,680
Hooya!

263
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,960
Captain, I’ve looked at the evidence that
those kids could find. They were quite good.

264
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,480
It’d be great if they can join the special investigation team.

265
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,280
It doesn’t matter how talented they are,
if they can’t follow the rules and be disciplined…

266
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,440
those talents are just a waste.

267
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,320
Guys,

268
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,000
I’m…

269
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,520
I’m really sorry.

270
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,720
for making us all in trouble.

271
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
It’s all right.

272
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,120
Just forget it.

273
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,000
What’s done is done.

274
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,160
Yeah.

275
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,360
We were acting like a smartass just like what Captain said.

276
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,040
I think what he said was actually right.

277
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,360
For us to become a good cop, we stick to the rules

278
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,560
Starting from passing the exam first.

279
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,280
I will definitely pass it.

280
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,200
Then I’ll shout in his face that I’m on the special investigation team.

281
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,480
Me too.

282
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,760
Let’s do our best to pass the exam.

283
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,640
Let’s do it.

284
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,280
Yeah.
Hooya!

285
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,320
Hooya!

286
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,760
Bring it on.

287
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,040
Go on, Tharn!

288
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,160
Go!

289
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,639
(Shooting sound)

290
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,159
(Shooting sound)

291
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,679
Time’s up.
It’s a tie.

292
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,920
Are you filming an MV or what? It’s time to bed.

293
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,680
I was just pondering about something.

294
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,760
Does a person like you have anything to ponder about?

295
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,680
I have a question that needed an answer.

296
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,720
Oh, you’re quite serious, aren’t you?

297
00:35:48,800 --> 00:36:00,680
Tharn, do you believe in the past lives or reincarnation?

298
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,600
I do. The Abbot often told me about it.

299
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:13,520
That what we did in our past life will affect us in this life.

300
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,320
Like what people said,

301
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,080
Everything happens for a reason. There’s no coincidence.

302
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:30,480
It happens because it has already been destined by something called…

303
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,200
Commitment.

304
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,760
Yeah.

305
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:43,280
You were born into this family of yours, and surrounded by your friends…

306
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,400
Because you might have had some commitment with those people in the past life.

307
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:59,160
So, you’re telling me that the reason I’ve you in this life…

308
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,600
is because we had a commitment in our past lives.

309
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,800
What if it’s true?

310
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,240
What did you promise me?

311
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,760
Is that why you’re always there to rescue me?

312
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,880
That’s the question that I need to know an answer.

313
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,400
What’s the reason behind this?

314
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:47,800
In the past life, I was probably a rich and kind-hearted man who liked to rescue cows like you from the slaughter house.

315
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,560
Asshole.

316
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:58,520
Or you were probably a caring wife who always took a great care of a good-looking hubby like me.

317
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:06,520
I see. This is what a handsome cow looks like.

318
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,600
- Now, you’re pissing me off.
- Ouch! I was just kidding.

319
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,640
Just stop thinking about it.

320
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,720
What are you going to do after the training is done?

321
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:29,320
If I can pass the exam, I’ll surely have something more interesting to do.

322
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,000
What about you?

323
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:42,000
If I pass the exam, I’ll do what I’ve always wanted to do.

324
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,320
What is it?

325
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,040
Can you stop being nosy?

326
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:59,040
Let’s go. It’s time for bed or else we’d get punished again.

327
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,640
The instructors are keeping their eyes on us.

328
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,120
The instructors are keeping their eyes on us.

329
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,160
Hey, wait for me!

330
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,000
Tharn!

331
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,240
Please come to the front when I call out your name.

332
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,880
Mr. Pathorn Pengprai.

333
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,720
Mr. Yingyai Mahanop.

334
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,640
Mr. Phaya Kamolwipak.

335
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,320
Mr. Songyod Maliwan

336
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,000
Mr. Wansa Raksil.

337
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,160
Salute!

338
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,160
Turn around!

339
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,920
Salute!

340
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,360
Captain.

341
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,640
What is it?

342
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,920
We did it.

343
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,000
You just passed the training. Don’t be so full of yourself.

344
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,120
You haven’t been on a real mission yet.

345
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,680
It’s a lot more tough.

346
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,320
You couldn’t believe it, could you?

347
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,640
That people like us would be able to pass the exam and be on the special investigation team.

348
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,760
Thank you, Captaion.

349
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,680
We’re looking forward to working with you, Captain.

350
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,040
One day, we’d proof it to you that we are able to be a great cop.

351
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,640
I’ll wait for that day.

352
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,560
Yes, sir.

353
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,480
- Well done.
- Thank you.

354
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,640
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

355
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,440
Bravo!

356
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,920
What a relief.

357
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,360
Hello, grandma.  I finally did it.

358
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,000
I’m now a police officer.

359
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,840
Next, I’m going to find out about my parent’s death.

360
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,960
I’ll find some time to visit you soon.

361
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,280
Please take care.

362
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,320
Tharn.

363
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,720
Can I borrow your phone?

364
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,760
Phone?

365
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,160
Yeah.

366
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,120
That’s my number.

367
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,280
But I didn’t ask.

368
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,520
But I want you to have it.

369
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:08,120
Are you stalking me?

370
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,960
I want to give you this cap.

371
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,600
Are you copying me?

372
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,600
If you could do it to me, why can’t I do it too?

373
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,120
Did you just take a photo of me?

374
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,000
I’m going to use it as a calling ID.

375
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,200
Why didn’t you tell me first so that I could pose for it?

376
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,480
You already look nice.

377
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,000
I like it.

378
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,800
I’ll store your number as…

379
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,480
Bolster.

380
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,320
I’ll give you ca call. Let’s go out and find something to eat.

381
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,800
Think of it as returning the favor for always helping me.

382
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,960
No need.

383
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,440
I don’t want to see you that often.

384
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,080
But I do.

385
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,480
So what?

386
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,400
Hey

387
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,880
Hey, are you guys going to stay over at the camp?

388
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,600
Don’t you want to go home?

389
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,560
Go pack your things. I want to go home so badly.

390
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,040
I’ll call you.

391
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,920
Bolster.

392
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,280
- Let’s go, Yai.
- ‘kay.

393
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,680
Bolster?

394
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,320
You like him, don’t you?

395
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,400
No.

396
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,440
He’s so annoying. Why would I like him?

397
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,680
Just tell me honestly if you like him.

398
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,640
I’m going to help protect him too.

399
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,200
Tharn, I really hope you’d find that someone you like.

400
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,520
And be with someone you love.

401
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,920
I thought you already know…

402
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,720
that if I love someone,

403
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,000
that person will die.

404
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,240
I don’t want anyone to die because of me.

405
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,160
I don’t want to feel that kind of grief anymore.

406
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,360
We have a week to rest before starting our work at the unit. Let’s go party, shall we?

407
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,000
I’m in. We were stuck in this training camp for 7 months.

408
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,360
I really miss all those fun and the crowds.

409
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,120
I miss the old days.

410
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,200
Khem, are you thinking about your ex?

411
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,640
I like that. But you’re getting me in trouble.

412
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,880
Right now, I only have eyes for my baby.

413
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,160
So, are we going?

414
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,760
Yai and I have to go back to Nong Khai province.

415
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,600
I’m worried about the Abbot. We’ve left him alone for too long.

416
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,440
And we won’t have much time to look after him once we start working.

417
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,200
You’re from Nong Khai?

418
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,200
Yeah.

419
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,280
So, do we have to go to Nong Khai?

420
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,280
You seem interested in him a lot.

421
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,680
Okay, listen up.

422
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,320
Just come to Nongkai with us tonight.

423
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,560
I’ll send you the time and place.

424
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:18,680
But first, let me tell my wife that I’m going home.

425
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,400
See you.

426
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,120
- Bye.
- See ya.

427
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,320
Tharn, let’s meet at the car.

428
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,320
Hi, sweety.

429
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,200
- See you.
- Okay.

430
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,760
See you.

431
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,400
Cheers!

432
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,880
- Are you okay, Tharn?
- Yes.

433
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,760
- It’s just one bottle.
- I’ve just arrived.

434
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,960
Are you okay?

435
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,120
Aren’t you the one who’s not good at drinking, Khem?

436
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:07,880
This way, Phaya! He’s here.

437
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,320
Wow, he’s looking good.

438
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,520
Oh, what a head turner. All the girls are looking at him.

439
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,480
- Come sit down. Hey, scoot over.
- Hey, scoot over.

440
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,120
Here, take a swig.

441
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,320
- Now?
- You’re late so take a swig.

442
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:31,000
If anyone got you as a boyfriend, he or she would surely have a headache. You’re so popular.

443
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,400
- Yeah, so handsome.
- Babe, don’t make fun of him.

444
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,320
Listen, I’m telling you right here…

445
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,320
I only have eyes for the one I love.

446
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,200
If I love anyone…

447
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,000
I’ll never…

448
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,920
(Phone ringing)

449
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,200
Talking about the devil…

450
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:51,080
Wow, who’s she? So gorgeous.

451
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,120
- So beautiful.
- Khem.

452
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,120
Gorgeous, isn’t she?

453
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,720
- Is your girlfriend calling?
- Khem, you jerk.

454
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,520
He’s embarrassed.

455
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,000
- Where are you going?
- I have to take this call.

456
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,800
So sweet.

457
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,560
What a sweet couple.

458
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,000
- Cheers!
- Okay.

459
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,320
Do you want anything? I’m going to place an order.

460
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,480
- I want one of this.
- Me too.

461
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,400
- Make it three.
- Okay, three bottles then.

462
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,760
Hurry up and get back.

463
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,440
Five bottles of beer, please.

464
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,200
Can I have two on the rock, please?

465
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,080
Hello.

466
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,560
Hello.

467
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,680
Are you here with your friends?

468
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,320
Yes.

469
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,840
They seem to enjoy it a lot.

470
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,320
My name is Oat.

471
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,240
I’m Tharn.

472
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,760
Nice to meet you.

473
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,880
Same here.

474
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,160
This one is on me.

475
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,560
Did you order this for me?

476
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,480
Thanks a lot, pal.

477
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,360
You really know what I like.

478
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,720
who’s this?

479
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,440
I’m Oat.

480
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,960
Excuse me, but I’m talking to my friend, not you.

481
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,880
So, are you done ordering?

482
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,040
Let’s go.

483
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,160
Does any of you want to come up and sing a song together?

484
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,640
I do, I do.

485
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,640
- ‘I’m a local girl from…’
- Khem!

486
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,880
- What?
-  Sorry.

487
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,920
Anyone?

488
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,840
I can do it, Yai.

489
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,440
- Thongthai, you go then.
- No

490
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,400
- Go on.
- You go, Phaya.

491
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,960
- What?
- You’re good at singing.

492
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,840
- What are you talking about?
- I heard you sing before.

493
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,960
- I can’t sing.
- I’ll go then.

494
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,280
- ‘I’m a local girl from Chiangmai…’
-Excuse me? My friend wants to join you.

495
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,600
Come on up here.

496
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,000
- Go, Phaya. / - Yeah.

497
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,240
Are you chicken out?

498
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,160
That’s my boy. Just a swig to boost up your guts.

499
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:29,040
- I’ll show you.
- Yeah, that’s my friend, everyone.

500
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,480
Do you need anything, I’ll go get it for you.

501
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,280
- Mine is done. Get me one of this.
- Me too. I’ll have one too.

502
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,600
Make it five, Tharn. Five bottles of beer.

503
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,920
(Music)

504
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,120
Let’s play some game.

505
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,120
What game?

506
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,640
Spin The Bottle game.

507
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:25,280
- Let’s clear the table.
- Okay

508
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,400
- But I’m going to alter the rule a bit.
- How?

509
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,680
If the bottle points toward anyone, that person can ask anyone a question.

510
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,200
- Okay
- Let’s do that.

511
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,720
If the you couldn’t answer the question, you must down the glass.

512
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,000
- We’ll surely get drunk.
- Who’s it?

513
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,560
- Who’s it?
- What the fuck are you doing, Yai?

514
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,960
Don’t worry, my bro. I’ll take care of it.

515
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,320
- Come on
- Bring it on.

516
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,880
- Let’s start.
- Who’s first?

517
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,360
It’s me.

518
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,440
Go on then.

519
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,480
Whom do you want to ask?

520
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,480
I’m going to ask Tharn.

521
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,920
Go on.

522
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,480
Do you have anyone you like right now?

523
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:27,480
Answer, answer, answer!

524
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,760
- Booo.
- What a waste.

525
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,760
I’ll ask Tharn.

526
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,800
It has to be like this, bro.

527
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,800
Here we go.

528
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,560
Again?

529
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,720
Go on.

530
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:50,760
What’s your type? Is it someone around here?

531
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:57,120
Answer, answer, answer!

532
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,240
Geez.

533
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,160
You!

534
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,320
I’ll ask Tharn.

535
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,560
Hold on. That’s enough.

536
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,320
Easy there.

537
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,200
Let’s stop. Look at him, he’s all red.

538
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,840
Fine, I won’t ask him then.

539
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,320
- I’ll ask you instead.
- Oh, it’s your turn now.

540
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,760
Just sit down.

541
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,720
Listen.

542
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,800
If you can pick anyone in this table to go home with you,

543
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,720
whom will you choose?

544
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,560
Answer it.

545
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,520
Answer, answer, answer!

546
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,080
- I’m going to choose…
- Yes?

547
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,000
- Shit!
- Oh, shit!

548
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,880
Tharn!

549
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,200
Tharn! Are you okay?

550
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,720
We shouldn’t have picked on him.

551
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,560
Tharn, are you all right?

552
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,720
I’ll take him to wash up first.

553
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,560
No more drinking, okay?

554
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,080
Let’s go.

555
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,320
Geez. I was afraid he’d puke all over me.

556
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,560
Are they actually….?

557
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,600
Are you okay?

558
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,800
Wash your face first.

559
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,360
Geez.

560
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,080
Sit down. Sit.

561
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,440
Already.

562
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,600
- Hey.
- Huh?

563
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,800
- Are you okay?
- Yeahh.

564
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,440
If you want to feel better,

565
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,440
I have this.

566
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,000
It’d help.

567
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,440
I’ll make it for you.

568
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,600
Just stay still.

569
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,440
Don’t move.

570
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,880
Open your mouth.

571
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,800
Drink it

572
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:50,120
- Feel better?
- Umm, yeah.

573
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,080
Very good.

574
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:58,280
- Let’s freshen you up a bit.
- Geez, what’s wrong with you?

575
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,720
Take this.

576
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,240
You really like for bugging me.

577
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,560
- Get off me.
- No.

578
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,880
I’m not going to let you go. I’ll hold on to you tight.

579
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,760
You, evil jellyfish.

580
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:24,080
Are you sure? This jellyfish’s sting is very painful.

581
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,840
It will go directly to your heart.

582
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,040
The heart, the heart, the heart.

583
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,600
Stop it.  You’re like a baby when you’re drunk.

584
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,760
Let me return the favor.

585
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,040
What’s wrong?

586
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,320
Where did you get this necklace from?

587
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,920
This amulet?

588
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,160
It’s the same.

589
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,720
Same as what?

590
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,760
Same as the amulet that I used to give to a boy.

591
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,440
You used to give a boy an amulet like this?

592
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,520
Yeah.

593
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,680
When? Where?

594
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,240
Tell me more about it.

595
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,280
It was when…

596
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,800
Yes?

597
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,120
When…

598
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,760
Hey, wake up. Talk to me first.

599
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,440
Geez, Tharn.

600
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,080
Sit down first.

601
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,400
- Wake up. Tell me where was it?
- It was…

602
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,600
Tharn.

603
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,840
Tharn.

604
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,320
Tharn.

605
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,560
Talk to me first.

606
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,160
Shit! I’m sorry.

607
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,920
Wait! It’s not what you think.

608
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,960
It’s good that you’re here. He’s already passed out. What to do now?

609
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,280
I thought so. He drank a gallon of it.

610
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,720
Now, what?

611
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,880
Okay, I know what to do.

612
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,840
You go and drop him off at his condo.

613
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,600
But I’m drunk too. I can’t do that.

614
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,240
So am I. I’m going to call a cab for you.

615
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,280
Come here.

616
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:57,000
- Sit down.
- What the heck are you doing?

617
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,480
Ouch!

618
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,920
- Geez, he’s heavy.
- Yai!

619
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:08,720
- Hang on.
- Now, go.

620
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,600
Where?

621
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,680
Wait for me in front of the club.  I’ll let you know when the cab is here.

622
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:25,080
Tharn, my bro. I’ve done everything I could for you.

623
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,960
Geez, what’s wrong with him?

624
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,240
Where are you taking me?

625
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,760
Your place.

626
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,040
Go back and get Yai too.

627
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,200
I don’t want to sleep alone.

628
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,200
I’ll stay with you.

629
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,560
But first, get off me.

630
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,280
Where’s the cab?

631
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,080
Just wait here.

632
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,240
Sorry

633
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,480
Just wait here.

634
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,040
Shit, whose car is it?

635
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,080
- Dr. Chalothorn.
- Tharn.

636
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,560
Excuse me?

637
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:43,240
Tharn and I have known Dr. Chalothorn since we were young.

638
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,280
Good for him.  Now, he’d someone to take care of him when he’s drunk.

639
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:55,640
Grandma, maybe it’s time for me to find out…

640
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,240
what those dreams actually mean.

641
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:02,720
I’m going to start from where it begins – where all those dreams started.

642
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,080
Phaya.

643
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:08,520
Tharn.  Why are you here?

644
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:31,400
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

645
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:47,360
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

646
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:57,320
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

647
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:12,720
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

648
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:20,000
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

649
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:24,200
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

650
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:32,120
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
