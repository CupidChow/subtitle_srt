2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,440
What has he done to you? Why do you hate him so much?

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,880
Because he’s the Naga!

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,280
Let go of me.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,080
No, I’ll never leave you here.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,040
What are you doing?! No. No! Phaya!

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,800
No. No!

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,520
Phaya!

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,280
Everyone that I love are taken away from me, all because of you.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,920
It’s time for you to choose.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,400
This is not just about Phaya, the man you love.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,040
It’s about everyone that you love.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,360
You know the whereabout of Montree and his every move...

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,640
because Chart is your spy?

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,360
That’s right.

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,800
I have recruited him to work secretly...

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,600
after he didn’t pass the training at the camp.

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,000
Disguising himself as one of Montree’s people, I sent him to find more evidence on the drug network.

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,280
and also evidence on Tharn’s father’s murder as well as my brother’s and Lieut Tam’s cases.

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,120
That day we secretly went to investigate on the spider tattoo,

21
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,720
Chart was also there. Was it your order?

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,120
If we had arrested Khom that day, everything would just end there.

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,280
We’d never able to get to Montree.

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,080
Why didn’t you tell us anything, especially Tharn?

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,400
- If Tharn had known about this...
- Because I don’t trust anyone.

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,120
I can’t trust anyone even you.

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,360
Lieut Tam died because someone in our unit tipped that information off.

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,880
Inspector.

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,760
Singh has tracked down Chart’s last location.

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,039
But it’s not clear.

31
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,800
We only know it’s close to our target area.

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,840
What about Phaya and Tharn, can you track them down?

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,280
Yes, they’re on the west side.

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,800
Only 5 kilometres away from Chart’s location.

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,880
Let’s split up into 2 teams.

36
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,759
Yai, go look for Phaya and Tharn with the forest rangers.

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,920
The rest of you come with me. We’ll go arrest Montree.

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,680
Yes, sir.

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,320
Can you show me the map?

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,680
- Come here.
- What is it?

41
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,080
Just come.

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,080
What is it?

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,800
Here.

44
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,440
Keep it for me first. Once everything is done, I’ll come back and put it on your ring finger.

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,120
Don’t be so full of yourself.

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,079
I’ve never said I would let you do that.

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,680
This mission is really dangerous. Please be careful.

48
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,160
Yeah, you too.

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,360
(Incoming call)

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,720
Hello, babe.

51
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,320
I’m with Tharn’s grandma right now.

52
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,840
Have you found him?

53
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,840
Not yet. We’d get going now.

54
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:38,480
Okay, please find them.

55
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,960
Yeah. By the way, can you make me a spicy fish paste when I go back?

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,360
I want to eat it.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,079
Of course, I’ll make it for you.

58
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Please come back soon. And promise me you’ll come back safely too.

59
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,360
Or else, I’ll throw it away. Got it?

60
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,160
Okay.

61
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,160
Please be careful.

62
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,160
He still hasn’t found them.

63
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,079
Please, let both of them come back safely.

64
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:43,040
I pray to all the holy spirits, please protect everyone and make them come back safely.

65
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:52,040
Please protect Phaya and Tharn too.

66
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,240
Dad, Mum. Please help protect Phaya and bring him back saftely.

67
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,840
I promise I will be good to him.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,080
And will listen to everything he says.

69
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,840
Got it.

70
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Gather up, everyone!

71
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,200
Let’s go, Yai.

72
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,080
Yes, sir.

73
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,720
Yai, please find Phaya and Tharn.

74
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,280
Yeah, you guys be careful too.

75
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,080
I promise I’ll catch up to help arrest Montree.

76
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,720
Let’s go.

77
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,760

Tharn, I’ll go look that way.

Okay.

97
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,480
- Tharn, I’ll go look that way.
- Okay.

98
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,880
Are you going to tell me now, whom you were just talking to on the phone?

99
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,159
Sir, the cops are coming.

100
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,480
Tell our men to clear the warehouse.

101
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,080
Hey, look! The light.

102
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,360
Come.

103
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,120
Come.

104
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,120
This is where I heard the shooting yesterday.

105
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,120
This way.

106
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,760
Wait a second.

107
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,360
Let’s hurry up. I think the persons I’m looking for are probably around here.

108
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,160
Careful.

109
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,640
Help!

110
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Help!

111
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,120
Can anyone hear us?!

112
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,160
Help!

113
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,640
Help! Anybody, help!

114
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,080
Help!

115
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,960
Can you hear us?! Help!

116
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,680
Help!

117
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,560
Anybody, help!

118
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,600
Help!

119
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,200
Tharn! Phaya!

120
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,480
Yai!

121
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,640
Sit down first. I thought I’d never see both of you again.

122
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,480
Why do you guys always get yourselves into danger like this?

123
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,080
We are so worried about you.

124
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,560
How did you find us?

125
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,560
Inspector and our team...

126
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,000
are going to raid Montree’s drugs warehouse around here.

127
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,160
Montree’s drugs warehouse?

128
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,040
How did Inspector find out?

129
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,360
Chart is his spy. He’s secretly working for Inspector.

130
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,240
He was the one who told Inspector...

131
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,560
about you two after Khom tried to kill you.

132
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,680
Chart is Inspector’s spy.

133
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,680
(Gunshot)

134
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Khem, let’s go.

135
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:05,720
(Gunshot)

136
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,240
Already started?

137
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,120
You two go back first.

138
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,080
I have to go help our team and Inspector.

139
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,360
Wait, take us with you.

140
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Look at yourself, how can you help us?

141
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,680
I’m okay. I can do it.

142
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,280
Let us help, Yai.

143
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,560
I’m not going to miss this chance to arrest Montree.

144
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,200
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

145
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:36,120
(Gunshot)

146
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,200
(Gunshot)

147
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,160
Cover him.

148
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,360
Go back!

149
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,080
Go back! Back!

150
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,960
Go after them!

151
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,160
Yes, sir.

152
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,200
Burn them all! Get him up, he’s coming with us.

153
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,960
Hey!

154
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,400
Let’s go.

155
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,040
Let’s go.

156
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,000
Walk!

157
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,520
(Gunshot)

158
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,760
(Gunshot)

159
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,240
Go! Go! Go!

160
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,680
Dammit! Why can’t they just leave me alone?!

161
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,320
Drop your weapons and turn yourself in!

162
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,560
(Gunshot)

163
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,920

(Gunshot)

166
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,040
Let’s go back!

167
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,720
Inspector, they went back inside.

168
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,840
Follow them.

169
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
(Explosion)

170
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,760
- Anybody hurt?
- No, sir.

171
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,520
Wait for my signal.

172
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,000
Go!

173
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
(Explosion)

174
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,760
Go! Go!

175
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,080
Go!

176
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,320
Go! Go!

177
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,800
3 o’clock. Set 2.

178
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,440
Go! Go!

179
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,480
(Explosion)

180
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,040
Yai, go!

181
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,160
Phaya! Tharn! Let’s go!

182
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,320
Take cover, Yai!

183
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,600
Go!

184
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,240
Stop!

185
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,800
Slow them down. I’ll get on the boat.

186
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,400
Make sure you get there in time.

187
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,200
Yes, sir.

188
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,080
(Gunshot)

189
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,160
Can’t you guys just leave me alone?!

190
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,960
I shouldn’t have spared your life.

191
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,920
I should have killed you both just like your father and your brother!

192
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,120
Please cover me.

193
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,520
(Gunshot)

194
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,320
Khem!

195
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,480
Khem!

196
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,200
Khem!

197
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,520
Khem!

198
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,960
Khem!

199
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,800
Khem!

200
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,240
Khem!

201
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,880
Stop! Let him go!

202
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,320
You don’t want him to die, do you? Put your gun down!

203
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,400
I said, put it down!

204
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,960
You too!

205
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,360
(Gunshot)

206
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,640
Bastard!

207
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,760
Yai, go!

208
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,599
Go get him, Tharn!

209
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,680
Stop!

210
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,120
Do you want to be with your parents so much?

211
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,920
I’m going to send you to live with them soon.

212
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,280
Say hello to them for me too. Tell them I miss them.

213
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,280
What the f***?!

214
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,080
No! No!

215
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,400
I don’t want him to die that easily.

216
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,640
I want him to pay for what he did.

217
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,000
Tharn.

218
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,880
Inspector, we found various kinds of drugs in the warehouse
including amphetamine, Ice, and Heroin.

219
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,640
It’s also a hub for processing drugs for concealment to avoid detection during the smuggling.

220
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,000
How are Chart and Khem?

221
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,040
Both of them are safe now.

222
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,440
Tharn.

223
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,960
What happened to Khom and Montree at that abandoned factory?

224
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,280
They both already paid for they did to my dad,

225
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
your brother, and the others.

226
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,280
Yeah.

227
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,920
I have a voice clip in which you’re dealing on your drugs business with Kao.

228
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,760
Just confess.

229
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,960
You won’t get away this time.

230
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,680
Then why do you still want to frame me?

231
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,960
If you have any evidence, just show it to me. Where is it?

232
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,280
I don’t want to frame you.

233
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,640
I want you to confess.

234
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,040
And you won’t be going to jail alone.

235
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
I’m going to get that person behind you too.

236
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,960
So, you better tell me how that person is.

237
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,800
(Laughing)

238
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,640
That person behind me?

239
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,280
Why would you want to know?

240
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,120
There is no one behind me!

241
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,320
Let me tell you this, Inspector.

242
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,240
It’s actually one of your kind who often comes wagging their tails...

243
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,960
and begging me to help them.

244
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,440
I’m telling you justice, honesty justification they don’t really exist in this world.

245
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
Even though you could arrest someone like me,

246
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,720
there’ll always be someone worse than me being born somewhere in this world.

247
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,920
Do you know why?

248
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,520
Because there are some people who are worse than people like me.

249
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,400
Some people like you lot...

250
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,640
who always help facilitate those with money and power like me, Inspector.

251
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,880
So, if you have any evidence, just lay it in front of me.

252
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,200
I’m not afraid of you.

253
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,680
Fine.

254
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,640
Then you can look forward to go rotting in jail.

255
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,680
And let me tell you something.

256
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,160
Justice, honesty, and justification

257
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,440
they do exist.

258
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,440
It’s up to the people who use them.

259
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,560
Um

260
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,120
Just wait and see.

261
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,760
I’m going to crush these filthy network and put people like you behind bars.

262
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,640
Then do it. Prove it.

263
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,920
You might feel so sure that your power and money can help you to escape the hands of law this time.

264
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,760
But trust me.

265
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,960
You can never escape karma.

266
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,080
Inspector.

267
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,560
Should I take him back to Bangkok?

268
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,800
Did he confess?

269
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,320
People like him won’t confess so easily.

270
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,280
He must think that the person behind him...

271
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,640
will be able to help him get away with this.

272
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,800
If we can Montree to confess,

273
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,320
Those behind him will surely be in trouble.

274
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,800
There is a recent report from IDF special investigation unit today...

275
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:52,120
regarding the big raid and arrest at Montree’s drugs warehouse.

276
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,040
Montree will be sentenced to prison for life.

277
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,400
He is involved in many criminal cases including an international drug traffiking.

278
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,160
A recent report also confirms that...

279
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,120
several high-ranking police officers...

280
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,000
as well as politicians are also involved in this case.

281
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,200
IDF special investigation unit will reopen the murder cases of many ex-police officers...

282
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,280
in order to bring back justice for every one of them whose deaths are still shrouded in mystery.

283
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,200
Phaya.

284
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,200
Tharn.

285
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,840
(Crying)
Phaya.

286
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,640
(Crying)
Are you hurt anywhere?

287
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,840
I’m safe and sound.

288
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,360
- Miss you so much.
- Yai.

289
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,440
Finally, you’ve made it.

290
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,240
- I was so worried. Are you hurt?
- No.

291
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,160
You're as beautiful as you always were.

292
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,120
(Slapping on the arm)
Ouch.

293
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,400
- Did it hurt?
- Ouch.

294
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,840
- Are there cuts or wounds anywhere?
- No.

295
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,560
I thought I’d never see you again.

296
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,480
(Crying)

297
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,520
Can I not have that spicy chilli paste?

298
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,000
Can I have you instead?

299
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,560
(Slapping on the shoulder)

300
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,440
Don’t do this again, Tharn.

301
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,520
You’re the only family I have left.

302
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,000
Without you, I won’t be able to live.

303
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,960
I’m so sorry, Grandma.

304
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,840
But I can finally put the one who killed my parents behind bars.

305
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,960
You’re not the mother of a bad cop.

306
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:57,440
You are a mother of a good cop an honest and law-abiding one.

307
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,320
That’s good, dear.

308
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,760
Your father must be so proud...

309
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:11,000
that his son is also a good cop like him.

310
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,680
(Music)

311
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,240
Now that you’ve caught the killer, your parents must be so happy.

312
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,720
Phaya.

313
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,120
Thank you so much.

314
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,520
For staying by my side.

315
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,040
We’ve been through a lot together.

316
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,720
Thank you so much.

317
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,920
It must be destiny.

318
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,720
Just like what you’ve always wondered...

319
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,600
how I’m always there to protect you.

320
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,240
Me too.

321
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,280
I will always protect you, Tharn.

322
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,000
Tharn.

323
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,760
You already promised me.

324
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,840
That you will always be by my side.

325
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,200
No matter what might happen tomorrow,

326
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,120
you must never give up.

327
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,760
You have to fight for us.

328
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,440
And we will get through it together.

329
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,040
Just one more day.

330
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,560
Then you and I...

331
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,800
will finally be together forever.

332
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,720
I love you.

333
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,719
I love you too.

334
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,000
I always have.

335
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,800
And always will.

336
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,360
(Exciting sound)

337
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,440
Please feel free to take some fruits.

338
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,080
(Bell jingling)

339
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,440
Go ahead and take some fruits & desserts.

340
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,920
(Bell jingling)

341
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,480
(Drum roll)

342
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,800
(Drum roll / Bell jingling)

343
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,200
(Drum roll / Bell jingling)
(Exciting sound)

344
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:10,000
(Exciting sound)

345
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,560
You’re up so early.

346
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,280
Are you preparing the offerings? Do you need any help?

347
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,240
Oh, it’s already taken care off.

348
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,200
(Exciting sound)

349
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:07,720
(Exciting sound)

350
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,920
(Exciting sound)

351
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,000
Today is an important day.

352
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,760
It’s the day that he will return...

353
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,440
to Makhong river...

354
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,720
in order to show off his power and also pay respect to the Buddha in the human world.

355
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,600
I’ve prepared these offerings for him myself,

356
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,480
in hope that the holy spirits and all the merits I have done...

357
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,760
will help turning a disaster into a blessing.

358
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:40,800
(Exciting sound)

359
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:28,200
(Praying)

360
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
(Exciting sound)

361
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:38,200
(Exciting sound)

362
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:59,000
(Praying)

363
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,120
Tharn!

364
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,480
Tharn!

365
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,760
Tharn!

366
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,920
Tharn!

367
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,000
Tharn!

368
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,560
Tharn! Where are you?!

369
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,240
Tharn!

370
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,240
Tharn!

371
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,160
Have you already taken him away?

372
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,440
Tharn!

373
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,760
- What’s going on?
- Grandma

374
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,080
What’s going on?

375
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,520
He has taken Tharn away!

376
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,440
Tharn!

377
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,200
Tharn!

378
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Tharn!

379
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,960
- Grandma!
- Tharn!

380
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,360
Tharn!

381
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,440
- Tharn!
- Grandma!

382
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,400
Where are you going?

383
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,320
Let me go!

384
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,800
I am going to find Tharn.

385
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,040
- Tharn
- Where are you going to find him?

386
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,080
- Phaya
- Grandma!

387
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,240
Grandma!

388
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,080
- Hey!
- Tharn!

389
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,800
Tharn!

390
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,880
- Tharn!      /     - Phaya!

391
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,120
What happened?

392
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,560
Tell me, what happened?

393
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,600
- Abbot!
- Phaya.

394
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,520
Luangpor!

395
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,920
Luangpor!

396
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,320
Tharn is gone!

397
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,280
Luangpor!

398
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,840
(Crying)

399
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,400
Tharn! Tharn!

400
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,920
Hey! Phaya!

401
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,520
Tharn!

402
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,600
Tharn!

403
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,400
Tharn!

404
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,160
Tharn! Where are you?!

405
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,520
Tharn!

406
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,160
Tharn!

407
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,720
Tharn!

408
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:38,880
Hey!

409
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,200
(Jumping into the river)

410
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,360
Tharn!

411
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,200
Tharn! Where are you?!

412
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,640
Tharn!

413
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,840
Tharn!

414
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,600
Phaya…why did you follow me?

415
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,600
I already told you.

416
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,720
I’m not going to let you go.

417
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,120
I decided to spare your life.

418
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,360
But you just chose to leave it here.

419
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,160
If you really love Tharn,

420
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,360
you should stop hurting him.

421
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,920
I’m not hurting him,

422
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,360
I just want to take him back to where he belongs.

423
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,720
To be with someone who can protect him, and love him.

424
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,600
When you said you love him,

425
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,160
the only person you love is actually yourself.

426
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,360
You did all this for yourself.

427
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,800
You’ve never loved him.

428
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,680
No!

429
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,640
I love him. I never forgot about him.

430
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,280
Unlike you who couldn’t remember anything.

431
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,520
Without Wanwisa, you wouldn’t have known the truth you wouldn’t have remembered him.

432
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:07,880
Tharn.

433
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,000
Even if Wanwisa hadn’t told me the truth.

434
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,760
Even if I hadn’t known anything about our past, about who you are.

435
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,960
Even if I hadn't known how much we used to love each other.

436
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,040
Nothing would change.

437
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,600
I still love you.

438
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,920
Just the way you are.

439
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,880
I’m not going to let you go.

440
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,240
I’m not going to make that mistake again.

441
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,680
Tharn.

442
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,160
Come back with me.

443
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,240
Hey!

444
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,640
(Pushing / Falling)

445
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,440
Doc, please let him go.

446
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,840
Leave me alone!

447
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,040
Tharn!

448
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,240
(Fighting)

449
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,560
(Fighting)

450
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,480
(Fighting)

451
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,800
(Fighting)

452
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,200
(Fighting)

453
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,200
(Fighting)

454
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,840
(Fighting)

455
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,640
Ouch!

456
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,680
(Roaring)

457
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,520
(Roaring)

458
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,840
Without you, everything would have been over by now!

459
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,760
(Fighting)

460
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,120
No!

461
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,840
Help!

462
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,920
- Hey!    /    - No

463
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,720
Tharn!

464
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,080
Tharn!

465
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,240
Tharn.

466
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,400
Tharn.

467
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,480
Tharn.

468
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,880
Tharn.

469
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,600
Tharn.

470
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,320
He has always sacrificed himself for you.

471
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,080
But all you do is trying to keep him where he doesn’t belong.

472
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,960
You are selfish.

473
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,560
No, Tharn.

474
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,080
Stay with me, Tharn.

475
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,120
You have to come with me.

476
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,720
Tharn.

477
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,680
Please stop killing each other.

478
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,720
I’m begging you both for one last time.

479
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,480
(Crying in pain)

480
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,440
Tharn.

481
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,000
Tharn.

482
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,360
Tharn.

483
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,560
- Tharn.     /    - Tharn.

484
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,800
Tharn.

485
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,240
He must go back to the Naga cave.

486
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,600
It’s the only way to save him.

487
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,520
Stop being selfish and let him go.

488
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,720
No. No.

489
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:03,880
Tharn.

490
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,280
(Pushing)
Arghhh!

491
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,160
Arghhh!

492
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,800
Tharn!

493
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,320
Tharn!

494
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,160
Tharn!

495
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,360
(Crying)

496
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,960
No!

497
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,480
Tharn!

498
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,560
Tharn!

499
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,040
Tharn!

500
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,480
Tharn!

501
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,080
Phaya, you’re back, dear.

502
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,160
Phaya.

503
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,640
Why am I here?

504
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,760
You were drowned.

505
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,480
You were unconcious for 4 days.

506
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,280
I thought I had lost you forever.

507
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,760
I went looking for Tharn.

508
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,320
Have you found him?

509
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,240
Has anyone found him, Grandma?

510
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,680
Tharn, he...he disappeared.

511
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,240
He’s disappeared since the day he was taken away.

512
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,960
No one has found his body yet.

513
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,640
Where are you going?

514
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,040
- I’ll go looking for Tharn.
- Phaya!

515
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,240
I’ll find him. I know where he is.

516
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,520
Chalothorn has him. I have to go help Tharn.

517
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,280
Where is it then?

518
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,200
In Makhong river. Let me go.

519
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,800
(Crying)
Phaya.

520
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,120
- Let me go.      /     - Phaya.

521
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,120
Phaya.

522
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,000
Let me go!

523
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,600
Phaya!

524
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,360
Get yourself together!

525
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,000
Tharn is gone!

526
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,880
He’s not with us anymore.

527
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,640
Don’t you get it?

528
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,040
(Crying)

529
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,040
Grandma

530
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,120
(Crying)

531
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,960
- Grandma
- Please try to get over it.

532
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,160
(Crying)

533
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,240
Tharn is not going to be with us anymore.

534
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,520
(Crying)

535
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,240
(Crying)
Tharn.

536
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,280
(Crying)

537
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,720
Tharn.

538
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,160
Tharn.

539
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,400
(Crying)

540
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,520
(Crying)

541
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,480
[ Dao: Nee, how’s the situation there? ]

542
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,880
Phaya has already come to.

543
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,560
But...

544
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,400
Tharn has disappeared.

545
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,120
Everyone here is so worried.

546
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,640
[ Dao: Is Grandma okay? ]

547
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,600
Well, sort of.

548
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,200
How are you? Is everything okay there in France?

549
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,360
[ Dao: Things are almost already in place once I’ve arrived. ]

550
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:16,880
[ Dao: Please send my best regards to Grandma and Phaya too. ]

551
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,200
Okay.

552
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,720
- Nee.     /      - Yes?

553
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,320
[ Dao: Please stay strong. ]

554
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:32,240
[ Dao: You have to take care of both Phaya and Grandma right now. ]

555
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,120
[ Dao: I’m worried about you. ]

556
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:37,920
Okay.

557
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,760
[ Dao: I’ll call you again later. ]

558
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,120
Okay.

559
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,080
Paranee.

560
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,760
Phaya has already come to.

561
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,240
Here, take it.

562
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,560
Why?

563
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,880
Just take it.

564
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:39,960
🎵Making me know that what we have has made you walked away🎵
It will help protect you.
Until next time, we’ll meet again.

565
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:51,320
🎵I never want it to be like this. I also have a heart🎵
Do you remember the first time we met at the camp? You know what?

566
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:55,280
🎵A heart that’s only for you🎵
I really want to hug you right now.

567
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:09,520
🎵I don’t want it to be like that. So, what should I do?🎵

568
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:18,880
🎵Or should I disappear?🎵
You don’t want me to stay away from water. Then can I stay close to you instead?

569
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:26,360
🎵No more that person who always has to watch you walk away🎵

570
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:35,200
🎵Or am I the one who should leave? No more tears from now on🎵
Do you believe in past lives and reincarnation?

571
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,760
🎵No more those time we could spend together🎵
I do.

572
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:51,280
🎵You and me, it’s over now🎵
Then I’ll do anything so that I could stay by your side.

573
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,160
I’m not going anywhere.

574
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,640
I’ll stay close to you.

575
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:12,000
🎵It’s over now, isn’t it🎵
I’ll do everything so that you won’t feel sorry or lose me. I promise.

576
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:31,320
🎵I don’t want it to be like that. So, what should I do?🎵

577
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,080
Has anyone found him yet?

578
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,960
Maybe, you should take leave for a while.

579
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,760
Once you’re ready, you can get back to work.

580
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,680
About Tharn.

581
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,440
I’ve asked every officer and authority involved to help search for him day and night.

582
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:26,160
I truly hope we’ll hear something from them soon.

583
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,720
Baby and I took a week off from work.

584
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,720
We’ll help you look for Tharn.

585
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,080
Wherever you’re going,

586
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,800
we’ll go with you.

587
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:01,080
Phaya, do you know that today is the 15th night of the 11th waxing moon?

588
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,280
The elders here believe that on this day...

589
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,320
the Nagas will disguise themselves as human.

590
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,720
Maybe, they might come to help looking for Tharn.

591
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,360
Yeah, so when the first fire ball appears,

592
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,640
we’d wish for you to finally find Tharn.

593
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,280
Are you going to spend the rest of your life like this...

594
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,240
if you can’t find him in this life?

595
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,040
Phaya

596
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,600
There are still lots of work at the unit waiting for you to take care of.

597
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,920
And I don’t think Tharn would want to see you in this state.

598
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,720
I’m sorry, sir.

599
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,960
(Music)

600
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,480
Phaya.

601
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:03,920
Tharn.

602
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:08,240
(Music)

603
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,120
Tharn.

604
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:13,600
(Music)

605
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,120
You are back.

606
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,440
(Crying)

607
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,680
It’s really you.

608
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,120
You came back to me.

609
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,760
Yes, it’s me.

610
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,800
(Crying)

611
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,560
Since that day,

612
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,760
Chalothorn took me back...

613
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,560
and tried to save my life.

614
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:21,240
He gave me his Naga soul so that I’d live.

615
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,960
Then why didn’t you come back earlier?

616
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,480
Do you know how much I really miss you?

617
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,880
I do.

618
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:52,840
But I feel bad for Chalothorn. I wanted to look after him.

619
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,520
And wanted him to truly let me go.

620
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,920
I did everything I could…

621
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,280
to make him understand about us.

622
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,920
So that he would stop making us apart.

623
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,640
And...did he get it now?

624
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,760
He’s not going to take you away from me again, is he?

625
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,120
Yes.

626
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,360
He’s the one who sends me here today.

627
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,320
He wants me to be with you.

628
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:36,920
Please don’t worry.

629
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,720
I will take care of him.

630
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,760
And will always love him.

631
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:07,160
You’re not going to leave me again, are you?

632
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:09,960
Do you know…

633
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,680
that during the time you were gone,

634
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,080
how badly I wanted to see you?

635
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,360
- I miss you so much.
- Say no more, Phaya.

636
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:28,279

(Exciting sound)

652
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,640
Long time no see.

01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,600
Sakunanopparuj.

654
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,120
How do you know my name?
