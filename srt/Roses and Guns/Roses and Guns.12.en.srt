2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,300
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,680
I'm Song Yu'er,

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,360
not Wen Yunong.

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,760
This time,

6
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,320
you still chose your mission

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,200
and abandoned me.

8
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,880
This is the second time.

9
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,080
Officer Jiang.

10
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,160
Didn't you say you were gonna test her?
But...

11
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,220
But you failed to contain your feelings
again.

12
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,560
I thought I could contain my feelings

13
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,600
because I believed she would change for me.

14
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,240
I've never expected

15
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,360
she would never do that.

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,520
You'd better give it up.

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,320
This woman is stone-hearted.

18
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,600
When you seize back the control
of this family,

19
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,120
you can get any woman as you like.

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,600
But Wen Yunong is unique in this world!

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll never give up,

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,120
ever.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,120
Then what are you gonna...

24
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,320
I'll make her admit

25
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,280
she

26
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,760
is

27
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,040
Wen Yunong.

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,360
You wanted to see me?

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,360
What's up?

30
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,120
I'm supposed to be pregnant
for four months.

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,200
I should show a baby bump.

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,480
What am I gonna do?

33
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,000
I can't put a fake baby into it.

34
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,160
Or

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,840
do you have any idea

36
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,240
to cause me to miscarry?

37
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,400
It's easy.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,400
Which doctor did you see?

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,080
A...

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,880
A doctor that I bribed.

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,920
What's wrong with him?

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Nothing.

43
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,960
Send for him

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,240
to prescribe some doses of medicine
for fake abortion

45
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,560
so as to deceive Madam Li.

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,080
Don't worry.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,520
I'll cover you.

48
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,600
What's going on between you and Qin Kewen?

49
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,080
It's none of your business.

50
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,400
None of your business.

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,560
But the doctor and the Japanese...

52
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,320
Forget about it.

53
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,400
It should be fine.

54
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
It's gonna be okay.

55
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,280
Ms. Song,

56
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,040
I'm going out for an emergency.

57
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,480
Would you be kind to send him to his room?

58
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,560
I'll get a servant.

59
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,200
I'll do it myself.

60
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,880
What do you wanna talk?

61
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,080
About Wen Yunong.

62
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,160
She was a patient hunter.

63
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,070
She carefully set up a trap for me.

64
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,240
Do you know since when

65
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
I've totally fallen in love with her?

66
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,200
I don't know.

67
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,760
Since the day I was attacked.

68
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,520
She pushed me aside without hesitation

69
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,360
and got stabbed for me.

70
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,320
From that moment on,

71
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,640
I believed she loved me,

72
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,960
at least at that moment.

73
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,720
People can hardly think
at the moment of life and death.

74
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,760
What drove her to protect me with her life

75
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,000
could be nothing but her love.

76
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,120
From that moment on,

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,520
I swore I would love her
with my heart and soul,

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,880
and she would be the only love of my life.

79
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,200
I wanted nothing but to be with her
forever.

80
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,080
But I've never thought
she was so heartless.

81
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,760
After she used me,

82
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,480
she just went away.

83
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,240
Do you really think
it's all gone without any trace?

84
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,760
The tattoo was fake,

85
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,760
but love is real.

86
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,100
There is a mark that can never be removed

87
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,680
on your body,

88
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,560
a knife scar.

89
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,240
This is the evidence
that you could die for me.

90
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,480
Are you crazy?

91
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Yes, I am.

92
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,080
I hate you now as much as

93
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,600
I loved you before.

94
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,440
You drove me crazy.

95
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,120
I lost everything because of you,

96
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,680
and now I'll get back.

97
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,720
What do you want?

98
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,280
I'm messing up your mission.

99
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,760
I'm gonna tell Qin Boyang the truth.

100
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,600
I'll ruin everyone

101
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,440
that you care about.

102
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,560
I'll start from the maid named Xiaohe.

103
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,400
What do you think?

104
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,400
Don't harm the innocent.

105
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,880
As for this jade pendant,

106
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,720
I might as well ruin it.

107
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,680
I'll ruin everything

108
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,440
that you care about.

109
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
I'll make you lose everything.

110
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,360
This is what you should pay
for dumping me.

111
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,480
Do you dare to show your scar?

112
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,000
Wen Yunong!

113
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,680
Uncle, are you confused?

114
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,360
It's all nonsense in your mind.

115
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,140
I couldn't be more clear about

116
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,000
who I am.

117
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,880
I don't have to prove anything

118
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,000
to anyone,

119
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,160
especially an outsider like you.

120
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,560
Aren't you afraid
I tell Qin Boyang the truth?

121
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,400
Do it

122
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,960
if you must.

123
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,960
I'm just afraid

124
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,160
nothing's gonna happen to me then,

125
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,160
but if your pretending to be disabled

126
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,000
is exposed,

127
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,720
you can't stay in this house

128
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,080
anymore.

129
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,640
Are you threatening me?

130
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,040
How can you say that?

131
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,720
We can continue to keep silent

132
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,560
and get what we want.

133
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,640
It's a win-win.

134
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,040
What if I refuse it?

135
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,160
Then the woman you want

136
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,920
and the military power you wanna seize back

137
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,280
will be gone forever.

138
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,480
Yunong.

139
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,600
I'm not Yunong.

140
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,520
I'm Song Yu'er.

141
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,000
Officer Jiang is back.

142
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,080
Excuse me.

143
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,120
Sir,

144
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,720
it's the urgent battlefield report.

145
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,200
Qin Huai'an got utterly defeated.

146
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,760
Now there is an air of insecurity
in the army.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,280
It's a good timing.

148
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,880
Should we take advantage of...

149
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,040
Wait a little longer.

150
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,880
It's not time yet.

151
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,080
Go get in touch with my father's
old subordinates first.

152
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
(She really took the jade pendant.)

153
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,120
(Something's wrong.)

154
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,780
(The texture doesn't look right.)

155
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,040
(This is a fake one.)

156
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,480
(Qin Kewen couldn't have)

157
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,040
(such a fine fake produced)

158
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,400
(within such a short time.)

159
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,080
(But for my early experience
with this jade pendant,)

160
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,400
(I might have been deceived.)

161
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,400
(That is to say,)

162
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,240
(the jade pendant in Qin Boyang's safe
was fake from the beginning.)

163
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,760
(Why did he forge a jade pendant?)

164
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,160
(No.)

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,600
(If Qin Boyang did it,)

166
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
(he couldn't have been so mad
the day it was gone.)

167
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,760
(The truth can only be)

168
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,400
(that the genuine jade pendant got replaced
to deceive Qin Boyang.)

169
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,240
(Then this person...)

170
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,520
Song Yu'er.
