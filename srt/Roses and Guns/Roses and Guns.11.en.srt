=Episode 11=

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,800
She is getting even more ridiculous.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,590
Master,

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,640
you're right.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,800
As the master's wife in the Qin family,

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,870
she should

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,160
dare to apply for the dancing job.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,720
She really

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,960
doesn't care about you.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,040
I think

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,320
you should have taught her a lesson.

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,160
It's not convenient at home.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,760
I gotta find a way to trick her
out of this house.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Let's do it at the nightclub.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
You ask the men

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,920
to move all the stuff in the warehouse
to the nightclub.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,120
Yes.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,360
Help, Madam!

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,480
Madam!

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,920
Run!

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,680
Master's gonna take you to the nightclub
and punish you.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,560
Take her away.

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,230
Yes.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,440
What are you doing, Qin Boyang?

26
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,840
She's just a maid.

27
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,720
Can't I even decide

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,600
her life or death?

29
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,100
Consider the owner's status
when you beat a dog.

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,400
Xiaohe is my maid!

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,240
Owner?

32
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm the owner of this entire family.

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,600
You even dared to say you were her owner?

34
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,080
Who are you?

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,960
You're nothing but a dog raised by me.

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,160
Are you crazy, Qin Boyang?

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,760
Song Yu'er,

38
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,600
you've been flirting with Qin Kewen.

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,720
You really think I'm blind?

40
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,640
I hate it when someone disobeys me.

41
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
No matter who it is,

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,960
I'll let her pay.

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,040
What about me?

44
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,240
Uncle,

45
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,600
please help me and Xiaohe.

46
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,920
Uncle,

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,240
I was just punishing a servant.

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,800
With a gun?

49
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,760
The maid was so cunning

50
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
that she even dared to eavesdrop on
our business talk.

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,680
I should have

52
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,880
shot her to death.

53
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,560
Since you love shooting so much,

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,680
why don't you go shoot the Japanese?

55
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,960
As a man, how could you bully your wife

56
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,840
and the maid at home?

57
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,640
Does it hurt?

58
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,680
Beating you wife at home,

59
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,920
are you still a man?

60
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,400
Uncle,

61
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,920
this is my household affair.

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
It's none of your business.

63
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,800
You're right.

64
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,520
This is your household affair.

65
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,560
Then as your uncle,

66
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,240
shouldn't I

67
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,920
teach you a lesson for your father?

68
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,800
Officer Jiang,

69
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,520
get him!

70
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,190
Yes!

71
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,080
Qin Kewen,

72
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
what are you doing?

73
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,600
Shooting the maid,

74
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,240
and beating your wife,

75
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,640
you deserve to be punished.

76
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,520
Wait!

77
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,560
Wait!

78
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,880
Sister-in-law,

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,920
you haven't fully recovered, have you?

80
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,480
You'd better lie in bed.

81
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,400
What's the problem with Boyang?

82
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,640
He shot at home,

83
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,240
causing a maid injured.

84
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,040
Sister-in-law,

85
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,720
I wasn't supposed to intervene.

86
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,640
I'm just an outsider, aren't I?

87
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,800
No.

88
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,400
How could you say that?

89
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,760
If your elder brother heard that,

90
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,280
he would surely be mad at me.

91
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,840
It's Boyang's fault,

92
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,200
and he deserves it.

93
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,440
If so,

94
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,400
I'm gonna handle this my way.

95
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,200
Boyang's going to be on his knees
in the ancestral hall

96
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,900
and copy the family discipline
one hundred times.

97
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,480
This is...

98
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,840
Or

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
I'll have to write to my elder brother.

100
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,680
It's just the fighting is intense now.

101
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,760
I really don't want to distract him.

102
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,000
If he punished Boyang more severely...

103
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
You're right.

104
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,400
This is too insignificant

105
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,240
to bother Huai'an.

106
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,160
Boyang,

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,800
go to the ancestral hall.

108
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,200
Mom.

109
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,120
Shut up.

110
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,640
A little impatience spoils great plans.

111
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,200
When your father comes back,

112
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,440
he'll kill Qin Kewen one day

113
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,960
to eliminate the potential threat for good.

114
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,680
Just stop

115
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,280
causing troubles to your father.

116
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
Does a maid

117
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,160
really deserve you

118
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,920
to do so?

119
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,600
Xiaohe is always loyal to me.

120
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,120
I can't just watch her being bullied.

121
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,640
Is this your way to win people's heart?

122
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,320
I just couldn't stand it.

123
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,320
Couldn't stand it?

124
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,720
I thought you could stand everything.

125
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,520
Back then,

126
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,800
you tricked me into
falling in deep love with you.

127
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,480
But then,

128
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
didn't you still dump me
without hesitation?

129
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,560
Are you thinking of Wen Yunong?

130
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,880
Yes,

131
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
and always.

132
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,040
I miss her so much

133
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,120
that I can't wait even one more second.

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,640
Yunong,

135
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,000
you can trust me more.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,200
I trust you.

137
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,000
But everyone

138
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,440
has their reasons unknown to others.

139
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,120
Do you understand?

140
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,640
I do.

141
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,280
Is this your mission?

142
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
You take it to your boss.

143
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,000
Yunong,

144
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,240
I hated you

145
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,640
for what you did to me,

146
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,280
but I hate myself even more.

147
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,560
If I had been strong and powerful enough,

148
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,360
would you have chosen me

149
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,320
instead of your mission?

150
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,760
Yunong,

151
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,760
I know you must be pretending

152
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,120
to be Song Yu'er for your mission.

153
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,480
I can help you.

154
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,040
Please

155
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,800
don't deceive me anymore,

156
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,360
and don't leave me again.

157
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,640
Tell me everything,

158
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,360
okay?

159
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,880
All my families and relatives
died for the jade pendant,

160
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,600
but I've lost it.

161
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,440
Even if I die,

162
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,480
I wouldn't dare to face my father.

163
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,200
Mr. Wu,

164
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,160
for the sake of my deceased father,

165
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,040
please,

166
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
please

167
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,600
let me stay.

168
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,920
I can do whatever

169
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,960
you ask me to do.

170
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,680
I'll avenge my father.

171
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,400
Uncle,

172
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,920
you got the wrong person.

173
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,400
I am Song Yu'er,

174
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
not Wen Yunong.

175
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,880
And this jade pendant,

176
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,880
does it belong to Boyang?

177
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,720
You can give it to him.

178
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,720
You're still denying?

179
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,520
Haven't you confirmed my identity?

180
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,880
I'm not Wen Yunong.

181
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,680
Have you forgotten that?

182
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,000
You...

183
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,230
You...

184
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,480
Good.

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,280
Very good!

186
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,680
Uncle,

187
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,960
I feel sorry

188
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,400
for what happened to you,

189
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,720
but

190
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
I don't wanna be her substitute.

191
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm asking you for the last time.

192
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,000
Who are you?
