1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,800
Because this is my wife.

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,560
It's my fault.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,640
I was so stupid.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,840
Get out!

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:19,880
Yes.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,960
You look different today.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,800
Didn't you hate dressing sexily like this?

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,200
Right.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,040
You're here to be a dancing girl.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,840
What's your new trick?

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,880
(He really mistook me for Song Yu'er.)

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,160
But you like the women
who can sing and dance

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,840
like Lu Xiangxue,

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,440
so you married her, right?

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,880
No.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,560
I actually like

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,480
sensible women like you.

18
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,680
You're docile,

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,840
thoughtful,

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,800
and never give me any trouble.

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,760
As long as you keep it that way,

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,000
you'll always be my favorite.

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,140
=Roses and Guns=

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,380
=Episode 5=

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,160
Master.

26
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,860
(Lu Xiangxue)

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,920
(Why is she back?)

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,120
Madam.

29
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:42,950
Have a seat.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,360
I asked Yu'er,

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,400
she said what happened in the study
last time was a misunderstanding.

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,280
She would like to apologize to you.

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,840
Xiangxue,

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,560
I really didn't mean to push you.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,240
I knew you were pregnant.

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,480
How could I even possibly do that to you?

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,520
I was too careless then.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,440
You won't hate me, will you?

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,720
I never hate you.

40
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,840
I knew you weren't

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,520
a petty girl.

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,840
Boyang,

43
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,000
you go and do your things.

44
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,400
I have something else
to talk with Xiangxue.

45
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,240
It's about women stuff.

46
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,240
You'd better stay out of this.

47
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,240
Okay.

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,720
What do you want?

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,360
Nothing special.

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,600
Song Yu'er, how dare you do this to me?

51
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,880
Why do I dare not?

52
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,280
I'm pregnant,

53
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,200
and I'm carrying Master's baby.

54
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,280
Pregnant?

55
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,400
Get your foot off!

56
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,000
Are you crazy?

57
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,000
I thought

58
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,120
while you were haemorrhaging
after the abortion,

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,480
the doctor told you

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
that you would never get pregnant.

61
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,320
How did you know this?

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,560
You bribed the doctor

63
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,840
and pretended to be pregnant,
thus marrying into the Qin family.

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,840
You even tried to make me
take the blame for your abortion.

65
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
Lu Xiangxue,

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
you're really awesome.

67
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,960
You knew everything?

68
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,000
It's impossible.

69
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,720
How did you know this?

70
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,320
You're not Song Yu'er.

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,520
Who are you?

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,360
A bad woman.

73
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,800
If you don't want

74
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,320
your fake pregnancy to be exposed,

75
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,000
you'll have to know

76
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
what you should do, won't you?

77
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,120
I see.

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
I will absolutely obey you,

79
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,560
and do whatever as you order.

80
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,600
Then tell me about

81
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,400
how Song Yu'er was missing.

82
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,680
She did run away from home,

83
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,960
and the Master told us this in person.

84
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,800
He did?

85
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,070
Sit down.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,510
Mom.

87
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,150
Mom.

88
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,120
What a surprise to see you back.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,510
Mom,

90
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,640
I heard Uncle's coming back today.

91
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,080
I'm going to meet him.

92
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,720
It's about time.

93
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Go meet him.

94
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,110
Okay.

95
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,880
Let's go.

96
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,680
Meet my uncle.

97
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,670
Let's go.

98
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,680
Uncle,

99
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,440
you're finally back.

100
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,120
My father's always concerned about you,

101
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,360
urging me to take good care of you.

102
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,840
But your legs

103
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,760
still haven't healed.

104
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,880
Who is she?

105
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,400
I almost forgot.

106
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,560
Uncle,

107
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,440
this is my wife,

108
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,200
Song Yu'er.

109
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,880
She looks exactly like a woman.

110
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,360
Who?

111
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
A woman who deceived me.

112
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,240
Four years ago, I eloped with her,

113
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,360
but she dumped me halfway,

114
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,440
causing my legs to be ruined.

115
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,960
Uncle, you wanted to see me?

116
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,040
Uncle, you have trouble walking,

117
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,640
I'll go get a candle.

118
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,160
What are you doing?

119
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,120
Take off your clothes.

120
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,320
You can scream louder

121
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,670
to let the entire family

122
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,840
know you're seducing me.

123
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,920
It's you that make passes at me.

124
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,640
How?

125
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,920
With these

126
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,920
crippled legs?

127
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm your nephew's wife.

128
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,800
But you also might be the woman
presented to my father,

129
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,840
and a liar

130
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,320
ruining my family.

131
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,240
Uncle, you must have got the wrong person.

132
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,000
Stop acting dumb.

133
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,360
She has a rose tattoo on her chest.

134
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,960
Let me check yours.

135
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,640
How did you know

136
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,240
the woman presented to your father

137
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,920
has a tattoo on her body?

138
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,080
Of course, it's because

139
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,160
there was something unusual between us.

140
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,520
I just can't believe

141
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,200
one should be so bold and straight

142
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
about the dirty things he did.

143
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,240
Now you can.

144
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,400
Take it off.

145
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,520
(Should I fight against him?)

146
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,200
Yu'er,

147
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,280
are you there?

148
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,560
Yes, I am.

149
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,000
Boyang,

150
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,400
Uncle freaked me out.

151
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,120
What happened?

152
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,040
Somebody!

153
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,120
Uncle is spitting blood!

154
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,120
(Qin Kewen,)

155
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,240
(what do you want?)
