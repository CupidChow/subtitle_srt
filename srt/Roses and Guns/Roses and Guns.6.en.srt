00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,260
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,440
Sir,

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,880
I've investigated

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,640
and did find a woman named Song Yu'er,

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,180
an adopted daughter of a rich merchant.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,440
Perhaps

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,680
they are two different women
who look alike.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,800
Keep investigating.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,160
I'm sure it's her.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,800
One day,

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,920
I'll tear off her mask.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,640
Sir,

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,160
we're back not for a woman

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,760
but something more important.

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,640
I've never forgotten that.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,480
No matter who murdered my father,

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,760
I will make them pay.

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll seize back everything

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,120
that belonged to me.

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,400
Boyang,

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,200
go spend sometime with Xiangxue.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,360
You really want me to be with Xiangxue?

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,000
Xiangxue is pregnant now.

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,800
You should spend more time with her.

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,080
You weren't so generous

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,880
before.

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,960
Didn't you often blame me
for being jealous?

29
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,940
Now I've changed.

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,480
Aren't you satisfied?

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,880
Honey,

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,120
you seem to have learnt a lot

33
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,760
while you were out.

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,200
Then

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,880
don't you like it?

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,920
I do.

37
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,000
A lot.

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,160
Why don't we...

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,760
While I was out,

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,680
I heard a piece of slang that goes:

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,280
a wife is not as good as a concubine,

42
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,900
a concubine is not as good as
someone else's wife

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
and someone else's wife is not
as good as one he can never get.

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,240
Tonight, I don't wanna be the wife,

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,040
but the one

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,240
you can't get.

47
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,080
Yu'er!

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,720
She's getting even more charming.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,800
(Song Yu'er,)

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,920
(where are you?)

51
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,360
(And where is this jade pendant?)

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,960
Come in.

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,240
Madam,

54
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,400
thank God you are alright.

55
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,320
I saw you being kidnapped the other day,

56
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,840
but Master and Madam. Lu

57
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,280
insisted that you had run away from home.

58
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,800
I was so worried about you.

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,280
Tell me the details.

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,080
Help!

61
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,040
Anybody!

62
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,040
Anybody!

63
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,360
Master,

64
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,320
Madam was kidnapped.

65
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,080
But from where I stand,

66
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,720
she has run away from home.

67
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,000
That's true.

68
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,440
This is not the first time.

69
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,120
She had you search for her
each time she goes.

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
She's never tired of

71
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,680
these tricks.

72
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,000
She isn't tired of this,

73
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,480
but I am.

74
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,960
I'm not gonna play with her anymore.

75
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,720
You should have do that long before.

76
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,440
But...

77
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,240
But I really saw her being kidnapped.

78
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,840
For sure?

79
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,640
One hundred percent.

80
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,200
Master!

81
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,360
Are you questioning me?

82
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,320
No, I'm not.

83
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,480
Madam,

84
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,000
you've suffered too much.

85
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,000
Thank you for caring for me so much.

86
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,360
This is for you.

87
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,880
Take it.

88
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,000
Thank you, Madam.

89
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,280
Now

90
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,520
you are my lady's maid.

91
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,680
Madam,

92
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,640
excuse me.

93
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,360
Welcome.

94
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,520
(Yunong?)

95
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,280
(I searched every corner of Qin's house
for the jade pendant, but got nothing.)

96
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,440
(Maybe it's hidden here.)

97
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,280
(Then I have to)

98
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,480
(get the key from Qin Boyang.)

99
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,320
Uncle,

100
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,080
what are you doing here?

101
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,320
What are you doing here?

102
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,240
I was cooking dishes for Boyang.

103
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,840
Where is Boyang?

104
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,280
He is being busy.

105
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,360
But I am hungry now.

106
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,680
Would you mind if I taste it?

107
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,960
Not at all.

108
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,040
This dish tastes

109
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,560
familiar.

110
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,280
Does it?

111
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,360
It's just like the dish

112
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,400
cooked by a woman

113
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,880
named Wen Yunong.

114
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,440
Then congratulations, Uncle.

115
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,320
I've found Wen Yunong.

116
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,200
She is our chubby cook in her fifties,

117
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,040
and all these dishes were cooked by her.

118
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,040
I just told her the dishes I want.

119
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,280
Then why did you say you cooked them?

120
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,280
You must be single now, right?

121
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,240
No wonder you know nothing about romance.

122
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,320
Of course, it's because

123
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,880
I want Boyang

124
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,800
to feel my love and care for him.

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,880
Good for you.

126
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,480
Thank you.

127
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,960
Then would you say something good about me

128
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,480
when you're with Boyang?

129
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,040
Both of you are here.

130
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,470
Boyang.

131
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,440
Boyang.

132
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,760
I've prepared dinner for you,

133
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,880
but Uncle

134
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,120
ate them all.

135
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,680
Uncle,

136
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,880
this dinner was prepared for me.

137
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,520
How could you seize my stuff?

138
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,240
What?

139
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,640
Now I'm crippled,

140
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,400
so I don't deserve
a dinner in the Qin family?

141
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,920
I didn't mean that.

142
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,640
Before my father go out to battle,

143
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,240
he repeatedly urged me

144
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,680
to take good care of you.

145
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,760
It's only a meal.

146
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,200
I'll do whatever

147
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,000
as you request.

148
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,360
I knew

149
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,000
you're filial to me the most.

150
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,040
Of course.

151
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,880
It's my obligation.

152
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,720
Yu'er,

153
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,280
make more meals for Uncle.

154
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,030
Okay.

155
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,670
I'll be filial to you

156
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,440
with Boyang.

157
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,030
Yu'er's cooks really well.

158
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,910
I haven't enjoyed meals like this
for a long time.

159
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,720
Yunong!

160
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,640
Where did you see Wen Yunong?

161
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,720
Yunong,

162
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,360
I've been looking for you for so long.

163
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,920
Who are you?

164
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,320
Who's Wen Yunong?

165
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,080
Why are you call me that?

166
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,800
Yunong.

167
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,190
Wh-

168
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,280
What are you talking about?

169
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm your fiance.

170
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,360
What are you doing?

171
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,280
I'm Qin Boyang's wife.

172
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,000
Boyang,

173
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,440
he insulted your wife like that.

174
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,680
As her husband,

175
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,520
shouldn't you figure out what's going on?

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're right.

177
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,680
Boyang,

178
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,720
you must defend me.

179
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,720
Tell me

180
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,880
where and when

181
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,480
you've seen Yunong.

182
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,520
A month ago,

183
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,360
Yunong broke up with me.

184
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,960
She said she would always love me.

185
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,680
Yunong.

186
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,920
Yunong.

187
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,800
Yunong.

188
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,920
I love you so much

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,200
that I gave up everything for you.

190
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,800
Why are you pretending not to know me?

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,840
Are you crazy?

192
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,200
I don't know you at all!

193
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,920
Let go of me!

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,440
How could you say you don't know me?

195
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,400
It seems that

196
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,040
this woman named Wen Yunong

197
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,720
cheated on you too.

198
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,200
Where is she?

199
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,520
Do you know where she is?

200
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,800
Why are you asking this?

201
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,520
It's none of your business.

202
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,440
But I'm your wife.

203
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,680
How is it none of my business?

204
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,920
You're just eye candy

205
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,200
in my house.

206
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,200
Have some self-knowledge.

207
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,440
Come with me.

208
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,520
Let's talk about Wen Yunong.

209
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,120
Yunong!

210
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,040
Yunong!

211
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,280
I'm Shuyi!

212
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,400
Why does Qin Boyang want you?

213
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,550
He...

214
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,440
He wants Wen Yunong,

215
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,960
not me!

216
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,800
He must be tired of me.

217
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,080
(I will make you show your true colors
one day.)
