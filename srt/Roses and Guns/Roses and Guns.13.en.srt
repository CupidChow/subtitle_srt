=Episode 13=

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,500
(Several days ago)

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,180
(Song Yu'er)

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,360
Madam,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,120
don't blame me.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,720
I'm just paid to do this.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,480
You have to die tonight.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,200
Before death,

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,160
do you have any words?

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,160
Was it Lu Xiangxue that made you do this?

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,880
Does it matter?

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,160
You're gonna die anyway.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,760
What's the point of asking this?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,760
I don't wanna die.

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,640
I have money.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,920
I have money.

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,600
I hid it in a place.

19
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,400
If you let me go,

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,400
I'll give you all my money.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,640
After that,

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,800
I won't stay in Qin City.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,720
I heard

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,120
you were not favored in the Qin family.

25
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,440
How much money do you possibly have?

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,640
I wanted to divorce Qin Boyang long before,

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,320
so I saved a large sum of money.

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,790
Right,

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,680
I also have a jade pendant.

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,120
Qin Boyang valued it

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,160
very much.

32
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,720
It must be worth a lot.

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,720
Where is it?

34
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,040
Tell me.

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,940
You let me go,

36
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,640
and I'll take you there.

37
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,240
Stop! Come back!

38
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,200
Stop!

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,040
- Yunong?
- Stop!

40
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,560
Don't run!

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,040
Come back!

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,920
What are you doing?

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,000
None of your business!

44
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,720
Help me.

45
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,080
It's not over!

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,120
We'll see!

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,000
Yunong,

48
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,520
great.

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,960
I finally found you.

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,240
Do you know

51
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,240
that I've cut all ties with my father,

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,440
and run away from home?

53
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,520
He can't force me
even if he is the Premier.

54
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,360
Yunong,

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,620
we can get married.

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,440
Yunong,

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,340
what's wrong with you?

58
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,600
Your injury...

59
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,120
(The Premier's stupid son
got the wrong person.)

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
(But he came just in time.)

61
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,620
I had my head hit,

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,640
and can't remember anything now.

63
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,560
Who am I?

64
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,240
Who are you?

65
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,120
Doesn't matter, Yunong.

66
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,620
You probably just can't remember
for the moment.

67
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,080
Don't be afraid.

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,280
I'm here,

69
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,320
and I'll be always with you.

70
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,560
Even if you lose your memory,

71
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,120
we can still

72
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,760
fall in love with each other once again.

73
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,640
(Now that I have the Premier's stupid son,)

74
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,000
(I don't have to sell you.)

75
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,160
(Now I'm having such a good life.)

76
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,520
(I really should thank)

77
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,380
(the gangster that kidnapped me
away from the Qin family.)

78
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,680
(But for him,)

79
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,600
(I would never have met Shuyi.)

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,160
(He regards me as Wen Yunong
who lost memory,)

81
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,280
(and is so nice to me.)

82
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,360
(I don't wanna go back
to the Qin family ever.)

83
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,920
Shuyi,

84
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,480
what are you doing?

85
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,720
I met the gangster,

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,040
and he told me about you.

87
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
What did he say?

88
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,920
You are not Wen Yunong,

89
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,400
but Qin Boyang's wife,

90
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Song Yu'er.

91
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,880
I'm not Song Yu'er.

92
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,560
I am Wen Yunong.

93
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,720
You're not!

94
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,200
What are you doing?

95
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,720
Yunong doesn't have this mole.

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,070
And she doesn't squander wantonly

97
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:18,625
and indulge herself in pleasure
like you do!

98
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,120
Song Yu'er,

99
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,520
you've been deceiving me
from the beginning.

100
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,240
I'll never forgive you!

101
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,560
Shuyi!

102
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,260
Shuyi!

103
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,760
You go see the doctor

104
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,800
and get the medicine for the fake abortion.

105
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,320
It's really not easy to pretend
to be pregnant.

106
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,792
I was always afraid of being exposed.

107
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,000
Now it's gonna be over.

108
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,960
You can finally rest assured.

109
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,000
Anyway,

110
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,260
thank you.

111
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:51,920
Go.

112
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,640
Madam, your soup is ready.

113
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,240
(So you're Wen Yunong.)

114
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,920
(Since you became Song Yu'er,)

115
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,160
(why can't I be Wen Yunong?)

116
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,200
(And that Lu Xiangxue...)

117
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
(Lu Xiangxue,)

118
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,120
(you frequently found faults with me
in the Qin family.)

119
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
Wedding photo?

120
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,800
- Don't!
- Xiangxue.

121
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
Song Yu'er!

122
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,720
Boyang!

123
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,860
What happened?

124
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,880
Boyang,

125
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,820
I just

126
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,100
saw her smashing your wedding photo,

127
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,240
and wanted to blame her,

128
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,800
but she pushed me over on the ground!

129
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,000
(And you also had me kidnapped.)

130
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,040
(I'll never spare you.)

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,510
Sir,

132
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,400
Lu Xiangxue came to me for help,

133
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,920
but she hesitated to promise me

134
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,700
to incite defection of Qin Boyang.

135
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,520
She is useless.

136
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,640
What do you...

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,260
I sent her to Qin Boyang.

138
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,040
Now she grew strong enough

139
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,560
to disobey me.

140
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,400
Then

141
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,520
give her a lesson.

142
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes, Sir.

143
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,920
Wise decision.

144
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,200
Remember,

145
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,440
you must make Lu Xiangxue
show her real colors.

146
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,800
What a coincidence.

147
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,480
I'm just about to teach her a lesson.

148
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,260
You just wait at the gate of Qin's house.

149
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,120
When she is dispelled from the Qin family,

150
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,380
she will be at your mercy.

151
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,080
Ask your men

152
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,000
to take her to the Riverside Lane,

153
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,960
right in the run-down house
behind the old locust tree.

154
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,360
Okay.

155
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,400
As you want.

156
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,520
Okay. I'm going.

157
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,320
Doctor,

158
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,160
how is my little grandchild?

159
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,840
Madam, till now,

160
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,120
I don't wanna deceive you anymore.

161
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
I've been guilty over these months,

162
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,960
and sleepless over night,

163
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,600
being afraid this is gonna be exposed.

164
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,260
What do you mean?

165
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,820
It's all my fault.

166
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,820
I was so stupid

167
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,960
that I took her money.

168
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,720
In fact,

169
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,880
she wasn't pregnant.

170
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,720
What?

171
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,680
You're lying. I didn't do it.

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,560
- Mom, don't believe him!
- She'll find out eventually.

173
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,640
You'd better confess to Madam.

174
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,920
Stop lying again.

175
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,120
Mom, he lied.

176
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,880
- Don't listen to his nonsense!
- You bad woman!

177
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,040
- How dare you deceive me?
- Mom!

178
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,060
Somebody!

179
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,000
- Drive her away!
- Mom!

180
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,440
Mom, I didn't deceive you.

181
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,000
I didn't. Don't listen to him!

182
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,840
Don't listen to him!

183
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,320
Mom, let me explain!

184
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,120
Mom!

185
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Who are you?

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,520
You can't be Qin Boyang's wife.

187
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,480
Who are you?

188
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,560
It doesn't matter.

189
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,920
What matters is

190
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,480
whether you wanna live.

191
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,080
I know nothing!

192
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,520
Nothing!

193
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,760
I'll tell you.

194
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,720
Who asked you to do that to Lu Xiangxue?

195
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,560
I don't know who she is,

196
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,840
because she wore a mask.

197
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,400
Where is she now?

198
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,670
In the broken house
behind the old locust tree.

199
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,660
Bring me there.

200
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,000
I've never expected

201
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,440
to get a big fish.

202
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,880
Tell me.

203
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Who are you?

204
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,800
Why would you pretend to be Song Yu'er,

205
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,920
being around Qin Boyang?

206
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,720
Tell me.

207
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,920
You wretch!

208
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,680
Tell me who you are!

209
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,660
Doesn't matter.

210
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,960
You are so tough, aren't you?

211
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,520
I have many ways

212
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,080
to make you talk.

213
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,640
Wait!

214
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,200
Kewen,

215
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,120
what are you doing here?

216
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,440
(Qin Kewen?)

217
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,040
(How come he colludes with the Japanese?)

218
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,720
I'm here to save a person.

219
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,240
Save a person?

220
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,360
Is it her?

221
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,880
If you wanna take Qin City without blood,

222
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
you'll have to kill Qin Boyang
and his father.

223
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,660
And to do this,

224
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,040
you'll need my help.

225
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,240
I've accepted your condition.

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,520
It's not over the line

227
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,040
to ask you for a person, is it?

228
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,880
Kewen,

229
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,440
who is this woman?

230
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,960
You seem to care about her very much.

231
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,840
She is my woman.
