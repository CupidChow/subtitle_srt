00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,040
Jiang,

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,000
you've been with me all these years.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,000
There is one thing
I could only trust you to do for me.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,200
I'm entirely at your service.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,680
Nowadays Qin City is in critical situation.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,120
I have to defend it until the last minute.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,840
Please help me

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,880
escort Yunong

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,880
to safety.

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,960
You've made this decision

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,720
without asking my opinion.

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,080
Why are you here?

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,080
Qin Kewen,

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,240
if you are staying to defend the city,

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,520
I will not leave.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,160
You have to leave.

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,510
What if I insist on staying?

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,200
Are you gonna force me to leave?

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,280
But you can't do anything if you stay.

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,360
Kewen,

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,280
I had no choice before.

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,760
To complete my mission,

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,480
I left you behind over and over again.

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,240
I won't leave you behind this time.

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,160
No matter how dangerous Qin City is,

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,240
I'm gonna stay with you.

29
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,000
Let me stay.

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,280
Okay?

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,430
Okay.

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,000
This is not the right time for you to come.

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,480
If something happens...

34
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,760
My child, I'm so sorry.

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,160
(Kewen should have been back earlier.)

36
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,040
(Why is there no news about him?)

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,320
Madam, bad news.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,600
General is...

39
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,620
What?

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,280
Kewen, Kewen.

41
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,400
Kewen.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,640
Are you all right?

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,560
I'm all right.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,360
Adjutant Jiang has made such a fuss.

45
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,960
Thank god.

46
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Thank god.

47
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,000
Yunong.

48
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,040
Yunong.

49
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,880
Yunong!

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,600
Kewen.

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,080
The doctor told me

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,280
that you are two months pregnant.

53
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,800
I wasn't planning

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,280
- to tell you this.
- Yunong.

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,920
I'm gonna be a father.

56
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,360
Yunong,

57
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,880
do you think it's a boy

58
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,040
or a girl?

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,680
You'll stay with me all the time,

60
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,920
right?

61
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:08,960
Yunong.

62
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,360
Yunong,

63
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,640
I've got something to discuss with you.

64
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,270
You are gonna send me away.

65
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,070
Yes.

66
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,760
I'll send you away first.

67
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,520
I'm not leaving

68
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,520
unless you go with me.

69
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,720
Yunong,

70
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,600
do you remember

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,380
four years ago, in this room

72
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,480
right here,

73
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,320
my father gave an order to kill you.

74
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,080
I meant to go with you.

75
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,880
At that time,

76
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,440
I was just a young marshal.

77
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,040
The safety of the Qin family,
and eight hundred thousand people

78
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,240
in Qin City are my father's duty.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,800
However, today,

80
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,760
I dare not go with you,

81
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,120
and I can't go with you.

82
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,040
But...

83
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,840
But I can't live without you.

84
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,040
Yunong,

85
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,000
I need to stay.

86
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,080
If I stay to defend the city,

87
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,000
tens of thousands

88
00:05:33,738 --> 00:05:35,360
or hundreds of thousands
of people might survive.

89
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
I want to protect them.

90
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,320
I want to protect you and our child.

91
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,400
Kewen,

92
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,200
I don't want to leave you.

93
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,040
Me either.

94
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,600
But it's not safe here.

95
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,200
For our child,

96
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,960
for you,

97
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,160
and for our future,

98
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,840
Yunong,

99
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
could you wait for me?

100
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,400
I'll never wait for something
to come to me.

101
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,600
I'll strive for

102
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,080
what I want.

103
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,480
(Kewen,)

104
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,760
(Qin City is gonna be safe.)

105
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,040
(I promise you.)

106
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,960
General, a call
from the central government.

107
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,360
Yes.

108
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,640
The enemy is as ferocious as flood.

109
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,360
General,

110
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,000
there is no way to keep Qin City safe.

111
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,760
Now that we are permitted to withdraw
by the central government, we...

112
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,960
We just wait.

113
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,920
Xiangxue,

114
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,360
there is something I have to do.

115
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,840
I remember
you used to know a lot of Japanese.

116
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,840
Can you try to

117
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
send me to Colonel Yamamoto?

118
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,360
Colonel Yamamoto?

119
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
The person who is attacking Qin City?

120
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,520
Yes.

121
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,080
What are you going to do?

122
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,960
It's dangerous.

123
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,800
Have you made up your mind?

124
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,840
I can't just sit and wait.

125
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
I've got to do something

126
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,200
for Qin Kewen and Qin City.

127
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,400
I will help you.

128
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,640
Don't worry.

129
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,120
Thank you.

130
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,200
Let me make a toast to you.

131
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,270
Okay.

132
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,240
Slow down there.

133
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,790
Cheers.

134
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,720
Come on.

135
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,480
Here,

136
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,440
let me help you.

137
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,540
One more cup.

138
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,280
- Come on.
- Together.

139
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,270
Kewen.

140
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,080
Yunong.

141
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,160
I've given you a great gift!

142
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,880
Colonel Yamamoto is dead.

143
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,280
The news will be out soon.

144
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,240
If you want to strike back,

145
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,160
this is the wonderful chance.

146
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
You did this.

147
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,760
Wen Yunong,

148
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,560
do you know how dangerous this is?

149
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,520
And you are pregnant with our child.

150
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,040
I'm fine.

151
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,320
Safe and sound.

152
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
I just...

153
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,920
I kinda miss you.

154
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,400
Me too.

155
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,640
Can you see the stars

156
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,360
at your place?

157
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,120
Yes, I can.

158
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,640
Although I cannot stay with you,

159
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
we are under the same starry sky,

160
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,620
fighting against the same enemy.

161
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,880
The winter has passed,

162
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,760
and the spring is coming soon.

163
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,840
We will see each other

164
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,000
when flowers are in bloom.

165
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,040
You are my brightest star.

166
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,843
(Qin City, led by General Qin Kewen,
struggled to defend itself.)

167
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,440
(Meanwhile, the invader chief Colonel Yamamoto
died mysteriously in a hotel.)

168
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:30,868
(Japanese army was forced
to delayed its offensive.)

169
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:32,380
(Qin City won a victory
after reinforcements arrived.)
