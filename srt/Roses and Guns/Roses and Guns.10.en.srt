3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,640
Qin Kewen!

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,840
What are you doing?

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,560
What are you doing?

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,600
I'm gonna kill you.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,560
I'm gonna kill you!

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,560
Gag his mouth!

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,440
Do you want to see me
teaching my nephew?

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,200
I might as well...

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,360
See it.

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,200
As your uncle,

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,600
I failed to discipline you.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,400
I've never thought
you'd developed such a sick hobby.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,760
Your father is in the battlefield,

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,040
unable to discipline you,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,400
but I can't ingore it.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,360
Sir.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,560
How many lashes did you just give her?

20
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,910
Right,

21
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,760
I kinda missed two other lashes.

22
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,920
Is it better to make it five?

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,320
You finish the other two

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,800
by yourself.

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,560
Boyang,

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,400
I've thought about it carefully.

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,280
Now that you're so obsessed
with this sick game,

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,080
as your wife,

29
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,240
I should play it with you.

30
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,840
Don't worry.

31
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,720
I'll learn hard from you.

32
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,480
Will you play with me?

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,520
The medicine is still working,

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,760
but your fever is gone.

35
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,400
Have a good rest.

36
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,920
Thank you.

37
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,440
I'd never thought

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,640
you would come to my rescue.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,040
Seeing your face,

40
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,640
I just couldn't help it.

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,920
Maybe you're Yunong's sister.

42
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,800
How could I ignore it?

43
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,400
You and she...

44
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,760
I love her as much as

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,840
I hate her.

46
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,800
Looking back,

47
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,920
I realized that

48
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,600
our relationship had been
just a part of her plan.

49
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,680
She was an undercover agent,

50
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,200
coming to me on a mission.

51
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,000
But I fell for her.

52
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,920
Yet she...

53
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,400
For her,

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,200
I propably was just a burden
she wanted to get rid of.

55
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,160
(No, Kewen.)

56
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,440
(I...)

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,640
I had intended to elope with her,

58
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,240
but the traffic accident happened
on the way.

59
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,840
To have my legs cured,

60
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,560
I went abroad for doctors

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,800
and stayed there for four years.

62
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,320
I even missed the chance to see my father
before his death.

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,120
Why didn't you come back to see him?

64
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,880
Because I couldn't.

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,400
Or

66
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,760
I couldn't if I was healthy.

67
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,960
My elder brother would never allow it.

68
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,840
My father-in-law

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,600
is quite concerned about you.

70
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,680
Indeed.

71
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
But he is also the person

72
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,080
who wants me to die the most.

73
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,720
Only if I die

74
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,120
will everything of the Qin family

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,600
really belong to him.

76
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,040
Is it because

77
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,760
he was an adopted son

78
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,400
and you are the natural son?

79
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,920
You're right.

80
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,760
My father bore no child when he was young,

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,960
so he adopted my elder brother,
Qin Huai'an.

82
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,120
But I was born later in his fourties,

83
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,600
which made him feel out of place
in this family.

84
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,840
It was not long before he left home.

85
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,720
Then he married Li Weiwei
from the Li family,

86
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,680
and lived with her family.

87
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,560
So there's no genetic connection
between you?

88
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,240
No.

89
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,720
Nothing but deep hatred.

90
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,440
Deep hatred?

91
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,440
Guess

92
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,920
who murdered my father?

93
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,440
Is it him?

94
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,160
Hardly had my father died

95
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,520
when he took control of Qin's army.

96
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,240
You tell me!

97
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,200
If it were not for my disability

98
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,680
without the chance to compete with him.

99
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,560
How could he even have been nice to me

100
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,760
and invited me back?

101
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,800
You're in danger now.

102
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,400
What's your next step?

103
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,720
I'm gonna seize back everything
that belonged to me.

104
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
(I'll help you.)

105
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
(If it weren't for the accident,)

106
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,920
(everything in the Qin family
would have been yours.)

107
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
(After all,)

108
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,720
(this is what I owe you.)

109
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Of course,

110
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,240
the things that belonged to me

111
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,120
also include

112
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,440
my beloved woman.

113
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,240
I gotta get her,

114
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,680
and break her legs,

115
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,440
so this liar who caused my family ruined

116
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,440
can never leave me again.

117
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,880
Did I scare you?

118
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,080
I was kidding you.

119
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,600
You were?

120
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,160
You freaked me out.

121
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,840
I believe

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,840
she must have had no choice.

123
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,400
If she confessed everything to me,

124
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,920
no matter who she is now,

125
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,960
I would forgive her.

126
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,800
(Yunong,)

127
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,120
(tell me the truth.)

128
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,920
(As long as you tell me the truth,)

129
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,520
(I will forgive you.)

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,200
She broke your heart,

131
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,720
and you should forgive her?

132
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,480
Because I love her,

133
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,960
and even I can't believe
I should love her so crazily.

134
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,280
During the past four years

135
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,840
when I was abroad,

136
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,320
my father died distressingly,

137
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,560
and the family property was stolen.

138
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,360
Even my leg got broken.

139
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,560
I had nothing

140
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,200
but the beautiful memory

141
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,840
about her.

142
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,360
I dreamed about her a million times,

143
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,920
and I just wanna ask

144
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,040
"have you ever

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,720
loved me?"

146
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,680
She might be in deep love with you,

147
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,000
but

148
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,680
she had something more important to do.

149
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,160
I know that four years ago,

150
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,960
she chose to perform her mission

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,960
instead of being with me.

152
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,680
That was the first time

153
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,440
I got dumped.

154
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,640
Now

155
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,960
I don't wanna be dumped again.

156
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,880
If she does that again,

157
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,680
I will kill her.

158
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,920
You play it so well.

159
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,560
Do I?

160
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,200
Wen Yunong taught me.

161
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,440
You also play it, don't you?

162
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,800
How can I...

163
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
(He is testing me.)

164
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,780
(Song Yu'er)

165
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,160
(This must be from Qin Boyang.)

166
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,400
(Song Yu'er also plays the violin.)

167
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,800
How can I compare with you?

168
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,160
I'm too inferior

169
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,520
to show in public.

170
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,920
I heard

171
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,560
you often play it before.

172
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,200
I just found it in the warehouse,

173
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,720
and took it out to play for a while.

174
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,440
I hope you don't mind.

175
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,080
Of course not.

176
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,200
As you want.

177
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,440
Why are you standing?

178
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,840
Have a seat.

179
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,120
You're sweating.

180
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,600
Let me help you.

181
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,120
Maybe

182
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,280
it's because of the hot weather.

183
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,960
I wanna hear you play it.

184
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,720
Please don't make me embarrass myself.

185
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,960
Not at all.

186
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:02,950
Come on.

187
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,800
Let me teach you.
