1
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:35,960
Sir.

2
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,440
This

3
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,520
woman...

4
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,880
What should we do with her?

5
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,760
Don't do anything

6
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480
until my father's back.

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,480
Yes.

8
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,780
=Roses and Guns=

9
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,940
=Episode 2=

10
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,320
It's surprising

11
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,480
that you play Western instruments.

12
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,680
I gotta learn something.

13
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,320
Or how can I entertain the guests?

14
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,320
You...

15
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,320
Master,

16
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,000
I know you detest the tease like me.

17
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,120
But if there had been other choices,

18
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,400
who wouldn't have wanted

19
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,120
to be a lady of noble birth?

20
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,920
So I can only seek solace in drink.

21
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,640
You can't drink red wine like this.

22
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Why don't you teach me?

23
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,400
Why are you here?

24
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,440
How can you change so quickly?

25
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,520
It's you that drank too much

26
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,400
and forced me to stay.

27
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,880
It's impossible.

28
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,680
It can't be.

29
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,760
Why are you making such a fuss about it?

30
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,480
You're not saying

31
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,040
it's your first time, are you?

32
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,720
Get out!

33
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,560
(You seem to be fond of innocent girls.)

34
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,640
(Three days later)
Kewen!

35
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,160
Kewen!

36
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,920
You've rejected me three times.

37
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,160
You must take it this time.

38
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,680
I told you

39
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,880
I don't like being accompanied
when I perform a task.

40
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,160
And I don't need a kitchen maid either.

41
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,800
Then I won't be your kitchen maid.

42
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,760
I'll be your

43
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,680
secretary.

44
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,360
But you're illiterate.

45
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,800
Yes.

46
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,560
I'm illiterate.

47
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,560
But I just wanna do something for you.

48
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Have you ever

49
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,000
been concerned about a person

50
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,440
all the time?

51
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,720
I just wanna be always with him,

52
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,400
and I can even give up my life for him.

53
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,670
You...

54
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,030
You...

55
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
You go back and wait for me.

56
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,480
Don't be childish. Go back.

57
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,590
Watch out!

58
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,000
Yunong.

59
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,000
Kewen,

60
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,080
am I gonna die?

61
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,240
No, you're not.

62
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:03,920
Doctor.

63
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,800
Officer Jiang!

64
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,800
Get the doctor!

65
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,440
Yes!

66
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,320
It hurts

67
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,200
so much.

68
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,760
You're gonna be fine.

69
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,280
Can you give me a kiss?

70
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,320
Yunong!

71
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,840
Yunong!

72
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,640
Sorry.

73
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,080
Sir,

74
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,200
General's recovered.

75
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,600
He wants you to get him back quickly.

76
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,550
Sir,

77
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,480
do you think

78
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,760
General will...

79
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,270
Don't worry.

80
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,880
Trust me.

81
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,040
I'm scared.

82
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,000
Can you give a hug?

83
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,160
I'll be back soon.

84
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,640
(Finally I got the key.)

85
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,040
(It's eventually not in vain
that I got stabbed)

86
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,080
(cooperating with Mr. Wu.)

87
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
(General Qin is coming back,)

88
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,840
(I have to get the map in no time,)

89
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,320
(and get out of here.)

90
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,880
(The incomplete map.)

91
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,240
(Here it is.)
