00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,980
=Roses and Guns=

2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,340
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,220
I overheard

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,220
that Qin Huai'an was murdered by Qin Kewen.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,720
Furthermore, Wen Yunong and Qin Kewen
are in love.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,480
I should have known.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,000
You can go now.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,790
Yes.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,840
- Let go of me.
- Move.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,880
What are you going to do?

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,309
- Do you know who I am?
- Be quiet.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,080
Li Shuyi won't stand how you treated me.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,760
He is the son of the premier.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,400
Get in.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:44,950
Mr. Wu,

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,120
here is Song Yu'er.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,840
This jade pendant

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,480
is a fake.

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,160
This jade pendant

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,880
can't be a fake.

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,920
Because I stole it

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,760
from Qin Boyang's safe.

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,920
Don't act any more.

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,480
I know that you have the real jade pendant.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,240
Mr. Wu,

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,200
it is very hurtful

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,920
when you talk like this to me.

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Song Yu'er has told me everything.

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,340
She changed the real jade pendant
with a fake one.

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,900
And you

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,760
took it afterward.

32
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,920
Where is Song Yu'er?

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,040
I'll release her

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,280
if you cooperate.

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
The pendant is not in my hands.

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,960
I won't carry it with me.

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,720
I know.

38
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,680
It's in Qin Kewen's hands.

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
And he

40
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,800
would exchange you

41
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,560
with it, for sure.

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,040
Is this Miss

43
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,200
Wen Yunong?

44
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,520
Right.

45
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,480
If you want to achieve a bloodless victory,

46
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,600
she is the key.

47
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,800
You've sold out to the Japanese!

48
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Miss Wen

49
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,000
is somewhat pretty.

50
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,080
You are lucky

51
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
to have impressed Mr. Sato.

52
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,120
(Nothing venture, nothing win.)

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
(This is a chance.)

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,120
Yunong.

55
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,160
Yunong.

56
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,480
Yunong.

57
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,760
Yunong.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,680
Xiaohe.

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,680
- General.
-Xiaohe.

60
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,920
Have you seen Madam Wen?

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,560
No.

62
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,200
Go find her.

63
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,790
Yes, Sir.

64
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,120
General,

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,760
you should see this.

66
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,720
(Wen Yunong's in our hands now)
Someone left this letter at the door.

67
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,280
It asks you to exchange
Madam Wen with the jade pendant.

68
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,920
- Get the car.
- Yes.

69
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,870
General,

70
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,760
you know very well this is a trap.

71
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,400
Are you still going to risk your life?

72
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,640
Yunong is in their hands.

73
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,920
I can't take it lightly.

74
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,520
I'm gonna go

75
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,720
even if it's dangerous.

76
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,880
Is everything ready?

77
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Here you are at last.

78
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,680
Here is what you want.

79
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,520
Where is she?

80
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,320
Easy,

81
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,440
she is right here.

82
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,800
Once I get the jade pendant,

83
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,920
I'll release her.

84
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,520
It seems you don't know the rules.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,760
I have to take a look at her at least.

86
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
Enough?

87
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,440
Now you are assured.

88
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,560
Give me the jade pendant.

89
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,240
Release her,

90
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,600
and let her walk toward me.

91
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,920
Give me the person
and I'll give you the thing.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,120
Do what he says.

93
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,640
Keep walking.

94
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,120
Don't move.

95
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,440
Yunong,

96
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,680
just go.

97
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,720
I'm not Wen Yunong,

98
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,920
I'm Song Yu'er.

99
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,360
Didn't expect this?

100
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Wen Yunong is not here.

101
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,440
Where is she?

102
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,260
You pull a gun on me.

103
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,640
I dare not to tell you.

104
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,360
Tell me where she is,

105
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,480
and I'll spare you.

106
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,160
Come out, all of you.

107
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,760
The Japanese.

108
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,680
You have underestimated me.

109
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,560
Wen Yunong's skills

110
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,280
were all taught by me.

111
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,960
It was you

112
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,320
who sold out to Japanese.

113
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,000
What then?

114
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,200
Qin Kewen,

115
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,400
I have a piece of good news for you.

116
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,240
In a few moments,

117
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,720
your loved one will be brought here.

118
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,120
She is going to

119
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,200
watch you die.

120
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,470
Move.

121
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,040
Well,

122
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,160
I've seized a big fish here.

123
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,800
Mr. Sato,

124
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,360
why don't we make a deal?

125
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,480
What deal?

126
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,320
Kill Mr. Wu,

127
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,120
and I'll set you free.

128
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,630
All right.

129
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,320
It's a deal.

130
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,920
Mr. Wu,

131
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,240
every dog has its day.

132
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,000
It's my turn now.

133
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,000
Yunong,

134
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,640
are you gonna disregard our relationship
as teacher and student?

135
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,120
I've thought of giving you a chance.

136
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,120
But you ruined everything

137
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,680
when you sold out to the Japanese.

138
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,120
Do it.

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,640
Do it.

140
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,840
The person is dead now.

141
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,360
Let go of me.

142
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,540
My people haven't left yet.

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,520
Kewen,

144
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,840
you go first with Yu'er.

145
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,960
Go.

146
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,960
Yunong, you go first

147
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,680
- and I'll handle this.
- It's not the right time

148
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,960
to argue with me now.

149
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,720
Don't worry.

150
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,000
I have my own arrangement.

151
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,180
(Two months later)

152
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,540
The secret treasure trove is in this spot.

153
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:41,920
(The National Revolutionary Army;
General Zhang)

154
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,000
These are fortunes accumulated
by the Wen family for generations.

155
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,520
According to my father's wish,

156
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,540
now

157
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,500
I hand it in.

158
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,040
Before,

159
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,660
I've heard from Mr. Wen

160
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:58,160
that after the Japanese
invaded the northeast China,

161
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
his hometown,

162
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,360
he has sold all his property.

163
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,120
And tried to

164
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,960
get these munitions from abroad

165
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,760
to support the anti-Japanese war.

166
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,600
I'll do it for him.

167
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,880
Besides,

168
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,240
as an intelligence expert,

169
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,600
you'd better withdraw
from Qin City as soon as possible.

170
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,280
The Japanese are about to attack the city.

171
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,320
I'm aware.

172
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
But I won't go.

173
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Because of Qin Kewen?

174
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,480
Because of him,

175
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,280
and my father as well.
