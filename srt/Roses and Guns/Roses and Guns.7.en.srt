=Episode 7=

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,560
Master,

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,960
I've sent Li Shuyi away

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,480
at your orders.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,240
Keep searching for Wen Yunong.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,040
Remember,

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,120
I want her alive.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,150
Yes.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,360
Please

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,360
bless my husband Qin Huai'an

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,520
with good health

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,760
and safety in battles.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:41,960
Stop!

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,480
Kneel down.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,960
Didn't you hear me?

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,520
Have you been out?

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,360
I brought meals to Boyang.

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,000
Brought meals?

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,840
Now that you've married into our family,

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,200
you should

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,320
stay at home,

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,800
wait upon you parents-in-law,

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,040
and bear children.

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,600
But now,

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,800
you're still childless after three years.

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,960
Worse still,

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,760
you ran away from home again and again.

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,000
I should have made Boyang divorce you.

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,120
Mom,

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,680
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,920
Stay here on your knees.

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,440
If you break your legs kneeling,

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,680
maybe

35
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,320
I would spare you this time.

36
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,200
(She suddenly gave me a hard time,)

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,840
(which is unusual.)

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,680
(Who told on me?)

39
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,680
(And this evil mother-in-law)

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,360
(must have repeatedly made things difficult
for Song Yu'er.)

41
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,440
(I gotta do something.)

42
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,840
Evil woman!

43
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,640
You dared to curse me, and even beat me!

44
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,560
Go to hell!

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,760
Not only did I tell on you to Madam Li,

46
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,600
I'll also let everyone know who you are,

47
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,680
and ruin your face.

48
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,440
Evil woman!

49
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,640
Go to hell.

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,920
It's really you.

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,880
Madam, I was wrong!

52
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,800
I'll never do that again.

53
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,160
Please don't beat me!

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,040
Your childish tricks

55
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,920
are really disgraceful.

56
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,560
Yes.

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,960
It's disgraceful indeed.

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,760
Madam,

59
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,080
I won't do that again.

60
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,080
Please forgive me.

61
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,520
It really hurts when you beat me!

62
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,700
(Song Yu'er)

63
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,160
You little good-for-nothing,

64
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,840
let me teach you

65
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,680
how to play some brilliant tricks.

66
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:05,960
Okay.

67
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,320
Now you can go tell on me.

68
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,800
What?

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,720
Mom,

70
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,320
look at Song Yu'er.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,280
You made her on her knees last time,

72
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,000
she didn't obey you
but slipped away secretly.

73
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,080
You must teach her a real lesson this time.

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,000
Song Yu'er.

75
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,440
Mom!

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,200
Mom!

77
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,560
I'm sending for the doctor.

78
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,440
You hang on there.

79
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,110
Mom,

80
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
are you alright?

81
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,280
It hurts!

82
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
You should have been careful.

83
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,320
Let me check it.

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,070
Don't worry.

85
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,120
I've learned bone setting.

86
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,000
It hurts even more!

87
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,240
Mom,

88
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,680
it looks

89
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,840
serious.

90
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,400
I'll send for the doctor.

91
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,080
You...

92
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,640
You bad woman!

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,280
You bad woman!

94
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,600
It's gonna be 100 days to recover
from a foot injury.

95
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,960
Now Li Weiwei is unable to control her.

96
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,720
Nice trick!

97
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,080
Should we let Qin Boyang know the truth?

98
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,480
This is between me and her.

99
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,200
Obviously you still have feelings for her.

100
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,680
Sir,

101
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,120
what are we gonna do now?

102
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,520
Qin Huai'an has been out for battles.

103
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,720
He must have been carrying
the military seal with him.

104
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,120
We can't get it.

105
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,480
No hurry.

106
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,560
He'll be back one day,

107
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,480
then he will find

108
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,120
his men

109
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,680
are working for a new boss.

110
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,440
How much coptis did you put in?

111
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,840
Do you know how bitter it is?

112
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,640
Mom,

113
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,840
the doctor said

114
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,640
you had too much liver-fire,

115
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,800
so you need more coptis to reduce it.

116
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,280
You did it deliberately!

117
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,760
- Mom!
- It hurts so bad!

118
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,160
Get out!

119
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,400
Xiangxue,

120
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,560
take good care of Mom.

121
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,160
She is in poor health, after all.

122
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,280
If she scolds you,

123
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
or punish you,

124
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,800
just take it,

125
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,760
don't talk back to her.

126
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,560
If you ever dare to talk back,

127
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,080
I won't spare you.

128
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,350
Mom,

129
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,640
I'm leaving.

130
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,800
Look at those affectations.

131
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,200
What an evil woman!

132
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,920
What are you doing in my room?

133
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,320
Did I give you my permission?

134
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,160
I was gonna ask you the other day.

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,480
A rising movie star back then

136
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,120
(Alive with the Wind)
now becomes a nameless concubine.

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,960
Are you really happy?

138
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,520
Even you come to mock me?

139
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
I'm not mocking you,

140
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,160
I feel sorry for you.

141
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
You were in movies

142
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,200
as a star.

143
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,040
Do you know how hard it is
to have a career for a woman?

144
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,200
Why did you give it up?

145
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,040
I couldn't be popular forever,

146
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,280
so I had to marry a man for a decent life.

147
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,840
Don't I?

148
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,120
A decent life?

149
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,680
Pretending to be pregnant,

150
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,120
and scheming and plotting against
another woman,

151
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,600
is it your decent life?

152
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,320
Think about your past.

153
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
Are you really happy now?

154
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,200
Of course, I'm not.

155
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,280
But what can I do?

156
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,280
I can't go back anymore.

157
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,880
Please be honest and tell me

158
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,520
if you got involved in

159
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,320
the disappearance of Song Yu'er.

160
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,160
I know nothing.

161
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,560
Qin Boyang won't change your fate.

162
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,320
You should think carefully about

163
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,360
who you can really count on.

164
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,400
Is that you?

165
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,680
It's yourself.

166
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,520
Of course,

167
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,760
I can help you,

168
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,040
and you can help me too.

169
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,120
How about this?

170
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,760
You do me a little favor first.

171
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,640
What have you got in your hand?

172
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,920
Why are you asking this?

173
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,640
Come over.

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
Give me your hand.

175
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,760
Why do you always give me a hard time?

176
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,560
You made me take off my clothes
when you first met me,

177
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,760
and now you wanna check
what I've got in my hand.

178
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,560
Can't you just let me go?

179
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,480
Let you go?

180
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,840
Of course, I can,

181
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,960
as long as you let me check

182
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,680
if there is the tattoo on your chest.

183
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,280
What a rogue!

184
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,960
See? Now I'm a rogue.

185
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,200
Where is it?

186
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,480
I had nothing in my hand,

187
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
but you didn't believe me.
