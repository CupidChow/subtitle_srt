1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,980
=Roses and Guns=

2
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,080
Kewen,

3
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,840
finally you're back.

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,520
My father's always concerned about you,

5
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,760
asking me to take good care of you.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,240
But your legs

7
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,160
still haven't been healed.

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,280
Who is she?

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,800
I almost forgot that.

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,960
Kewen,

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,840
this is my wife,

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,600
Song Yu'er.

13
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,280
She looks quite like a woman.

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,760
Who?

15
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,120
A woman who cheated me.

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,640
Four years ago, we eloped together,

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,760
but she dumped me halfway,

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,840
and ruined my legs.

19
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,620
=Episode 1=

20
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,780
(1933 Qin City)

21
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,660
(Wen Yunong)

22
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,400
What are you doing, Sir?

23
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,520
(Qin Kewen)
This is Mr. Chen's place.

24
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,270
What's going on?

25
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,310
Who knows.

26
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,240
Now

27
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,120
it's mine.

28
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,670
Action!

29
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,430
Don't move!

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,720
Officer Zheng is dead.

31
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,360
Good.

32
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,800
It's exactly the time

33
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,800
we've agreed on.

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,040
Then Mr. Wu,

35
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,320
are you gonna tell me about my family...

36
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,000
Yunong,

37
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,320
here came a very important task today,

38
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,760
which we have to complete right away.

39
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,560
What is it?

40
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,240
Take a look.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Qin Kewen.

42
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,680
I saw him just now.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,120
It's none of her business.

44
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,600
Let her go,

45
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,760
and I'll let you die in dignity.

46
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,640
Qin Kewen,

47
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,440
don't push me.

48
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,400
I'll count to three.

49
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,270
One.

50
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,670
Two.

51
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,720
Three.

52
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,200
Thank you.

53
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,040
Sir,

54
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,560
Officer Zheng is not pretending.

55
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,600
He got poisoned.

56
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,240
How did it happen?

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,040
At the casino just now,

58
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,560
he almost ruined my plan.

59
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,120
But I just brushed past him,

60
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,320
so he could barely see my face clearly.

61
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,880
That'll be good.

62
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,080
Not long ago,

63
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,640
General Qin was attacked by an assassin,

64
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,360
and was seriously injured.

65
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,960
Qin Kewen investigated it and found out

66
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,000
the Japanese had bribed

67
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,200
one of his fathers' subordinates,

68
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,880
who then betrayed his father.

69
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,160
(The Japanese thought)

70
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,480
(he was just a coward coming to beg them
to spare his father,)

71
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,560
(and would be at their mercy.)

72
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,760
Eat it, quickly!

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,760
Eat it!

74
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,600
It's gonna be so much fun.

75
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,120
Look, he is kneeling down.

76
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,520
Eat it. Let's continue.

77
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,000
(Nobody had expected)

78
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,800
(Qin Kewen would kill them,)

79
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,480
(avenging his severely injured father.)

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,680
And now to be serious,

81
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,440
there is an incomplete map in Qin's house,

82
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,280
but we don't know the exact position.

83
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,840
Your task this time

84
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,960
is to get the map.

85
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,200
No worries.

86
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,240
I've created a new identity for you.

87
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,000
As long as you complete this task,

88
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,680
I'll tell you everything

89
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,880
about your family.

90
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,160
Mr. Wu,

91
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,040
I hope you'll keep your promise.

92
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,560
Then this time,

93
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,600
who am I gonna be?

94
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,160
Sir,

95
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,320
bad news!

96
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,080
Somebody presented a woman to General.

97
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,200
It's absurd.

98
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
My father is still in hospital.

99
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,840
Why does he need a woman?

100
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,040
Send her away.

101
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,080
But she's already here,

102
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,040
and won't leave.

103
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,120
Then drive her away.

104
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,480
But she...

105
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,720
I'm losing my patience.

106
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,840
(He's really a man
of spirited and ambitious ardor.)

107
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,720
(Unfortunately,)

108
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,360
(to avenge my father,)

109
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,160
(I have no choice but to do this to you.)

110
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,880
Come in.

111
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,200
I heard you've asked your men
to drive me away.

112
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,760
So what?

113
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,840
Nothing.

114
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,960
I was just wondering,

115
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,120
as a son,

116
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,680
why should you drive away
your father's woman?

117
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,280
He is not home,

118
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,840
and I'll the master of this family.

119
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,320
Are you telling me

120
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,880
as long as I get you,

121
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,760
I'll be able to stay?

122
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,560
What do you want?

123
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,960
Put on your clothes.

124
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,160
Can you even pull the trigger?

125
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,720
What if I'm a sharpshooter by accident?

126
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,880
You can't even slip off the safety catch.

127
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,800
You're right.

128
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,160
I can't pull the trigger,

129
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,560
and can barely read.

130
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,480
It's only because
I have this tolerably pretty face,

131
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,680
and act slutty enough

132
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,840
that I was chosen to be sent here.

133
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,680
But just in this case,
you can't send me away.

134
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,920
Because you have no idea

135
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,360
what a hopeless woman

136
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,000
will do.

137
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,200
Like

138
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,160
pulling a gun on me?

139
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,760
No.

140
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,080
Sir,

141
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,080
you only have two options today.

142
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,240
Either

143
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,440
you let me stay,

144
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,040
or

145
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,440
you shoot me.

146
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,440
However,

147
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,720
I'm worthless.

148
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
Nobody will pick on you of higher position

149
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,200
just for a woman like me.

150
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,480
What if

151
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,520
I have another option?

152
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,760
See you out politely.

153
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,920
Okay.

154
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,040
Now that you want me to leave so much,

155
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,400
I'll be dressed like this,

156
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,520
walking out of your house.

157
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,560
I'll drop by all the newspaper offices
in the Qin City,

158
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,560
telling the reporters a fantastic story,

159
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,760
a romantic story between General Qin's son

160
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,200
and his woman.

161
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,840
You really think

162
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,520
I won't kill you?

163
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,960
Sir, you pull the trigger

164
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,880
not any better than me.
