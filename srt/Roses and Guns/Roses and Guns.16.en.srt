00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,620
(Mee Koo May)

4
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,120
Qin Kewen,

5
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,200
you lied to me.

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,440
You are not disabled at all.

7
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,840
If I didn't pretend to be disabled,

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,120
did Qin Huai'an dare to take me home?

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,240
Did you dare to hurt me?

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,480
Qin Boyang.

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,320
Listen,

12
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,880
this is the revenge

13
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,000
for the car accident.

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,240
How is he?

15
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,560
Please reassure yourself, he is fine.

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,360
Over there.

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,800
Kewen,

18
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,040
you all right?

19
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,550
I'm all right.

20
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,440
I'll give it to you.

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,470
Song Yu'er,

22
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,920
you wretch.

23
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,200
How dare you betray me?

24
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,320
Song Yu'er dares not,

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,520
but Wen Yunong dares.

26
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,080
You are

27
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,400
Wen Yunong?

28
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,680
What a surprise!

29
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,920
It was Song Yu'er who ran away from home,

30
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,480
but it was Wen Yunong who's come back.

31
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,680
Now that the jade pendant is back to me,

32
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm gonna revenge today

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,680
for the murder of my father

34
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,920
and the extermination of my family.

35
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,520
So this is it!

36
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,640
I was wondering

37
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,720
why I got interested in you

38
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,280
after you were back.

39
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,920
Because you are not Song Yu'er.

40
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,120
You are Wen Yunong.

41
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,640
The irreplaceable Wen Yunong.

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,040
What a shame.

43
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,640
I have no interest in you.

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,680
There is only hatred.

45
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,320
I am her one

46
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,160
and only.

47
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,880
Do you know

48
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,800
why I killed your father

49
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,480
in the first place?

50
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,640
Because...

51
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,880
Because...

52
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,560
Because...

53
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,320
This is between me and him.

54
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,800
Let me handle it.

55
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,320
You could do that with a single shot.

56
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,560
Why don't you cut the crap?

57
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,230
Wait a minute.

58
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,160
Wen Yunong,

59
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,480
your father died

60
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,640
because of you.

61
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,240
What did you say?

62
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,960
If you agreed to marry me

63
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,160
eight years ago,

64
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,600
your father wouldn't have died.

65
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,840
Qin Boyang,

66
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,040
do you know why I look down upon you?

67
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,600
Tell me.

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,400
Tell me.

69
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,000
Tell me.

70
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,840
Tell me.

71
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,840
Tell me.

72
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,760
You don't deserve to know.

73
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,640
He doesn't love you.

74
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,480
A man who truly loves you

75
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,600
will recognize you at first sight.

76
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,160
When I see you for the first time,

77
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,600
I'm certain that you are not Song Yu'er.

78
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,240
You are Wen Yunong,

79
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,720
my love.

80
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
I remember

81
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,040
that you threatened to kill me

82
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,720
at the beginning.

83
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,040
Because you pretended to be another woman,

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,360
and acted like we don't known each other.

85
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,200
You're jealous?

86
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,360
Yes, I was.

87
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,880
Why did you leave?

88
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,800
I had no choice.

89
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,590
Sorry.

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You should compensate me.

91
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
How?

92
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,640
I didn't prepare a wedding ring,

93
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,400
but I think

94
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080
this is the best moment

95
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,560
to be perfectly honest.

96
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,880
I've let go of hatred,

97
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
and you are no longer escaping.

98
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,960
In front of me,

99
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,080
you can just be yourself.

100
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,960
We both have moved on

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,160
and wish to start over again.

102
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,680
Yunong,

103
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,840
will you marry me?

104
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,520
Yes,

105
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,640
I will.

106
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,030
Kewen,

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,440
I've got one last person to finish off.

108
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Qin Huai'an.

109
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,120
He is behind
the extermination of my family.

110
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,080
I'm gonna have to kill him.

111
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,800
You should thank me if this is the case.

112
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,480
This is your father's military seal.

113
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,280
Has Qin Huai'an...

114
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,240
I've sent him to hell

115
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,880
to confess to your father and mine.

116
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,980
It's been eight years.

117
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,560
These hard days finally passed.

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,880
Someone is outside.

119
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,320
How are you going to thank me?

120
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,240
What do you think?

121
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,660
Let's put on a play.
