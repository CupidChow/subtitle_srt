00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,980
=Roses and Guns=

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,260
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,200
Do you know what I do?

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,720
You're a spy.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,200
Then are you still gonna work for me?

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,390
Yes.

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,080
Yunong,

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,840
stand up.

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,840
Let's work together

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
to find out the murderer

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,560
and the jade pendant,

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,640
avenging your father.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,080
I'll train you

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,200
to be a real spy,

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,720
and a heroine

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,040
in darkness.

17
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,500
(Father Wen Shouchu, Daughter Wen Yunong)

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,600
Dad,

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,760
I'll find the jade pendant back,

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,600
and also avenge

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,280
our family.

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,680
To this end,

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,240
I can give up everything.

24
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,300
(Four years later)

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,360
Yunong!

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,910
Yunong!

27
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,720
Don't go!

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,760
Yunong!

29
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,480
Why would you break up with me?

30
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm just an orphan.

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,880
Your parents

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,640
won't permit our relationship.

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,320
I don't care.

34
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,960
I can elope with you.

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,200
But you deserve better.

36
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,600
You're the Premier's son

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,080
with bright prospects,

38
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,840
and you'll surely meet a better girl.

39
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,360
But remember,

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,240
no matter where I am,

41
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,080
I'll always love you.

42
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,590
Let's go.

43
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,800
Yunong,

44
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,120
I love you too!

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,040
Wait for me!

46
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,840
I'll come to find you!

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,920
(Mission completed.)

48
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,320
(Farewell, Master Li.)

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,880
I've eliminated the spy around the Premier.

50
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,480
As agreed,

51
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,120
shouldn't you tell me
where I can find the jade pendant?

52
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,640
Yes.

53
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,200
Yunong,

54
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,440
do you know

55
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,600
Qin Boyang?

56
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,840
Of course.

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,400
He was my fiance
that my father had chosen for me

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,080
before he died.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,320
I've been investigating

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,560
and found that around the extermination
of your family,

61
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,240
the Qins acted weird.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,760
Over these years, Qin Boyang has been

63
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,360
looking for you.

64
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,680
Then one day,

65
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,040
he got married suddenly.

66
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,160
Got married?

67
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,040
What's special about this?

68
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,680
Take a look.

69
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,480
Who is this woman?

70
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,600
Why does she look exactly like me?

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He married a woman exactly like you,

72
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,120
named Song Yu'er.

73
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,240
I did have a twin sister,

74
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,040
but she got lost when she was little.

75
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,320
You mean...

76
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,480
Look at this picture carefully.

77
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,720
The jade pendant.

78
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,040
Exactly.

79
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,880
The jade pendant it is.

80
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,920
It's in the Qin family.

81
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,920
That is to say,

82
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,280
the Qin family must have been part of

83
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,260
the extermination of your family.

84
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,150
I see.

85
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,440
I pretend to be Song Yu'er

86
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,240
to enter the Qin family,

87
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,160
where I'll find out the truth

88
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,520
and get the jade pendant back.

89
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,560
Then I'm telling you a piece of good news,

90
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,200
maybe also bad news.

91
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,280
Song Yu'er has been missing for a week

92
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,720
until now.

93
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,320
Missing?

94
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,440
Mr. Wu,

95
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,680
was it you that did this?

96
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,000
Then you really do me wrong.

97
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,520
You'll find the truth yourself

98
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,360
when you enter the Qin family.

99
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,520
Of course, I'll do that.

100
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,310
By the way,

101
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,440
do you know the relationship

102
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,040
between Qin Boyang and Qin Kewen?

103
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,720
Sharing a family name,

104
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,520
are they relatives?

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,240
Yes.

106
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,880
Qin Kewen is

107
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,960
Qin Boyang's youngest uncle in the clan.

108
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,360
Yunong,

109
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,720
this time,

110
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,760
you're not gonna be his father's woman,

111
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,560
but his nephew's wife.

112
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,920
I almost forgot this.

113
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,400
Qin Kewen is returning to China.

114
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,000
Sir,

115
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,720
the ship is about to set sail.

116
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,040
We should get going.

117
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,640
I'll get you,

118
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,720
liar.

119
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,600
(Qin Boyang,)

120
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,320
(if you really killed my father)

121
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
(and seized the jade pendant,)

122
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,040
(I'll make you pay with your life.)

123
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,540
(Dancing Girls Wanted)

124
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,840
(I can't  just pretend
to be Song Yu'er to enter the Qin family.)

125
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,440
(I have to see)

126
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,960
(if I can deceive
Qin Boyang with this face.)

127
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,470
Master,

128
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,440
trust me,

129
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,600
it's definitely a terrific beauty,

130
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
fascinating

131
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,680
and charming.

132
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,240
Shall I bring her to you?

133
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,560
If I woke up from a dream about her,

134
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,440
I would slap myself in the face.

135
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,760
Really.

136
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Bring her.

137
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,750
Yes.

138
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,260
(Qin Boyang)

139
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:42,910
Master,

140
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,720
here she is.

141
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,400
If we have this stunning dancing girl
in our club...

142
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,240
Slap.

143
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,560
Understood?

144
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,880
Do you know what you did wrong?

145
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,120
I...

146
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,200
don't.

147
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,920
Can I ask why?

148
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,600
Because this is my wife.
