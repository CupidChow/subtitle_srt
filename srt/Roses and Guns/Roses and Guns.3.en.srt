00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,040
(The incomplete map.)

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,720
(Here it is.)

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,320
How come Qin Kewen's back so quickly?

6
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,280
Kewen.

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,920
Haven't you gone to pick up your father?

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,590
How come...

9
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,800
What are you doing?

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,160
My injury hasn't healed yet.

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,280
My father said

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,480
he would kill you as soon as he gets back.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,040
Is it because

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,320
he found something between us?

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,800
He'll never allow this to happen in here.

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,120
Are you sending me away,

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,560
or sending me to die?

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,680
I'm sending you away!

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,160
Wen Yunong,

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,840
I don't care who you are,

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,760
and what you've experienced.

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,960
I won't let you die.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,320
Then what about you

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,560
if I leave?

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,120
I'm his son, after all.

26
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,680
Even if he is in a fit of anger,

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,960
he won't kill me.

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,800
I'm not leaving.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,800
I love you!

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,800
Wen Yunong,

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,640
I can't let you die.

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,600
I'll send you to Nanjing.

33
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,400
As soon as my father calms down,

34
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,640
I'll get you back,

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,400
and we'll get married.

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,320
Are you gonna marry me?

37
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,360
But people will judge you.

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,040
I don't care.

39
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,550
Yunong,

40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,760
I couldn't be part of your past,

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
neither could I change it,

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,440
but from now on,

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,120
I, Qin Kewen,

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
will protect you.

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,400
Kewen,

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
go with me.

47
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,680
Okay?

48
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,200
Okay.

49
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,880
I'll go with you.

50
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,400
(Wen Yunong,)

51
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
(are you really letting go of the past?)

52
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,260
(A week later)

53
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,660
(General Qin's Youngest Son Injured
in a Traffic Accident, and Still in a Coma)

54
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,860
(General Qin's Youngest Son; In a Coma)

55
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,360
Where are you going?

56
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,320
I wanna go check on Qin Kewen.

57
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,640
I managed to save you

58
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
from the traffic accident

59
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,240
to help you get away from this.

60
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,080
Now are you gonna bite the hook?

61
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,600
How is he now?

62
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,120
Not life-threatening.

63
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,200
But you've been exposed.

64
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,960
He hates you.

65
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,880
Mr. Wu,

66
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,440
please tell me the truth.

67
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,880
Why were you at the accident site?

68
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,120
Are you still suspecting me?

69
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Our task was just to get the map,

70
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,240
not to take revenge on General Qin.

71
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,800
There is someone else

72
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,680
behind the accident.

73
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,000
Wen Yunong,

74
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,440
I gotta remind you

75
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,320
of your identity.

76
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,440
Never fall in love

77
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,560
with your target.

78
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,390
I...

79
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,320
I didn't.

80
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,040
I just...

81
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,600
I just feel sorry.

82
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,440
I hope so.

83
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,920
Don't you forget

84
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,320
how did you survive until today.

85
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,440
I won't forget.

86
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,640
I've never forgotten the death
of my entire family,

87
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,920
not even for a moment.

88
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,920
Good.

89
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,760
Romance

90
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,640
and love

91
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,920
can only

92
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,800
weaken your will,

93
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,520
and blunt

94
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,400
your blade edge.

95
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,680
If you still wanna take revenge,

96
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,400
you have to forget him.

97
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,790
Dad,

98
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,920
you're bleeding so much.

99
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,080
Yunong,

100
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,320
I can't go further.

101
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,360
Take this jade pendant

102
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,160
and run quickly.

103
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,160
Remember

104
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,880
to give it to General Zhang.

105
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,040
Dad,

106
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,320
I'm not going.

107
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,240
I'll avenge you.

108
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,760
Go find your fiance, Qin Boyang.

109
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,640
I hope you can live well.

110
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,920
As a girl,

111
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,600
never try to

112
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,400
seek revenge.

113
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,200
Dad!

114
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,200
I heard something happened
to your family yesterday.

115
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,360
I rushed there with my men,

116
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,400
but

117
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,200
it's too late to save all your families
but you.

118
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,150
Who killed my father?

119
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,320
There is still no clue.

120
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
Perhaps it's because of the jade pendant.

121
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,760
The precious stone

122
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,800
lands its innocent possessor in jail.

123
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,360
Where is the jade?

124
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,960
I was just about to ask you.

125
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,200
My father gave me the jade,

126
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,480
and I ran away carrying it.

127
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:00,910
The jade...

128
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,600
The jade must have dropped there.

129
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,720
I've had my men

130
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,920
search there,

131
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,920
but we got nothing.

132
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,600
Before my father died,

133
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,800
he had specially urged me

134
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,600
to give the jade pendant to General Zhang.

135
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,720
But now I lost it.

136
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,280
Dad,

137
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,440
What's done cannot be undone.

139
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,280
Yunong,

140
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,120
do you have any plan in the future?

141
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,200
Mr. Wu,

142
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,040
all my families and relatives

143
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,080
died because of the jade pendant.

144
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,600
Even if I die,

145
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,160
I can't face my father in heaven.

146
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,800
Mr. Wu,

147
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,920
for the sake of my father,

148
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,560
please,

149
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
please,

150
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,120
let me stay.

151
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,280
I'll do whatever

152
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,320
I can do.

153
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,160
I must avenge my father.

154
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,120
Do you know what I do?

155
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,720
You're a spy.
