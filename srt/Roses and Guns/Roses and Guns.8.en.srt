1
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,680
I really underestimated her.

2
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,800
Sir,

3
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,200
should I take her back?

4
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,400
No.

5
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,680
Have you found

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,800
what I want?

7
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,440
Sir,

8
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,440
let me do this.

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,040
If anyone finds our about your legs...

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,840
No.

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,280
I want to

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,760
stretch my legs as well.

13
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,140
=Roses and Guns=

14
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,500
=Episode 8=

15
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,630
(It's really you.)

16
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
What are you doing here?

17
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,880
Get out.

18
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,840
I said get out.

19
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,800
Didn't you hear me?

20
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,400
Stop it,

21
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,040
Wen Yunong.

22
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,560
I told you a million times

23
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,480
that I'm not Wen Yunong.

24
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,400
What should I do to make you believe me?

25
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
You know what to do.

26
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,200
You just wanna insult me.

27
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,360
I'm not in the mood for that.

28
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,640
All I want to do now

29
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,960
is to kill you.

30
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,880
Take it off!

31
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,640
Fine.

32
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,320
I'll show you.

33
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,200
But

34
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,680
if I don't have that tattoo

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,000
on my body,

36
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,080
you must treat me

37
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,120
as your nephew's wife

38
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,480
in a proper way.

39
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,120
No problem.

40
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
It's impossible.

41
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,200
What?

42
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,520
Are you satisfied now?

43
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,520
It's impossible.

44
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,120
Now could you please get out?

45
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,080
Don't forget your promise.

46
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,280
(I wasn't that stupid.)

47
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,480
(Doing this kind of job,)

48
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,320
(I'll never get a tattoo)

49
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,160
(that can't be washed off.)

50
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,960
(Isn't it Yu'er's room?)

51
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,960
Yu'er!

52
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,910
(Jesus!)

53
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,110
Yu'er!

54
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Boyang.

55
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,280
What happened?

56
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,000
Your uncle

57
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,240
has gone too far.

58
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,440
Hardly had I walked out of the bathroom

59
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,640
when I found him sitting in my room.

60
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,440
He even made passes at me.

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,240
Did you seduce him?

62
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,950
No...

63
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,360
I didn't.

64
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,120
We've been together for so many years.

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,640
Don't you know me?

66
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,880
He insisted that

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,080
I was like Wen Yunong

68
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,320
who has been missing.

69
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,600
Do you

70
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,080
also think I'm like Wen Yunong

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,120
that much?

72
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,640
She is way too much better

73
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,400
than you.

74
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,640
If you really think she is better,

75
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,960
why did you marry me

76
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,320
instead of her?

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,400
Are you being childish again?

78
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,840
Boyang,

79
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,680
you must

80
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,400
promise me something today.

81
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,480
Promise what?

82
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,080
When will your uncle leave?

83
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,880
I don't wanna see him again.

84
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,160
My father knew he was disabled,

85
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,640
and thought he was pathetic alone abroad,

86
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,360
so he asked him back.

87
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,680
I can't send him away

88
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,880
before he gets well.

89
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,200
You mean his legs

90
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,760
really got broken?

91
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,280
What do you mean?

92
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,960
I mean

93
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,560
is there any chance

94
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,920
that he is pretending to be disabled?

95
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,640
It's not impossible.

96
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,920
Now my father is on the front,

97
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,360
while he goes out to visit friends
every day.

98
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,960
Maybe he is trying to win some support.

99
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,040
I can't let him do that.

100
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,840
Boyang,

101
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,640
you uncle

102
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,280
is so weird.

103
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,480
But he seems curious

104
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,480
about me.

105
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,400
How about I testing him for you.

106
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,600
If I find him

107
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,160
not disabled,

108
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,160
then we can send him away

109
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,320
in just ways.

110
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,960
For the first time,

111
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,960
you pay so much attention on a man.

112
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,920
Are you gonna

113
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,440
hit on him?

114
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,080
Impossible.

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,480
Of course, it's all for you,

116
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,280
and for this family.

117
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,040
How wise and selfless you are!

118
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,840
Then you'll take care of it.

119
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,640
What's up?

120
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,920
Master,

121
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,000
bad news!

122
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,480
Manager said the safe had been cracked,

123
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,460
and the jade pendant's gone!

124
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,520
What?

125
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,790
Get the car!

126
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,320
I'm coming over.

127
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,120
(I can't let Qin Kewen
interrupt my mission.)

128
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,200
(I gotta drive him away.)

129
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,160
Master.

130
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,240
Good-for-nothing!

131
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
The map is still nowhere,

132
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,080
and now the jade pendant is gone.

133
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,800
Have I been making so much effort

134
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,360
just for nothing?

135
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,200
Search for it!

136
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,920
You must find it.

137
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,160
Yes, Master!

138
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,600
Wait.

139
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,240
What are you doing?

140
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,400
Apologizing.

141
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
For what I did to you,

142
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,720
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,320
I misunderstood you,

144
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,200
and I'll never be rude to you.

145
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,440
Seriously?

146
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,950
Seriously.

147
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,080
That was a misunderstanding,

148
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
and it's all in the past.

149
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,670
By the way,

150
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,480
I was just about to ask you something.

151
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,960
What?

152
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,360
Am I really like Wen Yunong

153
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,560
that much?
