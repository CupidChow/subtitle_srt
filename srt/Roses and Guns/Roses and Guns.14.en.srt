=Episode 14=

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,200
Kewen,

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,560
who is this woman?

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,160
You seems to care about her so much.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,520
She is my woman.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,000
Qin Kewen,

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,560
what are you doing?

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,320
Shut up!

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,320
You don't have any place
in this conversation.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,360
Kewen,

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,640
it's a deal.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,000
Take her away.

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,440
We'll attack them

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,600
when possible.

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,920
You got shot.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,600
I'm fine.

18
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,840
It's not fatal.

19
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,600
Your legs...

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,720
Haven't you long known that?

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,840
In the nightclub that night,

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,200
we fought in front of the safe.

23
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,080
Until now,

24
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,680
you still deny it?

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,120
Let me take care of your wound first.

26
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,200
I want Wen Yunong,

27
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,320
not Song Yu'er.

28
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,200
If you must act Song Yu'er,

29
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,700
get out of my face.

30
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,120
Get out!

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,560
Just do your business

32
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,760
regardless of my life.

33
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,920
Sir!

34
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,790
No.

35
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,280
Your wound must be treated now.

36
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,160
Let's go.

37
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,440
Wen Yunong,

38
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,360
I've never thought you would come.

39
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,680
Thank you.

40
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,600
It was all my fault.

41
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,400
I was to blame.

42
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,400
Thank you, Wen Yunong.

43
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,360
Without you, I would be hopeless.

44
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,720
I saved you.

45
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,440
Now can you tell me

46
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,360
how Song Yu'er was missing?

47
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,680
I really didn't do it.

48
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,680
I was just paid

49
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,400
to distract the guards.

50
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
That's all.

51
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,360
Who paid you?

52
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't know her name,

53
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,520
but she was a thirty-some woman,

54
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,560
dressed like a man.

55
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,760
(Mr. Wu,)

56
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,360
(was it you?)

57
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,040
Thank you.

58
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,680
I'll figure out this matter.

59
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,560
Is there any place for you to go?

60
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,200
I can give you some money

61
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,440
and have you sent to a safe place.

62
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,640
You saved me,

63
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,360
I'll do anything for you.

64
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,520
If you want the intelligence
of the Japanese,

65
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:55,920
I...

66
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,200
I can...

67
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,320
Lu Xiangxue,

68
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,080
raise your head!

69
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,320
Previously,

70
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,080
you had no choice,

71
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,200
so you did many wrong things,

72
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,080
and harmed many people,

73
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,200
but they were not out of your will.

74
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,960
Now that you're free,

75
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,360
you don't have to do anything
for anyone

76
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,520
but for yourself.

77
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,520
You must live well.

78
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,520
Lu Xiangxue,

79
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,480
you had me kidnapped,

80
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,440
almost killing me.

81
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,440
You must

82
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,240
pay for this.

83
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,720
It's you,

84
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,880
Song Yu'er.

85
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,440
Wen Yunong?

86
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,120
You know me?

87
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,000
I've seen you at the gate of Qin's house.

88
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,560
Why do we have the same face?

89
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,640
It's a long story.

90
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,000
Actually,

91
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,840
I'm your twin sister.

92
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,040
Sister?

93
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
I had been straying on streets

94
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,040
until I was presented to Qin Boyang
by the Song family.

95
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,920
I almost died from being bullied
by the Qins.

96
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,560
Now you're telling me

97
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,200
I had a family and a sister?

98
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,120
Sorry, it's my fault.

99
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,920
I should have found you

100
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,720
and come to you earlier.

101
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,160
Then don't mind me!

102
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,880
You don't know how hard I've been living.

103
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,640
Everyone loves you.

104
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,800
Qin Boyang loves you,

105
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,360
and Li Shuyi loves you too.

106
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,080
You know Li Shuyi?

107
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,240
When he found I wasn't you...

108
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,480
You've been deceiving me
from the beginning.

109
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,800
I'll never forgive you.

110
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,320
Shuyi!

111
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Shuyi!

112
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,080
He dumped me.

113
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,880
I don't love Shuyi,

114
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,600
but I know him well.

115
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,440
He is a soft-hearted man.

116
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,920
As long as you make a sincere apology,

117
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,800
he'll forgive you.

118
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,280
Really?

119
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,560
Trust me.

120
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,140
(She's really carrying the jade pendant
with her.)
