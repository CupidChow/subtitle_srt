00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,980
=Roses and Guns=

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,340
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,600
I was just about to ask you something.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,240
What?

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,480
Am I really like Wen Yunong

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,560
that much?

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,600
Except this mole,

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,800
there's nothing different between you two.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,880
Is there any chance

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,160
that we are twin sisters

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,760
without knowing each other?

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,600
Maybe.

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,960
Boyang's still hung up on her.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,960
Was it Wen Yunong

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,480
that he wanted to marry at first?

16
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,600
It's gross.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,960
What do you mean?

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,840
He loved this one,

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,920
but married another one.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,640
He insulted both,

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,840
and love.

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,040
You're right.

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,520
Yu'er.

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,640
Nothing.

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,440
(Kewen,)

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,280
(after so many years,)

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,320
(you haven't changed at all.)

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,120
Sir,

29
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,360
now that she has no tattoo on her body,

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,280
and there is no problem
with her background,

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,640
maybe we got it wrong.

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,200
I don't believe this stuff.

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,120
I only follow my heart.

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,680
With wild ambition, the Japanese
are conspiring to conquer China.

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,480
The war between China and Japan

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,200
is inevitable.

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,160
I heard you'd killed Japanese,

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,560
which was really cool.

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,440
Can you teach me that?

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,080
As a girl,

41
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,920
why do you wanna learn

42
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,080
fighting and killing?

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,880
Anyway,

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,240
I'll protect you.

45
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,880
Our nation is in danger.

46
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,640
Everyone has the responsibility
to guard our nation,

47
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,640
including women.

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,440
You'll see.

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,200
When I'm recovered,

50
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,560
I'll develop excellent skills,

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,960
maybe I'll be the one to protect you then.

52
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,920
Why are you laughing?

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,480
Don't you believe me?

54
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,520
I do.

55
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,560
I do believe you.

56
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,120
You got stabbed for me

57
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,920
regardless of your life.

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,160
You did protect me.

59
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,040
What good weather

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,240
today.

61
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,960
Because

62
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,880
it's already Spring.

63
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,760
What do you want?

64
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,560
I...

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,640
What?

66
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,640
Stop hemming and hawing.

67
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,600
It's not your style.

68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,640
I was doubting whether Qin Kewen

69
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,200
is disabled.

70
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,620
But it's inappropriate for me to test him,

71
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,720
so I need your favor.

72
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,670
Okay.

73
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,360
But this is the last time.

74
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,800
Uncle,

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,080
you don't look very well.

76
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,480
Is it that the meal doesn't agree with you?

77
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,920
Hardly.

78
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,360
Uncle, you're Grandpa's youngest son
he had in his later life,

79
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,520
so if there is anything valuable,

80
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,360
it'll be first presented to you.

81
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,600
No wonder these common dishes

82
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,000
don't suit your taste.

83
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,120
Having had too many delicacies,

84
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,640
I just miss the common dishes.

85
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,200
Who just kicked me?

86
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,320
Who?

87
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,160
I...

88
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,840
I didn't mean it.

89
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,960
Xiangxue,

90
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,800
you were too careless.

91
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,760
I didn't mean it.

92
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,280
Xiaohe,

93
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,760
make another meal
and deliver it up to Master.

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
Yes.

95
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,160
Xiangxue,

96
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,720
you're pregnant.

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,360
You have to eat more

98
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,560
for nourishment.

99
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,980
The baby is kicking me.

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,080
I'm going to the bathroom.

101
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,560
What do you think

102
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,880
of this meal?

103
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,360
It's good.

104
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
I'll go check if Xiaohe
has prepared the meal.

105
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,120
Master!

106
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,480
Master, let go of me!

107
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,800
You call Madam every time.

108
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,520
- You probably forgot
- I'm Madam's maid!

109
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,760
who is the real master of the Qin family.

110
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
- Boyang.
- Madam!

111
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,880
What happened?

112
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,040
Madam!

113
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,040
I didn't seduce Master!

114
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,790
You're such a coward.

115
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,790
How could you keep whining like this
when scolded?

116
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,320
I dare you.

117
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,840
You're excused.

118
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,750
Yes.

119
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,550
Wait.

120
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,200
Boyang,

121
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,440
you barely had the meal,

122
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,920
so I come upstairs to check on you.

123
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,240
Are you upset?

124
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,360
What?

125
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Are you gonna eat with me?

126
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,760
Okay.

127
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,560
Let's

128
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,600
open a fine wine.

129
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,120
Wait for me.

130
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,160
You can leave.

131
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,200
Yes.

132
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,120
What did you put in...

133
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,240
Just for fun.

134
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,600
Sir,

135
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,640
aren't they Qin Boyang and her?

136
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,160
What are they doing?

137
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,440
Something is wrong.

138
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,480
Let's go have a check.

139
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,080
Sir,

140
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,880
we should keep low-key now.

141
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,280
If you interfere rashly,

142
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,120
it may make Qin Boyang suspect you.

143
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,240
Keeping forbearing

144
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,480
is to make a difference when necessary.

145
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,320
Then is it necessary now?

146
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,480
Yes.

147
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,480
For the last time.

148
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,360
For the last time.

149
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,160
Get him!
