2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,340
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,640
I'll forgive you
if you tell me where Lu Xiangxue is.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,520
Lu Xiangxue is not the kidnapper.

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,200
It was a misunderstanding.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,080
I am your sister.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,120
Why are you speaking for her?

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,080
Keep a close eye.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,960
Don't let anyone out.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,920
(I can't let Song Yu'er
fall into Mr. Wu's hands.)

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,790
Yu'er,

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,200
do you know how to swim?

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,520
Just jump out.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,000
Go find Li Shuyi.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,200
Stay out of my business

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,160
or you'll be dead.

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,680
That was Song Yu'er.

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,520
Why did you let her go?

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,640
Your cover might be blown.

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,880
I was startled by you,

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
letting her seize the moment

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,760
to escape.

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,880
Did you get the jade pendant?

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
(She doesn't know)

25
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,200
(the real jade pendant was
in the hands of Song Yu'er.)

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,240
(I could try with the fake one.)

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,280
I can give you the jade pendant,

28
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,520
but

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,880
you've got to promise me something.

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,320
The family extermination eight years ago

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,720
was done by Qin Boyang.

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,520
But it was Qin Huai'an

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,520
(Spare no one when necessary)
who gave the order.

34
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,260
(Qin Huai'an)

35
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
The aim

36
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,360
is your father's

37
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,640
secret treasure trove.

38
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,240
Brutes.

39
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,400
I have no objection

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,520
to your revenge.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,960
But your father's last wish

42
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,040
was to give the jade pendant
to General Zhang.

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,360
Yunong,

44
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,560
do you understand?

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,480
This

46
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,360
is the jade pendant
I stole from Qin Boyang's safe.

47
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,680
Hand it in.

48
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Please.

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,400
(Mr. Wu,)

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,600
(you've become)

51
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,920
(more and more unscrupulous.)

52
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,080
(This is the last chance
I'm gonna give you.)

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,280
(Don't let me down.)

54
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,480
How long has it been for us

55
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,520
to sit down and talk like this?

56
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,360
Around ten years?

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,000
Thirteen years.

58
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,790
Really?

59
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,480
It's been such a long time?

60
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,880
Although I rank as your senior,

61
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,360
we are actually the same age.

62
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,480
I'd rather say we are brothers

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,440
than uncle and nephew.

64
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,000
I often recall

65
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,440
the times when we spend together
as young boys.

66
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,680
Uncle,

67
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,200
we are too young to recall the youth.

68
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,600
By the way, let's talk about

69
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,840
Wen Yunong.

70
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,320
You might not know

71
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,400
that I was engaged to her.

72
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,390
This is my handkerchief.

73
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,360
You are Qin Boyang?

74
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,320
Give it back.

75
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,680
No problem.

76
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,720
Give me a kiss first.

77
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,880
All right, close your eyes.

78
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,520
Interesting, the young lady
of the Wen family.

79
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,320
Were you?

80
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,360
Now that you are married to Song Yu'er,

81
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,480
the engagement should be void.

82
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,080
What if I find her

83
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,520
and rekindle our relationship.

84
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,720
Isn't it a wonderful thing?

85
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,760
You like her?

86
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,320
Of course I do.

87
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,360
Who doesn't?

88
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,640
I'm sure you will agree with me.

89
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,520
You've

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,400
got a weak spot since you were little.

91
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,240
Too greedy.

92
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,920
You've wanted everything in your pocket.

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,480
In the past,

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,760
I thought you'd be satisfied

95
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,880
if I gave you enough.

96
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,920
But I was wrong.

97
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,040
Uncle,

98
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,800
what do you mean by this?

99
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,080
There are people
that you should keep your hands off,

100
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,680
otherwise

101
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,200
they'll get you killed.

102
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,360
Since we lost in the battle front,

103
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,560
everyone has been in panic.

104
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,400
I've heard

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,040
that Qin Kewen has been in contact

106
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,480
with General Qin's former subordinates

107
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,840
to extend power.

108
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,720
Master,

109
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,120
I think

110
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,640
he is up to something.

111
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,360
Of course.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,560
He boasts of the would-be heir.

113
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,120
And he has been restless
even if he is a disabled commander.

114
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,520
My father was being kind

115
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,520
to take him home.

116
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,240
If I were Father,

117
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,260
I would let him die in another country.

118
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,600
Master,

119
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,240
should we...

120
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,760
So, without further ado,

121
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,480
do it at once.

122
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,110
Yes.

123
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,200
Hosebeast.

124
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,440
Yu'er.

125
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,600
Darling,

126
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,680
where are you going?

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,240
I'm going to sleep in my room.

128
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,400
Really?

129
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,920
I thought you are going
to the adulterer to snitch.

130
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,560
Adulterer.

131
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,560
What adulterer?

132
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,000
(He's finally going to)

133
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,120
(make a move?)

134
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,280
Why did you come?

135
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,260
Why are you banged up like this?

136
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,150
The dinner party tonight is a trap.

137
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,120
Qin Boyang's gonna kill you.

138
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,240
You must not go.

139
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,220
Do you know what you are talking about?

140
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,520
I do.

141
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,880
Why did you come here

142
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,600
- to inform me?
- Because I don't want to watch you die.

143
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,840
Why exactly?

144
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,280
Because...

145
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,080
Because you saved my life.

146
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,540
That's not the reason.

147
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Tell me

148
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,320
why, Wen Yunong.

149
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,880
Because I love you.

150
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,040
You admitted it

151
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
at last

152
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,200
that you are Wen Yunong,

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
instead of Song Yu'er.

154
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,430
Right.

155
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,280
I admit it.

156
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,660
Uncle,

157
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,880
the car is ready.

158
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,760
Wait a minute.

159
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay.

160
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,120
Do you want Qin Boyang to disappear
for good?

161
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,660
Answer me.

162
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,150
Yes

163
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,760
or no?

164
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,440
Yes.

165
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,080
Are you gonna start the fight?

166
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,120
I've already started.

167
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,160
You can't go.

168
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,760
Qin Boyang's got a lot of people.

169
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,360
You are still wounded.

170
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,150
Yunong,

171
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,280
this is my battle.

172
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,160
I can't run away.

173
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,040
Wait for me.
