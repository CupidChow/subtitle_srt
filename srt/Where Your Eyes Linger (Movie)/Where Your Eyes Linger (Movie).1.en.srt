00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,433
Han Taeju, you son of a bitch!

2
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,300
- Stay right there, asshole! 
 - Stop following me.

3
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,833
You, go that way.

4
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,867
You're damn fast.

5
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:11,567
All right.

6
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:15,300
I was pretty cool about you and Mingyeong.

7
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,600
But with 3 girls? Way over the line.

8
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,100
Move aside! You guys are too tall.

9
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,967
Mingyeong?

10
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,000
- She was pretty. A bit short, though. 
 - Watch your tongue.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,067
What about Hyeonjeong?

12
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:31,900
- Do you know how much I loved her? 
 - She hit on me first.

13
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,200
I'm nearly traumatized thanks to you.

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,567
Though I don't buy Christianity, I didn't expect Gippeum would...

15
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:39,767
Because she was so devout.

16
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,467
She was the most attractive one.

17
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:42,933
You!

18
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:45,033
What's so special about him?

19
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:48,367
I'm even better looking! No?

20
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:58,967
If you hit me, you'll pay the price dearly.

21
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:02,200
My dad is a director of TB Corporation, asshole.

22
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,867
Laughing?

23
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:11,500
You keep laughing, huh?

24
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:29,767
- Did you do this? 
 - Go easy on him.

25
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:31,867
I was wondering why you didn't turn up.

26
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:34,400
You are his minion, aren't you?

27
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,967
Sure I am.

28
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:43,700
Look at this minion shit.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,700
Are you okay?

30
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:55,633
You know what?

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,167
My dad is the chairman of TB.

<i>[Where Your Eyes Linger]</i>

34
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:33,267
I didn't assign you to Taeju to play house with him.

35
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:35,600
I apologize.

36
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,433
It wasn't playing house.

37
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:40,333
It did hurt.

38
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,600
You haven't changed your ways, have you?

39
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,467
I took a punch because I didn't want any trouble.

40
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:48,367
Han Taeju,

41
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:54,133
whenever you make trouble, I'll beat up Guk.

42
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,433
If this happens once again,

43
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,500
I will send you off to England.

44
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:08,400
I got you a house so that you could lie low and live quietly there.

45
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,133
You'd better behave yourself.

46
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:14,300
- Yes, Sir. 
 - Okay.

47
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:30,867
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,700
For what?

49
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,300
Didn't expect getting hit would be wrong.

50
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:41,733
Then don't. Just hit them next time.

51
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:45,800
I'd rather do that.

52
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,800
You shouldn't have said you are the chairman's son.

53
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,900
That idiot got on my nerves.

54
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,633
He said his dad is a director.

55
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:57,033
How pathetic is that?

56
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,490
We are having a hard time not getting recognized.

57
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,300
Just be careful.

58
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:09,767
What? Having a hard time?

59
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,467
Are you having a hard time?

60
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,167
I'm having the time of my life now. I'm happy.

61
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,933
Aren't you happy?

62
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,867
We can order in as much chicken as we want

63
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,633
and play video games all night, you and I.

64
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,700
We can have ramen, too.

65
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,667
All right, I'm happy, too.

66
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:51,767
Darling, I don't want to go to England.

67
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:54,367
- Don't do this. 
 - Why not?

68
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:56,400
Come off it. I kill you.

69
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,033
Look at you. Hey!

70
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:00,967
Get off me, damn it!

71
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:06,600
Are you all right?

72
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,733
- I told you not to do it. 
 - Damn it.

73
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,100
Were you faking it?

74
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,400
- Worried? 
 - Sure.

75
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
I'll show you my skills.

76
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,267
Thought you were hurt. Huh, you can't win against me.

77
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:25,367
-cAre you messing with me? 
 - I could do worse.

78
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:27,900
Attacking your weak spot.

79
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,933
Here.

80
00:06:57,433 --> 00:07:00,633
- Looks nice. 
 - The food is good.

81
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:03,533
No one from our school. That's the best thing.

82
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:07,067
I've just started this restaurant of late.

83
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:14,000
Let me guess.

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,100
You're a top and you're a bottom, aren't you?

85
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,000
Sorry?

86
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:27,033
Top, bottom?

87
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:32,167
Oh my! Watch it. There are customers here.

88
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:35,767
Sorry, Mom. It's the air pollution.

89
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,167
This is the boy I was talking about. My first customer.

90
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:47,567
It lifted my mood that he's so handsome.

91
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:51,400
Uh-oh. Is it you?

92
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,133
Is my palate good then?

93
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:00,100
A little.

94
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,000
What is it? Why are you following us?

95
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,933
Mom kept telling me about you.

96
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:18,300
You are cuter than I thought.

97
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Look!  Girls normally look at me, not him.

98
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah.

99
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,533
Give me your number.

100
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:34,100
Are you asking his number?

101
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,433
Not mine?

102
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,800
Here you are.

103
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:53,300
See you around.

104
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,767
Hey.

105
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:04,300
- What was that? 
 - What about it?

106
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,100
You've been flirting around while I was in Japan.

107
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,567
I saw her for the first time today.

108
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:17,400
You were acting all serious and cool.

109
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,733
What are you saying?

110
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,600
Happy you gave her your number?

111
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,667
I didn't.

112
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,300
What then?

113
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,367
A fake number.

114
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,933
Seriously?

115
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,800
Okay.

116
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,267
<i>[No incoming text]</i>

117
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:29,833
I'm thirsty.

118
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:31,967
So?

119
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,567
Buy me some choco milk, please.

120
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:38,600
- You're a rich boy. Buy it yourself. 
 - No, you buy it for me.

121
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,867
- Wanna die? 
 - Come on.

122
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:53,200
What now? I thought it was over.

123
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,167
I'm sorry.

124
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't know why but dad told me to apologize to you.

125
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,567
Damn insulting.

126
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:11,267
Accepted. What a shitty world, huh?

127
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,667
Are you really the son of the TB chairman?

128
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,367
No, he isn't.

129
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:19,767
Even if he was, it's none of your business.

130
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:24,267
I did apologize. All good now, right?

131
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,233
Don't snatch my fourth girlfriend.

132
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,700
- What're you doing? 
 - I'm sorry, too.

133
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,233
- Let's be friends. 
 - Are you nuts?

134
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,633
So I can stay away from your fourth girlfriend.

135
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:46,500
Stop it!

136
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,000
What's wrong with you?

137
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,067
Nothing.

138
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:20,333
What is it then?

139
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:24,033
I don't like that jerk.

140
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:31,233
Pilhyeon seems all right. He's kind of cute.

141
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:34,300
Cute? Look who's talking.

142
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,567
Don't you remember you got caught in my armlock?

143
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:41,267
- If we fight, I might beat you. 
 - You think?

144
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,133
Then you don't need me for your bodyguard.

145
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't say that, even as a joke.

146
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:03,967
Okay. Sorry.

147
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,700
How about a match today?

148
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,467
Fine.

149
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:27,467
Aren't you coming?

150
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:49,200
<i>Stop it. Don't get into trouble again.</i>

151
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:53,967
<i>What's wrong? I'm just joking around.</i>

152
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:58,200
<i>Sorry.</i>

153
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:31,733
Wow, what a body you have.

154
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:41,433
We hang out together, eating the same food.

155
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:44,100
How is that possible?

156
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,900
It's not the first time you've seen me shirtless. What's up?

157
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,033
Who's that?

158
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:01,700
- No idea. 
 - Take a look.

159
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,533
No, thanks.

160
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,100
<i>Are you Kang Guk?</i>

161
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:09,667
<i>Why did you give me the wrong number?</i>

162
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,767
What's that?

163
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,500
Did you give her my number?

164
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,767
- Why not? It's fun. 
 - No fun for me.

165
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,000
Go and try anything you want. Or you'll resent me later.

166
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,267
Try everything.

167
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:42,467
<i>Here's Guk's number. 010-892-3777. He gave you the wrong one.</i>

168
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:43,600
<i>You can thank me later.</i>

169
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,333
Is it your dream guy?

170
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:50,700
No, a weirdo.

171
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:57,500
His name's Kang Guk. Even his name's hot.

172
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:02,533
I think you should give up.

173
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:04,400
Why?

174
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,533
I don't think you should butt into their relationship.

175
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,933
What do you mean?

176
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:16,367
When you reach my age, you can see everything.

177
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:21,533
The two had great chemistry.

178
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:28,533
I don't think so.

179
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:35,600
- No going easy, okay? 
 - I won't.

180
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:51,733
- Did you reply? 
 - Not going to.

181
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,633
Do it. It's an order.

182
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,967
You can't. This is the only place I can get smart with you.

183
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:11,167
Sounds like you can't do that everywhere else.

184
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,167
Sure. That's the way it is, you and I.

185
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:22,233
Shall I kill you?

186
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,467
Admit it. That's our relationship. We can't help it.

187
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:29,533
I'll touch your ear.

188
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:37,570
What's up?

189
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,230
You know I have to do that to calm down.

190
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,233
Even so, no.

191
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,400
By the way, you should stop pumping your chest.

192
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,200
They are almost as big as...

193
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,200
Hey, are you all right?

194
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,433
-<i> Sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.</i> 
 - I knew it.

195
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:19,767
He didn't do it on purpose.

196
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:22,000
Did he contact you?

197
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,067
- He didn't do it on purpose. 
 - A hunky son-in-law would be nice.

198
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,700
I don't mind either of two.

199
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,700
It would be nice if things go well between the two.

200
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,767
What's wrong with you, Mom?

201
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:41,000
I haven't felt this romantic for a while.

202
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,270
If you get stuck between best friends,

203
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,160
it's bound to be awkward and tiring.

204
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,800
Argh! It's awkward!

205
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,633
I said I'm sorry.

206
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:01,133
All right. You won, okay?

207
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:04,933
I can't study or eat now.

208
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:13,967
Cook something nice for me tomorrow.

209
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,333
Okay.

210
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:19,867
Oh.

211
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:24,000
How am I going to take a shower?

212
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:28,700
Just make sure to keep your cast dry in the shower.

213
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,000
How can I wash my hair with one hand?

214
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,100
Left hand to boot?

215
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,467
You can.

216
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:40,200
But you can do it for me.

217
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,533
- No. I really don't want to. 
 - Why not?

218
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:47,767
I want to wash thoroughly. I hate to feel half washed.

219
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:51,200
I'm your bodyguard, not a butler.

220
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:56,400
What kind of bodyguard are you? You broke my arm.

221
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,280
<i>Damn! It's uncomfortable.</i>

222
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,860
<i>Just taking off my jacket is hard.</i>

223
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,367
<i>How am I going to manage?</i>

224
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:08,433
<i>I hate you, Kang Guk. Honestly, I do.</i>

225
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:20,367
<i>I know this is forward but what's your plan for this Saturday?</i>

226
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:32,933
<i>Nothing. Let's hang out.</i>

227
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:57,667
This is why I asked you to help me wash.

228
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,833
I'm cold.

229
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,600
It tickles.

230
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,300
Put up with it.

231
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:27,533
This reminds me of my mom.

232
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,467
Mom used to do this, too.

233
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,633
Why don't you take a shower?

234
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:47,600
It's your turn.

235
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,500
I'll do it later.

236
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:01,567
I told you it tickles.

237
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,433
You should take a shower.

238
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:08,467
I said later.

239
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:10,167
Hey!

240
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:12,733
It's cold.

241
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,167
- Then take a shower now. 
 - I'll do it later.

242
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:22,533
Did you reply to her?

243
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:25,833
I'll see her this Saturday.

244
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:28,367
I'll go out while you are being tutored.

245
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,760
Did you plan it all by yourself and just notify me?

246
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,300
You seem a different person.

247
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,733
You pushed me to go out.

248
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,833
Be gentle.

249
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:48,133
You should treat my glossy hair with great care.

250
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,567
That's it.

251
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,767
You're good at making this kind of stuff.

252
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:05,067
You shouldn't neglect me even if you go out with someone.

253
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:09,367
That'll be nice.

254
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:11,033
What?

255
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,100
What did you just say?

256
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:20,733
Nice.

257
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:33,267
Have you ever dated before?

258
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,633
I know you haven't.

259
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:41,433
Oh, Kang Guk. You'll be all gruff and unsociable.

260
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:43,533
You won't be a good date.

261
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:46,767
I'll teach you a thing or two tomorrow.

262
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:49,833
How's that? Are you grateful?

263
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:52,833
- No, I'm not. 
 - Yes, you are.

264
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:55,067
Be careful with your hand.

265
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:57,200
Oh.

266
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:14,633
How could you go out with my friend?

267
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:17,467
Your friend?

268
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:20,067
You gave her the same present.

269
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,633
You asshole.

270
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,133
Let's eat.

271
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,233
Hi, Guk.

272
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:20,600
What are you doing?

273
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,967
You have good manners. And you are handsome.

274
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:32,033
That one, please.

275
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:45,733
You are a good cook, too. Just my type.

276
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:48,100
Guk is my type.

277
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,500
What?

278
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:55,633
Why are you looking at me like that?

279
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:59,600
Is something on my face?

280
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,833
Come on, let's eat.

281
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:17,000
Everything's fine, except that you're bad at talking.

282
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,700
Don't just stare at me. Ask a question. Start a conversation.

283
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:24,667
I'll manage.

284
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,567
We have no time to lose.

285
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,567
You need a special training session.

286
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:38,000
Wow!  What a cool place.

287
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,100
You like to make things with your hands.

288
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,833
You could look cool if you talked about art and all.

289
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:51,133
- I'm not going to. 
 - Try it. I think it'll work.

290
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:54,333
That cool girl, Mingyeong went to get you?

291
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,933
Give it a rest.

292
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:59,767
We need to teach Guk how to date.

293
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:03,233
Hyeonjeong and Mingyeong were friends.

294
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,267
- You should go now. 
 - Why?

295
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:12,833
- If you're not going to be helpful, go. 
 - All right.

296
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:16,367
Who are you meeting? We have to know the person.

297
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:23,333
- Don't tell me that you... 
 - No, not your fourth.

298
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,667
She's a new student.

299
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:27,900
My heart almost stopped, damn it!

300
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,233
- You should stop. 
 - Stop what?

301
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:33,433
You've never been kissed, right?

302
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,900
Did you see me kiss Mingyeong yesterday?

303
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,900
What? You said she came over to argue with you!

304
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,900
Why kiss? It doesn't make any sense.

305
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:50,400
Don't you know an angry kiss?

306
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,600
Angry kiss? What's an angry kiss?

307
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,233
I know Angry Birds. Is it to do with birds?

308
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:01,867
I see you've got a lot to learn.

309
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:05,567
Am I the only one who doesn't get it? What does that mean?

310
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:08,300
- Pilhyeon. 
 - Hi.

311
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:14,300
- You shouldn't bring them here. 
 - They are fine.

312
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,633
Let's talk again later, okay?

313
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:20,467
Let's go.

314
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,500
Why do you trust him?

315
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:28,900
Because it's dull to be just the two of us?

316
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:48,300
How's this? Romantic?

317
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:51,440
This is what a date is like.

318
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,600
Just one act when least expected.

319
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,733
The same goes for touching.

320
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:01,700
I'm not sure if you can pull it off.

321
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:13,400
Can I do it like this?

322
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:17,467
Oh, Kang Guk.

323
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:20,100
Is it romantic?

324
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:24,033
You are angry, aren't you?

325
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,300
Stop doing things like this.

326
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,000
Don't provoke me!

327
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,500
Please, I'm begging you.

328
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:42,400
You don't like it either.

329
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,700
Just go.

330
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,167
Will you be all right?

331
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:47,333
Don't fuss. I won't get stabbed.

332
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,533
Call me if you need me.

333
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,533
Whatever.

334
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:13,833
God, I couldn't stand it.

335
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:16,500
Is it okay to take off your cast?

336
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,900
It's been a fake all along.

337
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:22,933
Let's move on to the next question.

338
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:27,167
In this part, it's important to read the question first,

339
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:30,233
understand the keywords, then read the passages.

340
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:34,767
<i>Here you can see the options of A, B, C, D.</i>

341
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:39,433
He's really leaving.

342
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:43,367
Taeju?

343
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,567
Taeju.

344
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:52,000
Excuse me, Miss.

345
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,633
I'm hungry.

346
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,533
They say I should start an eating show.

347
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:19,667
You do look like you're enjoying the food.

348
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,767
Will you watch it if I do it?

349
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:27,833
Sure. It's nice to watch someone enjoy food.

350
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,200
Have some more of this.

351
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:40,767
I'm not sure about this yet.

352
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,167
But I'd like to get close to you.

353
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:52,267
I even had a dream last night.

354
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:56,267
I had a meal with you and watched a film together

355
00:33:56,267 --> 00:34:00,833
and got married and already had two kids...

356
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,733
Huh?

357
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:04,800
Just kidding.

358
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:07,667
Please come in.

359
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,267
Oh?

360
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,567
Did you call him to come?

361
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:19,167
No.

362
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:25,133
Do you like Taeju?

363
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:28,367
Huh? What?

364
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:31,033
Or does he have a crush on you?

365
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:35,770
It's not like that.

366
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:38,500
- I'm a sort of a bodyguard.
 - Huh?

367
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,033
I'm living in Taeju's house and earning living expenses.

368
00:34:43,033 --> 00:34:46,267
It's a master-servant relationship, to be precise.

369
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,033
Is that a good thing?

370
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,800
It's okay.

371
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,433
Hey, what's up?

372
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:01,667
- What is it? 
 <i>- Want some pasta?</i>

373
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:07,333
I'm not Kang Guk.

374
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:11,233
<i>I know. You are Pilhyeon.</i>

375
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:13,533
What the hell. Hey!

376
00:35:13,533 --> 00:35:16,833
Do you expect me to come to you whenever you call?

377
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:20,233
There's no need to be so grumpy.

378
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:22,167
<i>I'm busy!</i>

379
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:27,967
Tada! Look, the shrimp are gone.

380
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:31,300
They are.

381
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,667
He hung up on me.

382
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,767
Since I spoiled him, that jerk thinks he's above me. What a bastard!

383
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:49,460
Why do you hang out with him?

384
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,030
You want to ditch us to switch sides?

385
00:35:52,033 --> 00:35:53,833
I have a reason.

386
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,533
What is it?

387
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,833
What? Tell us the reason.

388
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:02,800
- They tipped you about this place. 
 - Damn it.

389
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,300
What is it?

390
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,800
He's good looking.

391
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:12,467
What about us?

392
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:15,767
We're damn good-looking, too.

393
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:18,433
When height counts, yes.

394
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:27,300
Here's the pasta you ordered. Enjoy your meal.

395
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:36,233
My heart hurts.

396
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:39,467
What? Suddenly?

397
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:42,567
Are you all right?

398
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:46,200
I have a weakness for a guy with a secret backstory.

399
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:49,567
I feel like I just got punched.

400
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:58,167
I want to like you.

401
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,133
Thank you for asking for my number.

402
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,100
What kind of line is that?

403
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,600
And you two are not suited for each other.

404
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,667
- Both of you are so weird. 
 - Listen, Taeju.

405
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,850
I haven't finished talking to Guk.

406
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,560
Can I talk to you later?

407
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:35,667
I'll come back after I see Hyemi off.

408
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,233
- Sorry about this awkward situation. 
 - I'm fine.

409
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:52,367
On the contrary, it gets less boring. It's a plus.

410
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:54,567
That's good.

411
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:05,767
What happened to your cast?

412
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:11,233
- I was fibbing. 
 - Hey!

413
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,967
Why isn't it coming?

414
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:26,667
You walk home. I'm not feeling well.

415
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:35,600
My bodyguard is not supposed to catch a cold.

416

Get in.

00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:54,900
Why did I do that to you?

435
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:00,400
Because you're mean.

436
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:07,767
It was different. A different type of anger.

Taeju,

442
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:01,667
I begged you not to.

443
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:15,867

446
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:49,167
Better than studying.

447
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:52,333

It's dodgeball today. Your class against mine.

451
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:03,267
So? Don't you have any friends?

452
00:44:03,267 --> 00:44:05,733
Why make a fuss, coming over here?

453
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:09,367
I don't have any friends.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

 - I've no friends. Sorry.

- Annoying. 
 - Stop it.

460
00:44:58,267 --> 00:45:01,233
- I'm competitive. Let's win the game. 
 - Sure we should.

461
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:04,633
- What's sure about it? It's nothing. 
 - Then stay out of this.

You can guard me, so I don't get hit.

Why am I so angry then?

484
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,433
- Do you want to do it here? 
 - Do what?

485
00:48:35,467 --> 00:48:38,900
Tell me. Do what?

486
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:42,933
You want a match, don't you?

487
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,900
Not here. Let's do it in the gym at night.

00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:57,033
What is?

491
00:48:59,733 --> 00:49:04,600
I guess you feel the same as me.

494
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,333

 - I'm Kim Pilhyeon.

499

And I don't normally go to class.

500
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:18,533
You are the one, aren't you? Guk's date?

501
00:50:18,533 --> 00:50:22,433
Damn it. Don't go there. They're fighting.

502
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:25,800
- Are they? 
 - Anyway, just leave.

Don't go there. They're fighting.

514
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:58,967

518
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,433
Aren't you wearing your pants backward?

519
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:49,067
No, I'm not wearing them backward.

520
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:51,033

521
00:51:58,467 --> 00:52:00,533

523

- Mom. 
 - Yes?

 - Sure. It happens a lot.

529
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,767
- I felt that, too. 
 - Why?

530
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:41,333
Guk and Taeju got jealous?

531
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:44,000

00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,133
Want a match?

00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Shall I kill you?

536
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:23,700
I shouldn't have done that earlier on.

537
00:54:25,633 --> 00:54:27,900
Why did you do that?

538
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:36,133
Don't provoke me. Please, I'm begging you.

539
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,567
Han Taeju.

540
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,933
I begged you not to.

541
00:54:42,933 --> 00:54:45,867
- What do you mean? 
 - We need to talk.

542
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:47,767
Why did you say that?

543
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,000
You said we'd always settle things if we're to stay together for life.

544
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,333
If we talk, we can't stay together.

545
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,367
When I see you with Hyemi,

546
00:55:01,367 --> 00:55:03,533
I get really angry.

547
00:55:05,367 --> 00:55:08,167
I thought I got jealous as a friend.

548
00:55:13,533 --> 00:55:15,767
But I love you.

549
00:55:23,567 --> 00:55:26,633
I want to be with you all day.

550
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:29,967
I want to hold you when I'm with you.

551
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:33,733
I want to whine when I don't see you.

552
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,333
Give it a rest, will you?

553
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:44,433
I had enough with your tantrums.

554
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:50,333
You're only doing this because you think of me as your mom.

555
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:54,433
Don't get confused. It's annoying. Enough is enough.

556
00:55:58,667 --> 00:56:02,100
Do you think I'm a brat who can't tell them apart?

557
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,833
You're deliberately being cruel to me.

558
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,333
- You're so self-centered. 
 - I am.

559
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,567
That's me. I'm spoiled.

560
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,933
What about your feelings, smart boy?

561
00:56:20,433 --> 00:56:22,200
Tell me.

562
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,033
If I leave, who'd lose?

563
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:31,133
You think I'll lose because you've been paying me.

564
00:56:31,133 --> 00:56:32,933
But...

565
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:35,933
that's not true.

566
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:40,333
I can live without you.

567
00:56:41,433 --> 00:56:43,400
But you can't.

568
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:52,333
- I'm not asking that. 
 - Just listen. You should know this.

569
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,067
For the last fiftenn years,

570
00:56:56,067 --> 00:56:59,300
I felt the most free and happy

571
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,567
during that one week when you went to Japan.

572
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:24,800
Go and tell my dad right now.

573
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:31,267
Tell him that you had a hard time to cover the ass of the brat.

574
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,800
That he should give you money before you blow Han Taeju's secrets.

575
00:57:38,933 --> 00:57:40,967
Do tell him.

576
00:57:41,867 --> 00:57:43,600
Got it?

577
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,067
Okay.

578
00:57:52,767 --> 00:57:58,200
You are smarter than me. You must be right this time, too.

579
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:11,000
I'll give you a month.

580
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,100
Get lost before it ends.

581
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,933
<i>[Choi Hyemi]</i>

582
00:58:34,233 --> 00:58:35,933
Where's Taeju?

583
00:58:36,533 --> 00:58:38,067
He's at home.

584
00:58:38,067 --> 00:58:42,167
- Sorry, I left without a word. 
 - It's okay.

585
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:52,200
Tada. What do you think? This is a guardian angel.

586
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,967
- A guardian angel? 
 - I made it myself. Cute, huh?

587
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:00,567
- It is cute. 
 - Take it.

588
00:59:03,533 --> 00:59:06,300
There's no one to protect you.

589
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:10,033
I hope you have a less hard time.

590
00:59:11,967 --> 00:59:13,867
- Hyemi. 
 - Yeah?

591
00:59:13,867 --> 00:59:16,467
It's not hard for me.

592
00:59:16,467 --> 00:59:19,833
It's not hard to protect Taeju at all.

593
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:21,667
And...

594
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:24,567
I am sorry.

595
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:27,967
As you said, I like Tae...

596
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,033
- Mom was right. 
 - Huh?

597
00:59:33,033 --> 00:59:37,767
I didn't want to admit it but I guessed it from the beginning.

598
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:43,733
Your eyes... Though they were looking at me,

599
00:59:43,733 --> 00:59:46,700
it seemed that they were looking elsewhere.

Hey. Stop joking.

606
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,800
Taeju!

607
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:52,567
Han Taeju!

608
01:00:54,367 --> 01:00:56,300
Han Taeju!

<i>...will be relayed to the voicemail.</i>

610
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,900
Sir,

611
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:25,333
I think Taeju was kidnapped.

612
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,367
I checked his location on the GPS but his phone's off.

613
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:34,967
I'm sorry. I'm heading to his last location.

614
01:01:38,133 --> 01:01:42,233
Pilhyeon, did Taeju contact you?

615
01:01:42,233 --> 01:01:46,000
<i>No. Did something happen?</i>

616
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:29,333
<i>Come and see me.</i>

617
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:31,067
I'm busy at the mo...

618
01:02:31,067 --> 01:02:33,200
<i>It's about Taeju.</i>

619
01:02:44,733 --> 01:02:46,733
Hi, Guk.

620
01:02:46,733 --> 01:02:48,567
What is it?

621
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,700
I'm not quite sure.

622
01:02:56,533 --> 01:02:58,400
Tell me now.

623
01:02:59,367 --> 01:03:01,267
I had no idea they'd do this.

624
01:03:01,267 --> 01:03:04,867
Speak now or I'll kill you.

625
01:03:04,867 --> 01:03:07,033
I told them.

626
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,767
That I saw you guys kiss in the school backyard.

627
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,900
The chairman asked my dad

628
01:03:16,933 --> 01:03:20,067
that I should watch you two.

629
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:26,067
It's embarrassing, but I had to. Otherwise, my dad would've gotten fired.

630
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,000
I'm sorry.

631
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,400
That's good.

632
01:03:35,867 --> 01:03:37,333
What?

633
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,633
It means the chairman took him.

634
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,733
So it's a relief.

635
01:03:45,633 --> 01:03:47,933
I heard Taeju is going to England.

636
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:57,533
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

637
01:03:58,233 --> 01:04:00,767
Don't tell them I told you.

638
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:03,400
I'll get into trouble.

639
01:04:15,733 --> 01:04:18,367
Ouch, it hurts like mad.

640
01:04:20,667 --> 01:04:22,900
You are a piece of shit.

641
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,667
Kim Pilhyeon, you are shit.

642
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I shouldn't have let you two live together.

643
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,650
Don't hurt Kang Guk, please.

644
01:05:06,233 --> 01:05:08,500
I'm the one to blame.

645
01:05:09,433 --> 01:05:11,167
Only you?

646
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,967
I had a crush on him.

647
01:05:17,067 --> 01:05:19,180
I should never

648
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:23,330
have brought up a son like you.

649
01:05:25,267 --> 01:05:27,100
You are right.

650
01:05:27,733 --> 01:05:30,400
I failed you yet again.

651
01:05:33,667 --> 01:05:36,700
You are so weak. Just like your mother.

652
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,267
Don't insult Mom.

653
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,233
Kang Guk's arrived.

654
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,167
Let him in.

655
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:06,433
You were useful as a bodyguard.

656
01:08:07,133 --> 01:08:11,067
- I'm sorry. 
 - Why did you have to come here?

657
01:08:11,067 --> 01:08:13,300
Explain.

658
01:08:14,567 --> 01:08:17,267
I know I can't win this fight.

659
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:21,200
I have nothing whereas...

660
01:08:21,767 --> 01:08:24,300
you have the power to do everything, Sir.

661
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:27,000
You can say that.

662
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:33,470
Still, you blew your future

663
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:37,130
with one mistake.

664
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,667
I came here to talk to him for five minutes.

665
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,733
We've been together for fifteen years.

666
01:08:48,433 --> 01:08:51,067
We need at least five minutes.

667
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:04,467
I told you before. If you make trouble, I'll beat up Guk.

668
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:13,167
I'll go.

669
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:16,433
I'll go to England.

670
01:09:18,833 --> 01:09:20,533
And?

671
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,100
There,

672
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,600
with no one around,

673
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:33,000
I'll study on my own and go to college.

674
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,333
I'll do everything.

675
01:09:37,133 --> 01:09:42,033
- How can I trust you? 
 - I'll leave tomorrow.

676
01:09:43,467 --> 01:09:45,933
I'll do just fine.

677
01:09:46,733 --> 01:09:49,200
Please give me a chance.

678
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:54,167
I'll show you.

679
01:09:56,633 --> 01:10:01,967
Book his ticket for tomorrow and proceed as planned.

680
01:10:01,967 --> 01:10:03,667
Just one thing.

681
01:10:08,567 --> 01:10:10,533
Let me...

682
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,967
go to my place...

683
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:23,867
tonight.

684
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:45,300
I set you free. Why did you come here?

685
01:10:47,467 --> 01:10:49,467
Don't you know?

686
01:10:53,433 --> 01:10:56,167
I don't want to go to England.

687
01:10:58,067 --> 01:10:59,667
I'm sorry.

688
01:11:00,467 --> 01:11:04,700
That stupid jerk, Kim Pilhyeon! I'll kill him.

689
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:13,167
Time flies. It's already morning.

690
01:11:41,133 --> 01:11:43,867
I don't know since when,

691
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:47,267
but I always wanted to hold you.

692
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:52,133
I love you.

693
01:12:02,733 --> 01:12:06,867
You declare your love to a person who's leaving in a few hours?

694
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,533
To England.

695
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,033
Bye, Taeju.

696
01:12:24,567 --> 01:12:29,067
Oh, you should've accepted my kiss when I tried to kiss you.

697
01:12:30,367 --> 01:12:32,867
We haven't even kissed yet.

698
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:37,267
Hey.

699
01:12:37,267 --> 01:12:39,540
I'm not a pervert.

700
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:42,600
I don't want to kiss your bleeding lips.

701
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,900
Can we meet again?

702
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:55,167
Keep trying to find good tteokbokki places for me.

703
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,100
I'll come back.

704
01:13:00,733 --> 01:13:02,700
No, you shouldn't.

705
01:13:04,567 --> 01:13:07,833
Our lives will take different ways.

706
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:10,867
- You'll have a good life there. 
 - My dream is...

707
01:13:11,467 --> 01:13:14,300
just to have fun.

708
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:22,900
And I have the most fun when I'm with you.

709
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,300
So I will return.

710
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:41,600
- He's really hot. 
 - What if it's full again today?

711
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,067
- He smiles with his eyes. 
 - With his eyes?

712
01:15:44,067 --> 01:15:47,067
Hang on, let me put on lipstick.

713
01:15:53,367 --> 01:15:54,800
How do I look?

714
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,633
- Pretty. 
 - You, too.

715
01:15:56,633 --> 01:15:58,733
Come on.

716
01:15:58,733 --> 01:16:01,300
Oh my god!

717
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,533
- Hyemi, food is ready. 
 - Okay.

718
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:17,267
Here's your tteokbokki.

719
01:16:21,067 --> 01:16:23,867
Hey, here are your customers.

720
01:16:26,367 --> 01:16:28,267
Good afternoon.

721
01:16:30,433 --> 01:16:34,867
- I love you. 
 - I love you, too.

722
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:44,633
I didn't want my tteokbokki place to become so popular.

723
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:47,300
Don't talk nonsense.

724
01:16:49,633 --> 01:16:53,967
Are you really leaving, Guk?

725
01:16:54,867 --> 01:16:57,367
Yes, I am.

726
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:12,967
Why Japan, though?

727
01:17:12,967 --> 01:17:16,667
I always wanted to go there.

728
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:18,767
When are you coming back?

729
01:17:20,033 --> 01:17:22,967
When I don't feel anything anymore?

730
01:17:27,533 --> 01:17:31,940
Oh, my handsome Guk.

731
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,860
How can I manage without you?

732
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:39,100
Oh dear, all I have is her.

733
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:42,333
Mom, stop it.

734
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:53,767
Here, take it. It's your part-time pay.

735
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,900
Thank you.

736
01:18:03,567 --> 01:18:07,633
- Hyem. 
 - Oh, bother.

737
01:18:09,467 --> 01:18:12,600
I was really looking forward to today.

738
01:18:14,733 --> 01:18:16,933
I was nervous since you were around Hyemi.

739
01:18:16,933 --> 01:18:22,300
Guk's much better looking than Pilhyeon.

740
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:23,933
And he's more mature.

741
01:18:23,933 --> 01:18:25,700
Excuse me?

742
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:28,400
No present for me?

743
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:33,900
I ordered one but it hasn't arrived yet. Sorry.

744
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,367
How's college?

745
01:18:35,367 --> 01:18:39,233
I don't know. I learn all sorts of weird stuff.

746
01:18:41,033 --> 01:18:43,467
Maybe I should study abroad.

747
01:18:43,467 --> 01:18:45,333
Don't be stupid.

748
01:18:52,133 --> 01:18:57,200
Take care, damn it. Keep in touch, okay?

749
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,567
Ohisashiburidesu. (Japanese)

750
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:01,140
It means, long time no see.

751
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:03,800
Like you haven't met him in a while.

752
01:19:07,867 --> 01:19:11,800
Guk, bye.

753
01:19:19,733 --> 01:19:22,067
Oh, my Guk.

754
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:26,490
He's so fragile.

755
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:29,600
How can he live alone?

756
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,633
He's far from fragile, Ma'am.

757
01:19:35,467 --> 01:19:38,433
I said not to go, damn it.

758
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,467
Did you contact Taeju?

759
01:19:42,467 --> 01:19:43,967
Yeah.

760
01:19:43,967 --> 01:19:46,467
What did he say? Nothing?

761
01:19:46,467 --> 01:19:51,767
I told him Guk is moving to Japan for good but he said nothing.

762
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,800
It's about time he should come.

763
01:20:10,567 --> 01:20:13,967
Hello, I'm here for an interview.

764
01:20:18,767 --> 01:20:22,033
Oh, no. Not another handsome guy.

How sad of you to come here?

771
01:21:44,167 --> 01:21:48,033
Well, you got hotter.

Hey.

773
01:21:57,267 --> 01:21:59,400
Are you going to Japan?

774
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:04,570
I told you to find good restaurants for me.

775
01:22:04,570 --> 01:22:06,730
Why are you running away?

776
01:22:09,033 --> 01:22:11,300
You are late.

777
01:22:16,967 --> 01:22:19,800
You should run away with me.

778
01:22:20,567 --> 01:22:22,933
That was our wish.
