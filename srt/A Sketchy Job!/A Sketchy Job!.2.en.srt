1
00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:05,750
Boss

2
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,250
Don't you think

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,666
We should decorate this place a bit

4
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,958
Leave some traces that couples should have

5
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,416
Traces that couples should have

6
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,416
What specifically?

7
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,916
Well, for example

8
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:27,833
Couple photos

9
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:31,708
Sure

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,750
Let's take them now

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,500
So nervous

12
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,125
How can I be your little wifey like this

13
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,500
Can't you show some confidence

14
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,125
Mm

15
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:05,500
That's more like it

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,916
Your photo-taking skills are so straight guy

17
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,500
Let me see

18
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,166
Just now

19
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,958
When I was against your chest

20
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,500
I heard your heart beating so fast

21
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,041
Have you never hugged a man before?

22
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,708
Strictly speaking, not a woman either

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,125
So according to that

24
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:55,166
I'm actually your first love

25
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,375
You... you could say that

26
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,541
Then you need to practice more

27
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,500
Maybe in the future

28
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,791
It'll come in handy when dating

29
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,083
We'll see about that

30
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,958
How is it?

31
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,250
Things couples should do

32
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:48,791
What's next?

33
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,250
Next

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,833
Sharing a meal

35
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,541
These are all made according to your menu

36
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,875
All your favorites

37
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,583
Your cooking is quite good

38
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,083
Looks pretty decent

39
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,541
Try it

40
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:48,000
Is it terrible or just not to your taste?

41
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,458
No

42
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,666
It's just

43
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,208
It tastes like home

44
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,541
Like home

45
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,333
You

46
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,791
Haven't been home in a long time, have you?

47
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,041
Speaking of which

48
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,375
Between us two

49
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,291
How do we distinguish

50
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,000
Who's the top

51
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,375
Who's the bottom

52
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
I think

53
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,791
That should be obvious at a glance

54
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:23,625
I can't dance

55
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,500
I'll teach you

56
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,250
You'll have to teach me dancing from now on

57
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,208
Okay

58
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,333
So this is the next part

59
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:42,791
Yes

60
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,833
A couple must watch a romantic movie together

61
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,500
Alright

62
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:49,958
Let's start

63
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,000
Why are you sitting so far from me?

64
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,500
Not used to being too close

65
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,375
Hey

66
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,666
You're a professional actor

67
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,625
Too far away

68
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,750
We don't look like a couple at all

69
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,583
Okay okay come come come hug hug hug

70
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,458
(Movie dialogue) I'm still too shy

71
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,833
(Movie dialogue) This letter, I cannot send

72
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,625
This story

73
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,583
Is too sad

74
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,333
It's all fictional

75
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't get so invested

76
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,875
I'm actually envious

77
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,916
That they can have

78
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,750
Such an unforgettable love

79
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,000
Mm

80
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,208
Everyone has their own destiny

81
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,666
You'll meet your own love eventually

82
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,500
Will I?

83
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,125
You will

84
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,375
Definitely
