1
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:20,791
She's gone

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,375
Perfect, some peace and quiet

3
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:38,708
I'm sorry

4
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,958
I can't do this job anymore

5
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,208
Are you playing with me?

6
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,666
These past few days I've been conflicted

7
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,458
I think

8
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,458
This matter is much more serious than I imagined

9
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,833
And it's getting out of control

10
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,458
What do you mean by out of control?

11
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:19,708
What are you referring to?

12
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,125
Don't you know

13
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,250
I really like you

14
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:42,458
I'm sorry

15
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,583
I can't keep acting

16
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,083
Go back with Qinghuan

17
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,625
Can't keep acting

18
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,375
What?

19
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,291
I'm sorry

20
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,166
Lu Xiao has told me about you two

21
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,958
Pack up these few days and let's go back together

22
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,208
I won't go back

23
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,541
He's already left

24
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,541
Why are you still staying here?

25
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,500
He hasn't left

26
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,666
He was just deceived by your hypocrisy

27
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,583
Zairong, you're not a child anymore

28
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,875
This is life or death

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,666
Stop being willful, okay?

30
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,250
Are you threatening me?

31
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:04,916
Zairong

32
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,208
All these years

33
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,333
Don't you know how much I love you?

34
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,125
Why do you say such things to hurt me?

35
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry

36
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,458
I shouldn't have said that

37
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,416
But

38
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,708
I don't want to lie to you

39
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,000
I think

40
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,750
I've really fallen for him

41
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,125
Has it reached that point?

42
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,500
Even risking your life to be together?

43
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,708
To what extent

44
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,208
I don't know

45
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,208
But I'm clear in my heart

46
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,625
I want to stay in Japan

47
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,333
Not because I don't want to be arranged by my family

48
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,166
Not rebellion

49
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,750
And certainly not escape

50
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,041
But because I genuinely

51
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,375
Want to be with him

52
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,500
Even if it means risking your life?

53
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,291
Even if it means dying here with him

54
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:23,833
Fine

55
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,708
This is the path you've chosen

56
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,500
I hope you two can keep going well together

57
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,000
You're back

58
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,916
Zairong

59
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,833
Qinghuan told me you...

60
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,791
Come

61
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,416
Come in

62
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:57,666
Zairong

63
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,625
I'm still worried

64
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,625
It'll be dangerous if you don't go back

65
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,250
Don't worry about that

66
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,041
From now on

67
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,000
Whether in life or death

68
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,166
I never want to be apart from you
