1
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:17,166
Ah

2
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:23,791
Watching the sea together

3
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,250
Is this also something couples must do?

4
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:29,916
The movie says

5
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,000
When two people are together

6
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,500
It's about doing trivial things

7
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,958
It doesn't matter what you do

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,958
What matters is who's by your side

9
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:49,416
But

10
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,750
This is too ordinary

11
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,500
Give me your hand

12
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:20,958
You're quite good at this

13
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,083
Boss

14
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,791
I am a professional actor after all

15
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:09,916
Zairong

16
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,666
Qinghuan, you're here

17
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:12,333
Huh?

18
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,083
Zairong, who's this?

19
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,291
Yes, who is this?

20
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,375
Let me introduce

21
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,041
This is my boyfriend, Lu Xiao

22
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,500
This is my childhood friend

23
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,041
Gu Qinghuan

24
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,875
Hello, I'm Gu Qinghuan

25
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:39,541
Oh

26
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,708
Hello, come, please come in

27
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:03,125
Here, please have some tea

28
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,541
Thank you

29
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,541
Qinghuan's family and mine are old family friends

30
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:17,791
We've been good friends since we were little

31
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,541
What's this about?

32
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,541
Are we just good friends?

33
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,125
What brings you to Japan?

34
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,083
Where are you planning to visit?

35
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,791
You know exactly why

36
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,583
Didn't grandfather tell you?

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,583
My grandfather didn't tell me anything

38
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,291
Fine, just consider me here for vacation

39
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,916
You've been alone in Japan for so long

40
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,958
Someone needs to take care of you

41
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,666
No need

42
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,083
Having him is enough

43
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,791
Let me be honest with you

44
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,125
Lu Xiao and I are dating

45
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,166
And

46
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,166
We plan to keep dating

47
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,500
Um, I'll go unpack first

48
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,833
How was that?

49
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,583
Just put it there, I'll handle it myself

50
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,208
Thank you for taking care of him during this time

51
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,250
How long have you two known each other?

52
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,666
Ah, not very long

53
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,958
We've known each other for over ten years

54
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,916
Ah, so

55
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,041
You're his fiancée?

56
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,708
You're quite smart

57
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,750
Ah, I could tell from your attitude

58
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,416
But what you don't know is

59
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,083
His grandfather is in poor health

60
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,208
He's been hoping we'll get married soon

61
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,750
Old people, you know

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,500
Want to see great-grandchildren soon

63
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,875
His grandfather and father are both very domineering

64
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,750
In families like ours

65
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:50,083
Children's marriages are always decided by the parents

66
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,000
So

67
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,541
He can be rebellious sometimes

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,791
Likes a bit of novelty

69
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,958
By the way, for our wedding

70
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,083
His grandfather has already booked the hotel

71
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,708
When the time comes, he'll have to go back whether he wants to or not

72
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,291
"Have to go back whether he wants to or not"

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,500
She really said that to you?

74
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,083
Mm

75
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,208
This matter, I'm afraid you can't avoid it

76
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,541
There's still time

77
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,833
I'll figure something out

78
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,916
You just need to play your part well, okay?

79
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,416
Then I'll go back

80
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,000
Go back where?

81
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,333
Home

82
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,666
She took the room, where else would I sleep?

83
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,125
You'll sleep in the same room with me, of course

84
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,416
Sleep with you? You're joking, right?

85
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:00,833
I can't fall asleep

86
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,708
What joke?

87
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,000
You're playing my boyfriend

88
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,375
If you don't sleep with me, won't we be exposed?

89
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,166
No way, I'm going home

90
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,500
Are you crazy?

91
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,833
If you go home now, all our acting was for nothing

92
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,583
Same room doesn't mean same bed

93
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,583
Can you be professional?

94
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,875
No way, I can't sleep

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,500
Why are you being so difficult?

96
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,541
Am I being difficult? Is that what you think?

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,833
More money

98
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,750
I'll pay you more

99
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,250
How much more?

100
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,958
Enough to satisfy you

101
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:59,083
Mm, ah, so comfortable

102
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,458
Ah

103
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,708
Ah
