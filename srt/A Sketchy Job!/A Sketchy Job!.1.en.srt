1
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:06,958
Have I seen you somewhere before

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,333
Really?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,541
Maybe I look like Rain

4
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:13,583
You're quite confident

5
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:14,583
Of course

6
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:17,708
I participated in many club performances in college

7
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,250
I even went to NHK for their anniversary show

8
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,208
I also participated in...

9
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,000
So

10
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,416
You're a very experienced actor

11
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,333
Well, you could say that

12
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,041
Then do you think

13
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,333
You can handle any role

14
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,541
Of course, no problem

15
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:41,916
Then

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,625
Can you play my boyfriend

17
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,666
You're interested in that kind of thing?

18
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,166
You're overthinking

19
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:07,958
Men

20
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,750
I'm not interested either

21
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,750
Having you pretend to be my partner

22
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,916
This is also

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,750
A very difficult decision for me

24
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,708
If we fail

25
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:31,125
It means both you and I will be in danger

26
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,250
Oh I get it

27
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,208
Is it like Stephen Chow's movie "King of Comedy"

28
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,916
Or like "007"

29
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,041
I can't explain it too clearly

30
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:42,958
You can understand it that way

31
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:43,875
Anyway

32
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,791
During the contract period

33
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,625
You must follow all arrangements

34
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,208
All of your time

35
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,000
Will be at my disposal

36
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,500
Boss

37
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,625
I hope our cooperation

38
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,833
Is based on equality

39
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,041
I'll give you a price you can't refuse

40
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,708
Sounds good

41
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:10,958
Then

42
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,041
Let's discuss the details

43
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,250
This apartment has two rooms

44
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,000
You'll sleep in the guest room

45
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,458
On the tatami

46
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,291
But you can't keep your things in there

47
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,916
I get it, can't let people see

48
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,333
That we sleep separately

49
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,125
Smart

50
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,125
But too talkative

51
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,750
I don't like people who talk too much

52
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,833
Alright, as Party B of the contract

53
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,708
I'll allow you to ask two questions

54
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,625
When does the work start

55
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,791
I decide

56
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,875
When does it end

57
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,000
I decide

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,291
I...

59
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,125
Alright

60
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,083
Two questions are over

61
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,958
There's one more important requirement

62
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,625
What is it

63
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,083
That is

64
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,416
Never

65
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,625
Fall in love with me

66
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,083
You can rest assured about that

67
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,416
Boss

68
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,333
Can I ask you some questions

69
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,958
Are your questions related to our contract

70
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,458
Of course they are

71
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,333
You have two minutes

72
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,708
What's your zodiac sign and blood type

73
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,500
You're wasting two minutes

74
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,375
Just to ask such boring questions

75
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,666
Boring?

76
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm going to play your boyfriend

77
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,083
I should know something about your personality

78
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,541
Otherwise we'll be exposed when people ask

79
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,583
Your questions

80
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,375
Can be searched online

81
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,000
My name is Liu Zairong

82
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,166
I'm the heir to a well-known domestic company

83
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes, boss

84
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,708
Looking forward to your performance

85
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,666
I never eat legumes

86
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh

87
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,666
I said I never eat legumes

88
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:25,375
Mm

89
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,916
Bread is good too, have more

90
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,333
What I mean is

91
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,291
You'd better not eat them either

92
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:51,666
Boss

93
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,375
From a professional acting perspective

94
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,541
I've created our love story backstory

95
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:58,791
Want to hear it?

96
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,000
Sure

97
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,041
I work part-time at a bar

98
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,708
You're a traveler alone in a foreign land

99
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,625
You drank a lot that day

100
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,583
Left your wallet at the bar and I found it

101
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,791
I chased after you

102
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,125
That day the snowstorm

103
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,291
Was very, very heavy

104
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,083
You stood alone in the snow

105
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,750
Looking into the distance with distant eyes

106
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,500
As if the whole world had nothing to do with you

107
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,666
Such a cliché storyline

108
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,791
But I like it

109
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,541
Sounds very dreamy

110
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:47,750
Oh right

111
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,791
There's another important question

112
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:52,958
What

113
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,375
Who's the 0 and who's the 1

114
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,833
Or who's the top and who's the bottom

115
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,208
Is this question that funny?

116
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,041
Look at someone like me

117
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,958
Can I play the little wifey?

118
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,041
Why not?

119
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,166
Then

120
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,041
If I'm your little wifey

121
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,250
What would you do to me

122
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,083
For example

123
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,333
Like this

124
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,708
You really are a professional actor

125
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,541
But this matter

126
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,375
No rush to decide

127
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,708
We'll figure it out later
