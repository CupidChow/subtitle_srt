1
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:04,333
Hey

2
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:07,166
Such a big bed

3
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:11,625
Much more comfortable than the tatami

4
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,000
You talk too much

5
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:14,791
Keep it down

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:22,833
Hey

7
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,583
About your wedding

8
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,166
What are you going to do?

9
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,458
Take it one step at a time

10
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,125
Make her give up

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,458
But for something this big

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,833
It doesn't seem like she can decide either

13
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:49,583
Aren't you afraid that one day

14
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,416
Your grandfather will send people to drag you back?

15
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:56,750
Since I was little

16
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,208
I've listened to them about everything

17
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,333
But on this matter

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,625
I must make my own decision

19
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,250
Why does your grandfather

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,791
Like Qinghuan so much?

21
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,750
Qinghuan is the only child in her family

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
Marrying her

23
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,708
Means marrying hundreds of billions in assets

24
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:27,625
Hundreds of billions!

25
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,791
Shh

26
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,000
That's so much money

27
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,958
She's also the heir to a family business

28
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,208
But I don't care

29
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,000
Without money

30
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,250
I can live even better

31
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,083
But

32
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,333
Why are you being so fussy tonight?

33
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,291
Why think so much?

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,250
Qinghuan told me your grandfather's health isn't good

35
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:18,291
Hey

36
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,125
I didn't know it would involve so many people

37
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:21,625
Tsk

38
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,500
I'm tired

39
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,125
Going to sleep

40
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,500
Good night

41
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:40,916
Tsk

42
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,916
Tsk, ah

43
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,708
What the hell

44
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,208
Why are you in my bed?

45
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,666
Look for yourself

46
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,625
This is my bed

47
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,375
Then

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,500
What's going on?

49
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,416
Ask yourself

50
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:06,916
Zairong

51
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,416
Qinghuan

52
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,416
It's not convenient for the three of us to keep living like this

53
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,208
Shouldn't you go back?

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,541
Then come back with me

55
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,166
I

56
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm doing fine in Japan

57
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,750
I don't plan to go back yet

58
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,291
But your grandfather and father

59
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,791
Specifically asked me to come discuss the wedding with you

60
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,791
Do we have to get married?

61
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,125
Of course

62
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,958
If we must get married

63
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,375
Then I'll marry Lu Xiao

64
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,625
Enough! This childish game of yours

65
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,125
I've really had enough

66
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,958
Do you really think I believe you'd come out?

67
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,250
Whether you believe it or not

68
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,791
It's the truth

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,458
Fine, since you don't want to get married

70
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,666
Tell grandfather directly

71
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,500
Fine

72
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,083
I'll tell him

73
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:52,541
Hey

74
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:54,666
Don't

75
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,083
Think about it more

76
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,208
I've thought about it

77
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,500
I'm serious

78
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,541
You think this is a game?

79
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,125
Acting in some idol drama?

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,291
Do you know how many people

81
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,416
Behind the Liu family want him to disappear?

82
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,208
If it weren't for my family's support

83
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,625
He would have had an accident and been eliminated long ago

84
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:37,916
Don't

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,208
Qinghuan is right

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,166
Marriage

87
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,666
Can't be taken lightly

88
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,333
Lightly?

89
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,625
You also think I'm playing games?

90
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,541
Hey

91
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,708
You want me to leave, right?

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,708
Your acting is terrible too

93
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,625
So

94
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,958
You never believed it

95
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,750
I've known Liu Zairong since I was five

96
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,875
Since middle school

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
His favorites were Maria Ozawa and Sora Aoi

98
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,000
Do you think he would come out?

99
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,500
Matters of the heart

100
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,416
Can't be forced

101
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,750
If you really want to marry him

102
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,458
It should be based on mutual love

103
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,000
How do you know we don't love each other?

104
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,333
We were intimate when we were 17

105
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,541
These past ten years, I've only loved him

106
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,166
So you've known each other that long

107
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,375
He just doesn't like a life that's arranged for him

108
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,458
He just wants to rebel

109
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,000
All these years

110
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,041
Many girls have appeared by his side

111
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,166
But the only one who stayed

112
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,000
Is me

113
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,875
I can see

114
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,500
He has real feelings for you

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,166
But you don't understand what he needs

116
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:12,750
Lu Xiao

117
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,333
I'll give you time

118
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,708
Hope you can end this boring game soon

119
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,916
And give him back what he really needs
