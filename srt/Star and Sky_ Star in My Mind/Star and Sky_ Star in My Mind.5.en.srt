Is it so obvious that I'm nervous?

00:00:04,025 --> 00:00:06,415
Your hands are so cold.

3
00:00:07,415 --> 00:00:10,285
It will be over soon. Don't be afraid.

00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:18,285
Fah, will people think I'm buying the title?

5
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,765
Well, you are my kid.

6
00:00:19,765 --> 00:00:21,525
Of course, I'll help you at all costs.

7
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:22,765
Fah, stop playing around.

8
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:24,891
Here, let me help.

00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,645
Thank you.

10
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,545
Guys,

11
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:36,165
this is Kuafah, my older brother.

12
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:38,445
So he's your real brother?

13
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:40,665
Yes, he is.

14
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:45,345
We will celebrate this event at the beach.

15
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:46,755
Is this Khabkluen's resort?

16
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,075
Did you really not know?

17
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:51,795
Kluen lets us stay at his resort for free.

18
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:54,082
You're taking a walk and not inviting me at all?

19
00:00:54,082 --> 00:00:56,515
I guess I need to back off for Ai Typhoon.

20
00:00:56,515 --> 00:01:01,535
He stepped up his game after knowing that Kuafah was Nuea's brother.

21
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:03,274
If Nuea didn't like him at all,

22
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:05,755
he wouldn't be talking to him so sweetly like that.

23
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:09,415
Do you think Nuea likes Phoon?

24
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,168
What are you painting?

25
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,778
We're at the seaside. Of course, I'm painting the sea.

26
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:24,595
Here. This one is yours.

27
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:28,125
And this one... You painted it for me, right?

28
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,245
Yes.

29
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:32,235
When did you two get changed?

30
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:35,317
They look kind of similar.

31
00:01:35,317 --> 00:01:37,545
Just eat. Eat!

32
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:40,385
Do you think that Daonuea already has someone in his heart?

33
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:44,105
I will make Daonuea forget and start over with me.

34

There are things you can't undo.

35

No matter how much you ponder them,

36
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:50,525
it's pointless.

37
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:52,192
I've been carrying it with me for so long.

38
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:54,492
I don't know how to get it off my chest.

39
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:56,085
Give it here.

40
00:01:56,685 --> 00:01:58,565
I'll throw it away for you.

41
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:00,345
Yes.

42
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:02,499
Please throw it far away.

43
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,881
What exactly am I throwing away?

44
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:18,895
So I'll know how to help.

45
00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:21,045

54
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:01,795
Where are you going?

55
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,259
For a walk.

56
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,345
That bridge, can I go?

57

Why was this place named Kluen's House?

58
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:07,444
When I was young, my dad asked...

59
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,187
what I wanted to name this resort.

60
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:14,468
And that was what I told him.

61
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:21,785
And you were named Khabkluen because of the sea?

62
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:27,185
I guess so.

63
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:30,340
My mom named me the North Star

64
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,875
because it's the brightest star.

65
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:40,035
There. The North Star.

66
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:45,025
The brightest star that always stays in the same spot, unlike the others.

People who are lost

68

trust the North Star to guide their way.

69
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,760
My mom wished for me to grow

70
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,750
and be able to guide someone to the right route.

71
00:05:57,755 --> 00:06:00,843
I don't know if I can ever be like the star.

00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:16,235

81

I can never like her.

The best thing you'll do for someone who loves you...

84
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:49,545
is to directly say that you don't love them back.

00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,795

If the person in his heart was truly good,

97
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:02,721
he wouldn't keep him waiting this long.

I want to be honest about my feelings

We should have stayed for two nights.

150

Nevermind. I might be hungover.

00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:47,005
Do you know how much you tossed and turned when you slept?

168
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:48,285
Really?

169
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:52,188
Yes. I needed to hold you all night.

170
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,465
Come on. I was just drunk, not dead.

171
00:12:54,465 --> 00:12:56,685
I knew what happened.

172
00:12:56,685 --> 00:12:58,695
I'm joking.

173
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,035
You did toss and turn, though.

174
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:03,645
Do you always cry when you're drunk?

175
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:06,345
I wasn't drunk.

176
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:10,565
You weren't? But you cried.

177
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:14,205
Yes.

178
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:46,955
Kluen, aren't you going to stay one more night?

179
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:52,905
Kluen.

180
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:54,785
Yes, Mom?

181
00:13:54,785 --> 00:13:56,895
Is something wrong?

182
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,145
No.

183
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:03,005
No, it is.

184
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:07,325
Why aren't you getting ready?

185
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:09,705
The bus is here.

186
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:11,965
I'm about to.

187
00:14:11,965 --> 00:14:14,575
Let's go. I'll walk you.

188
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:15,795
Sure.

189
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:47,485
Wow! You're early today.

190
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:50,029
Let me copy your Math homework.

191
00:14:55,705 --> 00:15:00,205
Mr. Pakpian's assignment was due yesterday, wasn't it?

192
00:15:00,925 --> 00:15:03,385
But it's due today for the Science Program class.

193
00:15:03,385 --> 00:15:06,105
What? Are you doing an assignment for Ai Kluen again?

194
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,665
Shit! Keep it down.

195
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:12,015
- People can hear.
- All right. Let me go.

196
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:20,155
Do you have to distort it?

197
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:22,465
Yes. It can't be perfect.

198
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:23,935
Otherwise, the teacher will be suspicious.

199
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:27,565
Wow. I truly admire your hard work.

200
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:39,225
And now you're writing with your left hand?

201
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:45,045
Does Kluen even know there's someone doing this much for him?

202
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:49,626
I don't do this

203
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:51,445
because I want him to know.

204
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:54,405
I just want to help him in any way I can.

205
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:56,425
You don't get it, Ai Nay.

206
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:58,565
Love that does not require anything back.

207
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:00,365
Yes.

208
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:02,955
I only know "Love Doesn't Require Time" by Noona.

209
00:16:02,955 --> 00:16:05,055
Happy now?

210
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:15,695
Shit.

211
00:16:15,695 --> 00:16:18,445
I'm not done yet!

212
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,855
Continue it in the classroom. Come on.

213
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,945
- And these things?
- Grab them for me.

214
00:16:30,185 --> 00:16:33,494
So? Are you having fun?

215
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:37,084
Ting Ting told me you liked beaches.

216
00:16:37,084 --> 00:16:41,005
Yes. I like the colors of the sea.

217
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:44,362
It's simply clear water,

218
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:47,605
but it can change its colors at any time.

219
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:51,015
A speech from a Fine and Applied Arts guy.

220
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:53,525
I just can't relate.

221
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:55,645
You're flattering me.

222
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:59,355
What kind of paintings do you like to do, Nuea?

223
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:02,965
Watercolor paintings.

224
00:17:02,965 --> 00:17:04,465
I can do portraits too.

225
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:06,265
Really?

226
00:17:06,265 --> 00:17:10,205
Can you draw me sometimes?

227
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,985
Yes. Sure.

228
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:19,558
Please make it beautiful. More beautiful than the real me.

229
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:21,575
Papang, you're beautiful already.

230
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:23,755
Your drawing will turn out beautiful no matter what.

231
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:26,805
Well, well.

232
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:28,785
Are you two flirting here?

233
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:31,625
Are you crazy, Ting-Ting.

234
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,365
What are you saying?

235
00:17:33,365 --> 00:17:35,825
Don't be shy.

236
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:37,475
We're about to hit the road. Are you guys coming?

237
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:38,925
Or will you stay, just the two of you?

238
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,825
Smile. Smile.

239
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:43,985
- Let's go.
- So you're going back?

240
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:46,245
Nuea, come on.

241
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,973
All right. Bye.

242
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:51,475
Goodbye, Na.

243
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:53,905
Your resort is really nice.

244
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:57,085
If you like it, come visit often. Great hospitality awaits you.

245
00:17:57,085 --> 00:18:00,105
- Of course. Thank you so much.
- Sure.

246
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:01,925
Are you okay there?

247
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:02,978
Let's go.

248
00:18:02,978 --> 00:18:05,398
He's a lightweight.

249
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:09,246
Goodbye, Girls.

250
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:10,425
Goodbye, Khun Na.

251
00:18:10,425 --> 00:18:11,505
Bye.

252
00:18:11,505 --> 00:18:15,225
Daonuea, please come again.

253
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:19,655
One night is too short. I didn't even get to take you diving.

254
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:27,645
I should be going now.

255
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:29,105
Of course.

256
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:37,325
Can Mommy get a hug?

257
00:18:41,145 --> 00:18:46,245
Remember, you can't keep everything to yourself, all right?

258
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:47,985
Thank you, Mom.

259
00:18:48,775 --> 00:18:51,825
- Goodbye.
- Bye. See you.

260
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:05,595
Fah, can I sleep with you?

261
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:14,703
For a physical illness,

262
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:17,251
doctors can find a way to help.

263
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:21,455
For love sickness, I don't think we can.

264
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:23,775
Stop messing with me.

265
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:28,995
What's the matter?

266
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:35,245
If you don't talk, I'll go to sleep now.

267
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:42,085
Ai Kluen told me to go out with Ai Phoon.

268
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:46,185
Phoon?

269
00:19:47,065 --> 00:19:49,185
The Medicine Freshy Boy?

270
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:52,865
Yes.

271
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:55,505
I think he knows how I feel.

272
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:57,431
That's why he said it.

273
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:02,235
Did you tell him how you feel?

274
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:06,345
Should something like that be spoken out loud?

275
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:12,625
But Khabkluen already has a girlfriend.

276
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:16,515
I never wanted to steal anyone's boyfriend.

277
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:21,365
I should have kept it hidden like before.

278
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:25,065
Right now, it's like I'm being pushed away.

279
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:26,865
I freaking hate it.

280
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:29,685
If there's no hope in it,

281
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:33,445
why don't you step back?

282
00:20:33,445 --> 00:20:38,615
What Khabkluen told you might be right.

283
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:42,485
I guess he meant well.

284
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:45,125
Fine. I'm the stubborn one here.

285
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:49,865
I should just torment myself through life and become a Casanova like my brother.

286
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:52,065
It's not tormenting.

287
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:55,835
It's called, living your life to the fullest.

288
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:57,315
Fah,

289
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:01,465
there are tons of nice people in this world.

290
00:21:02,215 --> 00:21:04,805
Don't shut yourself off just yet.

291
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:09,285
I'm not. I just haven't found the right one.

292
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:10,605
Right.

293
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:15,405
You're probably the reason I'm so hopeless in love.

294
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:17,965
Your karma is biting your brother in the ass.

295
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:20,475
Don't be silly.

296
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:22,435
Go wash up and get some sleep.

297
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:24,535
All right, then.

298
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:15,665
What the heck is wrong now?

299
00:22:15,665 --> 00:22:17,805
Did you leave your mouth in Hua Hin?

300
00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:19,685
Nosy.

301
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:22,725
What an ass! I'm worried about you here.

302
00:22:22,725 --> 00:22:24,762
What's wrong, exactly?

303
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:28,545
Same old stuff.

304
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:33,855
By the way, are you going to Ai Sean's birthday party tomorrow?

305
00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:35,595
I am.

306
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:37,945
Gia is coming as well.

307
00:22:37,945 --> 00:22:40,705
She's meeting up with her friend there.

308
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:44,480
When will you two stop being like this?

309
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,825
You guys know it, but other people don't.

310
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:52,515
And why should I care what they think?

311
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:55,425
Isn't it why you're being like this?

312
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:58,535
You care what other people think.

313
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,025
What should I do then?

314
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:08,195
Make yourself clear.

315
00:23:08,195 --> 00:23:11,265
Both your feelings and actions.

316
00:23:12,405 --> 00:23:15,005
Is it so hard? I don't think so.

317
00:23:15,005 --> 00:23:18,105
Try it. Things might get better.

318
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:22,385
That can't be the only reason.

319
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,775
Gia said someone like me is not suitable to care for others.

320
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:33,599
Ai Kluen, when will you stop this habit of assuming things yourself?

321
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,965
Aren't you tired of yourself?

322
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:38,815
- Well?
- I am.

323
00:23:39,872 --> 00:23:41,602
So damn much.

324
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,560
[WAB Café and Friends]

325
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,425
Cheers.

326
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,635
Happy birthday, Sir.

327
00:24:01,635 --> 00:24:03,345
I wish you lots of happiness.

328
00:24:03,345 --> 00:24:05,565
Thank you, Sir.

329
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:10,765
So?

330
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:15,005
Ever since the Hua Hin trip, you two haven't left each other's side.

331
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,785
Are you falling for the University Freshy Boy now?

332
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:23,405
No. We're being normal.

333
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:26,425
Yes. Normally flirting.

334
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:30,905
People who are flirting, what do they do?

335
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:32,605
Show me.

336
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:36,825
Yum-yum.

337
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,355
Feed me.

338
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,235
No. It's my birthday. You feed me.

339
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,755
Damn! Ai Kluen finally opened up about his girl.

340
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,300
Kluen, Kluen! This way. Right here.

341
00:25:16,805 --> 00:25:18,275
Hi, Guys.

342
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:21,365
I'll be here for just a second. I'm meeting up with a friend later.

343
00:25:21,365 --> 00:25:25,045
Ai Kluen, aren't you going to introduce us?

344
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:29,265
Gia, this is Sean, the birthday boy.

345
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:31,775
This is Maitee.

346
00:25:31,775 --> 00:25:33,235
Typhoon.

347
00:25:35,245 --> 00:25:37,945
And... Daonuea.

348
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:46,380
Guys, this is Georgia, my close friend.

349
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,875
Stop it! You're talking like a TV star again.

350
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:52,735
Here. Happy birthday.

351
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:54,638
Thank you, Sir.

352
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,775
My friend is here. Would you excuse me?

353
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:02,965
Kluen, don't wait for me.

354
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,575
Bye bye.

355
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,635
So are you in a relationship or not?

356
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,235
I told you.

357
00:26:12,235 --> 00:26:14,245
It wasn't clear.

358
00:26:14,245 --> 00:26:16,285
Friend or girlfriend?

359
00:26:19,095 --> 00:26:21,365
Ai Nuea, slow down.

360
00:26:21,365 --> 00:26:24,307
- You'll be wasted.
- That's fine.

361
00:26:26,165 --> 00:26:29,785
Here. I'll tell the story. In tenth grade…

362
00:26:29,785 --> 00:26:33,710
Knowing my story won't make the drinks taste better.

363
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,988
Ai Kluen.

364
00:26:34,988 --> 00:26:36,588
That's enough.

365
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,845
Your life is filled with mysteries, Ai Kluen.

366
00:26:41,845 --> 00:26:43,845
Handsome guys can do whatever they want.

367
00:26:43,845 --> 00:26:46,015
Man, you are despicable.

368
00:26:46,015 --> 00:26:47,645
You can't compete with Ai Phoon.

369
00:26:47,645 --> 00:26:49,645
He hits on someone and he admits it, right?

370
00:26:49,645 --> 00:26:53,153
Yes. I hit on one person at a time... to be with one person at a time.

371
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,097
Unlike this jerk.

372
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,605
Ai Kluen loves one person at a time, too.

373
00:27:01,165 --> 00:27:04,025
Daonuea, what about you?

374
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:06,295
How many people do you love at the same time?

375
00:27:06,295 --> 00:27:10,565
Do you spare a tiny space for me at all?

376
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:12,535
Eat up.

377
00:27:12,535 --> 00:27:14,528
I'm going to step outside.

378
00:27:16,565 --> 00:27:18,625
To answer your question,

379
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,845
I love one person at a time, too.

380
00:27:20,845 --> 00:27:23,705
Before I love someone new,

381
00:27:23,705 --> 00:27:26,045
I will forget the old love first.

382
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,055
Damn! That cuts deep.

383
00:27:31,055 --> 00:27:32,755
Bravo.

384
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:35,325
I'm going to go check on him.

385
00:27:35,325 --> 00:27:38,375
Go, Mr. New Love.

386
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,427
Why are you here by yourself?

387
00:28:00,965 --> 00:28:03,335
To get some fresh air.

388
00:28:03,335 --> 00:28:05,715
The lights inside give me a headache.

389
00:28:05,715 --> 00:28:10,055
Is it the lights inside or someone inside that give you a headache?

390
00:28:11,087 --> 00:28:13,167
What do you mean?

391
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:16,395
I don't know. Just saying.

392
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:23,025
The old love, new love you talked about,

393
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,650
was I even included there?

394
00:28:32,065 --> 00:28:36,555
Didn't I tell you I was scared to turn people down?

395
00:28:36,555 --> 00:28:38,795
Because you're scared...

396
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:41,725
I still think I have a chance.

397
00:28:45,495 --> 00:28:49,025
Isn't there any way for you to forget?

398
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,165
I can never forget it.

399
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:09,025
Sit properly.

400
00:29:10,085 --> 00:29:12,360
Did everyone else leave?

401
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,730
Yes.

402
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,375
Ai Noel asked me to tell you he needed to leave first.

403
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:18,285
Maitee was wasted.

404
00:29:18,285 --> 00:29:20,345
Noel volunteered to take him home.

405
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,400
Sean, should we end the party? It's late.

406
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,645
Yes. Nuea has passed out already.

407
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:32,875
It's not easy to wake him up.

408
00:29:33,577 --> 00:29:35,177
Nuea.

409
00:29:35,895 --> 00:29:39,295
Nuea. Nuea!

410
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:46,695
Fire!

411
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:53,455
I'll just let you spend the night here.

412
00:29:53,455 --> 00:29:57,655
Daonuea, will you be my boyfriend?

413
00:29:59,335 --> 00:30:02,164
If you don't wake up, I'll take it as a yes.

414
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:07,805
Ai Kluen, easy there, Man.

415
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:13,685
Ai Phoon, that's not something you can joke about.

416
00:30:17,085 --> 00:30:19,005
I need to use the restroom.

417
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:21,855
Yes. We're leaving now.

418
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:24,236
Meet us out front when you're done.

419
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:26,155
Yes.

420
00:30:32,975 --> 00:30:34,475
Sit down.

421
00:30:36,785 --> 00:30:40,565
Did you stop me because you've already taken his side?

422
00:30:42,105 --> 00:30:43,725
I don't take sides,

423
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:46,160
but I know you see the signs.

424
00:30:59,855 --> 00:31:01,803
Hey! What are you doing?

425
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:05,185
Kluen, you're drunk.

426
00:31:05,882 --> 00:31:07,805
- You are drunk!
- I'm not.

427
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:09,955
But you kissed me.

428
00:31:11,325 --> 00:31:12,485
Kluen, you asshole!

429
00:31:12,485 --> 00:31:15,645
My feelings aren't something you can toy with.

430
00:31:25,785 --> 00:31:27,485
I'm jealous.

431
00:31:33,265 --> 00:31:36,005
What rights do you have to be jealous of me?

432
00:31:36,005 --> 00:31:38,245
I think you gave me the right.

433
00:32:05,695 --> 00:32:11,295
I used to give it to you, but that doesn't mean you can do anything.

434
00:32:14,095 --> 00:32:16,290
You may have thought it yourself.

435
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:20,965
Then let me take it back.

436
00:32:23,105 --> 00:32:25,305
Kluen, Nuea.

437
00:32:30,845 --> 00:32:32,445
I am sorry.

438
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:39,678
Forget it. You're just drunk.

439
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:50,085
You were gone for a long time, so I came looking for you.

440
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:51,795
Let's leave now.

441
00:33:00,832 --> 00:33:02,632
Ai Kluen, wait up.

442
00:33:04,175 --> 00:33:06,190
I want to ask you something.

443
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:09,265
What is it?

444
00:33:09,265 --> 00:33:11,995
Did you and Gia really break up?

445
00:33:14,485 --> 00:33:17,656
You broke up with her because of Daonuea.

446
00:33:18,685 --> 00:33:21,010
You're the one in Daonuea's heart.

447
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:24,585
And Daonuea is the one in your heart, too.

448
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,564
Am I reading it right?

449
00:33:27,775 --> 00:33:30,225
Are you kidding, Kluen?

450
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:34,640
What did I do wrong? Why do you break up with me?

451
00:33:41,325 --> 00:33:43,025
I'm sorry.

452
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:46,885
I don't want to hear an apology.

453
00:33:48,345 --> 00:33:50,875
I want to know the reason.

454
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:56,395
Please think it through, Gia.

455
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:00,425
We don't love each other like that.

456
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:05,557
We're just…

457
00:34:06,305 --> 00:34:08,946
used to having each other in life.

458
00:34:10,605 --> 00:34:12,765
And what we had...

459
00:34:12,765 --> 00:34:15,945
What was it that we had?

460
00:34:15,945 --> 00:34:19,415
Why did you realize it just now, Kluen?

461
00:34:21,005 --> 00:34:23,020
Because up until now,

462
00:34:24,985 --> 00:34:27,345
I had no idea what love was.

463
00:34:31,265 --> 00:34:34,965
But now, I do.

464
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:38,435
How do you know?

465
00:34:43,455 --> 00:34:45,945
One day, when you meet that person,

466
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:50,105
you will know it just like I do.

467
00:34:51,265 --> 00:34:53,292
That person who isn't me.

468
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,059
I really am sorry.

469
00:35:11,955 --> 00:35:14,345
Ai Phoon, I say you are too drunk.

470
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,865
Leave your car here and come get it tomorrow.

471
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,665
Ai Nuea, let's take a taxi and get you home first.

472
00:35:20,715 --> 00:35:22,925
It's okay. You can go straight home.

473
00:35:22,925 --> 00:35:24,125
I'll get back by myself.

474
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:27,645
I want to make sure you're home. Let me take you.

475
00:35:27,645 --> 00:35:30,085
Hey, we've got two taxis here just in time.

476
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:31,685
Excuse me.

477
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:34,955
You and Nuea, get in and go home.

478
00:35:34,955 --> 00:35:36,942
I'll wait for a new one.

479
00:35:39,425 --> 00:35:41,685
Come on, Ai Phoon.

480
00:35:41,685 --> 00:35:44,205
Please take my friend home.

481
00:35:46,825 --> 00:35:48,625
Get home safe.

482
00:35:56,425 --> 00:35:57,585
Hold on.

483
00:35:57,585 --> 00:36:00,065
Patch things up with him.

484
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:03,345
Ai Kluen, set it right.

485
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:05,045
See you.

486
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:14,136
What do you want?

487
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:21,305
About what?

488
00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:26,525
Are you playing dumb, or do you actually not know?

489
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:31,685
Daonuea, you might think I'm smart at everything,

490
00:36:32,465 --> 00:36:34,614
but I want you to know that...

491
00:36:34,614 --> 00:36:36,585
when it comes to love,

492
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:38,494
I know nothing.

493
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:41,625
About this,

494
00:36:42,725 --> 00:36:45,055
I'm dumb,

495
00:36:45,055 --> 00:36:46,985
freaking dumb.

496
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:49,139
I'm so dumb that I hate myself for it.

497
00:36:54,605 --> 00:36:57,084
You told me to go out with Ai Phoon.

498
00:36:57,084 --> 00:37:00,515
You acted like you didn't care.

00:37:00,515 --> 00:37:03,675
Just when I started to get you out of my life,

500
00:37:05,675 --> 00:37:08,285
you kept coming right back.

501
00:37:11,305 --> 00:37:14,605
I'm not having fun like you are.

502
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:17,299
Do you think I ever had fun with this?

503
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:19,706
Then what do you want?

504
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:22,065
What are you doing this for?

505
00:37:22,735 --> 00:37:25,745
Make it clear to me now

506
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:29,145
whether you have me in your heart or not.

[Next Week]
Khabkluen likes me.

517
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:28,885
He told me to keep my heart open for him only.

518
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:30,875
What did you do last night?

519
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,515
I kissed Ai Kluen.

520
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:33,945
Yesterday, you guys kissed.

521
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,605
And today, you'll be going to his place.

522
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,652
What brings you here?

523
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,085
Eat so you can take medicines.

524
00:38:43,085 --> 00:38:45,618
Why are you sick all of a sudden?

525
00:38:45,618 --> 00:38:47,705
You don't take care of yourself.

526
00:38:47,705 --> 00:38:50,032
People are worried about you.

527
00:38:54,105 --> 00:38:58,115
I know my heart because of you.

528
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:02,955
Fah, I have a boyfriend.

529
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:07,625
You spent one day taking care of him, and now you're in a relationship?

530
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:11,735
Ai Phoon, I need to talk to you.

531
00:39:14,405 --> 00:39:17,605
I like Daonuea. No...

532
00:39:18,305 --> 00:39:20,155
I love Daonuea.
