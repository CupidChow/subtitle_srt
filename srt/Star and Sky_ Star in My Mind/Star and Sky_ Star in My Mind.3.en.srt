Can you help me find a birthday present for my mom?

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,010
Your mom already has everything.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,070
We can't find anything for her here.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,020
You can just order. My treat.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,320
Do you want some?

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,670
Should I draw your mom as her birthday present?

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,500
Wow! You two are famous.

How come you're here?

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,830
Don't worry, everyone. I'm a doctor.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,436
Does it hurt right here?

15
00:00:49,436 --> 00:00:51,220
Ouch! It hurts.

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,560
Be more gentle.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,060
Get up.

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,290

Should I take you to the infirmary?

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,360
Let me take Daonuea to the hospital. Then I'll take him back to his dorm.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,480
Of course.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,580
Okay.

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,320
Ouch.

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,270
It's all right, Guys. I'm okay.

28
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,200
I'll be right back.

29
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,122
Don't place too much weight on it.

30
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,670

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,150
Why did he seem so close to Daonuea?

34
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,920
He rushed here to save him like that.

35
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,330
There's no need to guess, we know that they are "something like that."

For sure.

I'm hotter.

Guys, let's call it a day.

I am just undeniably hot.

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,840
There are some pills and ointment.

44
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,980
Be careful. Don't get confused.

45
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,980
I know. I won't consume the ointment.

I'm not tormenting myself.

I'm happy with my life as it is.

I don't want to be just a friend, all right, Sir.

Let me be honest here. They look good together.

00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,306
You don't have to. I'm fine.

169
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:37,210
Don't be stubborn.

170
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,480
Where have you been?

171
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,700
To get more snacks.

172
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,300
People are drinking up there. They're loud.

173
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,693
Do you want to go to Maitee's room first?

174
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:52,230
Come on. I'm okay.

175
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,090
I will even join them.

176
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,790
Let's go.

177
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,880
So that was…

178
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,540
What?

179
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,666
Nothing.

180
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,220
Hey! How are you?

181
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,910
I was in shock when you fell.

182
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,426
What did the doctor say? Will you be okay?

183
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:22,620
How did you walk up here?

184
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,430
Should you take a day off tomorrow?

185
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,910
Calm down. That's a lot of questions.

186
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,593
Maitee, it's okay. I'm fine.

187
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:33,340
You guys are having a party without me.

188
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,946
Let me go take a shower first.

189
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,520
Thank you.

190
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,106
That's all right. I can walk.

191
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,600
What are you guys standing there for?

192
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,700
Come sit!

193
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,700
I got a plan.

194
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,855
What are you talking about?

195
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,886
It's Daonuea's bed, right?

196
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,833
Get off it. He won't have a place to sleep.

197
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,560
Tonight, I'm going to sleep right here.

198
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,560
When he comes out and finds me here, we will need to nestle.

199
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,353
Tonight, he'll be mine.

200
00:12:31,353 --> 00:12:35,040
Stop playing around, will you?

201
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,540
Just let him.

202
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,440
Let's drink.

203
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,300
Ai Phoon, give me Nuea's glass.

204
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,673
I'll make him a drink.

205
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,680
Nuea, do you have morning classes tomorrow?

206
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,240
I can wake you up.

207
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,453
I'm a heavyweight, let me tell you.

208
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:06,100
I never got hungover and skipped class.

209
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,380
Are you saying you can wake yourself up tomorrow?

210
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,500
No, I have afternoon classes.

211
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,200
Let's drink.

212
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,440
Bottoms up!

213
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,040
Nuea, can I ask you something?

214
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,200
Sure.

215
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,460
Shoot.

216
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,030
What's your type?

217
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,800
My type?

218
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,380
Yes.

219
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,533
A caring one.

220
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:39,266
An attentive one.

221
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,380
Honestly, I like a person like Fah.

222
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,180
As in Kuafah?

223
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,250
A guy?

224
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,018
Yes. I don't mind.

225
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:56,993
I see people for their character.

226
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:59,840
If we click, then it's done!

227
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,273
Ah.

228
00:14:03,273 --> 00:14:08,546
Guys, I have a funny story to tell.

229
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,600
I once confessed to someone,

230
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,050
a very popular one in school.

231
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I was so damn dorky back then.

232
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,450
Thinking back, it was funny.

233
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,766
How did I even do that?

234
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,373
Now that I know your type,

235
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,184
I think I have a chance here.

236
00:14:36,184 --> 00:14:39,200
Once you and he are over,

237
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,213
turn to me, please.

238
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:43,890
What?

239
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,613
Who over with whom?

240
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:52,526
Hey, Ai Sean.

241
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:55,213
Make me a drink.

242
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:06,873
I really want to know who Doanuea confessed to.

243
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:10,080
Ai Kluen, you're from the same high school.

244
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,080
Do you know?

245
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,966
You should ask him.

246
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:17,160
Did you see Daonuea at all in school?

247
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,794
What was he like then?

248
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,780
People always gazed at him when he passed by.

249
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,896
He smiled at everyone.

250
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:33,985
Imagining myself as one of them makes me blush already.

251
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,549
I think I really like him.

252
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,441
Do you think I have a chance?

253
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,193
- You do.
- Really?

254
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,448
When there's love, there's hope

255
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,701
as well as disappointment.

256
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,427
You might need to prepare for it.

257
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,726
I know I should,

258
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,886
but I think I will try my best for now.

259
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:09,346
And the first thing I'll do is wait for Daonuea to break up with Kuafah.

260
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,300
Hey.

261
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,710
Daonuea.

262
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:39,860
Dao.

263
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,940
Dao.

264
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,644
You should go sleep on the bed.

265
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,150
Yes.

266
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,550
Come on.

267
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Kluen,

268
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,260
the drawing is about to be finished.

269
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,073
I just need to work on some teeny-tiny details.

270
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,320
Is it hard?

271
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,600
Look who you're talking to.

272
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,226
It's totally manageable for me.

273
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,580
You and your mom have resemblances.

274
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,973
You know, I'm an expert at drawing your face.

275
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,011
Have you been drawing me?

276
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,500
I have a book of it. Let me tell you.

277
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,420
That many?

278
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,140
Yes, they're my collection.

279
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,426
I've got nothing to do.

280
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,580
Daonuea.

281
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,610
Yes?

282
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,366
Do you still like me?

283
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,580
Hello. Are you home, Fah?

284
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,712
I drank… No! I took the pills already.

285
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,853
I didn't redo the crepe bandage, though. I will do it tomorrow.

286
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,813
See you, Fah.

287
00:18:42,813 --> 00:18:44,510
Bye.

288
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,724
Goodnight, Kluen.

289
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,060
Goodnight.

290
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,133
Why am I the only one with morning classes?

291
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,653
Hey, I didn't see anything.

292
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:58,840
Yes, I'm still drunk. Still hungover.

293
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,590
I should take a shower. My towel?

294
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,773
Shower. Shower.

295
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,633
That's it for today. I'll see you all next time.

296
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:21,946
Guys, the mentors gave me a rehearsal-free day today.

297
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:24,886
Should we go get a bite?

298
00:20:24,886 --> 00:20:30,360
Well, I don't eat food. I'm a drinker.

299
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,050
Come on.

300
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,173
I drank last night, and I am still hungover.

301
00:20:35,173 --> 00:20:38,120
I was kidding.

302
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,130
I have plans with my family today.

303
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,493
I actually should get going.

304
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:45,153
Plans with your family again?

305
00:20:45,153 --> 00:20:48,140
Are you seeing someone and not telling us?

306
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,760
Seeing what?

307
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,400
I'm going to meet up with my mother. Will you come with me then?

308
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,880
- We'd rather not.
- No.

309
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,990
And you, Ai Pong?

310
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,820
Do you think a nice guy like me has time for his friend?

311
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,980
- Of course, you do.
- No, I don't.

312
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,373
Okay. My friends never have time for me.

313
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,610
Let's go.

314
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,560
What is he doing in our faculty?

315
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,260
Exactly.

316
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,180
What are you doing here?

317
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,620
Do you have some time?

318
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,420
Do you want to come and choose the picture frame with me?

319
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,390
For the picture that I drew?

320
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,889
Yes. It's my mom's birthday.

321
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:40,983
That's right. It's your mom's birthday.

322
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,228
I have time.

323
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:46,170
Should we go now? Or else we won't make it by this evening.

324
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,450
Okay.

325
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,380
- Come on.
- Yes.

326
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,963
I'll see you guys later. Bye.

327
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,180
See you later.

328
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,040
Don't. I can walk.

329
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,960
- But your leg hurts.
- It's okay.

330
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,360
- Come here.
- I can walk just fine.

331
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,840
Kluen, I can walk by myself.

332
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,640
I'm feeling like a superstar now.

333
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,146
Will you hurry, Ai Kluen?

334
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:42,190
I asked to go with you to the car and you said no.

335
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,760
Be prepared to be the talk of the town.

336
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,790
But your leg is still in pain.

337
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:51,240
I'm fine now. Stop acting like P'Fah.

338
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,940
You seem very close to this Kuafah guy.

339
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,660
Of course. He's my big brother.

340
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,260
Big brother?

341
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,240
Speaking of the devil.

342
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,480
Fah is calling.

343
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,740
Yes, Sir. I've taken the medicines.

344
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,885
Morning pills and after lunch.

345
00:23:17,885 --> 00:23:20,513
I can just run right now, you know?

346
00:23:20,513 --> 00:23:23,923
Were you drunk last night?

347
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,140
How did you know that?

348
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,950
I could tell from your voice.

349
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,760
When did you call? I had no idea.

350
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,106
Were you that drunk not to recall anything?

351
00:23:35,106 --> 00:23:36,980
Have you applied the ointment yet?

352
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,460
Oh, Fah! Let me tell you a weird story.

353
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,863
I was wasted, but the bandage got changed,

354
00:23:45,863 --> 00:23:48,960
and the ointment was already used.

355
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,806
I am so cool. I can totally take care of myself, even when I'm drunk.

356
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:29,960
By the way, I got a free day today,

357
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,652
so I'm helping Kluen with his mom's birthday gift.

358
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,100
Okay. Sure, Sir. I'll see you later.

359
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,910
You said only special ones can call you that.

360
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,827
What?

361
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:49,670
Dao.

362
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:53,430
How did you know that?

363
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,572
You said it in the promo video.

364
00:24:56,317 --> 00:25:00,000
So Kuafah... is special?

365
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,820
Damn right, he is. He's my big brother.

366
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,320
Big brother?

367
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:07,940
What do you mean?

368
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,593
Well, those who are born first are older ones (phi),

369
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:11,820
and those born later are younger ones (nong).

370
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,697
Why did you even ask?

371
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,940
Nothing. Let's go.

372
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,620
No need to help. I can walk.

373
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,990
[Somjai] (Satisfaction)

374
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,177
It's a sketch.

375
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:58,620
Should we just get a white and simple frame?

376
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,870
Sure.

377
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,700
Okay. Let's get this one then.

378
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,390
It's white and homey. It can be placed anywhere in your house.

379
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,700
Come on.

380
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,400
Go pay.

381
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,980
Here, it's just perfect.

382
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,620
It's beautiful. I think my mom will love it.

383
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,190
Oh! Write the date and your wish on it.

384
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,973
So it can be a memorable gift.

385
00:26:41,973 --> 00:26:44,510
I'm leaving for Germany tonight to study.

386
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,032
So I'd like you to write…

387
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,446
Hurry. It's hot out here.

388
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,750
You should write, too.

389
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,980
It's for your mom.

390
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,900
I don't know her. I have no idea what to write.

391
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,800
Well, you let a stranger write on your school shirt once.

392
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,926
If you want to bring that up, just shut up.

393
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,130
♫ Everyone on this earth ♫

394

♫ Is looking for their missing piece ♫

402
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,246
Which direction is your house?

403
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:37,790
Will it be a waste of time if you drive me back first?

404
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,296
I can go back myself, you know.

405
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,445
It is a waste of time.

406
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:47,060
You can drop me off here then.

407
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,526
I can use a taxi.

408
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,415
Do you want to come?

409
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,380
To where?

410
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,540
My mom's birthday party. Do you want to come?

411
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,180
Are you crazy? I don't know her.

412
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,550
Besides, I'm not so good around seniors.

413
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,220
I don't know how to act.

414
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,380
It's just a simple dinner, not a prospective marriage meeting.

415
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,950
You don't need to take it too seriously.

416
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,860
Are you annoying me again?

417
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,723
Why don't you bring your girlfriend?

418
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,860
My dad is working out of town tonight.

419
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,260
So it will be just my mom and me.

420
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,840
If you come, it shouldn't be so lonely.

421
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,340
But…

422
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,693
I… I'm nervous.

423
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,100
Hi, Son.

424
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,460
Where are you now? Dinner is almost ready.

425
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,541
Hi, Mom.

426
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:45,020
Someone here wants to talk to you.

427
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,190
Really? Who?

428
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,350
Hello, Khun Na.
(T/N: Polite way of calling someone "Aunt")

429
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,290
Hi, there.

430
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:57,600
Mom, I invited Daonuea, but he refused.

431
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,820
He's afraid you would yell at him.

432
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,340
Kluen, I didn't say that.

433
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,940
Khun Na, that's not true. Don't listen to him. He's lying.

434
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,080
Daonuea, please come.

435
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,180
Kluen's dad was supposed to be here, too,

436
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,470
but he has to take care of the resort in Hua Hin.

437
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,850
So I need to celebrate in two locations.

438
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,694
Please join us, Honey. I made lots of food here.

439
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:23,780
It will be quite lonely with just me and Kluen.

440
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,070
Okay then, Khun Na. I'll come.

441
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,280
We should arrive soon.

442
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,950
All right.

443
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,427
Kluen, you said Daonuea was stubborn.

444
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:38,300
He isn't at all.

445
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,880
Drive safely. I'll see you in a bit.

446
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,780
Okay. Bye.

447
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,679
Is the nervousness gone?

448
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,020
You're wicked, Khabkluen.

449
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,784
You bet I am.

450
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,126
Hi, Mom.

451
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,947
- Hello.
- Hi, there.

452
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:06,620
You two have arrived.

453
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,280
Happy birthday, Khun Na.

454
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,250
I wish you good health and that you stay fabulous like this forever.

455
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,760
Thanks a lot, Honey.

456
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,620
I'm sorry I didn't bring any gifts.

457
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,770
It was such short notice, and I didn't have time to get one.

458
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,090
That's totally fine.

459
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,200
Your being here to have dinner with me makes me happy enough.

460
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,780
Sure.

461
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:33,700
Besides, isn't it you who drew this picture, Daonuea?

462
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,450
Did you know?

463
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:40,200
Kluen drew it, too, on the hair, just a bit.

464
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,330
Just a little bit extra here, right?

465
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,920
That's right.

466
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,840
You didn't need to say that.

467
00:31:49,313 --> 00:31:52,910
Of course, I know. When you were drawing it,

468
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:57,453
that one sent me lots of pictures.

469
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,960
- Mom.
- Yes?

470
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,813
These are from Gia's parents and Gia herself.

471
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,953
Put them on the table.

472
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,980
Go on.

473
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,080
Let's go find somewhere to hang the picture.

474
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,760
Sure.

475
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,870
Hey, what's wrong?

476
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:24,300
A little accident during the rehearsal.

477
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,333
Well, go slowly then.

478
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:42,166
I think it would look better with one more picture here.

479
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:45,120
I agree.

480
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,220
If we have a picture of Kluen's dad right here, too, it would be great.

481
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,100
When is his dad's birthday? I can draw one.

482
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,960
No, that's okay. I don't want to bother you.

483
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,574
It's totally fine.

484
00:32:58,574 --> 00:33:02,440
I love drawing. It's no problem at all.

485
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,350
Okay then.

486
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:08,150
But you must promise me

487
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,286
you will hand it to him yourself,

488
00:33:11,286 --> 00:33:13,586
just like you did today.

489
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,113
All right. I promise.

490
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,760
Is this Khabkluen?

491
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,610
Yes. Unbelievable, isn't it?

492
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,673
Who would have thought he would grow up so handsome?

493
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,900
He enjoyed eating so much as a child.

494
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,540
Look at his cheeks.

495
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,540
His doctor even told me to watch his weight.

496
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,900
You know what?

497
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,986
Kluen was so mad because he didn't want to.

498
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,773
I have so many stories to tell.

499
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:05,217
Is that it?

500
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:07,906
They left us clueless about what the hero was going to say.

501
00:34:07,906 --> 00:34:09,130
That's right,

502
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,020
and we must wait a week for it.

503
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,920
Exactly.

504
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,860
What a surprise.

505
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,700
I didn't know youngsters watched TV dramas, too.

506
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,420
Ah! I watch them with my mom.

507
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,110
She's a big fan of TV dramas.

508
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,800
Even when we were in Germany, living in a different time zone,

509
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,820
I had to wake up early to watch it with her.

510
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,120
She couldn't stand reruns. She had to watch it live.

511
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,360
That's nice.

512
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,240
Then… should we watch something else?

513
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,960
- Mom.
- Yes?

514
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,633
I think it's late.

515
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:46,543
And you must go back to Hua Hin tomorrow.

516
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,023
Shouldn't you take some rest now?

517
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:59,140
Yes, you're right.

518
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,090
I think I should just go to bed.

519
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:07,140
Daonuea, come watch shows with me next time.

520
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,210
I will.

521
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,500
And visit me in Hua Hin if you have time.

522
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,400
Definitely, Khun Na.

523
00:35:13,053 --> 00:35:16,110
I should go then.

524
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,920
Bye.

525
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,400
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

526
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,860
Bye, Mom.

527
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,550
Don't stay up so late.

528
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,450
We won't.

529
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,169
Should we leave now?

530
00:35:32,169 --> 00:35:34,213
Do you want to leave already?

531
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,566
The contest will take place soon.

532
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,050
And then we will need to move out of the dorm.

533
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,520
I'm super lazy.

534
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,800
How much do you expect from the contest?

535
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,780
I fell off the stage at the rehearsal.

536
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,460
Can I even expect anything?

537
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,323
Walking properly without falling is already a blessing.

538
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,470
I don't like doing this kind of thing.

539
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:22,820
When I get nervous, everything I do is a mistake.

540
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,639
I have a solution.

541
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,010
What?

542
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,540
Before the contest,

543
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:44,053
find a paper, and write down your feelings.

544
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,833
After you vent it out, you'll feel better.

545
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,800
Have you ever used this trick?

546
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,300
I have.

547
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,060
Right. I have done it, too.

548
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,187
How could I forget that?

549
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,760
I will try it on the contest day.

550
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:19,270
The weather here at your house is nice. It's so hard to find in Bangkok.

551
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,750
The sky is like in Germany.

552
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,333
Only it was a bit darker there.

553
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:30,040
When I was there, I asked my dad to let me sleep in the attic every night.

554
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,840
I looked at the stars so much that I got tired of them.

555
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:38,053
Now that I'm back here, I kind of miss the stars over there.

556
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,247
Do you want to go back?

557
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,160
I do.

558
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,986
But just for a visit.

559
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,200
I…

560
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,379
don't want to move anywhere again.

561
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,760
I mean… I don't like to adjust.

562
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,920
I don't like the new environment.

563
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,540
I don't like to adjust, either.

564
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:32,350
♫ I know how scary this is. I feel it, too, like shots in the dark ♫

565
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,150
Khabkluen,

566
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,313
have you…

567
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,252
ever fallen in love?

568
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,020
I have.

569
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,310
At that moment,

570
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,999
how did you feel?

571
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,000
Love. How else should I have felt?

572
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,940
You have such a nice pool.

573
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,760
If I had clothes to change, I'd be in the water right now.

574
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,858
It's even nicer in Hua Hin.

575
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,713
You have the sea all to yourself.

576
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,820
Let's go there together.

577
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,410
Can I really...

578
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,304
go to your resort?

579
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,120
Of course...

580
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,900

593
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,060
There are disappointments, and sometimes we cry.

594
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,160
We smile, or our hearts are racing.

595

No matter how we experience it, it's still love.

596

[Next Week]
Is it so obvious that I'm nervous?

597
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,040
It will be over soon.

598
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,740
Don't be afraid.

599
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,260
Is this the place you asked me to come along to?

600
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,500
It's so beautiful.

601
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,700
What are you painting?

602
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,246
We're at the seaside. Of course, I'm painting the sea.

603
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,510
Here. This one is yours.

604
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:36,830
And this one, you painted it for me, right?

605
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,120
Do you dare put it on right now?

606
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,350
If you wear it, I will also wear it.

607
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,460
Ai Phoon, are you serious?

608
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,360
Yes. Nuea and I are both single.

609
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,000
It's not wrong to hit on him.

610
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,360
Why do I get the impression that Daonuea already has someone in his heart?

611
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,350
When did you two get changed?

612
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,410
Are these shirts from the same shop?

613
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,400
