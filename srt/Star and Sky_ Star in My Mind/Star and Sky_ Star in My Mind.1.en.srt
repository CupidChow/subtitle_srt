Khabkluen, Kanaruj Wongthampanich.

165
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:14,045
He arrived at school right at 7 a.m. every day.

166
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:17,160
His breakfast was always guava juice and a sandwich.

167
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,075
He wore a No. 22 basketball shirt.

168
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,270
He loved his girlfriend so damn much.

169
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:30,695
Pay attention in class.

170
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:36,390
Khabkluen, can you please accept a flower from me?

171
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,490
All I need to do is take it, right?

172
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,491
And he was freaking cold.

173
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,410
I'm sorry.

174
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,190
Ai Kluen!

175
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,325
When will you stop messing with my life?

176
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:20,050
Why don't you just come tomorrow?

177
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,315
I already finished it, and I'm about to order again.

178
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:25,390
Stop chewing me out because I don't have the energy to fight you.

179
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,630
I can tell from his expression.

180
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,660
This is exactly like you told me.

181
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,415
What did Ai Nay tell you, Ai Pong?

182
00:14:31,415 --> 00:14:33,330
You met him already, didn't you?

183
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:38,148
I did. I was shocked to see him at the Freshy Boys and Girls camp.

184
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,955
Wait a minute.

185
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:45,470
You knew Kluen was going here, didn't you?

186
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,140
Damn, Nay, why didn't you tell me?

187
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,390
He also knew you and Khabkluen were both Freshy Boys.

188
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,897
Ah!

189
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:59,932
Was that why you pushed me to become the Freshy Boy?

190
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,760
You horrible friend!

191
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,735
Calm down.

192
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:05,285
I only learned it a few days before you did.

193
00:15:05,285 --> 00:15:07,194
And it's already been a while.

194
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:09,405
I thought you wouldn't have any feelings for him anymore.

195
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:12,930
I no longer have feelings for him.

196
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,296
I was just taken aback.

197
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:16,295
Oh, really?

198
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:17,762
Yes!

199
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:21,562
There's no way in the freaking hell that I'd believe that.

200
00:15:21,562 --> 00:15:24,260
- That's a little too much.
- Sorry, my friend.

201
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,290
I honestly don't have feelings for him anymore.

202
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,840
I'm just embarrassed I once confessed my love for him.

203
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,500
It's humiliating,

204
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,620
and he's so annoying now,

205
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,675
acting like he's so cool.

206
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,305
It's good you no longer like him.

207
00:15:42,305 --> 00:15:46,010
Otherwise, you would be miserable to see him with his girlfriend right now.

208
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,510
What?

209
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:51,750
You have to move to the dorm on campus, right? When is it again?

210
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,010
Next week.

211
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,010
Do you want my car key, just in case,

212
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,090
so you can drive yourself?

213
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,380
No way!

214
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,740
You have no idea how many guys want to drive me.

215
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,695
You can stay in the on-campus dorm for six months,

216
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,755
and I can always find myself a chauffeur.

217
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,810
Okay.

218
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,543
Let's go find a table.

219
00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:27,410
My friend is just so cool.

220
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,690
So cool.

221
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,940
Of course.

222
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,700
Just wait and see.

223
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,330
I'll use my handsome face to snatch the crown from Kluen.

224
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,304
But now, just stop staring at him,

225
00:16:39,304 --> 00:16:41,575
- and put the knife down.
- Knife down.

226
00:16:41,575 --> 00:16:44,060
Earlier... was that Daonuea?

227
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,540
Yes.

228
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,555
And what? You didn't tell me you met Daonuea at the university.

229
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:55,325
Everything remains the same. Nothing has changed.

230
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:56,905
There has.

231
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:58,890
It's you who has changed.

232
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,280
I've never changed.

233
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,960
Here.

234
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,670
Take care of my baby.

235
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,460
No scratches, or my brother won't stop going on about it.

236
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,190
I know.

237
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,958
Your big brother wouldn't do that.

238
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,710
He would surely buy you a new car.

239
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,310
That's exaggerated.

240
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,345
By the way, how many people are there per room?

241
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:50,800
Based from the pictures...

242
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,016
I think there are four people per room.

243
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:55,345
Why?

244
00:17:55,345 --> 00:18:02,435
How likely is it that you will be in the same room as Kluen?

245
00:18:02,435 --> 00:18:05,405
Hey, there are like ten Freshy Boys.

246
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:07,175
I can't be that unlucky.

247
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:09,465
Fine.

248
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:16,345
Hi, Roommate.

249
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,720
Hey.

250
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,735
Hi, Guys.

251
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:22,010
Can I just pick a bed?

252
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,460
Yes.

253
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,305
I'll take this one then.

254
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,220
Go for it.

255
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,375
Is it just the three of us here?

256
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,895
Hi, Kluen.

257
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:38,195
Ouch! Damn it.

258
00:18:38,195 --> 00:18:39,405
Did you just fracture your skull?

259
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:41,405
I'm fine.

260
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:44,655
I'm that unlucky, Ai Nay.

261
00:18:44,655 --> 00:18:47,380
What? Did you talk to me?

262
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,370
No.

263
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,830
Ai Kluen, the second wardrobe from the left is yours.

264
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:02,575
Wow, Ai Kluen.

265
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,565
Do you want a ruler for that?

266
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:07,225
It won't stay like that when you actually use it.

267
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:08,665
- Nosy.
- What?

268
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:11,945
Save yourself from getting yelled at, will you?

269
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:13,773
Nuea, are you okay with the bed?

270
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:14,901
Do you want to switch with mine?

271
00:19:14,901 --> 00:19:16,859
You won't get your head hit up here.

272
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:20,449
It's okay. It's nothing. I'll be used to it in no time.

273
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:22,550
Do you mean you'll learn to avoid getting hit?

274
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,980
I mean, I'll be used to getting my head hit.

275
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,040
Are you happy now?

276
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,450
Guys, I have morning classes.

277
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,840
- See you later.
- Hey, I'm going, too.

278
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,705
- I have a thing to get to.
- You guys have classes?

279
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:39,685
Yes.

280
00:19:39,685 --> 00:19:45,580
I'm glad all familiar faces get to stay together.

281
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,595
Yes.

282
00:19:46,595 --> 00:19:47,900
I'm taking off now.

283
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,195
See you, Kluen.

284
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:50,250
See you.

285
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,250
Later.

286
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,755
Have you been well?

287
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,261
So do we know each other?

288
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,010
Asshole.

289
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,410
- So, Kluen...
- Yes, Gia?

290
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,290
Flat tires?

291
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,699
But you said you had a bunch of men who wanted to drive you.

292
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,165
All right. Bye bye.

293
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:57,680
Was that Gia?

294
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,724
You guys seem to get along well.

295
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:02,295
You've been together for so long.

296
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:06,265
Didn't someone overseas warn you it's rude to listen in on people's phone conversations?

297
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,290
Kluen, you asshole! Ouch!

298
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:15,485
Goddamn it. Did my head crack?

299
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,080
You're fine.

300
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,854
Don't be such a baby.

301
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,746
How about you hit your head and see?

302
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:46,410
Keep the room tidy.

303
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,032
I don't like messes.

304
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,650
♫ And this heart of mine that has been wavering for a long time  ♫

305
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,230
♫ For so long. What should I do? ♫

306
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,990
You've spent the night with your old love.

307
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,710
You look lively.

308
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,020
I'll smack you in the face.

309
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:31,040
Kluen is bugging me every step of the way.

310
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,990
So annoying.

311
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,840
Annoying or because you like him?

312
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,855
Are you still pretending you don't know him?

313
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:44,005
Because I pretended not to know him, he keeps bugging me.

314
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:47,285
What if he suddenly talks about the confession you made?

315
00:22:47,285 --> 00:22:49,407
What will you do, Ai Nuea?

316
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,235
He won't say it.

317
00:22:52,235 --> 00:22:55,355
I can't be the only one bothered by this.

318
00:22:55,355 --> 00:22:58,430
Kluen must feel uncomfortable, too.

319
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,090
Forget it. It has been a long time ago.

320
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,710
It was just a teen's puppy love. Nobody cares.

321
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,740
- Puppy love, huh?
- Yes, puppy love.

322
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,463
It's just been a year.

323
00:23:09,463 --> 00:23:12,348
I won't call it "long."

324
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:15,320
I do call it "long." Do you have a problem?

325
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,925
Don't be angry.

326
00:23:16,925 --> 00:23:19,140
I'm your friend.

327
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,070
Hi, Guys. Get your assigned sheets out.

328
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,795
How much do gardeners get paid again?

329
00:23:30,795 --> 00:23:32,443
You just need to water a single plant,

330
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:35,128
so you can't call yourself a gardener.

331
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,533
Don't blame me if it dies. I told you I had a black thumb.

332
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:43,525
If it dies, I can always get a replacement.

333
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:45,810
Just don't break its pot.

334
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,340
I know it's your precious thing.

335
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,870
Bye now. I'm meeting my friends.

336
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,275
Bye.

337
00:23:55,075 --> 00:23:58,165
What are you looking at? I just got here.

338
00:23:58,165 --> 00:24:00,625
I didn't eavesdrop. I didn't hear anything.

339
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,940
Don't condemn me with your eyes.

340
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,333
German education taught me well

341
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:07,330
that it's rude to listen in on people's conversations.

342
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,953
What are you saying? I'm not condemning you.

343
00:24:09,953 --> 00:24:13,160
Your eyes say otherwise.

344
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,760
Bye.

345
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,245
Why are you following me?

346
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:21,505
Where are you going?

347
00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:23,330
The Freshy Boys camp and you know it.

348
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,510
Yes, I know it.

349
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,270
Then why are you still following me?

350
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,597
I'm headed there, too.

351
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:30,810
Well, let's go together then.

352
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:42,225
Have you figured out what you are going to do for the talent show?

353
00:24:42,225 --> 00:24:43,460
Not yet.

354
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,475
Can I just draw? I don't have any other talents.

355
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:50,095
You're good. You can draw.

356
00:24:50,095 --> 00:24:51,405
No doubt.

357
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:54,050
He's from the Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts, you dumbass.

358
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,095
Stop flirting around.

359
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,340
He's a friend.

360
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,400
Phoon, what's your talent show?

361
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,635
I'm thinking of singing and playing guitar.

362
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:06,615
What a classic hero.

363
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,865
Which song will you be singing?

364
00:25:13,865 --> 00:25:15,565
I don't know yet.

365
00:25:15,565 --> 00:25:17,675
Which song do you want to hear?

366
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:19,679
Then I can sing that song.

367
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,580
See? Ai Phoon is being flirty, too,

368
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,103
so why don't you yell at him?

369
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:26,890
I don't want to brag.

370
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,835
But I was my high school representative, competing in many contests.

371
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,250
What about you, Kluen?

372
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,180
Any exciting high school experience to brag about?

373
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,830
Or were you just effortlessly popular?

374
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,330
I have some.

375
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,254
Someone confessed to me.

376
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:49,905
Damn. What a bragger.

377
00:25:49,905 --> 00:25:53,985
Guys, I'm going to use the bathroom.

378
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,920
What do you want?

379
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:15,535
What?

380
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,495
You keep bugging me; what do you want?

381
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:23,095
"Bugging you"?

382
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,920
What did I do?

383
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,676
I don't want us to be awkward when we're together.

384
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:33,750
Can you stop mentioning that, please?

385
00:26:47,485 --> 00:26:48,970
Here he comes.

386
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,418
Daonuea, Honey.

387
00:26:50,418 --> 00:26:54,403
We need a little promo video from you.

388
00:26:54,403 --> 00:26:57,150
- Sure.
- Come on.

389
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:00,808
We have some questions for you.

390
00:27:00,808 --> 00:27:03,693
Please try to answer them quickly.

391
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,950
[Mentor]

392
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,375
Why do you look so furious?

393
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,715
Smile. This is your first promo video.

394
00:27:12,635 --> 00:27:14,295
Are you ready? Are you okay?

395
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:16,815
Should I ask Khabkluen to do it first?

396
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:19,425
That's okay. I'll go first.

397
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:21,768
Okay then. 3, 2, 1.

398
00:27:21,768 --> 00:27:23,913
Please introduce yourself.

399
00:27:23,913 --> 00:27:26,690
Hi. I'm Daonuea.

400
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,390
[Mentor]

401
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:34,358
Do you want to know anything else about me?

402
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:36,000
Milk or coffee?

403
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,300
Milk.

404
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,090
Beaches or mountains?

405
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,440
Beaches. I can draw and paint beaches quite nicely.

406
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,420
Lime or vanilla ice cream?

407
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,320
Vanilla.

408
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,815
If you're hitting on someone, will you draw or sing for that person?

409
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:51,545
I'll definitely draw.

410
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:56,015
I tried once, but I failed.

411
00:27:56,015 --> 00:27:59,012
How do you address yourself when you're in a relationship?

412
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,105
Dao.

413
00:28:00,105 --> 00:28:04,063
Other people can't call me that. It's reserved for special ones only.

414
00:28:04,063 --> 00:28:05,245
And what will you call the other one?

415
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:10,420
By the nickname or whatever name I'm asked to.

416
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,600
When did you have your first love?

417
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,900
In tenth grade.

418
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,550
Will you approach or back off?

419
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,890
I will approach.

420
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,390
But if it doesn't work, I'll back off.

421
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,005
One sentence for the one.

422
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:25,745
Thank you for making me smile...

423
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,509
every time I think of you.

424
00:28:38,807 --> 00:28:41,785
Sorry. Did I keep you waiting?

425
00:28:46,477 --> 00:28:47,730
Wait up.

426
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,930
Where are you going? The car is parked over there.

427
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,780
Back to my dorm.

428
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,345
But you told me you wouldn't stay in.

429
00:28:54,345 --> 00:28:56,260
You said we would go out to party.

430
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,070
Loss of memory?

431
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,329
You know I remember everything.

432
00:29:02,952 --> 00:29:04,090
What the heck?

433
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,445
Can't you just say things that are easy to understand?

434
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,330
Have you seen the promo video?

435
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,432
It's freaking awesome!

436
00:29:14,432 --> 00:29:17,351
He's quiet. I don't think he has seen it.

437
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,426
What's going on?

438
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,300
That's what I thought.

439
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,112
Freshy Boys and Girls Contest promo video.

440
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:28,330
You know, Kluen gave the exact same answers as you.

441
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:31,826
Take a deep breath before you watch it, my friend.

442
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:37,905
Hi. I'm Khabkluen.

443
00:29:37,905 --> 00:29:39,545
Milk or coffee?

444
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:40,885
I don't like coffee.

445
00:29:40,885 --> 00:29:42,680
Beaches or mountains?

446
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,570
Beaches.

447
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,075
Lime or vanilla ice cream?

448
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,315
No lime ice cream.

449
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:52,100
If you're hitting on someone, will you draw or sing for that person?

450
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,765
I'll probably draw.

451
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:57,440
How do you address yourself when you're in a relationship?

452
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,140
Kluen.

453
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,537
Can we hear an example?

454
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,885
Kluen is sleepy.

455
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:07,170
And what will you call the other one?

456
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,820
By their nickname.

457
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,720
Your first love?

458
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,550
Not sure.

459
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,751
Will you approach or back off?

460
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,190
Depends on the situation.

461
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:22,665
What is your favorite thing you've said?

462
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:28,725
Shit!

463
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:30,035
I…

464
00:30:30,035 --> 00:30:32,680
I didn't mean to curse at you.

465
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,360
Are you checking out the popularity of your rival?

466
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,975
I'm not.

467
00:30:36,975 --> 00:30:39,620
So… have you watched my video?

468
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,070
I have.

469
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,190
Did I do well?

470
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,850
Of course, you did.

471
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,770
- Are you sure?
- I am.

472
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,435
Should we go grab a bite?

473
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:52,185
- I'm hungry.
- Where?

474
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,230
In front of the university.

475
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,030
Hi, Kluen.

476
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,575
Are you skipping practice?

477
00:30:58,575 --> 00:31:01,060
Do you want to grab something to eat?

478
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,910
Then we can go back to the dorm together.

479
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:07,510
Kluen, Nuea just watched your video.

480
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:11,720
I watched everybody's video.

481
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:16,505
I'm not going with you guys.

482
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:18,765
Why not?

483
00:31:18,765 --> 00:31:19,995
No reason.

484
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:22,678
See you at the dorm.

485
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:24,555
- All right.
- See you.

486
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,743
Let's go then.

487
00:31:32,743 --> 00:31:34,464
Come on, I'm hungry.

488
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,970
Kluen, where are you going?

489
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,870
It's this way.

490
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,873
I'm not hungry. You guys go ahead.

491
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,243
Hello, Sir.

492
00:32:20,243 --> 00:32:23,567
So? How is the on-campus dorm?

493
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,955
I've been staying here for almost a week,

494
00:32:26,955 --> 00:32:29,395
why did you call only now, Fah?

495
00:32:29,395 --> 00:32:34,680
If I can't stand it here, I'd be sleeping next to you by now.

496
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,210
Will you die if you stop messing with me, Dao?

497
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,290
I won't die, but I'll be half-dead.

498
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:46,145
I called to let you know I can go to your contest.

499
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:48,290
But you're such a pain,

500
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,530
so I changed my mind.

501
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,550
Hey, you can't.

502
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,632
Fah, if you don't come, I won't go up on the stage.

503
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:58,967
Talk to me nicely then.

504
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,300
Khun Fah,

505
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,965
I've been here for almost a week.

506
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:11,610
It's comfy here,

507
00:33:12,518 --> 00:33:16,170
but I can't help missing you, Fah.

508
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:19,100
Whenever I breathe in, breathe out,

509
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,445
your face always pops in my head.

510
00:33:22,445 --> 00:33:25,875
I want to see you every second.

511
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,190
If I don't get your support at the contest,

512
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,755
I'll be so miserable.

513
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,992
Are you happy now?

514
00:33:35,992 --> 00:33:38,760
Okay. See you.

515
00:33:41,365 --> 00:33:43,065
Shit!

516
00:33:47,245 --> 00:33:49,358
Put these in the bathroom.

517
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,710
Do it yourself.

518
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,970
What an ass.

520
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,680
Who copied you, Kluen?

521
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,275
I recorded it first. I couldn't possibly copy you.

522
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,280
But I thought of the answers first.

523
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,675
And who on earth could know what went through your head?

524
00:34:59,675 --> 00:35:02,010
You didn't even do your art homework.

525
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,842
You can't draw and use it to hit on people.

526
00:35:04,842 --> 00:35:05,945
Delete it.

527
00:35:05,945 --> 00:35:07,484
How did you know I didn't do my art homework?

528
00:35:07,484 --> 00:35:09,552
Because I did…

529
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,953
I'm going to bed. Do whatever you want.

530
00:35:13,953 --> 00:35:17,118
When my time comes, you're dead.

531
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:46,850
You two said absolutely the same things in the videos.

532
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:49,780
Right. I can't tell who copied whom.

533
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,110
I didn't copy his answers. I recorded the video first.

534
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,520
By the way, have you cleared things up with him?

535
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,670
What things?

536
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:02,020
Come on. About you confessing to him back then.

537
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,480
- Do I need to clear things up?
- Hell, yeah.

538
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,528
You share the same room with him every day, and you don't want to be uncomfortable and explode.

539
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,390
Hey, that's Kluen.

540
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,555
He's there.

541
00:36:14,555 --> 00:36:15,690
Go talk to him.

542
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,730
- Go ahead.
- Go on. Get it over with.

543
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,060
Trust me.

544
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,885
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

545
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:22,496
It will turn out great. Go now.

546
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:24,050
Get it off your chest. Go.

547
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:27,230
Once and for all. That's it.

548
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:30,567
- Hurry!
- Fine.

549
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:32,245
Go for it!

550
00:36:32,245 --> 00:36:34,045
You can do it.

551
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,100
Khabkluen.

552
00:36:47,235 --> 00:36:49,035
I'll see you later.

553
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,475
I have something to tell you.

554
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:07,695
What is it?

555
00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:09,915
I…

556
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,140
I could never get over my feelings for you.

557
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,795
I like you, Khabkluen.

558
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,210
I like you, too.

559
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,790
Just when he appears to be drowning, the waves wash him to shore.

560
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:05,420
He survives for a brief moment before the waves sweep him back into the ocean.

561
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:10,270
No matter how hard he tries, he'll never be able to swim well.

562
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:14,090
He can't even resist these little waves.

563
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,800
He just never can...

Hey, is that Ai Kluen?

566
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,155
Ai Kluen!

567
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:29,310
- Why are you calling him here?
- Come here, the two of you.

568

Kluen, you're now Nuea's roommate, right?

569
00:38:32,285 --> 00:38:33,965
How is he? Is he messy?

570
00:38:33,965 --> 00:38:36,185
A little. He also talks in his sleep.

571
00:38:36,185 --> 00:38:37,685
What?

572
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,965
What did I say in my sleep?

573
00:38:40,965 --> 00:38:43,490
- You said you liked…
- Nope!

574
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,880
I don't want to know anymore.

Can you help me find a birthday present for my mom?

00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,115
Should I draw her as a present?

Do you want to try it? I can teach you.
