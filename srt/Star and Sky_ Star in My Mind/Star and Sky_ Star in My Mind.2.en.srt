Khabkluen, I have something to tell you.

2
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:05,720
I like you.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,330
You met him already, didn't you?

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,200
I was shocked to see him at the Freshy Boys and Girls camp.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,586
Did my head crack?

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,143
How do you address yourself when you're in a relationship?

7
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,204
Dao.

8
00:00:19,204 --> 00:00:22,027
Other people can't call me that. It's reserved for special ones only.

9
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:24,785
- When did you have your first love?
- In tenth grade.

10
00:00:24,785 --> 00:00:26,180
I have something to tell you.

11
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,460
What is it?

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,240
I could never get over my feelings for you.

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,020
I like you.

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,963
Shit! Ouch!

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,790
What were you dreaming about?

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,426
Your lips were ugly.

17
00:00:54,426 --> 00:00:56,020
In my dream, I was kissing...

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,771
What was the dream again?

19
00:00:59,757 --> 00:01:02,740
Ting, how did you get in here? It's a boys' dormitory.

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,637
There's no more male-female differentiation. It's either good or bad now.

21
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:10,080
Stop with the wise words, Ting.

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,020
Act like a girl, will you?

23
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,020
It's as if our faculty has two Freshy Boys here.

24
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,827
You're grouchy like an old man. Go take a shower.

25
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:21,609
If you had woken up earlier, I wouldn't have had to come here.

26
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,260
Next time, give me a call.

27
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,560
Before you say that, check your phone, Mister.

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,400
How many missed calls do you have? I kept calling until my phone was about to burst into flames.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,000
Khabkluen, next time if he doesn't wake up, please wake him up.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,903
Hey! Are you still here?

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,900
Did he see me talk in my sleep?

32
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,500
No.

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,140
What a relief!

34
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,310
No doubt. Of course, he did. He slept next to you.

35
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,593
He probably saw more than I did.

36
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:05,453
I'll be waiting downstairs. Get yourself ready and hurry down.

37
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,740
Damn.

38
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,277
What's the matter?

39
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:20,937
You couldn't even concentrate in class.

40
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,086
Sigh one more time, and your lungs will run out of air.

41
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:34,490
I got a little something to think about.

42
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,190
Little something?

43
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,800
Hey! Is that Ai Kluen?

44
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,023
- Ai Kluen! Hey!
- Why are you calling him here?

45
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:49,396
Come here, the two of you. Sit here.

46
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:52,066
Have a seat.

47
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,600
Let me join you.

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,126
Hey, do you remember me?

49
00:02:58,126 --> 00:03:00,400
We went to the same high school.

50
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,593
I do.

51
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:05,073
I've seen you a lot, but never got a chance to say hi.

52
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:10,060
This is Pokpong, a friend of Nuea from Germany.

53
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,234
He must have been so fond of Nuea that he followed him back here.

54
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,780
What an overstatement.

55
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,600
As if I have a crush on him or something.

56
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,150
You nuthead.

57
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,526
Why did you ask him to join us? You're such an ass.

58
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,540
Kluen, you're now Nuea's roommate, right?

59
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,573
How is he? Is he messy?

60
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:35,360
A little.

61
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,226
When was I even messy?

62
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:43,230
- He also talks in his sleep.
- What?

63
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,730
I couldn't understand what he said, though.

64
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,380
Yet, for some messages, it's quite clear.

65
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,213
On my face too.

66
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,063
I'm going to get a drink.

67
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,726
Get us some napkins too.

68
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:04,580
Kluen, why are you walking away?

69
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,653
Finish talking.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,918
Can I get a cup of guava juice, please?

71
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,787
What did you hear me say in my sleep?

72
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,960
- How much?
- Kluen, don't ignore me.

73
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,360
Here.

74
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,260
What did I say in my sleep?

75
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,535
So you really want to know?

76
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,130
Yes.

77
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:42,233
- You said you liked…
- Nope!

78
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,308
I don't want to know anymore.

79
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:48,826

Guys, let's go grab something to eat this evening.

92

I already have plans.

00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,675
Aren't you going back to your condo this weekend?

94
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:06,588
I'm lazy. I don't want to pack.

95
00:06:06,588 --> 00:06:11,386
Besides, I'll be alone wherever I am anyway.

96
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:14,228
Pong, are you free this evening?

97
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:15,820
Sorry.

98
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,140
I'm going out of town with my family tomorrow.

99
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,366
So I need to go home and pack.

100
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:22,830
Okay.

101
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,300
My friends just love me very much.

102
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,460
I want to cry my heart out.

103
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,120
Don't be so dramatic. I know you can live alone.

104
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,300
Don't act like you know everything, Nay.

105
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,693
Hold on. On-campus dorms are said to be haunted by ghosts.

106
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:44,200
Shit! Pong, I tried my best to avoid that topic.

107
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,560
If you're not going to stay with me, shut up about it.

108
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,730
Be careful, though.

109
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,880
Someone might come "knock, knock, knock" on your door at night.

110
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,580
Whatever you are hearing, do not answer.

111
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,881
Shit.

112
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:58,640
Let's just go.

113
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,080
Good luck. I hope nothing happens to you.

114
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,593
Nuea, did your class just end?

115
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:15,240
The class ended a while ago, but...

116
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,440
I was so engaged in drawing that I lost track of time.

117
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,673
How are you going home?

118
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,080
I'm thinking of staying.

119
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,460
Why?

120
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,720
I'm too lazy to pack.

121
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,470
Plus, there's no one home.

122
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,107
If you're lonely, you can come over to my house.

123
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,040
No, not like that.

124
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,580
I mean, a lot of friends like to come to my house to party.

125
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,220
I'll invite you, too, next time.

126
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,620
Of course.

127
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,540
My dad is here.

128
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,380
I should go then.

129
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,280
Get home safe.

130

Hey. Did you just get back?

132
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,347
- Yes.
- Are you heading out now?

133
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:04,780
Should I wait so we can leave together?

134
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,253
I think I'll just stay here instead of going home.

135
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,876
- I will wash up and go to bed.
- What?

136

138
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,306
Are you sure you'll stay alone?

139
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:18,766

I can survive Saturday by myself.

142
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,740
Okay then.

143
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,514
See you. If there's anything, give me a call.

144

See you on Sunday.

145

Where is the food delivery pick-up spot?

147

May I ask where the food pick-up location for on-campus dorms is?

148
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,146
It's in front of the uni. The guards don't allow food delivery inside.

149
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:14,973

What's up, Future University Freshy Boy?

I don't think I'm available tomorrow.

Why not?

170
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:52,960
Will you be able to get a present for your mom in time, if not tomorrow?

171
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,460
I think I will.

And why can't you go tomorrow?

Okay. I understand.

175
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,086
I'll see you at your mom's birthday party then.

All right.

Didn't someone overseas teach you what fried rice looks like?

179

You're talking bad about my institute again.

- Eat.
- For me to eat?

It's from a street vendor.

186
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,860
The package is a little too nice for street vendors.

187
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,810

And Chicken Steak with Spicy Sauce.

Of course. Do you want your ice cream now?

- Yes, please.
- Right away.

Will you have ice cream before food?

No, but it comes with a coloring set. I want one.

When I was little, I painted the walls so much that my mom gave me hell,

348
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,020
but I didn't learn anything.

349
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:48,480
I got up in the middle of the night and finished the painting anyway.

350
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,393
After that, my mom came around and bought me lots of paint.

351

It shouldn't be too large, though. We don't have that much time.

No. I don't want to ruin it.

00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,829
- I have.
- What is it? Can you tell?

495
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,020
I can't.

496
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,320
I think I know. I saw it in your Close Friends on IG. Bye. I need to go pack.

497
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,140
Although they are from different institutes, they still meet up.

498
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,063
Look. He even walks her to the car.

499
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:41,883
Why doesn't he carry her already?

500
00:38:41,883 --> 00:38:45,275
I heard they've been together since high school.

501
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:48,030
Yes, they have.

502
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:52,215
Though they were in different classes, Kluen always carried the school bag for her.

503
00:38:52,215 --> 00:38:54,680
Girls in school were so jealous of her.

504
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,960
So that means you did know Khabkluen before, didn't you?

505
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,430
All right, Guys. Let's continue where we left off.

506
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,800
Come on.

507
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,620
The first pair, please walk forward. Stop at the marks.

508
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,973
Pose at the center of the stage.

509
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,730
Next pair, please. Let's continue smoothly. Step up.

510
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,960
Memorize your blocking. You need to follow it at the actual event.

511
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,593
Next pair, please.

512
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,030
Okay. Good.

513
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,626
The last pair, please.

514
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,038
Why is he walking like that?

515
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:54,907
Daonuea, be more confident and widen your steps.

516
00:39:54,907 --> 00:39:56,867
He needs to be trained a bit more.

517
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:58,950
That's okay.

518
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,400
Those of you who don't feel really confident, you can keep practicing.

519
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,766
Okay.

520
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:06,630
Just relax. Don't be nervous.

521
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,240
Look ahead. Focus on things in front of you.

522
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,340
Walk straight, slowly.

523
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,439
Don't be so stiff.

524
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,020
Let's do it again with faster pacing.

525
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,180
Relax.

526
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,250
That's it. Now, walk on. Chest up.

527
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:41,460
Better. Stop. Turn around.

528
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,500
You're doing it right. Let's try one more time.

529
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,950
Daonuea!

530
00:40:53,632 --> 00:40:56,332
Dao!

531
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,474
Are you all right, Dao?

532
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,311
Are you hurt?

533
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,820
Fah.

534
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,880
It's not because of embarrassment from his unrequited love.

535
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,040
He's afraid that he will be troubled...

536
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,410
knowing there is someone who likes him so much.

Nuea, what's your type?

539
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,460
A caring one.

540
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,880
An attentive one.

541
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,300
Hey, you don't have to. I'm okay.

542
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,500
Don't be stubborn.

543

Dao.

544
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,820
You should go sleep in your bed.

545

Daonuea.

546
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,680
Yes?

547
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,922
Do you still like me?

548
00:42:10,457 --> 00:42:11,560
Do you have some time?

549
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,320
Can you come choose the picture frame with me?

550

Here. It fits perfectly.

I'm nervous.

Hi, Son.

00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,360
Someone here wants to talk to you.
