I love Daonuea... so much.

I love you so much. I love you, Daonuea.

Dao, will you be my boyfriend?

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,960
Did you hear that? I heard someone say "boyfriend."

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,980
Daonuea is Khabkluen's boyfriend. Khabkluen is Daonuea's boyfriend.

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,300
How sweet.

00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,230
Can I please explain about Typhoon?

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,543
He called and explained everything. We should make time to clear things up with him.

10
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:37,951
I don't want to lose a good friend.

12

No. I have class after this.

00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,513
Actually, I just came to apologize.

17
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:11,220
I told you I can handle it. You can say it.

18
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,600
It's the choice I made. Don't feel bad.

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,760
I didn't go out with you just to hurt Khabkluen.

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,580
I don't know. I was to blame for playing with your feelings.

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,678
I must thank you...

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,290
for all the goodwill you had for me. I could really feel it.

23
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,440
Yes. I meant it when I said I could handle it.

24

25

Congratulations to you two. You've liked him for so long.

You knew?

27
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,740
Yes. I kind of connected the dots.

28
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,440
You said you liked someone a lot in high school.

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,913
When you looked at Ai Kluen, your eyes said it all.

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,650
Was it that obvious?

31
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,813
I also know that Ai Kluen loves you so much, too.

I'm okay.

As I said, I've been prepared.

35
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,040
I just wanted to try. In case I could win your heart.

36

The result isn't different from what I expected.

37
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,020
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,967
I really am.

39
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,404
I should go now. I have class.

Can we still be friends?

41
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:58,527
Of course. See you.

Ai Phoon said he was okay, but I don't think he is.

He says he is. We should trust him. Don't overthink it.

I was thinking of someone who did art assignments for me.

It had nothing to do with that. It's true that I broke up with Georgia

after you confessed to me.

was she so upset?

102
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,526
A little, I guess.

103
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,130
It was probably that I said it directly.

104
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,383
I didn't hesitate. I didn't spare her feelings.

105
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,720
I guess she cried because she was in shock.

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,080
♫ If you're the sky ♫

167
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,460
♫ Let me be the North Star ♫

168
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,610
♫ To guide your heart ♫

169
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:22,860
♫ To be next to mine, like the sky and starlight ♫

170
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:39,020
P'Fah isn't that bad.

171
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes.

172
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,568
As they say, it takes one to know one.

173
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,196
Actually, you and Fah have many things in common.

174
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,353
You're both tight-lipped, spoiled, and you two like to make stoic faces.

175
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:01,369
Are hot people like that?

176
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:05,195
There's one thing dissimilar.

177
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:06,343
What?

178
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:08,963
I'm way hotter.

179
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:10,350
Yuck.

180
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,350
Do you disagree?

181
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,986
But there's one thing we have so much in common.

182
00:14:18,986 --> 00:14:20,486
What?

183
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,066
We both love Daonuea so much.

184
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,006
I'm going to sleep now.

185
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,020
Dao.

186
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,560
Turn this way.

187
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,720
Good night.

188
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,920
Dao. Dao.

189
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,153
Aren't you going to give me a goodnight kiss?

190
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,893
Hey.

191
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:48,170
Are you not in a hurry today, Mr. Daonuea?

192
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,694
Usually, I always see you go home with a Dentistry student.

193
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:54,720
The Dentistry student has an exam today.

194
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,360
I'm actually waiting for him.

195
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,760
Just what I thought.

196
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,720
Otherwise, you won't be sitting here.

197
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,240
I envy people who are in love.

198
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,660
I do, too.

199
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,030
Find one for yourself so you can stop being envious.

200
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,053
Wait a minute.

201
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,720
You two should be together.

202
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,280
Since no one wants to take you guys anyway.

203
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,780
Yuck!

204
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,120
Don't make me puke.

205
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,430
It's a waste of food I just ate.

206
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:26,650
Is P'Fah okay with you spending time at Ai Kluen's place?

207
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,730
He is okay with Kluen now.

208
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,053
Although he acts like an upset brother sometimes,

209
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:33,440
it's all good.

210
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,466
Doesn't he have a girlfriend?

211
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,870
He did.

212
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,090
But they broke up.

213
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,666
He's still hurt.

214
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,160
Shit!

215
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,650
Someone like him gets hurt by love, too?

216
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,100
He's such a player.

217
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,486
He became one because he's hurt.

218
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,960
I heard she is getting married.

219
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,660
How's it going, Ai Fah?

220
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,557
Long time no see. How have you been?

221
00:17:04,906 --> 00:17:10,300
How are you, Fah? This is our wedding invitation.

222
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,188
Congratulations, May.

223
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:36,594
It would be great if you could come.

224
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,313
Of course. I'll try to make it no matter what.

225
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,353
Would you please excuse me?

226
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,010
Fah is miserable.

227
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,560
Oh my!

228
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,146
Her new boyfriend is also their friend.

229
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:04,580
This is insane.

230
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,500
Fah blames himself for not having had time for her.

231
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,940
He was serious with her.

232
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,620
He even mentioned to me his marriage plan.

233
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,940
Whatever.

234
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,740
They're over.

235
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,270
Guys, Ai Kluen is here.

236
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,220
Will you excuse me now?

237
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,973
I knew it.

238
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:35,826
Now you hurry.

239
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,180
Are you tired today?

240
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,166
I'm not that tired.

241
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,966
I can drive.

242
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,520
It's okay. We will take turns.

243
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,986
What should we have for dinner?

244
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:01,660
It's your call.

245
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,050
My call it is.

246
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,480
Here. Let me help.

247
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,940
Okay. I'll get the door for you then.

248
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,440
Of course.

249
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,273
Please, Khun Kluen.

250
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,913
How are you, Mr. Future Dentist?

251
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:31,783
How was the exam? Are you tired?

252
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:35,300
But it's Kluen I'm talking to here. It shouldn't be a problem, right?

253
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,453
The tiredness was gone once I saw my boyfriend's face.

254
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:42,081
I can drive. I'm not that tired.

255
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:47,295
You should have seen your face when you said that.

256
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,016
Here. Drink this and refresh yourself.

257
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,160
Thank you.

258
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,450
How is it?

259
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,080
Refreshing, isn't it?

260
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,870
You'll become a dentist one day.

261
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,417
You should take care of yourself, too.

262
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,756
Your health is also important.

263
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,230
What is it?

264
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:26,641
What flavor is it? Is it...

265
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:29,024
Isn't it the one you drink regularly?

266
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:31,565
Or did I buy the wrong bottle?

267
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,800
Smells good.

268
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,802
Do you mean the drink?

269
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,660
My boyfriend's cheek.

270
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,706
You must have spent time plotting that.

271
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,970
Next time, you can just ask nicely.

272
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,060
Really?

273
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,860
Try it.

274
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,560
Can I kiss your cheek?

275
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,723
What? I give you an inch, and you take a mile.

276
00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:18,826
Back to your seat.

277
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,266
What should we have for dinner?

278
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,710
Kluen?

279
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:04,320
Hey!

280
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,593
- What?
- Buy me dinner.

281
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:09,613
- What?
- Buy me dinner, please.

282
00:22:09,613 --> 00:22:11,862
Why would I do that?

283
00:22:11,862 --> 00:22:16,500
Because I'm broke. Pay for me, please. Please?

284
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,303
Hey.

285
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,913
[The dentist is knocked out.]

286
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,310
Ai Phoon.

287
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,710
Phoon. Hey!

288
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,650
Come on. I'm starving.

289
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,140
Yes, I'm coming.

290
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,910
Let's go.

291
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,360
Treat me, please.

292
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,900
Do you have warm clothes?

293
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,998
It's cold in Chiang Mai.

294
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:55,760
I'm well-prepared.

295
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,020
I remember I went there as a kid.

296
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,060
It's been a long time.

297
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,260
I'm excited.

298
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,360
Don't get too excited.

299
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,260
Here. Let me carry it for you.

300
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,920
Our friends are in the van.

301
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Come on.

302
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,213
Have we arrived?

303
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:35,013
Are you carsick?

304
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,766
No. I'm okay.

305
00:23:38,766 --> 00:23:41,673
Will you sleep on or get out and eat?

306
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,053
Eat. I'm starving.

307
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:48,290
Let's go then.

308
00:23:49,506 --> 00:23:51,710
Guys, wake up.

309
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,540
We're here.

310
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,146
Guys, let's go eat.

311
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,580
Who farted?

312
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:05,330
What did you do?

313
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,460
I did nothing. I just woke up.

314
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,200
Why don't you just poop already?

315
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,000
Come on.

316
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,446
Let's go.

317
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,573
Guys, this way.

318
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,433
Wow.

319
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:26,310
Have a seat.

320
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,786
They all look so good.

321
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,930
Oh right, this is Prince,

322
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,426
a friend of mine and Ai Kluen from a summer camp overseas.

323
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:44,890
Hello, everyone.

324
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,770
Make yourself at home. If there's anything you need, just let me know.

325
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,826
What a nice name.

326
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,730
Stop flirting around.

327
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,160
Don't mess with Prince if you want to stay alive.

328
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,153
Do you know who his parents are?

329
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,070
No.

330
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,560
I'm an ordinary guy.

331
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,200
Don't be humble.

332
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,646
The restaurant we're sitting in is his mom's. And…

333
00:25:11,646 --> 00:25:13,689
Stop it, Noel.

334
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,130
Let's eat.

335
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,226
After this meal, we will store the bags and rest at the hotel.

336
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,280
I'll take you guys to see the stars tonight.

337
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,950
Listen.

338
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,650
We will see the stars on a privately owned mountain.

339
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,126
You do have a private mountain?

340
00:25:39,126 --> 00:25:40,450
Who would have such a thing?

341
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,300
Noel doesn't make any sense.

342
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,532
Mountains aren't condos. We can't buy them.

343
00:25:46,532 --> 00:25:47,930
One more thing.

344
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:52,746
His dad closed the road up to the mountain just for us.

345
00:25:52,746 --> 00:25:54,730
No one else can use it.

346
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:58,735
I'm curious now. What's your family business?

347
00:25:58,735 --> 00:26:01,960
Just a normal business.

348
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,650
Noel is exaggerating. Don't mind him.

349
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:09,800
I'm also into business. Do you want a partner?

350
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,693
I don't really know much. Usually it's my dad who takes care of it.

351
00:26:12,693 --> 00:26:15,360
No. I mean a life partner.

352
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,003
Would you love... No. Would you like that?

353
00:26:20,928 --> 00:26:23,470
Eat.

354
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,626
Just eat.

355
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,880
Here.

356
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,053
Nay and Pokpong will have that room.

357
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,406
You again?

358
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,260
As if I'm not tired of you at all.

359
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,060
Damn it.

360
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,066
Noel and Typhoon, your room is this way.

361
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,280
Daonuea and Khabkluen will have this room.

362
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,800
Let's go.

363
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,946
Sean and Maitee, that way.

364
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:27,646
Tell me if you need anything.

365
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,360
I told you not to come if you can't handle it.

366
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,320
I'm okay now.

367
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,510
For real?

368
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,740
Yes.

369
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,760
Don't you know the phrase "move on?"

370
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,250
What's your "move on" like?

371
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,440
Like Michael Jackson's moonwalk.

372
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,170
You're crazy.

373
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,187
Just kidding. I really am fine.

374
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:54,420
I'm glad to hear that.

375
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,520
You'll surely find someone great.

376
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,703
I don't want that now. I need to focus on studying.

377
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:04,680
I'm afraid I won't have time for that person.

378
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,540
I want a long, happy relationship. I don't want a breakup.

379
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,350
Come on.

380
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:14,060
When the time comes, you'll meet someone who loves you for who you are.

381
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,440
You're good at talking, aren't you? Why don't you find one for yourself?

382
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,560
You just flirt around, not being serious.

383
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,266
I can't. I've never found the one.

384
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:28,110
But it's good as it is.

385
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,370
No commitment, no regrets.

386
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,340
I really want to see who can stop you, Ai Maitee.

387
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,790
Only the red light can stop me.

388
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:42,746
The room is fabulous and spacious. Come on.

389
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,700
I arrived this afternoon.

390
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,530
Okay. Glad to hear that.

391
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,690
Are you taking a flight back?

392
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,960
Yes.

393
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,040
Hey, Fah, can you pick me and Kluen up at the airport?

394
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,980
Sure. Dao, I have to go.

395
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,100
I have patients.

396
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,860
Oh, okay.

397
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,520
I'll get you gifts from here.

398
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,213
All right. Take care.

399
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,760
Your nose is red.

400
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,140
Well, it's cold.

401
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,213
Where is Ai Phoon anyway?

402
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,700
He rented a car and drove to the city.

403
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,860
I guess he'll crash there tonight.

404
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,980
What? We came as a group, and now he's a solo traveler.

405
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,080
You took forever in there.

406
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,380
And it stinks.

407
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,070
You're too much.

408
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,340
Why are you holding your nose?

409
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,520
I just pooped, all right?

410
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,180
I see we're all ready. We should get going now.

411
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,000
It's even colder up there. Take your warm clothes with you.

412
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,360
You drank a lot.

413
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,000
What?

414
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,500
The car is that way.

415
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,200
Okay.

416
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,340
Daonuea, someone is calling you.

417
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,453
Who is it, Prince?

418
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,640
Someone named Fah.

419
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,960
Can you please answer it for me?

420
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,759
He's my older brother. Tell him to wait a bit.

421
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:11,060
Okay.

422
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,707
Hello, Dao.

423
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:16,500
- I...
- I'm at May's wedding.

424
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,273
I'm going home.

425
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,140
I'll call you again when I get home.

426
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,070
Here.

427
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,980
What did you say, Fah?

428
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,890
I'm about to leave May's wedding.

429
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,406
Wow, Fah, you sound really drunk.

430
00:31:37,406 --> 00:31:40,500
Who's driving? Are you?

431
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,530
I can drive.

432
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,113
Ai Mesa and JJ passed out.

433
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:46,600
I'm the only one left.

434
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,400
Fine. Be careful then.

435
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,093
Let me know when you get home, okay?

436
00:31:52,838 --> 00:31:54,438
Yes.

437
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,320
Let's go. Our friends are waiting.

438
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,020
Damn, it's freezing.

439
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,178
Do you want to hug me?

440
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:12,740
That's okay.

441
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,500
We should have brought a tent to sleep in.

442
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,746
I freaking love the weather.

443
00:32:19,746 --> 00:32:23,920
Hey! We should play a fun game.

444
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,629
How about this? We go one by one.

445
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:32,620
"What was your first impression of each other?"

446
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,560
- Does it sound good?
- Okay.

447
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,949
Let's start with Maitee.

448
00:32:36,949 --> 00:32:40,180
He wasn't worth associating with. Annoying.

449
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,420
Hey, don't say that to your friend.

450
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,320
- Foul-mouthed.
- That's right.

451
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,580
He's a big talker like those internet trolls.

452
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,580
Stop right there.

453
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,726
Hold on.

454
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,740
You guys don't hate me, do you?

455
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,146
No.

456
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:01,520
Fine, then.

457
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,180
The next one.

458
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,880
Daonuea.

459
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,760
Daonuea?

460
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,140
I thought he was a good guy. Reliable.

461
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,290
That's my friend.

462
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,580
- After I got to know him—
- Hey!

463
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,666
Don't go beyond the question.

464
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:20,620
He seemed like he had walls.

465
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,806
Those walls are my friend here.

466
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,033
Let's move on to Kluen.

467
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:30,420
- I hated his guts since high school.
- Right.

468
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,040
Nuea always did assignments for him.

469
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,980
Weren't you curious who did them for you?

470
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,140
You got an A on everything, while you didn't even do them yourself.

471
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,380
- Weren't you curious at all?
- Weren't you?

472
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,913
I wasn't because I knew it was Dao.

473
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,128
And how did you feel?

474
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,820
Love.

475
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,520
Yuck!

476
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,013
Speaking of which,

477
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:59,060
I was always the one witnessing their moments.

478
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,700
They cuddled in the dorm room.

479
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,960
Hey, I didn't see anything.

480
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,160
He put his own flowers for the Popular Vote into Nuea's bucket.

481
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,566
Kluen, you gave me your flowers?

482
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:21,013
[Daonuea Wattana-wattanachot]

483
00:34:21,013 --> 00:34:24,213
Yes. I wanted you to win.

484
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,940
Win the Popular Vote title?

485
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,906
Win his heart!

486
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,728
Do you want to go see the stars?

487
00:34:37,728 --> 00:34:41,300
They're sneaking out, creating their moments again.

488
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,680
Let's go.

489
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,010
Can I join?

490
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,756
Why would you? Leave them be.

491
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,466
No?

492
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:51,973
Nuea, I want to join you!

493
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,380
Which one is the North Star?

494
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,426
This one.

495
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,500
- The brightest one, right?
- That's right.

496
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,160
You said the North Star never moves anywhere.

497
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,800
No matter which direction the earth rotates,

498
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,880
the North Star always shines in the same spot.

499
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,293
Do you remember that?

500
00:35:48,293 --> 00:35:49,820
Of course.

501
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,464
I remember everything.

502
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,298
From you sneaking and watching me play basketball,

503
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,020
[Sinrawee]

504
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,246
doing my assignments,

505
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,834
and asking me to write on your shirt with teary eyes.

506
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,766
Shut up about that.

507
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,500
At that moment,

508
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,300
I was so scared.

509
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,857
Scared of what?

510
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,359
Scared you wouldn't take it well.

511
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,533
Well... I don't know.

512
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:43,130
If I had confessed and you would have said yes,

513
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,216
I would have been happy.

514
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:49,373
If I had confessed and you would have yelled at me,

515
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,273
I would have run off to Germany, period.

516
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:03,373
I really didn't expect to see you again.

517
00:37:03,373 --> 00:37:06,393
I thought our paths wouldn't cross ever again.

518
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,980
- Do you remember this?
- What is it?

519
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,126
You know about this too?

520
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,326
Here, watch me.

521
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:31,000
Damn you, Nay!

522
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,013
If you're too afraid to say it, write on his picture instead.

523
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,900
I can't think of any other way. This is all I can think of, my friend.

524
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,833
Quickly. Before anyone sees it.

525
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,113
At that time, I happened to pass by.

526
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:51,020
I saw you two sneaking around, doing something to it, so I kept it.

527
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:56,453
[I like you.]

528
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,093
[Love.]

529
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,530
Kluen!

530
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,700
And…

531
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,200
What is this?

532
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,220
I wanted to give it to you before you went to Germany,

533
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,886
but didn't have the courage,

534
00:38:37,886 --> 00:38:39,786
so I kept it.

535
00:38:39,786 --> 00:38:43,226
I didn't think I would get a chance to give it to you.

536
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,520
Wow!

537
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,693
I feel bad...

538
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,846
for thinking it was a one-sided love all this time.

539
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,470
Please be with me for a long time, Daonuea.

Stop complaining.

00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,960
Are we home yet?

560
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,760
- Where are we?
- We just left the wedding. Can you wait?

561
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,360
What?

562
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,720
Can you drive faster? I want to go home.

563
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,010
Yes, I am.

564
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,206
You're such a slow driver.

565
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,300
Turn the temperature down. It's hot back here.

566
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,333
All right.

567
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,230
We're going so slow. When will I get home?

568
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:21,026
Can you guys be quiet? I need to concentrate.

569
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:23,820
Do you use your ears to drive or what?

570
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,540
Shit!

571
00:41:56,337 --> 00:41:58,640
Thank you for making me smile every day,

572
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,980
