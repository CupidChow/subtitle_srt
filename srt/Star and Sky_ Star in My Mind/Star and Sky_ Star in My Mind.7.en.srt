Khabkluen likes me.

2
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:07,533
He told me to open my heart to him only.

3
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:09,453
What did you do last night?

4
00:00:09,453 --> 00:00:11,160
I kissed with Ai Kluen.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,540
Yesterday, you two kissed.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,915
And today, you'll be going to his place.

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,670
Eat so you can take the medicine.

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,350
It's because of you...

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,180
that I got to know my own feelings.

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,980
I just don't get the relationship between you and Gia.

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,423
Are you guys like good friends?

12
00:00:28,423 --> 00:00:29,590
Hello, Gia.

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,270
Gia! Slow down.

14
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,670
I'll be right there.

15
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,120
Fah. I have a boyfriend.

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,620
So you spent one day taking care of him, and now you two are in a relationship?

17
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,770
No. It's Typhoon.

18
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,160
Ai Phoon. Can I have a talk with you?

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,060
I love Daonuea.

20
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,680
Kluen, don't!

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,160
I freaking hate people who use violence.

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,371
Nuea, can you please listen?

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,500
Shit! Hey! Nuea!

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,706
We should leave now.

25
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,965
- See you.
- Bye. See you.

26
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,881
Where is Daonuea?

27
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,053
He left.

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,050
I'll check on Ai Phoon.

29
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,990
I don't know where he went.

30
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,686
Hey. Slow down.

31
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,920
He said he hated me.

32
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,980
Do you really believe that?

33
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:54,875
I think you're the only one who can't tell how he truly feels.

34
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,648
Pull yourself together.

35
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,607
I love him.

36

I love him so damn much.

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,153
I know you two love each other.

38
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,020
Is it too late now... to tell him?

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,394
I didn't tell you directly before...

129
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,944
because I was afraid you would be hurt.

130
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:41,893
But now I know that not saying it to spare your feelings...

131
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,824
isn't the right way.

132

I am sorry.

133
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,759

What about the chance I asked from you?

137
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,990
I have someone I like already,

138
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,846
and I don't see how I can stop liking that person.

139
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:13,766
Perhaps… I might like him forever.

140
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:17,540
Can we be friends, Papang?

141
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,823
What the heck is going on?

142
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,540
I don't want to talk about it now.

143
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,220
Please understand.

144
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,710
Fine. Deal with your problem then.

145
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,937
I'll go check on her.

146

148
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,626
Do you think it's right to run away like this?

149
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,390
Why are you crying?

150
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,360
Are you crying because you're sad

151
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,853
or because you're angry at yourself for doing something you knew wouldn't work?

152
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,006
Can you tell?

153
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:26,733
Actually, everyone can.

154
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,493
Daonuea has always made it very clear.

155
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:33,620
I'm so pathetic.

156

Sit first.

157
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:47,320
Actually, it's not wrong to try doing something.

158
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,786
It's better than regretting it later for not trying at all.

159
00:12:51,786 --> 00:12:54,810
Are you saying...

160
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:00,130
that at least I tried...

161
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:03,202
although I knew it was impossible?

162
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:05,560
That's a nice way of putting it.

163
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,003
Actually, when we try doing something,

164
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,336
we want to accomplish it.

will you keep going?

167
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,000
It's a waste of time, right?

168
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,333
This isn't how pretty girls like us roll.

169
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,960
Actually, Ai Nuea is so-so.

170
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,110
He's not even handsome.

171
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,149
I'll introduce you to a new guy. You'll forget him for sure.

172
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:40,273
Ting-Ting.

173
00:13:40,273 --> 00:13:43,260
It's not that easy to forget someone.

174
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,673
Not easy doesn't mean it's not possible.

175
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,560
Let's go.

176
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,460
Going where?

177
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,245
An army marches on its stomach. Let's find something to eat first.

178
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:55,763
Then we will go check out some guys. Come on.

179
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:57,463
Stop crying.

180
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,270
See?

181
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:04,473
Rejecting or not saying anything,

182
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,280
none of them is good.

183
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,533
People just want to hear the answer in their favor.

184
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,560
Hey, relax.

185
00:14:24,354 --> 00:14:26,660
We're here for you.

186
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:32,559
I'm tired.

187
00:14:33,661 --> 00:14:36,577
I shouldn't have loved Ai Khabkluen.

188
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,380
I should have let it end after I confessed.

189
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,922
Ai Kluen shouldn't have come back into my life.

190
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,390
♫ I may seem like I do not care ♫

191
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:59,790
♫ Like a wave rolling into shore over and over again, just that and nothing else ♫

192
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:05,180
♫ But in my heart, there are many questions ♫

193
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:11,580
♫ What am I supposed to do when I see you? This feeling is too strong to hide ♫

194
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,600
Come on.

195
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,140
Just take it easy. Trust me.

196
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,206
Don't overthink it, all right?

197
00:15:19,206 --> 00:15:21,666
You still have us.

198
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,986
We're here for you.

199
00:15:23,986 --> 00:15:26,180
You'll get through it.

200
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:33,710
♫ Oh, my lovely star, do let me know ♫

201
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,170
♫ What am I supposed to do with my heart that’s so in love with you? ♫

202
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,649
Yes.

203
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:41,367
Okay.

204
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,307
Ai Kluen!

205
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,280
Damn you, Pong.

206
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,110
Don't speak his name right now.

207
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,920
You, hold it.

208
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,420
Look.

209
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,080
Ai Kluen shared your photo on his IG.

210
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,577
[The sunflowers and their planter finally met after two years.]

211
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:07,540
Can you water the flower for me?

212
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,060
This one?

213
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,480
It's the only one I have.

214
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,444
I've never had any other plant.

215
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,530
You're putting more effort in than in your own work.

216
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,330
Stay out of it.

217
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,106
Come on.

218
00:16:37,106 --> 00:16:40,517
When will you stop doing assignments for Ai Kluen?

219
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:44,710
How about you let him get an F? What is with him, though?

220
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:50,526
Isn't he curious why he gets marks while not doing his own work?

221
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:51,740
Nosy.

222
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,416
Fine. My bad.

223
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,744
Kluen is still keeping it.

224
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,480
I think it means something.

225
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,180
I don't think you're the only one who feels it.

226
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,820
I say Ai Kluen feels it, too.

227
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,280
I must go see Ai Kluen right now.

228
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,673
Daonuea, can I speak with you?

229
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:28,390
Kluen hasn't told you what happened, has he?

230
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,580
That's why things turned out this way.

231
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,280
No.

232
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,140
He didn't seem to want to tell.

233
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,623
So I didn't make him.

234
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,460
It's not like that.

235
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,773
I was the one who asked him not to tell anyone.

236
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:45,140
What do you mean?

237
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,900
Gia! Gia.

238
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:52,241
Are you okay?

239
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,690
Where the heck is he?

240
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,680
I got the phone and was going to call the police,

241
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,166
so he ran off.

242
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,854
Did you call the police?

243
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,993
I don't want to make my mom worried.

244
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:11,466
So you are going to let it go like this?

245
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,593
Are you going to let this happen again and get even hurt more?

246
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,203
What do you want to do now? Should I take you home?

247
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,866
No. I don't want Mom to see the bruise.

248
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:38,596
I don't want you to stay here alone.

249
00:18:38,596 --> 00:18:40,270
It's not safe.

250
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,940
Besides, I need to go back.

251
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,227
I can't keep you company.

252
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:47,509
What's the hurry?

253
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:49,775
I'm going back to Daonuea.

254
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,007
Did you leave Daonuea for me?

255
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,993
Did you tell him why?

256
00:18:58,993 --> 00:19:02,493
You asked me not to tell.

257
00:19:02,493 --> 00:19:04,553
Kluen!

258
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:14,118
I had no idea he was with you.

259
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:16,400
I had a fight with my partner.

260
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,850
It got a little physical.

261
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,012
Are you all right, Gia?

262
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:24,210
You two are just the same.

263
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,180
Stop putting others before yourself.

264
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,308
You're human. It's okay to be a little selfish sometimes.

265
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,760
Kluen and I really broke up. Like completely.

266
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,620
We will never be more than friends.

267
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,866
To be honest, we broke up because of you,

268
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,660
but you're not the third wheel or anything.

269
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,133
You made us realize what we had wasn't a romantic relationship.

270
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:53,630
Kluen and I grew up together.

271
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,880
We're close like brother and sister.

272
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,967
Do you get it?

273
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,600
- But…
- Hear me out.

274
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,900
Honestly, Kluen might be book-smart

275
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,486
but keep in mind, he's a real dumb-ass.

276
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,919
He has liked you for a long time now.

277
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,020
Who knows? He might have liked you not long after you liked him.

278
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,540
He just didn't say it.

279
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,800
He likes to keep his feelings to himself.

280
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:25,293
It's to the point where I even said that he should be alone for the rest of his life.

281
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:27,360
Until you came along, Daonuea.

282
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,100
You seem like a good match for Khabkluen.

283
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,768
What made you think so?

284
00:20:31,768 --> 00:20:35,545
Because you're the only one he's been waiting for.

285
00:20:35,545 --> 00:20:39,040
It can't be anyone else. Clear things up with him.

286
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,860
I don't want to be the problem while I've been trying to help.

287
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,320
It turns out I ruined it for you two.

288
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,980
I feel bad, you know?

289
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,930
Thank you, Gia.

290
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,120
You're so cool. Do you know that?

291
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,970
I know.

292
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,733
I'm done here. Now go hear Kluen's apology.

293
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,060
I won't let you do this, Khabkluen.

294
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,373
You might or might not know me,

295
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:28,800
but I'm leaving for Germany tonight to study.

296
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,493
So I'd like you to write…

297
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,080
[Good luck.]

298
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,770
Khabkluen,

299
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,559
I like you.

300
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:15,481
Have a safe flight.

301
00:25:07,665 --> 00:25:09,730
If I'd known you'd return my gift,

302
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,850
I wouldn't have done anything for you.

303
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,910
Daonuea.

304
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:27,143
Why did you call my name?

305
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,768
I am sorry.

306
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,386
Sorry for not explaining.

307
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,310
Sorry for being so bad at expressing myself, bad at talking...

308
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:46,445
And I'm sorry I didn't have the courage to say… love.

309
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,530
♫ If you’re scared, just hold my hand ♫

310
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:03,200
♫ No matter what obstacles we find ♫

311
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,860
I'm sorry.

312
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,544
If I had known that I would love you this much,

313
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,933
I would have said anything better than, "have a safe flight."

314
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,574
You can say it now.

315
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,660
I love Daonuea... so much.

316
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,962
I love you so much.

317
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:31,696
I love you, Daonuea.

318
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,586
I know. I know.

319
00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:40,210
I love you, Daonuea.

320
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,520
I know that.

321
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,013
Thank you for taking good care of my sunflower.

322
00:26:51,013 --> 00:26:52,710
You know?

323
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,366
When you didn't recognize it,

324
00:26:55,366 --> 00:26:57,791
I was really sad.

325
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:03,394
I didn't pay attention to every detail.

326
00:27:03,394 --> 00:27:07,000
All I knew was that I needed to do two art assignments at the same time.

327
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,180
One with my name on it,

328
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:14,106

who exactly Daonuea is with.

Although Typhoon deleted the photo, people still saw it.

I'll let Dao talk to Ai Phoon first. And we'll see.

495
00:39:54,063 --> 00:39:55,703
If that's what you want.

496
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:06,513
Thank you for all the goodwill you had for me.

497
00:40:06,513 --> 00:40:08,792
I could really feel it.

498
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:11,397
Congratulations to you two.

499
00:40:11,397 --> 00:40:13,952
I should go now. I have class.

500
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,580
I wish you a long and happy relationship.

501
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,380
Thanks.

502
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:29,660
♫ If you’re scared, just hold my hand ♫

503
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:34,380
♫ No matter what obstacles we find ♫

504
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,030
♫ Right beside you, I’ll stand ♫

505
00:40:38,037 --> 00:40:40,220
Love takes time.

506
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:44,800
And good things come to those who wait.

507
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:54,360
[Next Week]
Can I stay over tonight?

508
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,700
You and Fah have many things in common.

509
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,600
But there's one thing we have so much in common.

510
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,040
What?

511
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,564
We both love Daonuea so much.

512
00:41:04,227 --> 00:41:08,820
Oh, right, his is Prince, a friend of mine and Ai Kluen from a summer camp overseas.

513
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,726
After this meal, we will store the bags and rest at the hotel.

514
00:41:12,726 --> 00:41:14,420
I'll take you guys to see the stars tonight.

515
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,570
Which one is the North Star?

516
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,406
This one.

517
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,650
What is this?

518
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:30,050
I wanted to give it to you before you went to Germany, but I didn't have the courage.

519
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,780
Please be with me for a long time, Daonuea.

520
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:50,000
♫ Do you believe that there is still hope for your love? ♫

521
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,180
♫ Even in your dreams every night, love is still waiting for you to come ♫

522
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,350
♫ And change your dreams ♫

523
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:01,950
♫ So they can turn into reality ♫

524
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:06,130
♫ If you're the sea, I will be the sand ♫

525
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,950
♫ If you're the sky ♫

526
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:12,290
♫ Please let me be the North Star ♫

527
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:16,530
♫ To guide your heart ♫

528
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:22,840
♫ To be next to mine, like the sky and starlight ♫
