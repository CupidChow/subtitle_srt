00:14:00,027 --> 00:14:01,759
I know nothing.

168
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,860
About this,

169
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,490
I'm dumb, freaking dumb.

170
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,997
I'm so dumb that I hate myself for it.

171
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,180
You have ten minutes.

172
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,265
Say whatever you need to say.

173
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,580
Can I call Noel first?

174
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,580
I don't want to say anything stupid.

175
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,560
Just say whatever you want without caring

176
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,850
about other people or thinking for them.

177
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,946
Gia and I broke up in eleventh grade.

178
00:14:58,422 --> 00:15:02,866
Was I the reason you broke up with Gia?

179
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:06,080
Yes. You were.

180
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:09,969
But it wasn't your fault.

181
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,140
You just made me realize how I felt.

182
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,655
Though it was too late, at least I got to know.

183
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,890
Gia is a very important person to me.

184
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,040
We grew up together.

185
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,213
She's a girl I must look after.

186
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:31,967
That's what my mom said,

187
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:35,507
but we misinterpreted it.

188
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:38,240
We thought we needed to get together in order to take care of each other.

189
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,450
Though we've broken up,

190
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,577
we still look out for each other.

191
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,886
It's because of you...

192
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:50,186
that I got to know my own feelings.

193
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,444
Since when?

194
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,811
Can you water the flower for me?

195
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:06,260
What?

196
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,660
I'm sick and I haven't done it.

197
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,840
This one?

198
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,219
It's the only one I have.

199
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:31,389
I've never had any other plant.

200
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,400
I just don't get the relationship between you and Gia.

201
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,540
Are you guys like good friends?

202
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,397
Something like that.

203
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,486
Whenever she has something, she comes to me first.

204
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:58,780
Me, too.

205
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,963
We had been together for so long and know each other so well.

206
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:10,890
And what if you date someone?

207
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,520
Can your lover accept it?

208
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,553
That you're making time to take care of someone else?

209
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,660
There must be some adjusting.

210
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,360
Who in this conversation needs adjusting?

211
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,360
Hello, Gia. Gia!

212
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,200
Slow down.

213
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,920
I'll be right there.

214
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,960
Don't hang up, okay? Gia!

215
00:17:39,973 --> 00:17:41,833
Where are you going?

216
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,460
To Gia.

217
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,053
Should I come with you?

218
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:48,670
No. I can handle it.

219
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:53,453
Look at you all worried and hiding things from me.

220
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,180
It's hard to believe you two broke up.

221
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,950
Gia and I are just friends.

222
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:04,800
If Ai Nay or Ai Pong were in this situation, I swear I wouldn't act like you do now.

223
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,640
- That's different.
- How?

224
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,666
Explain it to me.

225
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,440
You said someone needed to adjust.

226
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,253
It's not you two, but it's me, right?

227
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,140
When will you stop being silent, Kluen?

228
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,143
Your silence makes me look irrational.

229
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,279
I don't want it to be like this.

230
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,635
What if I asked you to choose now?

231
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,343
This is going way too far.

232
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,800
Wait for me.

233
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,700
I'll come back to talk to you.

234
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:19,960
What's up?

235
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,365
Where are you? Let's go grab a bite.

236
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:25,123
Kluen's place.

237
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,874
Is something wrong?

238
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,274
Yes.

239
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,440
Should I come pick you up?

240
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,786
He told me to wait.

241
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,146
Did he say for how long?

242
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,060
No.

243
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,660
Should I keep you company?

244
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,659
If I don't know what I'm waiting for,

245
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,660
do I still need to keep waiting?

246
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,423
To answer that selfishly,

247
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:57,874
you don't need to wait and get out of there to see me now.

248
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,510
But if you need the real answer,

249
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,139
I would say you should wait.

250
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,700
Even I can wait.

251
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,500
I totally understood it when you said, you don't even know what you are waiting for.

252
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,137
Even so, you still want to wait, don't you?

253
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:17,770
Don't think you're the only one who's good at waiting.

254
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:22,626
Like right now... I'm still waiting to hear your answer from last night.

255
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:27,670
How obvious should I be for you to understand?

256
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,520
And how long will it take you to get out of there?

257
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,659
Gia! Slow down. I'll be right there.

258
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:37,473
Where are you going?

259
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:39,420
To Gia.

260
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,780
I'm leaving now.

261
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,780
Thanks for the exhortation.

262
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,190
Can I exchange your gratitude for something else?

263
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,523
Like what?

264
00:20:50,523 --> 00:20:52,560
Your answer about last night.

265
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,640
You're the greatest friend.

266
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,440
Wow!

267
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,693
Getting shot is less painful.

268
00:21:02,693 --> 00:21:04,990
Can you give me just one day?

269
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,992
What do you mean?

270
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:09,080
Can I have one day with you?

271
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:11,640
Please.

272
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,533
This isn't funny.

273
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:18,590
Do you think your joke will make me feel better?

274
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,230
I'm serious.

275
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,946
I know I have no chance,

276
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,580
but at least give me something to think about and make me smile.

277
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,350
How can you be so sure that after one day with me,

278
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,910
you will smile when you think about it?

279
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,249
I just want to take the risk.

280
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,040
Phoon, please don't do this.

281
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,770
Ever since I decided to love you,

282
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,710
I've been prepared for any regrets.

283
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,834
If that one day is good,

284
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:54,140
it's the reward for my effort.

285
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,393
If it's bad,

286
00:21:56,393 --> 00:21:58,873
I can deal with it just fine.

287
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,070
Can I have it?

288
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:10,714
I'll see you at my place in an hour.

289
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,350
Here.

290
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:25,411
You've come all the way to see me.

291
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,900
What is it?

292
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,300
Fah.

293
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:36,519
I have a boyfriend.

294
00:22:39,711 --> 00:22:41,751
This is big news.

295
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,140
Yes.

296
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:52,420
So you spent one day taking care of him, and now you two are in a relationship?

297
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,150
No.

298
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:58,720
It's Typhoon.

299
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,550
Typhoon?

300
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,970
What is going on, Dao?

301
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,870
It will be over in 21 hours from now.

302
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,190
In 21 hours?

303
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,869
Dao, what are you playing at?

304
00:23:15,986 --> 00:23:20,178
Dao. What exactly happened?

305
00:23:20,178 --> 00:23:22,206
Can you tell me?

306
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,050
I'm not judging you here.

307
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:34,466
But please think it through when you do something.

308
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:36,118
And what you are doing now,

309
00:23:36,118 --> 00:23:40,514
you're not going out with Typhoon just to hurt Khabkluen, are you?

310
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,546
Seems like it, right?

311
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:50,253
I don't mean it to appear that way.

312
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,934
It's what Phoon asked from me.

313
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,746
He wants something to reminisce about and smile with it.

314
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,180
Can it really make him smile, though?

315
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,473
I said that, too,

316
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:12,570
but… he insisted.

317
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,120
Can you still fix anything now?

318
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,873
Those 20 hours… might be too long.

319
00:24:30,873 --> 00:24:35,326

If you don't delete it, just leave.

334

Okay, okay. I'm deleting it right now.

Okay. I'll be right down.

00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,080
How did it go?

340
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,340
Did you explain? Did Daonuea get you?

341
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,880
Daonuea is dating Ai Phoon now.

342

What? How come?

Everything is too late.

344

Whatever I do, I'm always one step behind.

345
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,146
I probably shouldn't be with anyone like Gia said.

346
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,120
The way I see it, Daonouea loves you, too, Kluen.

347
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,423
I guess he used to love me.

348
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,341
He doesn't need to wait for someone like me.

349
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:52,520
Actually, Ai Phoon is good.

350
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,487
A lot better than me.

351
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,560
Kluen, it isn't time to complain about life.

352
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,400
You said it yourself, you're always one step behind.

353
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,130
This time, how about you run?

354
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,869

You guys are misunderstanding.

Yes. I did it by mistake.

All right. I will explain everything tomorrow,

Hey! Grab a seat.

You don't have to invest so much into it, Ai Phoon.

The reason I take such good care is that I hope it can last longer than just one day.

Ai Daonuea doesn't like Phoon, does he?

401

Where are you going?

Because I love Daonuea, too.

But you win, Ai Kluen,

420
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,818
because Daonuea also loves you.

421
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,149
You don't need to compete with anyone.

422

Anybody can see that Daonuea likes you.

426
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,510
And you two have liked each other for a long time.

427

If you know it, then why are you dating him?

428
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:05,005
I guess I'm doing this to trigger Daonuea's feelings.

429
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,510
That answer makes me look cool rather than a loser.

430

Actually, I just wanted to try competing with you...

431

in case the referee could see how hard I tried.

432

But damn, it's useless.

433
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:28,401
Daonuea used to like me.

434
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,490
But now... he has probably changed his mind.

435

497
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,720
And why are you calling yourself "Kluen"?

498
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,498
I told you that I would call myself "Kluen" when I'm with my boyfriend.

499
00:37:57,498 --> 00:37:59,778
When did I become your boyfriend?

500
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,430
Right now.

501
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,410
Dao, will you be my boyfriend?

502
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,790
Did you hear that? I heard someone say "boyfriend."

503
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,614
Daonuea is Khabkluen's boyfriend.

504
00:38:11,614 --> 00:38:14,820
Khabkluen is Daonuea's boyfriend.

505
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,180
How sweet.

506
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,030
You're beaming.

507
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,580
You must love him very much.

508
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,320
Very much so.

509
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,800
Ai Kluen.

510
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,600
Hey.

511
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:39,290
♫ Do you believe that there is still hope for your love? ♫

512
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:44,490
♫ Even in your dreams every night, love is still waiting for you to come ♫

513
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,650
♫ And change your dreams ♫

514
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:51,330
♫ So they can turn into reality ♫

515
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,500
♫ If you're the sea, I will be the sand ♫

516
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,260
♫ If you're the sky ♫

517
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,720
♫ Please let me be the North Star ♫

518
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,920
♫ To guide your heart ♫

519
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,290
♫ To be next to mine, like the sky and starlight ♫
