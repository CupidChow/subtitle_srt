00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:33,560
So I really can't give an answer to this question...

168
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,590
because I don't date people based on their appearance or intelligence.

169
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,020
I will talk to the person first.

170
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,815
Whether the person is pretty or smart,

171
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:48,740
if we click, this person will be the one I choose.

172
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,490
Wow!

173
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,160
Nice one.

174
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,761
- That's my friend.
- My friend.

175
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:58,620
His answer just melted our hearts, didn't it?

176
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,110
Okay. Grab your flowers firmly, Guys,

177
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,560
because now the flower booths out front are all sold out.

178
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,260
Don't give all your hearts to Nong Daonuea yet because we still have one contestant left.

179
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,740
Please welcome Nong Khabkluen from The Faculty of Dentistry.

180
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:21,942
You got the last question. There's no need to choose.

181
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,390
Your question is...

182
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:32,110
What is the best thing you will do for someone who loves you and someone you love?

183
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,040
The best thing I'll do for someone who loves me

184
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,390
is to first find out whether I love the person or not.

185
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:50,140
If not, I will say directly that I don't...

186
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,240
because no one wants to get their hopes up.

187
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,160
And I'll always be thankful for the affection I get.

188
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,970
As for someone I love,

189
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:13,320
the best thing I will do is to promise to listen,

190
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,120
take care of them,

191
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,779
and always stay by their side.

192
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,310
I'll be honest about my feelings.

193
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,750
Though I'm not good at expressing them,

194
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:36,300
though the person still has no idea how much I feel,

195
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,330
my love will never stop.

196
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,870
Thank you.

197
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,180
What a heart-wrenching answer.

198
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:52,670
All right, everyone. The contest has come to an end.

199
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,910
Prepare to give the flowers to the one you like.

200
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:01,160
The contestant with the most roses will receive the Popular Vote title.

201
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,860
Step up front, everyone.

202
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,120
Thank you.

203
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,370
Thank you.

204
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,480
- Here.
- Fah,

205
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,380
will people think I'm buying the title?

206
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,830
Thank you.

207
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,020
Well, you are my kid. Of course, I'll help you at all costs.

208
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,540
Fah, stop playing around.

209
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,980
P'Kuafah, the former University Freshy Boy, is so hot.

210
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,840
He just sank all the ships.

211
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,660
KluenNuea and PhoonNuea don't stand a chance.

212
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,620
I can't let you lose, Baby.

213
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,710
Will you get serious?

214
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,630
Here, let me help.

215
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,630
Thank you.

216
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,970
If I had answered the question a bit better,

217
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,590
I would've been crowned instead since I'm as hot as Phoon.

218
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,630
When will you realize yourself, huh?

219
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:30,410
Congratulations to Khun Typhoon for The University Freshy Boy title.

220
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,150
Stop it, Guys.

221
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,240
You're making me blush.

222
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,870
I didn't think I would win.

223
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,060
Should we celebrate tonight?

224
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,990
I can't. My brother is waiting.

225
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,590
Brother, my ass.

226
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,147
Everyone knows. Don't try to hide it.

227
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:53,490
Know what?

228
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,850
Know that you're seeing Kuafah, the ex-University Freshy Boy.

229
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,800
If you're already taken, just tell us honestly,

230
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,743
and don't get my hopes up like this.

231
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:04,950
Wait a minute.

232
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,120
Before I make myself clear,

233
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,670
when did I ever give you hope, Maitee?

234
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,060
You nuthead.

235
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,840
Guys, Kuafah is my brother.

236
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,790
I can't date my brother, can I?

237
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,187
Don't lie.

238
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:24,500
You two have different last names.

239
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,600
You're denying it like most TV stars.

240
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,650
I'm so sad.

241
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,160
You, stop it.

242
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,130
Come on. Let's go get our stuff.

243
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,770
- Let's go.
- Come.

244
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,120
Come on, Maitee.

245
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,350
Yes, I'm almost there.

246
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,133
I'm taking the stairs. All right, okay.

247
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,540
I'm sorry.

248
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,360
- Thank you.
- Of course.

249
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,121
- Phoon, can I try that?
- It's mine.

250
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:14,470
Look at him. He is like Miss Thailand.

251
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,000
Let me try it.

252
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Stop playing around.

253
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,493
- I want to try it.
- Take it then.

254
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,380
- And you let him have it.
- So? Are you done here?

255
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,703
Oh, Fah! It's the right timing!

256
00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:28,090
Guys,

257
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,940
this is Kuafah, my older brother.

258
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,300
We don't share the same last name because we have different fathers but the same mother.

259
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,450
So he's your real brother?

260
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,910
Yes, he is.

261
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,420
- Hello.
- Hi.

262
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,000
Should we go now? We need to go get your things at the dorm.

263
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,500
Yes.

264
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,290
Are you moving out tonight?

265
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,360
Aren't you joining the party tonight?

266
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,870
I...

267
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,190
I think I should head back to my place.

268
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,700
I'll see you all later.

269
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,460
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.
- See you.

270
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,620
See you.

271
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,070
Everyone, please listen up.

272
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:14,080
After going through a long and tough event,

273
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,350
there's a surprise for you prepared by the mentors.

274
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:23,710
We will celebrate this event at the beach.

275
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,200
The beach!!!

276
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,010
Fah, can I go?

277
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,940
Can I stop you?

278
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,990
- Okay. Let's go now.
- Let's go.

279
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,690
Why are you fighting?

280
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,870
Here, give to me.

281
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,980
[Number of passenger seats: 20 seats]

282
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,360
Hey!

283
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,270
What are you doing? Why are you pushing me?

284
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,347
Why are you guys so hyped up?

285
00:21:09,347 --> 00:21:10,620
Kluen's House?

286
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,280
His mom just wants to tell the world whose resort this is.

287
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,160
Hold on. Is this Khabkluen's resort?

288
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,280
Did you really not know?

289
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,310
Everyone knows that Kluen lets us stay at his resort for free.

290
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,860
Are you gossiping about me?

291
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,240
What? No!

292
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,905
Get your bag inside.

293
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,550
Hey, Papang. Let me take care of that for you.

294
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,350
You can just go inside.

295
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,140
That's okay. I don't want to bother you.

296
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,850
It's nothing.

297
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,980
You can just walk inside.

298
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,910
Ai Nuea, what about mine?

299
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,730
Are you now not watching your language anymore, Miss Ting-Ting?

300
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,910
The contest is over. Politeness is no longer needed.

301
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:07,330
Well, impolite girl, how about you carry it yourself then?

302
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,223
What! Such double standards.

303
00:22:10,223 --> 00:22:12,237
My suitcase is big too.

304
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,180
Where's your generosity?

305
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,940
Ai Nuea!

306
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,320
Here.

307
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,830
Thank you, Nuea.

308
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,530
No problem.

309
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,380
Smile away.

310
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,760
So this is the face of the girl who said she would get over him.

311
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,410
Daonuea was being so nice to me.

312
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,660
Who can get over him now?

313
00:22:54,660 --> 00:23:00,510
I bet you're very happy to know P'Kuafah is Daonuea's brother.

314
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,010
How convenient.

315
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,810
I don't know.

316
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,660
I just want to try my best first.

317
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,889
That's the determination!

318
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,453
Give me the key.

319
00:23:10,453 --> 00:23:12,893
Let's get the suitcases inside.

320
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,380
Is this the place you asked me to come along to?

321
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:38,512
It's so beautiful.

322
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,040
I'll let my mom know that you like it.

323
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,110
Is your mom here, too?

324
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,620
I'm not sure if she's back yet.

325
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,380
She normally stays in the house at the back.

326
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,440
Does that mean this beach belongs to your family?

327
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,350
Yes.

328
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,095
It belongs to you, too.

329
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:02,595
Hello.

330
00:24:02,595 --> 00:24:05,410
Fah, I arrived.

331
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,310
It's gorgeous here, Fah.

332
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,184
I will talk to you later.

333
00:24:14,197 --> 00:24:16,205
What did you just say?

334
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,500
Nothing.

335
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,750
Ai Kluen, come here.

336
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,710
Hurry.

337
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,230
Let's go. Let's go play.

338
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,986
We're coming, too.

339
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,440
Quickly.

340
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,630
Come on.

341
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,720
Wow!

342
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,019
I've never seen such a beautiful beach like this before.

343
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,945
Are you taking a walk and not inviting me at all?

344
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,500
You like beaches, don't you?

345
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,260
You said it in the interview.

346
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,360
I do.

347
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,497
If I were Ai Kluen, I wouldn't go to Bangkok.

348
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:37,920
I'd just stick around and wake up to see the beach every day.

349
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,510
That can't be good.

350
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,220
If Kluen hadn't gone to Bangkok,

351
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,737
we wouldn't have met.

352
00:25:44,737 --> 00:25:47,720
What? What did you say?

353
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,360
Nothing. You're right.

354
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,030
If I had the beach all to myself, I would draw it every day.

355
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:59,058
Then your drawings would be just the same.

356
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,706
Wouldn't you get tired of it?

357
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:03,670
It wouldn't be the same.

358
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:09,330
The color of the sky and the sea changes every second. Did you know that?

359
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,980
And they will never be the same.

360
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,830
I guess I need to back off for Ai Typhoon.

361
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:23,460
He stepped up his game after knowing that Kuafah was Nuea's brother.

362
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,830
Look.

363
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:29,060
If Nuea didn't like him at all, he wouldn't be talking to him so sweetly like that.

364
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,820
Do you think Ai Nuea likes Phoon?

365
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,280
I don't know.

366
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,840
But they sat together on the bus.

367
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,670
They chose the beds next to each other.

368
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:45,050
I have a resort, too, but it's up on a mountain.

369
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,248
It's only a sea of mist up there. We don't have a sea like this.

370
00:26:48,248 --> 00:26:50,630
A sea of mist is pretty too,

371
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,660
but it's also cold.

372
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:56,717
Do you want to go there together?

373
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,325
Let's ask our friends to come along.

374
00:27:04,551 --> 00:27:08,680
Between a sea of mist and a sea like this one,

375
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,076
which one do you prefer?

376
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:13,205
I like a sea like this one.

377
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:25,365
- Hi, Kids.
- Hello.

378
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,950
How do you like the resort?

379
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,360
Your resort is so beautiful.

380
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,961
- Then you need to come often.
- Of course.

381
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:34,040
You're back, Mom.

382
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,470
Right.

383
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,580
Do you want anything in particular for dinner?

384
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,840
You can just let me know.

385
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,660
I will treat you all to a big banquet.

386
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:46,360
Oh, Khun Na, anything you make is for sure tasty.

387
00:27:49,487 --> 00:27:53,990
If you don't need anything here, I'll go check the kitchen.

388
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,060
Do you mind if I help?

389
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,835
Not at all.

390
00:27:57,835 --> 00:28:00,040
Hey, Ai Phoon, do you want to come?

391
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,010
I'll go get some drinks with Maitee.

392
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,912
Do you need anything?

393
00:28:03,912 --> 00:28:07,100
No, but be careful.

394
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,882
Come back quickly.

395
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,360
Roger that, Sir.

396
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,900
I'll come back as soon as I can.

397
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,500
Yes, Sir.

398
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,499
Come on. Let's go to the kitchen.

399
00:28:30,927 --> 00:28:34,337
Is there anything I can help you with here?

400
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,260
Here. I will steam them for you. They're fresh from the sea.

401
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,770
- Are these all we have?
- Yes.

402
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:51,140
They won't be enough for the kids.

403
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,680
Should I call Ai Phoon and tell him to buy more?

404
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,097
I'll go buy them.

405
00:28:56,097 --> 00:29:00,180
We need 8-9 more kilograms.

406
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,220
I'm cooking Steamed Prawns with Vermicelli and Steamed Salted Prawns.

407
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,947
I'll go with you.

408
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:08,147
That's fine.

409
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:13,590
Take Daonuea with you so he can keep you company.

410
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,530
If you want to come, then follow me.

411
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,324
I'll be right back.

412
00:29:22,275 --> 00:29:24,208
Wash them up nicely.

413
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,920
Ai Kluen, what's wrong with you?

414
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,420
Nothing.

415
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:34,018
Something is wrong.

416
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:36,250
You can't possibly know better than me.

417
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,690
Don't act like you know what I'm thinking.

418
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,220
Because there is no way you know.

419
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,201
Why are you raising your voice at me?

420
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,640
I'm sorry.

421
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,876
I have something to think about.

422
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,450
My bad.

423
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,170
Is there anything I can help you with?

424
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,980
That's all right.

425
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,700
I'm sorry about that.

426
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,920
Should we go?

427
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:22,060
Hey!

428
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,360
They sell turtles here too. Can we eat it?

429
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,760
- It's a horseshoe crab, not a turtle.
- Really?

430
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,960
Damn. It's still moving.

431
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,900
Which one do you want, this or this?

432
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,360
Can I have four kilograms of these?

433
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,980
And four more from this tray, please.

434
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,780
Hey.

435
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,090
Hello, Khabkluen.

436
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:50,440
♫ Do you believe that there is still hope for your love? ♫

437
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,620
There! A grouper. Let's take a look.

438
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,750
♫ And change your dreams ♫

439
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,170
♫ So they can turn into reality ♫

440
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,170
♫ If you were the sea, I would be the sand ♫

441
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,470
Hey! Ice cream.

442
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:13,130
A cup of vanilla ice cream, please.

443
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,880
Can you advance it?

444
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,250
I didn't bring my wallet.

445
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,419
If you want to see it, just ask.

446
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,200
Can I?

447
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,910
You can.

448
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,800
Try it.

449
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:46,680
Khabkluen, can I take a look at your picture, please?

450
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,030
[Khanaruj Wongthampanich]

451
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,930
Here. Watch me.

452
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,430
Damn you, Nay!

453
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:13,680
If you're too afraid to say it, write on his picture instead.

454
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:18,780
Are you out of your mind?

455
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,760
I'm so sick of hearing you simp over him.

456
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,880
If you want to express it, write it down.

457
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,350
Do it.

458
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,830
I can't think of any other way. This is all I can think of, my friend.

459
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,077
Quickly. Before anyone sees it.

460
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,020
Hey. Hey!

461
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,520
Daonuea.

462
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:42,290
Here. I don't want to see it anymore.

463
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,410
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

464
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,680
Your welcome.

465
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,440
Let's go. People are waiting.

466
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,630
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

467
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,280
Do you want to do it?

468
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,860
Yes.

469
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,940
But we don't have enough time, do we?

470
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:14,880
We still do.

471
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,480
Really?

472
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,420
Here you go.

473
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,190
- Thank you.
- Let me know when you're done.

474
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,450
What are you painting?

475
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,180
We're at the seaside. Of course, I'm painting the sea.

476
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,420
But don't worry. It will be done in no time.

477
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,710
Excuse me. It's done.

478
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,218
Let me take the frame off for you.

479
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,160
Did you know that I painted that shirt for you?

480
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,550
Why?

481
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,967
It's just a gift.

482
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:14,037
Besides, it features your name, Kluen (Waves).

483
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,240
Excuse me. Can I have another painting set, please?

484
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,240
Just one moment.

485
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,130
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

486
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,990
Here. This one is yours.

487
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:50,500
And this one... You painted it for me, right?

488
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,620
Yes.

489
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,840
Do you dare put it on right now?

490
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,640
If you wear it, I will also wear it.

491
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,350
If so, I'll wear it.

492
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,850
Let's do it.

493
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,140
- This is delicious.
- Really? I'll give it a try.

494
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,330
Why is it so hard to peel?

495
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:19,480
Here comes the soft-shell crab, Daonuea's favorite.

496
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,660
Thank you, Khun Na. I will eat them all.

497
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,140
If there is not enough, I will make more.

498
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,649
If there's anything you want, please let the staff know. Would you excuse me?

499
00:35:31,649 --> 00:35:34,210
Thank you. Of course.

500
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,044
Please enjoy. If you want more food, do tell me.

501
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,047
These are mouth-watering.

502
00:35:43,047 --> 00:35:46,077
You seem close to Kluen's mom.

503
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:50,740
I am. I met her once when I had dinner at Kluen's house.

504
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,290
You know, his mom reminded me so much of mine.

505
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,630
- She can be your mom.
- I don't mind.

506
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,130
She's your mom.

507
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,186
You gave her up so easily, like a crab leg.

508
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,620
Here comes more food.

509
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,180
- The soft-shell crab is so good.
- Yes.

510
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,030
It's my favorite.

511
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,200
Let me have some.

512
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,280
Hey. When did you two get changed?

513
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,444
Are these shirts from the same shop?

514
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,500
They look kind of similar.

515
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,740
They do.

516
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,760
Just eat. Eat!

517
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:38,400
Do it like this...

518
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,140
doing it back and forth...

519
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,890
Here. Eat more, Daonuea.

520
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,690
Thank you.

521
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,540
Cheers.

522
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,940
I'll get you drunk.

523
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,310
I'm not afraid, Sir.

524
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,250
What's going on here?

525
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,160
You two have been acting weird.

526
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,060
- Weird, how?
- Exactly, weird, how?

527
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,233
It's what people who are flirting do. It's normal.

528
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,400
Flirting, he said.

[Kuafah]

530
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,620
Guys, I need to take this call.

531
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:28,920
Are you blushing and walking away?

532
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,103
Blushing, my ass. My brother is calling.

533
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,440
Hey, Ai Phoon, I thought you were just playing around.

534
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,380
Are you serious?

535
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,980
Yes. Nuea and I are both single.

536
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,220
It's not wrong to hit on him.

537
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:53,540
When I am with him, I feel like I want to take care of him.

538
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,180
Why do I get the impression that Daonuea already has someone in his heart?

539
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,080
- Do you feel that, too?
- Papang.

540
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,850
When I ask him questions,

541
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:07,260
he becomes sad and avoids the topic.

542
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,010
I don't care.

543
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,460
If the person in his heart was truly good,

544
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,100
he wouldn't keep him waiting this long.

545
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,350
I will make Daonuea forget and start over with me.

546
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:22,300
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

547

Yes. I'll talk to you later, Fah.

549
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,920
Hey, Papang.

550
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,660
What are you doing here?

551
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,990
I came to see you.

552
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:57,120
To see me? What is it?

553
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,150
I don't know if you know this

554
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,956
or feel anything toward me at all.

555
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,790
I just want to tell you that

556
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:17,120
I like you very much, Nuea.

557
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,530
- Papang.
- Please don't say anything now.

558
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:28,191
I'm not here to force you and make you feel uncomfortable.

559
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:30,732
I'm only asking for a chance...

560
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,524
to love you.

561
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:39,785
I won't stop you...

562
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,996
if you want to love someone else,

563
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,489
but please don't turn me down just yet.

564
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,446
Give me a chance to love you, please.

565
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,510
Please.

566
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,653
Please, Daonuea.

567
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,400
What's the matter?

568
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,642
Can I ask you something?

569
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:54,856
If someone asks for a chance to love you...

570
00:40:56,357 --> 00:40:59,590
but you know you can never love that person,

571
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,785
how would you respond?

572
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,910
I would tell that person honestly.

573
00:41:12,751 --> 00:41:15,140
I can't.

574
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,630
I'm too afraid to say it directly.

575
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:23,129
Because I once was the one asking for a chance.

576
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,200
You know, an honest response people want to hear

577
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,430
turns out to be just a consolation.

578
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:42,920
They all want to hear an honest response

579
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,990
that meets their expectations.

580
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,471
Nobody likes to be rejected...

581
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,960
before they even start.

582
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,760
Nuea, are you okay?

583
00:41:57,637 --> 00:41:59,737
Not quite.

584
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,290
I shouldn't have told Papang that.

585
00:42:04,961 --> 00:42:06,600
What about your past?

586
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,940
You said you asked for a chance and you failed.

587
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,400
Does it still hurt you?

588
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,840
Well...

589
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,070
Yes.

There are things you can't undo.

591
00:42:31,278 --> 00:42:35,420
No matter how much you ponder them, it's pointless.

592

I've been carrying it with me for so long.

593

I don't know how to get it off my chest.

594
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,360
Give it here.

Your unhappiness. Give it to me.
