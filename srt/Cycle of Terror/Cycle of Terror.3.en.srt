1
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:05,600
You deserve it.

2
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:05,920
I'm here.

3
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,680
Hee-hee.

4
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,280
Hee-hee.

5
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,400
I bought you a new dress.

6
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,280
You little...

7
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,800
Hee-hee.

8
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,960
You didn't even answer.

9
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,880
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

10
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,880
Hee-hee.

11
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,800
Look at this beautiful dress.

12
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,160
What are you doing?

13
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,400
You cut such a nice dress like this.

14
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,360
Do you know

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,000
I asked someone to bring this dress back from abroad.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,640
Why are you so naughty?

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,040
Ah.

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,960
Get up get up

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,480
Scared. Does it hurt?

20
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,759
I don't like dolls.

21
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,800
I don't like skirts.

22
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,800
I like basketball.

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
What basketball?

24
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,079
Didn't I tell you?

25
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,079
to study hard.

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
What basketball?

27
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,079
Jung-hee.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,640
What's wrong?

29
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,360
Dormitory.

30
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,800
Time is half an hour earlier.

31
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,520
11:13.

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,760
It might be Ji Jinhee.

33
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,320
Hello?

34
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Where are you now?

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
I'm in the dorm.

36
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,560
It's half an hour earlier.

37
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,160
We have more time to stop the explosion.

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,200
Oh.

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,440
Okay. Let's talk in person.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,800
Okay.

41
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,880
Hey, Jun.

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,200
Are you going to eat in the canteen?

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,600
Yes. Do you want one?

44
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,800
I want one too.

45
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,640
Thank you.

46
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,720
I'll send you the money later.

47
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,760
Love you.

48
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,600
If the circulation can stop,

49
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,240
I'll bring you food.

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,000
Love you.

51
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,400
Why are you here so soon?

52
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,400
I happened to be nearby.

53
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,200
According to

54
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,240
from Editor Chen

55
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,800
and his chat history with the Psychology teacher.

56
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,400
I think

57
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,360
that scholar named Qin Ze seems very suspicious.

58
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,000
Qin Ze is a scholar.

59
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,920
Maybe he's also good at chemistry.

60
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,320
Hello, where are you?

61
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,240
Luo Yi and I are at the door of the dorm building.

62
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,560
Where are you? When will you arrive?

63
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,560
I'm stuck on the highway.

64
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,000
I can't go down in half an hour.

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,600
Okay.

66
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,160
Take care.

67
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,160
Luo Yi and I will go to the psychological consultation room

68
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,360
and ask about Qin Ze.

69
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,040
Okay.

70
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,360
Let's go.

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,520
Faster.

72
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,400
Faster.

73
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,160
No one is here.

74
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,000
Not many people come here at school.

75
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,920
I guess she went to eat.

76
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,880
The door is not locked.

77
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,280
Luo Yi.

78
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,400
I found him.

79
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,120
Looks like Qin Ze's situation

80
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,159
is completely different

81
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,080
in the elevator.

82
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,080
Qin Ze's pressure isn't from his studies.

83
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,880
but not his future life.

84
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,480
Because of his family,

85
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,840
after his parents passed away,

86
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,480
after their parents passed away.

87
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,440
We've been relying on government subsidies.

88
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,440
The school did pay a lot.

89
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,720
But his brother is still young.

90
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,880
he's still in primary school.

91
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,920
I can't stay in elementary school either.

92
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,080
I can only pick her up every day.

93
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,720
I've been taking him back and forth every day.

94
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,520
plus college life,

95
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,640
he barely had time to rest.

96
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,720
But he hasn't received

97
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,080
for a long time.

98
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,480
If it's because of this,

99
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,920
it's not impossible to think of destroying the elevator.

100
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,159
The tuition fee

101
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,760
The education department gave it to the school.

102
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,000
The teacher from the school sponsor center released it.

103
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,000
The school's sponsor center office is under renovation.

104
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,880
so I moved it to the media building.

105
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,520
So,

106
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,760
Qin Ze was probably going to the support center of the media building.

107
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,280
What's his purpose?

108
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,760
With all the information,

109
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,720
Qin Ze is likely to be the murderer now.

110
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,680
We need to find him and test him.

111
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,360
Okay.

112
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,440
This is Qin Ze's phone number I found online at school.

113
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,320
I'll call him now.

114
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,880
Okay.

115
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,360
Hello.

116
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,120
Hello, are you Qin Ze?

117
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,760
I'm a reporter from Advisor Media.

118
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,640
My name is Tang Xiao Zheng.

119
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,560
We're interviewing

120
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,360
of the scholarship.

121
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,120
I need to talk to you about something.

122
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,360
Are you free?

123
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,160
Okay.

124
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,920
I know.

125
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
I'll go find you.

126
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,560
Okay.

127
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,640
Qin Ze is working at a cafe outside the school gate.

128
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,800
We'll go there now.

129
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,040
Okay.

130
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:36,960
Hello.

131
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,760
Welcome.

132
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,360
What do you need?

133
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,960
A cappuccino, please.

134
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,960
Cappuccino.

135
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,320
Three or five?

136
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,120
Sanfen sugar.

137
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,640
Yes.

138
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
Okay, wait a moment.

139
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,120
Hello, welcome.

140
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,240
What do you need?

141
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Qin Ze.

142
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,160
Did you call me just now?

143
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,920
Yes.

144
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,440
Let's talk outside.

145
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,240
What do you want to know?

146
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
I have to work.

147
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,360
I may not have much time.

148
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,600
I heard you have a younger brother.

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,560
Do you live with him now?

150
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,040
Can you take care of him after you go to college?

151
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,000
I rented a single room near the school.

152
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,520
I brought him here

153
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,840
so I brought him here.

154
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,400
and asked him to study

155
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,840
in the west city.

156
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,520
My brother and I

157
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,640
And...

158
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,000
the rent

159
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,480
and daily expenses.

160
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,520
and daily expenses.

161
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
I can't get my scholarship back.

162
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,120
But I heard

163
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,920
because of a new policy.

164
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,920
The poor must stay in school.

165
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,720
A poor student?

166
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,000
If you don't stay in school,

167
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,560
I won't get any subsidies.

168
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,120
But I really can't live in school.

169
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,320
I have to take care of my brother.

170
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,080
What do you think about

171
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,160
what do you think?

172
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
I hope it can be released as soon as possible.

173
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,080
Sorry.

174
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,560
Hello

175
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,760
Yes

176
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,480
Your water, sir.

177
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,800
I don't think I can make it now.

178
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,200
Thank you.

179
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,960
Okay.

180
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,400
I'll be there as soon as possible.

181
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,760
Okay.

182
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,640
The teacher at the school sponsor center

183
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,000
He wants to ask me some questions about the scholarship.

184
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,680
If the school and the Education Bureau want to investigate my situation,

185
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,640
it should be easy to find out.

186
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,080
There's no need to ask again and again.

187
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,200
to expose people's scars, right?

188
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,240
If you have any questions,

189
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,800
you can go to my brother's school.

190
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,120
But please don't disturb him.

191
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,240
I have work to do.

192
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,640
Sorry.

193
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,520
Qin Ze went to the media building

194
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,000
because of the scholarship.

195
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,560
I don't think

196
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,240
he's not the culprit of the elevator explosion.

197
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,640
It's 12:20 now.

198
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,600
It's been over an hour.

199
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,880
We don't have much space to investigate.

200
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,040
We need to confirm Qin Ze's situation.

201
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,800
Why don't we split up?

202
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,680
I'll go to the media building to observe Qin Ze's movements.

203
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,920
Go to his brother's place and find out what's going on.

204
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,320
Qin Ze said his brother will return to the dorm he rented at noon.

205
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,840
There's a detailed address in the psychological consultation room.

206
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,200
I can take a look there.

207
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,200
There should be time.

208
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,560
Okay.

209
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,280
Take care.

210
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,400
You too.

211
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,960
Hello, Lu Zitired.

212
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,000
After you arrive at school,

213
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,560
go to the media building to meet Luo.

214
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,240
Okay.

215
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,360
Be careful.

216
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,360
Okay, bye.

217
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,520
Okay.

218
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,440
If Qin Ze is the murderer,

219
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,440
once there's a conflict,

220
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,560
we can at least defeat him.

221
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,640
Who is it?

222
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,360
Are you Qin Ze's brother, Qin Xiaofeng?

223
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,040
Who are you?

224
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Why haven't I seen you before?

225
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,760
I'm a reporter

226
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,200
who is investigating the drop of your brother's tutor.

227
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,560
I have some questions for you.

228
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,840
Wait a minute.

229
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,280
Hello, brother.

230
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,760
Not only does Qin Xiaofeng look like Qin Ze,

231
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
but also his personality.

232
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,760
He's very vigilant.

233
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,520
Come in.

234
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
Can I sit here?

235
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,600
Xiaofeng.

236
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,360
How is your brother?

237
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,000
Did you notice

238
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,120
he showed any unstable emotions?

239
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,040
My brother

240
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,760
has been busy lately.

241
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,960
Every time you cook for me,

242
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,960
after cooking for me.

243
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,840
Did you see

244
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,360
at home?

245
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,640
This is a single room.

246
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,760
It's only this big.

247
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,120
Is there anything that you can't see at a glance?

248
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,600
This...

249
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,040
Nothing strange.

250
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,640
Sister.

251
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,640
Do you think my brother did something bad?

252
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,760
What?

253
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,080
Sister.

254
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,280
My brother would never do anything bad.

255
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,960
He's a good man.

256
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,800
I think

257
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,920
Oppa has been busy recently

258
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,600
and anxious

259
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,760
I didn't get the tuition fee this semester.

260
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,000
It's all my fault.

261
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,400
If it weren't for me,

262
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,000
you wouldn't have suffered so much.

263
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,040
Xiaofeng.

264
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
It's not your fault.

265
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,920
You are my only family.

266
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,120
Of course he has to take care of you.

267
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,160
and protect you.

268
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,600
When you grow up,

269
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,640
when you grow up, right?

270
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,000
Don't worry.

271
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,520
I'll try to help your brother.

272
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,560
Here are your snacks.

273
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,560
Take it

274
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,560
No sister

275
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,160
Take it

276
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,800
I bought it for you.

277
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,760
A reward for you.

278
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,040
Does she really exist?

279
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
Or...

280
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,960
It's just my imagination.

281
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,680
What did I get?

282
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,440
What did I lose?

283
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,960
It's as if my life has lost its meaning.

284
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,280
My body is no longer important.

285
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,160
My brother

286
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,760
can't hold me back

287
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,160
My soul

288
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,640
will only be a gift for Lolimas.

289
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,480
Sister.

290
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
Is there anything else you want to ask me?

291
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,240
Oh.

292
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,720
No problem.

293
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,560
Today is your birthday.

294
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,520
You have classes in the afternoon.

295
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,080
Have a good rest at noon.

296
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,080
When I have time,

297
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,680
when I have time.

298
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,560
Bye.

299
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,840
There are only two minutes left before the elevator explosion.

300
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,640
It should be too late to meet Luo Yi and the others.

301
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,120
I wonder how they are doing.

302
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,480
Hey.

303
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,200
Did I hit your head with basketball before?

304
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,640
You only cared about Qin Ze.

305
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,600
and forgot Ji Jinxi.

306
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,920
I have something to ask you.

307
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,720
Just now...

308
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,080
Rorymars.

309
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,520
Her name?

310
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,040
In the novel,

311
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,840
in the movie.

312
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,400
Roris means a kind of rose.

313
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,160
means death.

314
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,040
So it's both for the wedding and for depression. [This is the reason why Roris Rose was used to miss death.]

315
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,560
Therefore, it's used for the wedding

316
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,640
It's a huge sadness.

317
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,600
A cracked wound.

318
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,000
Judging from this sentence,

319
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,760
Qin Ze has already thought of killing himself.

320
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,200
But he didn't write in the diary

321
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,960
he was afraid that his brother was in primary school.

322
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,240
He can read.

323
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,000
and discover your disappointment.

324
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,080
You've been staring at Qin Ze.

325
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,440
Did you notice anything unusual?

326
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,920
I've been with Qin Ze for a long time.

327
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,840
He went to the media building after working at the cafe.

328
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,120
Nothing was wrong during that time.

329
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,280
I didn't find

330
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,280
he did something strange to the elevator.

331
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,840
However,

332
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,680
Qin Ze went to the conference room

333
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,640
he went to the conference room on the first floor of the media building.

334
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,320
and stayed there for a few minutes.

335
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,320
I didn't follow him

336
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,400
I didn't follow him.

337
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,080
I don't know what he did inside.

338
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
After he left,

339
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,200
after he left.

340
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,160
but I found nothing.

341
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,440
Is he looking for someone in the meeting room?

342
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,080
or something?

343
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,000
You didn't see anything

344
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,480
because he took it.

345
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,680
Otherwise, he wouldn't have entered the conference room for no reason.

346
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,800
There must be something there.

347
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,600
Qin Ze is still in the cafe.

348
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,000
If there's really something in the conference room,

349
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,000
it might still be there.

350
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,480
Let's take a look.

351
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,000
Let's go.

352
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,720
Let's look around.

353
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,480
Luo Yi.

354
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,320
What did I get?

355
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,720
What did I lose?

356
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,920
My life is meaningless.

357
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,840
My body is no longer important.

358
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,280
No one can stop me from running towards death.

359
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,040
Qin Ze wrote this.

360
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,600
It's a suicide note.

361
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,840
Qin Ze wanted to commit suicide.

362
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,480
And he has some relevant knowledge.

363
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,040
Maybe

364
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,440
the breakthrough of the elevator is really with him.

365
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,320
We can look into Qin Ze.

366
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,840
But if it's a suicide note,

367
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,640
the handwriting doesn't look like it.

368
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,600
Hey.

369
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,440
What's going on?

370
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,680
Why do I keep going through the same thing?

371
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,600
Not only you,

372
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,200
We're all circulating.

373
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,480
What?

374
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,680
Because of the explosion in that elevator,

375
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,840
everyone who experienced the explosion in the elevator

376
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,240
can enter the circulation.

377
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,320
Elevator explosion.

378
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,560
Will we

379
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,560
be dead?

380
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,920
I never thought I was dead.

381
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,840
I'm still fighting for my destiny.

382
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,440
Hello?

383
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,400
I'm at the media building.

384
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,640
Where are you?

385
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,360
Oh.

386
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
The meeting room on the first floor.

387
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,760
Okay.

388
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,760
He's in the loop too.

389
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,800
Yes.

390
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,760
You know me?

391
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,240
Hum.

392
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,600
Yes.

393
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,800
You may not know me,

394
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,360
but I was in the elevator

395
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
I was in the elevator too.

396
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,360
My name is Lu Zitired.

397
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,120
The circulation is real.

398
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,160
When I first entered the circulation,

399
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,400
I only had 30 seconds.

400
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,040
The elevator door was closed.

401
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,920
Every time I woke up, I was already in the elevator.

402
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,720
So I had to escape.

403
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,160
Then it was the second and third time.

404
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,160
Until one time,

405
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,520
I accidentally led Lu Zitired out of the elevator

406
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,640
and dragged him into the circulation.

407
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,320
The time was only 30 minutes.

408
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,960
And Luo Yi.

409
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,560
Every time someone enters the circulation,

410
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,600
time will extend.

411
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,360
And every extended time is related to 30.

412
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,760
The first time is 30 seconds.

413
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,360
The second time is 30 minutes.

414
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,160
Every time after that is the same.

415
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,960
Now our question is

416
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,360
the melody we heard in the elevator.

417
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,600
The anonymous message that Editor Chen received

418
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,600
And Qin Ze.

419
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,800
If you ask me, it must be Qin Ze.

420
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,560
He's been in a bad mood for a long time.

421
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,040
It's highly possible that he did such a thing.

422
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,160
I went to his current place

423
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,200
I went to his current place.

424
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,160
and found nothing dangerous.

425
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,880
If we ask Qin Ze directly,

426
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,760
if we ask Qin Ze directly.

427
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,360
How can we let Qin Ze tell the truth voluntarily?

428
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,560
Maybe

429
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,920
in another way.

430
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,800
What would you like?

431
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,800
A cappuccino, please.

432
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,920
It's cold and hot.

433
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,800
Cold

434
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,600
26

435
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,360
Hello.

436
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,160
Welcome.

437
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,320
What would you like?

438
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,560
Two lattes.

439
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,280
Okay.

440
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,720
3% sugar, 5% sugar.

441
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,520
5% sugar.

442
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,160
Do you want ice?

443
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,520
Ice.

444
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,400
Okay.

445
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,120
44 in total.

446
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,920
Scan here.

447
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,120
Okay.

448
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,120
I heard

449
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,760
someone installed a bomb in the elevator in the media building.

450
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,880
Ah.

451
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,280
Really?

452
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,720
Someone installed a bomb in the elevator in the media building.

453
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,320
It must be a rumor.

454
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,600
Enjoy.

455
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,160
He's so cold.

456
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,520
He doesn't seem to know about the elevator explosion.

457
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,360
If he's really the culprit,

458
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,280
it would be too good to hide it.

459
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,560
Maybe

460
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,800
we went in the wrong direction from Editor Chen.

461
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,120
We investigated Qin Ze

462
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,720
because he has a tendency to commit suicide.

463
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,800
But he has a tendency to commit suicide.

464
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,320
doesn't mean he has antisocial personality.

465
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,360
Besides,

466
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,080
Qin Ze has a younger brother.

467
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,680
Even if he hates the school for not paying his tuition,

468
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,320
he doesn't have to blow up the elevator.

469
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,120
Yes.

470
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,920
Oh, and that will.

471
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,760
Yes.

472
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,520
Hey, waiter.

473
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,360
Why is there something dirty in your coffee?

474
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,120
Sorry.

475
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Where is the sorry?

476
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,000
Bing.

477
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,320
It seems that

478
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,560
The sugar hasn't melted, right?

479
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,480
Ah

480
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,160
I see.

481
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,160
I'm sorry.

482
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,360
I didn't see it clearly.

483
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,720
Ah.

484
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,880
It's okay.

485
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,320
Hey.

486
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,600
I spilled the sugar on the table.

487
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,920
Help me clean it up.

488
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,120
I'm sorry.

489
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,160
Okay.

490
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,680
I found a suicide note

491
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,320
I found a suicide note.

492
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,720
Who do you think wrote this?

493
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,680
A student from our school?

494
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,920
Is someone trying to commit suicide?

495
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,920
Hey,

496
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,280
Have you seen this suicide note?

497
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,520
Do you know who wrote it?

498
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,200
I don't know. I haven't seen it.

499
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,520
Qin Ze reacted to this letter.

500
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,920
Does Qin Ze really want to die?

501
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,520
to die?

502
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,040
Do you want Qin Xiaofeng

503
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,240
in this world?

504
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,400
You investigated me?

505
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,440
Have you ever thought

506
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,440
if you leave,

507
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,400
Qin Xiaofeng will be alone from now on.

508
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,160
Do you want him to experience

509
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,000
Do you want him to experience it again?
