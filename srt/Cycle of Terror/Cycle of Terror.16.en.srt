1
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,040
I'm not going there.

2
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,560
Ji Jinhee!

3
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,520
Calm down.

4
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,000
You can't take the money.

5
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,440
If you take it,

6
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,480
the president will fire me.

7
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,080
Hold on tight.

8
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,800
The accountant has transferred the money to your card.

9
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,680
That video...

10
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,640
What video?

11
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,800
I've never seen it.

12
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,120
We've never seen any videos.

13
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,320
Right?

14
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,400
Yes.

15
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,680
No.

16
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,040
Understand?

17
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Yes.

18
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,560
All the surveillance cameras

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,880
in the media building

20
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,720
are all broken these days.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's under repair.

22
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,400
Don't worry.

23
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,400
The hard disk has been replaced.

24
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,640
Okay.

25
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,080
I'll leave you to it.

26
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,080
My dad is saving people.

27
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,280
It's not what you reported.

28
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,080
Delete the video

29
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,440
and explain it to the netizens.

30
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,280
Go to the police if you have any questions.

31
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,720
How dare a murderer's child talk to me here?

32
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,640
Drag him away.

33
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,040
Why is this happening?

34
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,920
You said

35
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,920
we should just pretend that we don't know?

36
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,720
Why do you take it out of context?

37
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,880
Song Liang is dead.

38
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,640
In order to protect Ji Jinxi,

39
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,720
we chose to hide it.

40
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm already very upset.

41
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,480
Why did you hurt Song and his mother?

42
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,680
What's the difference

43
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
killing people?

44
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,320
It's already like this.

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,400
What's the point of telling me this now?

46
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,840
I didn't expect this to happen.

47
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
What should we do now?

48
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,120
We'll call the police.

49
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,920
Call the police.

50
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,720
Are you crazy?

51
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,240
You took the money.

52
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,040
Besides,

53
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,440
will Jo Jin spare us?

54
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,040
What about your future work?

55
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,400
As long as we don't say it,

56
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
it has nothing to do with us.

57
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,440
But if you tell the truth now,

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,680
troubles will come after you.

59
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,880
One after another.

60
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,560
The police will come for you.

61
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,240
The netizens are going to spray it on you.

62
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,800
The leaders will hate you.

63
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,120
In the end, we'll lose both money and money.

64
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,480
What should we do?

65
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,640
You're an adult.

66
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,680
Don't you know that?

67
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,320
But...

68
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,720
No buts.

69
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,520
Listen to me.

70
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,280
Stay safe.

71
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,800
I have a request.

72
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,320
Yes.

73
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,640
Give me the video of Song Liang

74
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,600
to me.

75
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,920
I didn't expect

76
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,440
before she saw the video,

77
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,040
before she saw the video.

78
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,080
I didn't expect

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,200
Because my secret

80
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,040
will be the last straw

81
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
who overwhelms him.

82
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,640
So,

83
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,960
there's no difference between us.

84
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,520
We're both murderers.

85
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,920
One is my best friend,

86
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,280
and my good friend.

87
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,400
Everyone is here today.

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,800
Great.

89
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,040
Hao Miao.

90
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,520
You're really alive.

91
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,600
I'm glad you're alive.

92
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,440
BA077.

93
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,240
It's good that you're alive.

94
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,200
You should live well.

95
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,640
I didn't expect

96
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,640
it's really you.

97
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,280
Circulation.

98
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,159
is also your fault.

99
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,280
What did I get?

100
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,080
What did I lose?

101
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,400
My life is meaningless.

102
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,440
My body is no longer important.

103
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,080
No one can stop the body running towards death.

104
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,120
Hao Miao.

105
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,920
Of course,

106
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,920
I have to drag you two together.

107
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,840
Why?

108
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,720
Didn't you say

109
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,640
Just pretend

110
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,280
just pretend not to know?

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,320
Why do you take it out of context?

112
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,520
Song Liang is dead.

113
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,039
In order to protect Ji Jinxi,

114
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,679
we chose to hide it.

115
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
I'm already very upset.

116
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,520
Why did you hurt Song and his mother?

117
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,000
What's the difference

118
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,440
killing people?

119
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,520
Things have come to this.

120
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,640
What's the point of telling me this now?

121
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,840
I didn't expect this to happen.

122
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,080
What should we do now?

123
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,000
We'll call the police.

124
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,840
Call the police.

125
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,560
Are you crazy?

126
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,080
You took the money.

127
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,400
A couple fell off the building yesterday noon.

128
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,200
Security Song Liang stole

129
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,800
stole 300,000 yuan from the construction workers.

130
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,640
After Xiao Meng found out,

131
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,920
the security guard pushed her down the building.

132
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,360
The moment she fell

133
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,080
Xiao Meng grabbed the security guard

134
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,760
In the end, they both died

135
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,400
I'm calling the police.

136
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,880
Someone jumped into the sea and committed suicide.

137
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,800
At this port,

138
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,920
the elevator will explode around 12:40.

139
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
I've decided.

140
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,720
I will announce that

141
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,200
I’ll announce it.

142
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,640
I don't want the money.

143
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,560
[I'll see you at 12:15 p.m.]

144
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,080
See you at the meeting room on the 10th floor.

145
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,800
Call everyone.

146
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,320
We can discuss the money later.

147
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,400
Hello?

148
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,360
Is it you?

149
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,720
What?

150
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,800
Did something happen?

151
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,880
Oh.

152
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,400
Nothing.

153
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,400
Have you arranged the interview at the Culture Palace

154
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,080
Come back for a meeting at noon.

155
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,200
Besides,

156
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,720
ask the part-time art editor Luo Yi

157
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,600
and ask him

158
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,920
to me at noon.

159
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
We have a meeting at 12:15 p.m.

160
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,400
Make sure to go to the conference room on the 10th floor of the media building on time.

161
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,960
Hand in the manuscript at noon.

162
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,120
Please.

163
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,120
Copy that.

164
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,840
[Come to my office at 12:45 p.m.]

165
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,760
Something urgent.

166
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:06,960
Okay.

167
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,840
BA.

168
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,760
BA003.

169
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,560
BA032.

170
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,120
Leonavo.

171
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,480
Leonavo

172
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,960
Leonavo

173
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:12,040
Leonavo

174
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,880
Leonavo.

175
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,560
BA032.

176
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,000
BA032.

177
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,320
Leonavo.

178
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,960
Lenov.

179
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,920
I'm fine.

180
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,880
I just feel a little dizzy.

181
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,840
Leonov.

182
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,240
Lenov.

183
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,960
Hey.

184
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,120
Are you okay?

185
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,800
Lenov.

186
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,720
I have something important to tell you.

187
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,720
I'm cleaning up your mess.

188
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,080
Stay quiet for a while.

189
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,600
No one can get out of the circle alive.

190
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
In the circulation,

191
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,880
I already killed you once.

192
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,240
But you're the one I want to kill more.

193
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,040
Ji Jinhee.

194
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,320
I didn’t expect

195
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,120
in order to save you,

196
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,520
to save you.

197
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,280
And Ji Jinhee was trying to kill all of you.

198
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,920
Isn't it ironic?

199
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,400
Then I realized

200
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,480
every time someone dies in a circle,

201
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,920
time will shorten.

202
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,800
Then this time,

203
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,520
the circulation should be over.

204
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,880
Hao Miao.

205
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,480
Song HaoMiao!

206
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,280
Stop!

207
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,160
Stay back!

208
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,360
One more step and I'll throw him down.

209
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,160
Song HaoMiao.

210
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,280
Please calm down.

211
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,320
The crowd outside is almost evacuated.

212
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,920
How is it?

213
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,400
Mac Book Pro.

214
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,320
Okay.

215
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,360
Why are firefighters here?

216
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,320
There's a safety cushion on on the floor.

217
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,920
Someone is on the rooftop.

218
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,600
He's on the rooftop now.

219
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Could it be...

220
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:18,920
Captain Xia.

221
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,960
The elevator bomb has been removed.

222
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,920
The sniper is in position.

223
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,600
Officer Xia.

224
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,480
I didn't expect you to be so fast.

225
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,680
But he must die.

226
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,120
Calm down.

227
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,600
The police have investigated

228
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,720
has been investigated.

229
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,760
Listen to me.

230
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,920
He will be punished by the law.

231
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,280
Justice?

232
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,800
Where is the evidence?

233
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,680
Song HaoMiao.

234
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,680
I have evidence.

235
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,520
Hey.

236
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,120
It's dangerous here.

237
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,480
Please leave the media building.

238
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,160
I'm his friend.

239
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,240
Let her come over.

240
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,680
Song HaoMiao.

241
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,840
I have a video of your father's fall.

242
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,360
Tang Xiaotong

243
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,480
I know you are trying to find the truth.

244
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,280
I told you to leave.

245
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,200
Why are you back?

246
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,720
You don't want to kill me,

247
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,680
including all the people

248
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,960
in the media building.

249
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,160
you don't want to kill them.

250
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,760
You just want them to see

251
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,520
how the murderer was killed by you.

252
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,200
You want them to live in shadows forever.

253
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,760
But you didn't expect

254
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,320
the four of us

255
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
entered the elevator with Ji Jinhee.

256
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,520
But you don’t want to miss

257
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,280
your carefully designed plan.

258
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,120
can only explode the elevator.

259
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,120
I want everyone to die with my dad.

260
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,720
It’s just Ji Jinhee.

261
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,120
He deserves to die more.

262
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,920
Song HaoMiao.

263
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,760
Calm down.

264
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,360
Your mom is waiting for you to come home.

265
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,920
Think about your mom.

266
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,880
She

267
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,800
waiting for her son to come home.

268
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,160
Can you bear to leave her alone?

269
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,120
Hao Miao.

270
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,120
I know.

271
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,120
You don't believe that I have evidence.

272
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,760
But you should know

273
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,720
I'm an intern reporter for the advisor.

274
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,600
Please give me five minutes.

275
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,480
I'll upload the video online.

276
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,480
I have 2 million fans.

277
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,920
The video will spread soon.

278
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,000
And I'll do a live broadcast.

279
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,120
If I can’t

280
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,120
in five minutes,

281
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,720
I’ll accept your punishment with Ji Jinhee.

282
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,040
Okay?

283
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,920
I'll start the live stream now.

284
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,400
The meaning of epiphyllum.

285
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,920
The beauty in that moment

286
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,680
is eternal.

287
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,240
The evil in that moment

288
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,320
is hell in a moment.

289
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,760
Tang Xiaotong, don't come over.

290
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,720
If you come any closer,

291
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,160
I'll throw it down.

292
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,080
I'm not going.

293
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,800
Ji Jinhee.

294
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Calm down.

295
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,080
You can't take the money.

296
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,520
If you take it,

297
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,600
the president's book will fire me.

298
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,280
If you have any difficulties,

299
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,600
just tell the president.

300
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,880
She will help you.

301
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,000
She's your mother.

302
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,040
Hello.

303
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,920
I'm an intern reporter

304
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,920
My name is Tang Xiao Zheng.

305
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,080
I believe you've seen

306
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,560
the video I just released.

307
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,720
This is the real truth

308
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,520
the truth of Song Liang’s fall.

309
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,480
Security Song Liang

310
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,320
He was obviously trying to save people.

311
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,000
but some bad self-media reported it as murder.

312
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:23,920
and even

313
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,680
he framed Song Liang, who risked his life to save him as a thief.

314
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,560
which made his wife and son

315
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,520
suffered endless cyber violence.

316
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,120
Behind it,

317
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,800
[behind it.]

318
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,720
We're waiting for the police's investigation.

319
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,800
One thought became a demon.

320
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,480
The evil in that moment

321
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,920
[is hell in an instant.]

322
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,520
If the boy in the video

323
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,880
could help

324
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,280
and save Song Liang and Xiao Meng

325
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,920
That will be another ending

326
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,960
At least,

327
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,960
what awaits him is not the punishment of law.

328
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,320
He becomes a devil in a blink of an eye.

329
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,520
In a moment,

330
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
is hell.

331
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,600
The Internet

332
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,320
has given us more channels to voice out.

333
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,520
In this age of self-media,

334
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,360
Internet information is diverse.

335
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,920
Of course it's also a mess.

336
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,000
Behind opposition and conflict,

337
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,080
there are chains of interests.

338
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,400
The creation direction of traffic

339
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,000
has also created a more distorted values.

340
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,960
or create rumors

341
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,320
or throwing cold arrows behind the Internet,

342
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,600
or even conduct a human search.

343
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,200
These are heavy weapons that constitute cyber violence soil.

344
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,200
If it's dispersed, it's not a threat.

345
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,600
When they gather, they will be powerful.

346
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,520
During the avalanche,

347
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,920
every snowflake doesn't think it's their responsibility.

348
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,640
However,

349
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,080
every snowflake

350
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,760
has gained power for that sin.

351
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,320
Self-media era.

352
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,920
It's the era where people get emotional easily.

353
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,200
Everyone has a microphone.

354
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,080
It's like a keyboard gives us a desperate power.

355
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,320
However,

356
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,080
everyone of us could be the spread of the rumors.

357
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,320
We could be involved in cyber violence.

358
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,960
So,

359
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,240
we need to observe more from a wider perspective.

360
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,320
Don't turn water into ice sword.

361
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,120
Jo Jin.

362
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,560
Please come with us.

363
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,920
Calvin.

364
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,720
Please come with us.

365
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,640
I got justice for you.

366
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,920
If there is a next life,

367
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,800
I don't want to become a demon.

368
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,560
Hold tight.

369
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,960
Hold tight.

370
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,280
Hurry up.

371
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,480
Help me save him.

372
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:06,760
LinA 301RV.

373
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,680
Number 23.

374
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,520
Hello?

375
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,080
I want to call the police.

376
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:46,840
Tang Xiaotong Li Xiyuan

377
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,440
Luo Yi, Xingze.

378
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:48,760
Lu Zitired, Thunderstorm.

379
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,040
Ji Jinxi, Miao Yaning.

380
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:49,680
Song HaoMiao Mo Qinyang

381
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,360
Editor Chen, Shen Bao Ping.

382
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:50,640
Zhao Zhen, Tian Miao.

383
