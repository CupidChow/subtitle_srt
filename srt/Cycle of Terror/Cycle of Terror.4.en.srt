1
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,680
Do you want Qin Xiaofeng

2
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,880
in this world?

3
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,040
You investigated me?

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,080
Have you ever thought

5
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,080
if you leave,

6
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,039
Qin Xiaofeng will be alone from now on.

7
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,800
Do you want him to experience

8
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,640
Do you want him to experience it again?

9
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,440
He's at home now.

10
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,600
He's waiting for you to celebrate his birthday.

11
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,039
Zheng.

12
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,880
Who are you?

13
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,039
What are you doing?

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,840
Did you write this suicide note?

15
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,920
No.

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,560
No.

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,680
But the content

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,840
is exactly the same as what you wrote in your diary.

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,440
Don't get me wrong.

20
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,720
I'm an intern reporter for the advisor.

21
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,560
My name is Tang

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,160
We're interviewing the progress of the scholarship.

23
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,280
Let's talk outside.

24
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,520
I'm not lying.

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,800
I didn't write this suicide note.

26
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,200
How did you know

27
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,400
at the meeting room?

28
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,960
Someone mentioned it by accident.

29
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,640
I thought

30
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,040
after work at noon.

31
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,680
A senior who graduated

32
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,440
She donated money to me

33
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,400
she donated money to me through school.

34
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm grateful to her.

35
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,240
So,

36
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,000
We kept in touch.

37
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,560
She used a nickname.

38
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,560
Her name is Sister Long Legs.

39
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,200
I was depressed at that time.

40
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,079
I wanted to talk to someone.

41
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,079
So after receiving the letter from the long-legged sister,

42
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,680
I sent her an email every two or three days.

43
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,200
Maybe she

44
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,760
doesn't want to expose her true identity.

45
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,640
That's why we've been texting each other.

46
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,600
We don't have any other contact information.

47
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,680
I don't know her real name either.

48
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,400
Once,

49
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,000
the long-legged lady said she was sad.

50
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,000
because she didn't save her friend who was disappointed.

51
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,399
Her friend also went to college in Lincheng.

52
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,560
She's about my age.

53
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,400
Then he met difficulties

54
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,440
and thought of dying.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I understand her.

56
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,160
So I want to do something

57
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,280
to help her.

58
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,440
Yesterday

59
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,200
The long-legged lady sent another email.

60
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,560
She said her friend will write a suicide note

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
on April 28th.

62
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,280
in the conference room on the first floor of the media building.

63
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,000
I wanted to go to the conference room

64
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,680
after work.

65
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,960
I didn't expect you to come earlier.

66
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,800
I'll take care of my own business.

67
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Don't worry.

68
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,200
Also,

69
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,280
I won't choose to die.

70
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
and cause trouble to the school.

71
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,960
I didn't know there was someone else behind this.

72
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,600
Sister long legs.

73
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,400
I did see this name

74
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,760
on Qin Ze's email.

75
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,240
Now I think it's weird

76
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,000
And how did she know

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,760
On April 28,

78
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,960
her friend hid her suicide note in the conference room.

79
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,240
To predict the future?

80
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,600
It's like the long-legged sister is also in the bad.

81
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,440
If that's the case,

82
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,400
how did she enter the circulation?

83
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,760
Is it related to the elevator explosion?

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
Or is there another way?

85
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,040
to enter the elevator.

86
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,280
Do you think what Qin Ze said is true?

87
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,000
I think this long-legged sister

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,640
is the key to solving the problem.

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,200
We have to find it first.

90
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,560
Luo.

91
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
What’s wrong?

92
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,200
Nothing.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,280
What did you just say?

94
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,800
Are you not feeling well?

95
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,760
I just came out of the cafe,

96
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,200
I thought something was wrong with you.

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,800
It's okay.

98
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,960
Maybe he's tired.

99
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,200
The donor Qin Ze mentioned just now

100
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,880
I suspect she has entered the circulation.

101
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,600
Sister long legs.

102
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,440
Since Qin Ze is the donor,

103
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,600
Since it's a donation,

104
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,400
you must pass the school.

105
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,600
There should be records in the school's sponsorship center.

106
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,960
I wonder how Ji Jinhee and Lu Zitired are doing.

107
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,400
We need to meet them first

108
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,880
and investigate it together.

109
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,680
Sister long legs.

110
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,240
Okay.

111
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,240
Let's go.

112
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,400
Tang Xiaotong

113
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,400
How's your investigation going?

114
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,920
Let's talk in the meeting room.

115
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,880
Okay.

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,920
We've investigated the release of Qin Ze's scholarship.

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,920
There's something wrong.

118
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,000
But this problem wasn't intentionally made things difficult for him.

119
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,080
It's because Qin Ze got the scholarship

120
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,640
because

121
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,840
someone helped him hide his immigration.

122
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,880
But then?

123
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,840
his classmates found him.

124
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,920
and reported him.

125
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,840
That's why he couldn't get a scholarship.

126
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,040
We need to review it.

127
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,680
The teacher in charge of the scholarship is Zhang Qunying.

128
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,120
Mr. Zhang has been sorting out the information for him.

129
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,920
to submit to the Education Bureau.

130
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,280
and give him a new scholarship.

131
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,120
If that's the case,

132
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,880
Qin Ze is less likely to be the murderer.

133
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,240
I have an idea.

134
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,960
Say it.

135
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,400
this long-legged lady

136
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,400
the person who wrote the suicide note?

137
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,200
Then she led Qin Ze here to look for his will.

138
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,640
How about this?

139
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,480
let's investigate

140
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,280
who has been sponsoring Qin Ze.

141
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,679
If she is the one who wrote this will,

142
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,280
we'll give up on Qin Ze.

143
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,680
We've confirmed that

144
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
Qin Ze is not the murderer of the elevator explosion.

145
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,720
The only clue

146
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,720
is this long-legged lady.

147
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,680
and Editor Chen received.

148
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,680
But the text you got was a virtual number.

149
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,560
It's nowhere to be found.

150
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,680
Now we can only start with this long-legged girl.

151
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,880
You two went to the school support center.

152
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,440
If you go there again,

153
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,720
it'll be suspicious.

154
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,960
Besides, the sponsor...

155
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,480
If the donor wants to hide his identity,

156
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,120
the school will try their best to keep it a secret for the donor.

157
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,880
It usually doesn't leak out.

158
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Ji Jinxi, Lu Zitired.

159
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,360
I have a difficult task for you.

160
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,120
Sir, bad news.

161
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,680
Someone fell into the lake.

162
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,880
What?

163
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,800
Over at Biyu Lake.

164
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,440
Sir, hurry.

165
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,840
It'll be too late.

166
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,240
Take me there.

167
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,440
Over there.

168
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,240
Clam.

169
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,840
I don't think the school knows about her.

170
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,680
Otherwise, they'll write it down.

171
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,520
Judging from this screenshot,

172
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,440
the donation time of the long-legged sister lasted for six months.

173
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,280
The last donation time

174
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,600
was April 24, 2024.

175
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,280
But her real name wasn't written on it.

176
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,880
Then this clue is dead here.

177
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,640
Two minutes left.

178
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,440
The elevator will explode soon.

179
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,440
You two...

180
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,520
Are you kidding me?

181
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Don't you know this kind of joke can't be played?

182
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,640
Oh no!

183
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,960
The teacher is back.

184
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,120
We need to find more clues.

185
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,600
Okay.

186
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,800
Who's inside?

187
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,400
Ah

188
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,240
Open the door.

189
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,120
Sir.

190
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,600
Please calm down.

191
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,240
We're just kidding.

192
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,880
Here's the donor's email.

193
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,200
Lolimas.

194
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,440
Did Qin Ze find out

195
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,840
because of

196
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,240
and wrote it down.

197
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,880
Or Ji Jinhee was right.

198
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,240
The one who wrote the suicide note was this long-legged lady.

199
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,680
Jun.

200
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,880
I found her email.

201
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,680
I think she's the one who wrote the suicide note.

202
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,000
The long-legged lady.

203
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
is the only clue we have now.

204
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,040
She set an automatic reply to the email.

205
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,640
She won't log in for a while.

206
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Calm down.

207
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,840
Let's meet up first.

208
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
We'll talk about other things later.

209
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,360
Jun.

210
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,200
Who are you calling?

211
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,240
What suicide note?

212
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,440
It's a riddle game we play.

213
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,400
Are you going to the canteen?

214
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,800
Yes. Do you want some?

215
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Thank you.

216
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,320
I'll transfer the money to you later.

217
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,040
Luo Yi.

218
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,680
Zheng.

219
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,840
About Roris,

220
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,440
I suspect the long-legged lady is the one who wrote the will.

221
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,920
If so,

222
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,480
the long-legged sister has nothing to do with the circulation.

223
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Anyway,

224
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,080
I want to discuss

225
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,080
to see if we can find any new clues.

226
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,680
Where should we meet?

227
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,440
Meeting room.

228
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,440
I found his diary

229
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,000
in Qin Ze's rental house,

230
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,560
I accidentally saw

231
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,200
on his computer.

232
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,720
It was sent by the long-legged sister's email.

233
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,320
It's a strange letter

234
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,400
It wasn't written directly in the letter.

235
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,320
Who would hide the suicide note

236
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,920
on April 28th?

237
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,360
but the scene.

238
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,960
I'll write it down.

239
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,600
"Then come to me." I hid my will here. You can see me if you find it.

240
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,040
In this email,

241
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,800
the exact time and place in this email.

242
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,120
But from these descriptions,

243
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,560
do you think

244
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,320
is the net of the basketball court?

245
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,760
I think so.

246
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,120
I can see the basketball court from the window.

247
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,240
On the first floor.

248
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,720
That's the conference room.

249
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
And tomorrow.

250
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,200
This email was written on April 27th.

251
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,000
According to the time,

252
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
That's today.

253
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
April 28.

254
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,560
Judging from this email,

255
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,000
Qin Ze figured out that the suicide note was in the conference room

256
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,000
and appeared on April 28.

257
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,440
So does he want to see the person who wrote the suicide note

258
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,599
or

259
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,800
who has been communicating with him.

260
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,359
And who exactly is this Lolis?

261
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,280
Is it that long-legged girl

262
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,400
Or does she mean herself?

263
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,800
Luo Yi.

264
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,200
Did you find anything?

265
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,880
No.

266
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,000
He likes drawing.

267
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,440
Do you know him too?

268
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,080
And he's a senior student.

269
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,000
I think we should stop hesitating.

270
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,360
Our priority now is to find this person

271
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,400
and find him.

272
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,000
Maybe we'll break the circulation soon.

273
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,760
I'm almost at school.

274
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,800
Where should we meet?

275
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,400
Art Academy.

276
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,600
Let's meet there.

277
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,720
Art Academy.

278
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,880
Why are we meeting there?

279
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,680
Aren't we going to the media building?

280
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Just come here.

281
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,000
Stop asking questions.

282
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,680
Why are you so fierce?

283
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,440
You should be a teacher.

284
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,480
Not cute at all.

285
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,240
Where are you?

286
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,680
I'm already at the art academy.

287
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,600
I haven't seen you all.

288
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,680
Where are you?

289
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,000
Tell me the location.

290
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,880
I'm in a small park.

291
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,200
in a small park.

292
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
and a red tree.

293
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,960
Okay.

294
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,160
Stay still.

295
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll pick you up.

296
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,560
Why isn't he here yet?

297
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,960
It's really him.

298
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,040
What took you so long?

299
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,040
How could you let me wait for you in such an obvious place?

300
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,200
And you came so late.

301
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Do you know I'm sensitive at school?

302
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,360
I have a lot of fans.

303
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,480
What if I was attacked by them just now?

304
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,440
You said it like if you stand longer,

305
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
you'll be eaten by your fans.

306
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,360
I don't hate fans.

307
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,480
I just don't like to get in touch with too many people.

308
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,400
This is no time to waste.

309
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,440
There's only half an hour left until the explosion.

310
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,200
I suggest

311
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,880
the four of us should search separately.

312
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,200
It'll be faster to search like this.

313
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,520
Go upstairs.

314
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,280
Luo Yi.

315
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,360
Here's your painting.

316
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,120
Lolimas.

317
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,760
It's almost the same.

318
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,520
Then the author of this painting

319
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,760
could be the person

320
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,920
who wants to die.

321
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,760
There's no name on it.

322
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,000
Hey, Luo Yi.

323
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,640
Are you also from the oil painting department?

324
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,560
Do you know who drew this?

325
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
I drew it.

326
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,720
What did you say?

327
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,720
This painting

328
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,320
was drawn by me.

329
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,720
But...

330
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,400
So...

331
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,720
you knew I was looking for you from the beginning.

332
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,200
What else are you hiding?

333
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,800
Do you know Sister Long Legs?

334
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,760
Could it be Luo Yi who wants to kill her?

335
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,920
You're the one Sister Long Legs wants to save.

336
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,120
No.

337
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,520
That will has nothing to do with me.

338
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,520
When I first saw that suicide note,

339
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
I felt strange.

340
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,480
Because the handwriting on it

341
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,280
is almost

342
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,120
the same as mine.

343
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,960
But I didn't write that suicide note.

344
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,480
I didn’t tell you

345
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,680
so I didn't tell you.

346
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,720
Now I suddenly realize

347
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,920
I might never really understand Luo Yi.

348
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,400
We grew up together,

349
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,880
I couldn't even recognize his handwriting.

350
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,320
After reading his will several times,

351
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,280
I've been wandering around like a headless fly.

352
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,720
All I wanted was to find the person who wrote the suicide note.

353
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,400
Who do you think

354
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,920
who wrote that suicide note?

355
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,320
Do you believe

356
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,120
what I said?

357
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,080
I'm tired and fainted.

358
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,200
What?

359
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,800
Where are you?

360
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,000
The grocery room on the third floor.

361
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,120
Hurry up.

362
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,080
Okay, I'll be right there.

363
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,200
Lu Zitired fainted.

364
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,960
I'm tired.

365
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,880
I'm tired.

366
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,200
Let me help you up.

367
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,120
Ah.

368
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,960
Here.

369
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,320
What's wrong?

370
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,800
What's going on?

371
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,120
I don't know.

372
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,480
He fainted as soon as he came in.

373
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,520
I'm tired.

374
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,560
I'm fine.

375
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,920
Help me out.

376
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,960
Okay. Here.

377
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,280
TOYOTA

378
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:24,600
TOYOTA

379
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,960
It's the first time I feel so close to death.

380
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,240
So when it comes to a closed space...

381
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,600
the terror reaction Lu Zitired showed in the elevator.

382
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,640
He said it was claustrophobia.

383
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,760
Maybe not exactly.

384
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,640
It should be a traumatic stress reaction.

385
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,440
I'm fine.

386
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
You'll get better.

387
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,800
Don't worry about me.

388
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,240
I didn't expect you to be one of the victims

389
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,600
You're one of the victims.

390
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,360
I'm sure everyone saw the news.

391
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,200
According to the news,

392
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,760
He was found running away.

393
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,240
had a fight on the rooftop,

394
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,320
and died.

395
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,200
He deserves to die.

396
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,120
We only have three minutes until the elevator explodes.

397
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,760
Three minutes. We can't do anything.

398
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,160
Even if we find something,

399
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,280
we can't stop this circulation.

400
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,560
All we know now

401
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,080
she is a painter.

402
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,720
The art school is so big.

403
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,600
Isn't this looking for a needle in a haystack?

404
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
Besides, we're not sure

405
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,880
if she's an art student.

406
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,760
She's not the only one who knows her.

407
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,720
There's a ready-made one.

408
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Why don't we find

409
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,160
through him?

410
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,920
Yes.

411
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,600
Qin Ze.

412
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,320
We've been focusing on him.

413
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,280
But

414
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,120
he wasn't the one who broke the elevator,

415
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,920
we gradually put our attention

416
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,520
to the long legs sister.

417
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,200
but also ignored.

418
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,160
Qin Ze is also from the elevator.

419
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,600
I think we've been in a weird circle.

420
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,160
We tried our best to find a clue.

421
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,520
but forgot the informant at the beginning.

422
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,520
The four of us keep struggling

423
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
trying hard to find clues about the long-legged sister.

424
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,520
but forget Qin Ze.

425
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,960
is the first person to contact the long-legged sister.

426
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,920
He's in the elevator too.

427
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,120
Why didn't you ask him for help?

428
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,920
If Qin Ze enters the circulation,

429
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,360
he wants to find the long-legged sister more than us.

430
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,360
I got this clue from him.

431
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,680
Why did you

432
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,720
instead of Qin Ze?

433
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,520
Let's build a group chat next time.

434
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,880
It's convenient to contact.

435
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,560
The handwriting is similar to Luo Yi.

436
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,800
And the one with long legs.

437
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,760
Lolimas.

438
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,920
Should I tell Lu Ziyi

439
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,960
about Luo Yi?

440
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,560
I grew up with Luo.

441
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,040
I know Luo Yi.

442
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,200
I don't want to suspect him.

443
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,320
But Lu Zitired and Ji Jinxi

444
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,760
are not close to him.

445
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,720
If it weren't for circulation,

446
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,960
they might never have met each other.

447
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,360
Will they believe Luo?

448
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,440
It’s hard to say.

449
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,080
If the two parties have conflicts

450
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,040
due to their lack of trust,

451
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,920
causing the unity between the four.

452
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,960
and dissolved.

453
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,400
it will be hard to solve.

454
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,120
Before Qin Ze enters the circulation,

455
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,400
we'd better hide it for now.

456
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,040
Are you going to eat in the canteen?

457
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,760
Don't forget to bring me a meal.

458
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,640
We must let the people in the elevator get off the elevator.

459
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,800
If you tell Qin Ze

460
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,680
tell Qin Ze what happened,

461
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,960
I don't know if he'll scare us.

462
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,600
With his personality,

463
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,840
he will doubt us

464
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,160
from the beginning.

465
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,480
Hey.

466
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,400
Why can't we get him out of the elevator?

467
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,000
Isn't that more convenient?

468
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,560
If it's a trick,

469
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,040
you can't enter the circulation.

470
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,000
Do you have any good suggestions?

471
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,280
Let's discuss it.

472
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,880
There are three of us now.

473
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,000
Hello.

474
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,800
Welcome.

475
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,400
What would you like?

476
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,880
A cup of latte.

477
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,600
It's 22 yuan.

478
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,560
Please scan it.

479
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,000
Luo, why are you here?

480
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
Didn’t you go home?

481
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,560
I still have a painting to finish.

482
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,880
I'm not going back for now.

483
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,800
I heard

484
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,040
the painting you recently drew

485
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,440
is called Rolimas, right?

486
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,600
Yes.

487
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,680
Although that painting is not finished,

488
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,000
but it's pretty.

489
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,240
Are you going to use that painting?

490
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,240
Do you have any intention?

491
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,840
Nothing.

492
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,360
Well,

493
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Luo.

494
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,720
It’s late.

495
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,840
I'm going home.

496
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,160
Hey.

497
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,160
Thank you.

498
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,160
Rolimas.

499
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,680
I'll get going then.

500
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,400
Okay.

501
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,120
See you tomorrow.

502
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,600
The fish has taken the bait.

503
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,840
I've taken this will out from the meeting room.

504
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,480
When Qin Ze comes in,

505
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,240
when Qin Ze comes in.

506
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,040
But I think he'll be waiting at the door.

507
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,240
He doesn't seem to take the initiative.

508
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,240
You don't know.

509
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,680
I can't act at all.

510
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,880
I'm so nervous.

511
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,480
Look, my hands are sweating.

512
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,120
I think your acting is quite good.

513
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,120
I believed it.

514
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,640
Really?

515
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,880
It's a tough battle later.

516
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,640
Let's go.

517
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,920
Don't make any noise.

518
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,240
Luo Yi has entered the conference room.

519
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,440
Ji Jinxi is on the fourth floor.

520
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,320
What if I fail?

521
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,719
What if Qin Ze doesn't believe me?

522
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,040
or they're in the elevator.

523
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,800
I'm a singer.

524
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,040
I'm not an actor.

525
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm not good at

526
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,440
I'm not good at it.

527
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,280
Don't worry.

528
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,440
Luo Yi is here too.

529
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,639
He will help you.

530
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,520
Just like a stage performance.

531
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,520
It's not a stage performance.

532
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:09,840
Luo Yi.

533
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,360
[Go to the meeting room and put the suicide note.]

534
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,520
Qin Ze should appear to meet you at this time.

535
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,440
He has been keeping in touch with the long-legged sister.

536
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,840
So if everything goes well,

537
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,440
he would choose to get involved.

538
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,320
The long-legged sister

539
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,640
he would also choose to stop it.

540
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,600
In the process,

541
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,640
you can accidentally reveal

542
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,440
about the long-legged sister.

543
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,240
Because in that email

544
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,600
the long-legged lady knew her.

545
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,840
who wants to die.

546
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,520
Hey, kid.

547
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,280
Yes?

548
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,080
Do you know the long-legged lady?

549
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:21,520
Actor table.

550
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,520
Tang Xiaoma Li Xiyuan

551
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:22,840
Luo Yi, Xingze.

552
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:23,440
Qin Ze, Gao Kai.

553
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,080
Lu Zitired, Thunderstorm.

554
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:24,720
Ji Jinxi, Miao Yaning.

555
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,120
Song HaoMiao Mo Qinyang

556
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:25,720
Editor Chen, Shen Bao Ping.

557
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:26,680
Song Liang, Jiao Peng.

558
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,320
Mother of Song, Jia Shu Yi.

559
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:27,640
Wu Yiren Wang Yanan

560
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,280
Luo Wenli Fu Xiaoming

561
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:28,520
Little Xiao Meng, Tangyuan

562
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,200
Lu Zitired's father, Guo Yanlang

563
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,160
Luo Yi's stepmother, Liu Xiaotian.

564
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,120
Agent Han Mingyun

565
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,440
