1
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,800
Are you okay?

2
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,800
You guys go with auntie first.

3
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,840
I'll accompany him to take a rest outside.

4
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,320
Let's go.

5
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,800
Are you okay?

6
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
I'm fine.

7
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,800
The location of my accident

8
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,600
was downstairs of the media.

9
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,040
You mean the man who fell on the top of your car

10
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,800
who fell off your car?

11
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,840
What a coincidence.

12
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,600
I didn't expect a bag

13
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,640
to be involved in a bag.

14
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,000
And this is related to Lu Zitired.

15
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,400
How is it going?

16
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,560
We met the owner of Room 2103.

17
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,960
The owner does look very pale.

18
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,960
But because of the lady,

19
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,400
we asked about the bag.

20
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:53,240
Maybe losing his son is too painful for him.

21
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,640
The owner doesn't remember the bag.

22
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,240
While they were talking,

23
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,040
Qin Ze and I went in and looked for it.

24
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,800
and found nothing.

25
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,440
There's only 10 minutes left

26
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
before the elevator collapses.

27
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,200
I remember.

28
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,320
When Song HaoMiao's father fell down,

29
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,640
a bag fell off too.

30
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,880
Do you remember the details of the bag?

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

32
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,600
that was a green bag.

33
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,560
When it faces me,

34
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,640
There's a pear mark.

35
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,880
When the corner of the bag slipped from the car,

36
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,240
there was blood on it.

37
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,080
So...

38
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,960
There will be a lot of blood on it.

39
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,480
The bag in his hand

40
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,120
is exactly the same as the one we couldn't see his face.

41
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,680
Look at this stain.

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,640
The bag that looks like

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,240
It's not stain.

44
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,040
but dried blood.

45
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,880
No way.

46
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
If it's blood,

47
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,240
That's too creepy.

48
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,200
Why didn't you clean this up?

49
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,240
It's done by a normal person.

50
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,840
Who is the person who sponsored Qin Ze?

51
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,960
When and where did he get this bag?

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,280
and why he used it.

53
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,080
Is it a coincidence?

54
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,800
Or is he up to something?

55
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
Is he the one who's in the loop or not?

56
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,800
Do you want to know the truth about the long-legged lady?

57
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,360
Please turn on the video.

58
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,440
You took that bag.

59
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,400
It wasn't me.

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,800
How can I believe it wasn't you?

61
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,000
The handwriting of the suicide note.

62
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,040
The painting that seems to be Lolis.

63
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,800
and the video I saw with my own eyes.

64
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,000
Luo Yi.

65
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,240
Now we have a video to prove that you took the bag.

66
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,840
Then why did you deny everything I asked you before?

67
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,960
Shouldn't you give us an explanation?

68
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,760
Zheng.

69
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,960
He's hiding so well.

70
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,760
No, we can't let him go like this.

71
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,040
I'll go after him.

72
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,640
You really don't know a book by its cover.

73
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,840
Is my donor

74
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,360
Luo Yi?

75
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,440
Could it be...

76
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,760
he doesn't want you to know he's your donor.

77
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,799
And he wanted to hide it.

78
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,640
he wanted to kill himself.

79
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,640
That's why.

80
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,480
At first, we suspected that your donor, the long-legged sister

81
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,120
because he knew

82
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,680
the suicide note was in the conference room.

83
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,880
Now the truth is out.

84
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,800
Luo Yi found the suicide note.

85
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,120
Then it must be him who put the will.

86
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,640
Including the email saying someone would put the suicide note.

87
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,560
He was the one behind all this.

88
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,800
So no sixth person has ever entered the circle.

89
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,200
It's always the five of us

90
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,200
Luo Yi was too emotional

91
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,600
so many things happened.

92
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,800
Who sent you the video?

93
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,040
The focus was Luo Yi.

94
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,760
I almost forgot about it.

95
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,560
The person who sent the video was sent by a virtual number.

96
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,160
No one else knows.

97
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,560
we're investigating this.

98
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,360
Could it be...

99
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,640
the sixth person has entered the circle?

100
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,960
Could it be...

101
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,760
There really is a sixth person.

102
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,120
But who is the sixth person?

103
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,560
Could it be the murderer who blew up the elevator?

104
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
What about Luo Yi?

105
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,720
Will he be an accomplice?

106
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,160
If he was,

107
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
he doesn't have to keep us company.

108
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,960
And if that's the case,

109
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
the person who sent the video

110
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,960
doesn't have to expose him.

111
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,960
There's less than five minutes left until the explosion.

112
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,920
There's no time.

113
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,360
Now that Luo Yi is gone,

114
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,600
the most important thing is to find him first.

115
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
If he really wants to kill himself,

116
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,600
we can't leave him alone now.

117
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,200
Let's go.

118
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,280
Luo Yi.

119
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,800
Luo Yi.

120
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,080
Luo Yi.

121
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
He still forgot your death anniversary.

122
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,240
Let's go home.

123
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,960
Mom, I'm hungry.

124
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,920
Poppet is hungry.

125
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,800
Come on, wash your hands.

126
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,360
Let's eat.

127
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,720
You didn't cook?

128
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,840
You have dementia at such a young age.

129
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,640
What time is it? Why don't you cook?

130
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,960
Do you want to starve your brother to death?

131
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,640
Gosh.

132
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,120
He probably forgot the time to draw.

133
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,160
I'll do it.

134
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,440
I'll make it right away.

135
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,320
You can watch TV and take a rest.

136
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,360
Luo, listen.

137
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,160
I won’t forgive you if you protect him today.

138
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Watch TV and take a rest.

139
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,040
I'll finish it right away.

140
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,360
Draw it.

141
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,920
Why do you draw this crap all day?

142
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,240
You don't cook.

143
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,320
If you don't study hard,

144
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,800
Can you support you by drawing it?

145
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,840
Alright.

146
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,120
Let me tell you.

147
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,200
From now on,

148
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,720
as long as you stay here for one day,

149
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,040
you won't see it.

150
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
Oh.

151
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,160
Are you okay?

152
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,600
He hit me.

153
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,120
Luo, do you still care?

154
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,920
How dare you!

155
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,760
Apologize to your mom now.

156
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,600
You picked it up?

157
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,920
I said pick it up!

158
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,040
I'll smash it.

159
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,960
Don't move.

160
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,200
If you touch this painting,

161
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,560
I'll die here.

162
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,560
Put it down.

163
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,760
Luo Yi.

164
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,840
Calm down.

165
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,320
Put down the knife.

166
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,840
All these years,

167
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,160
you've forgotten it so thoroughly.

168
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
From now on,

169
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,160
in this house with no warmth,

170
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,160
Luo Yi is dead.

171
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,440
I won't come again.

172
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,320
Luo Yi. Luo Yi.

173
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,440
What did I get?

174
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,840
What did I lose?

175
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,560
My life is meaningless.

176
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,920
My body is no longer important.

177
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,160
No one can hold me back.

178
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,320
and run towards death.

179
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,080
Tang Xiaotong

180
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,480
Tang Xiaotong

181
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,360
Tang Xiaotong

182
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,200
Your phone has been ringing for a long time.

183
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,640
You woke me up.

184
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
11:13.

185
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,960
The time has been shortened for half an hour.

186
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,560
Luo Yi.

187
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,640
Luo Yi.

188
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,160
Hello, Luo Yi.

189
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,000
Is Luo Yi you?

190
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,960
Luo Yi.

191
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,120
I'm here.

192
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,000
I thought you were dead.

193
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,960
I thought I would never see you again.

194
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,960
Don't worry.

195
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
I'm fine.

196
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,600
I'm always here.

197
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,800
We were worried about you.

198
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,080
Why did you

199
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,600
in the middle of the road?

200
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,320
Gosh.

201
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,360
But

202
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,480
I have to thank you

203
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,920
for saving me at the critical moment.

204
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,800
Are you the long-legged sister?

205
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,160
I said no.

206
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
Believe it or not,

207
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,320
I don't know.

208
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,160
I want to trust you.

209
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,760
But

210
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,560
it was you in the video.

211
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,600
I don't know what to do.

212
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,840
I'm contradictory.

213
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,040
I just set up a WeChat group.

214
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,640
Tang Xiaotong dragged you in.

215
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,160
Luo Yi.

216
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,320
I'm sorry.

217
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,840
I can't hold you for the time being.

218
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,400
You're still under suspicion.

219
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,160
Thank you for saving me,

220
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,640
but...

221
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,360
I understand.

222
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,520
What's going on?

223
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,960
Half an hour shorter.

224
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,960
Luo Yi won't...

225
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,360
Luo Yizheng is with us.

226
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,520
He's safe.

227
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
That's good.

228
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,960
Although Luo Yi is the suspect now,

229
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,920
we don't want anything to happen to him.

230
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,360
We've entered the circulation,

231
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,040
but we shortened another half an hour.

232
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,920
It's unbelievable.

233
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,640
Qin Ze, is it safe over there?

234
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,640
I'm fine here.

235
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,400
I took a leave from the cafe.

236
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,760
I'm on my way.

237
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,560
Since everyone is safe,

238
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,000
it's not convenient to talk on WeChat.

239
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,200
Let's talk in detail when I get there.

240
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,960
Tang, let's meet at the canteen.

241
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,920
Let's meet at the canteen.

242
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,560
Okay.

243
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,520
Scholar, this...

244
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,720
I said I'm not the long-legged sister.

245
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,520
You won't believe me.

246
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,320
Looking at the atmosphere, I already knew what you were talking about.

247
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,760
I'll cut to the chase.

248
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,520
Whether Luo Yi is the long-legged sister,

249
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,920
or if he's an accomplice.

250
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,560
The most important thing now

251
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,600
we've shortened half an hour.

252
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,600
Why is this happening?

253
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,920
Next time,

254
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,720
Will time be shortened?

255
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
If we keep shrinking,

256
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,880
if we can't find the reason,

257
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,080
will we die in the circulation?

258
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,480
One last question.

259
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,960
Who will be the sixth one

260
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,760
will enter the circulation?

261
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,400
I'm going to Dongzhou Garden

262
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,360
to look for clues.

263
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,760
I'll go with you.

264
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,520
Keep an eye on Luo Yi.

265
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,920
Let's find out who sent the video.

266
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,200
Wait for us.

267
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,200
Can I

268
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,520
can I still trust him?

269
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,880
Everyone has their own reasons.

270
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,960
I've been looking for my donor.

271
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,840
Ms. Long Legs.

272
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,120
Now that this person has appeared,

273
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,520
he is

274
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,400
who has been lurking around us.

275
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,440
Of course.

276
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,000
no matter who he is,

277
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,960
I should thank him.

278
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
In the darkest time of my life,

279
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,320
Luo Yi's donation gave me hope.

280
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,720
But I don't understand

281
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,760
why Luo Yi hid his identity as a donor.

282
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,120
Also,

283
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,720
if he wrote the suicide note.

284
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,240
Does he have anything to do with the elevator explosion?

285
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,560
Who's the sixth one to enter the circulation?

286
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,400
We have so many questions.

287
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,600
All these questions

288
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,800
all these questions.

289
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,800
I still can’t believe Luo did that.

290
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,920
We've known each other for so many years.

291
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,720
He doesn't seem like someone who would do such a thing.

292
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,400
I think we can think about it separately.

293
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,840
First,

294
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,600
Luo Yi is my donor.

295
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,520
This is the truth.

296
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,560
Second,

297
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,560
Is Luo Yi related to the elevator explosion?

298
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,840
If Luo Yi is related to the elevator explosion,

299
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,800
then the long-legged lady...

300
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,360
Suicide note.

301
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,760
and the person who wrote the suicide note.

302
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,360
There's a huge secret behind everything.

303
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,760
One wants to destroy the elevator

304
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,600
or

305
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,360
the whole media building.

306
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,000
Is Luo the murderer of the elevator explosion?

307
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,160
If Luo Yi planned all this,

308
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,120
would he kill me too?

309
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,440
I will find a way to get the answer from him.

310
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,000
Where is Luo Yi?

311
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,800
How is it?

312
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,320
We searched everywhere.

313
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,120
No.

314
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,600
Luo Yi is missing.

315
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,040
Missing?

316
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,320
What does that mean?

317
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,440
You've been watching him.

318
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,920
I don't know where he is.

319
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,440
There's no back door in the canteen.

320
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,960
We even searched the kitchen

321
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,960
It's really dangerous to let Luo Yi go alone now.

322
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,440
He was in front of the canteen

323
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,600
In a blink of an eye,

324
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,720
he suddenly disappeared.

325
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,440
And there's no movement.

326
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,560
I don't know where he is now.

327
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
Don't worry.

328
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,040
We'll be right back.

329
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,360
Okay.

330
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,640
Sir.

331
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,560
Please turn around.

332
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,160
Thank you.

333
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,040
Sir, please hurry up.

334
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,360
They're coming. Get up.

335
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,960
What's going on?

336
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,960
We just stand here.

337
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,520
I thought there was no back door in the canteen.

338
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,560
We also searched inside.

339
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,360
Tell me.

340
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,760
Where could he have run away?

341
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,560
He can't blame us anyway.

342
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:08,560
All right.

343
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,720
I know it's not your fault.

344
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,840
It's important to find him now.

345
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,400
Where do you think he might go?

346
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,440
The place he usually goes is the studio in the art academy.

347
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,760
The rest is the dorm.

348
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,080
If Luo wants to avoid us,

349
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
he will definitely

350
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:25,920
where he thinks

351
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,720
we can't find.

352
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,920
We don't have much time.

353
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,480
Okay.

354
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,760
Let's split up.

355
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,320
Search every place we can.

356
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,160
Keep in touch in the group.

357
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,760
Leave the dorm to me.

358
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,360
Okay.

359
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,200
I'll go over there.

360
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,040
Keep in touch on WeChat.

361
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,800
Where are we going?

362
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,040
It's not convenient for you to be alone at school.

363
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,720
I'll go to the art academy later.

364
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,840
Come with me.

365
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,360
Let's go.

366
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,520
He looks like Lu Zitired.

367
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,760
Did anyone recognize you?

368
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,280
Is it him? It's him.

369
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,240
I don't know.

370
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,600
But someone has been following me.

371
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,240
It's really Lu Zitired.

372
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,760
Really?

373
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,720
Is that him?

374
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,600
Thank you for watching tonight's entertainment 30 minutes.

375
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,840
This is entertainment news.

376
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
Tonight at 8 p.m.

377
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,960
