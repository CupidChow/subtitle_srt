1
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,040
Do you want to die?

2
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,720
Yes.

3
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,200
I deserve to die.

4
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,840
I deserve to die because of you.

5
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,000
Say something.

6
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,560
Say something.

7
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,960
Nothing happened between us, right?

8
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,320
Tell me.

9
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,160
Say it!

10
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,560
It's private.

11
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,360
Choose quickly.

12
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,560
Private.

13
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,479
Private?

14
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm back.

15
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,360
Did you go to a band again?

16
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,760
No.

17
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,440
I have a lot of homework today.

18
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,040
I just finished my homework.

19
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,960
I'll cook for you.

20
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,160
Can you

21
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,560
lend me some money?

22
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,760
Isn't your pocket money there?

23
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,240
You can spend it.

24
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,560
No.

25
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,760
It's about studying.

26
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,640
No.

27
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
Hurry up.

28
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,760
Ji Jinhee.

29
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Why are you here?

30
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,920
The chairman's schedule is to see the truth.

31
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,240
She won't be here today.

32
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,360
Ahem.

33
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,800
I forgot my mom isn't working here today.

34
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,320
I'll go find her.

35
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,560
Ji Jinhee.

36
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,000
Ji Jinhee!

37
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,160
Stop!

38
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,360
Ji Jinhee.

39
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,680
Ji Jinhee!

40
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
Stop!

41
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,160
Ji Jinhee!

42
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,360
Stop!

43
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,159
Don't come over.

44
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,560
If you come any closer,

45
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
I'll throw it down.

46
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,600
Okay.

47
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,120
I'm not going.

48
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,400
Ji Jinhee.

49
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,760
Calm down.

50
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,960
You can't take the money.

51
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,640
If you take it away,

52
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,400
the president will fire me.

53
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,760
Let's go to the president, okay?

54
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,160
She's your mother.

55
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,720
She will definitely help you.

56
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
She'll help me.

57
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,760
Yes.

58
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
You know nothing.

59
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,320
Even if you don't care about me,

60
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,120
you should think about the workers of the decoration team.

61
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,360
This is all they have lived for six months.

62
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,560
Be careful.

63
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,400
Hold tight.

64
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,160
Hurry up.

65
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,240
Help me save him.

66
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,360
Do you think

67
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,360
Song HaoMiao?

68
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,560
I'm back.

69
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,400
You're back.

70
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,360
The meal will be ready soon.

71
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,200
Go wash your hands.

72
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,800
Where's my dad?

73
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,560
Your dad is inside.

74
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,920
Ask your dad to come out for dinner.

75
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,480
Dad.

76
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,920
What are you doing?

77
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
You scared me.

78
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,600
I thought she was your mom.

79
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,920
She's hiding her private money again.

80
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,360
Keep your voice down.

81
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,760
Don't let your mom know.

82
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,760
Don't let your mom hear you.

83
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,920
Look.

84
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,840
It's messy again.

85
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,840
I almost forgot.

86
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,080
You punk.

87
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,240
I'll count again.

88
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,200
I have something to discuss with you.

89
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,840
I'm going to the band tonight.

90
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,960
You're using me as your shield, right?

91
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,640
No.

92
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,600
I'll stay at home tonight.

93
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm not going anywhere.

94
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,280
and spend time with you.

95
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,800
That's right.

96
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,000
It's...

97
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,960
It's...

98
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,120
What is it?

99
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,240
Why are you hesitating?

100
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,600
Tell me.

101
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,560
I can do it.

102
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,240
No problem.

103
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,960
It's quite fashionable.

104
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,800
Of course.

105
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,400
I'll tell you then.

106
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,160
Why do I feel something is wrong with you today?

107
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,320
Are you trying to steal my money?

108
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,240
Hey.

109
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,160
My dad

110
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,200
is Sai Zhuge.

111
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,560
You guessed it

112
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,320
before I said it.

113
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,960
Cut it out.

114
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,920
Your dad's hair is almost gone.

115
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,360
You even put on a high hat for me.

116
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,960
Tell me.

117
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,160
How much do you want?

118
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,160
Well...

119
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,760
You first.

120
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Turn around.

121
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,520
Don't look.

122
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,320
Don't look.

123
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,400
What do you mean?

124
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,840
Not enough.

125
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,480
Yes.

126
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,120
Do you want 6,000 won?

127
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,320
Yes.

128
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,240
Why do you need so much money?

129
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,360
Aren't we going to an exhibition today?

130
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,760
I saw a painting.

131
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,560
touched my music very much.

132
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,880
Forget it.

133
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,920
You won't understand.

134
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,160
I just like it.

135
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,120
I just want to buy it.

136
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,640
Please.

137
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,960
Please.

138
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,720
Dad.

139
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,920
I really like it.

140
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,920
I just want to buy it.

141
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,560
Yes.

142
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,760
What are you talking about?

143
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,000
Come out for dinner.

144
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,200
Coming soon.

145
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,000
Let's go.

146
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,880
Let's eat first.

147
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,160
After dinner,

148
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,760
I'll fix it for you.

149
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,800
Long live dad!

150
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,960
Bye.

151
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,840
Bye.

152
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,240
Bye.

153
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,840
Your dad has been transferred.

154
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,800
he hasn't had a proper meal at home.

155
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,320
Take this to your dad.

156
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,840
Don't forget to tell him

157
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,600
I'll make dumplings at home tonight.

158
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,640
Tell him to come back early after work.

159
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,560
Okay, I won't forget.

160
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,560
You nagged me three times.

161
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,480
You punk.

162
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,360
Your mom is nagging.

163
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,400
I'm leaving.

164
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,440
Take care.

165
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,280
Good boy.

166
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,680
You're wasting money again.

167
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,320
This blueberry is very expensive.

168
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,240
I'm just borrowing it to offer it to you.

169
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Try it.

170
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,560
Yes.

171
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,560
Stop!

172
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:56,920
Wait for me here.

173
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,720
I'll go upstairs.

174
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,880
Stop!

175
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,160
Dad.

176
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,120
Hey.

177
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,440
Please save my dad.

178
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,000
Hey.

179
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,680
My dad...

180
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,040
My dad just fell down.

181
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,320
I don't know what to do.

182
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,360
Please help me.

183
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:47,760
Help me.

184
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,480
Sorry.

185
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,480
I have something to do.

186
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,520
I can't help you.

187
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,520
Please save my dad.

188
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,760
My dad fell.

189
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,040
Please help me.

190
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,680
Please help me.

191
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,320
Please.

192
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,960
I'm sorry.

193
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,200
My dad was pushed down.

194
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,840
My dad was pushed down.

195
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,080
My dad was pushed down.

196
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,560
We'll look into it.

197
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,720
My condolences.

198
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,080
Or did we see it wrong?

199
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,080
Maybe it's really Song HaoMiao.

200
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,640
Previously,

201
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,640
we thought he was dead.

202
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,600
so we never suspected him.

203
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,720
Now that I think about it,

204
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,520
everything is right.

205
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,960
It seems that Song Hao Miao really came back for revenge.

206
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,520
I think I saw him.

207
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,960
That day,

208
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,880
I went to the media building

209
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,160
I met someone asking for help.

210
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,520
I remember he was helpless.

211
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,320
and begged me to help him.

212
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,960
But I was focusing on the scholarship.

213
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,920
I just wanted to get the scholarship as soon as possible.

214
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,360
and let my brother suffer less.

215
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,760
So I don't care who this person is.

216
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,120
Of course.

217
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,720
I rejected him.

218
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,560
Please save my dad.

219
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,400
I'm sorry.

220
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,360
I didn't expect him to be Song HaoMiao.

221
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,360
Now he wants to kill me.

222
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
I understand.

223
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,120
And me.

224
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,720
I understand him.

225
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,760
I saw it with my own eyes.

226
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,360
the truth.

227
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,720
It seems

228
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,920
everyone came here

229
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,840
was intentionally led by Song HaoMiao.

230
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,640
Luo Yi's escape

231
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,000
must have something to do with this.

232
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,600
What about me?

233
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,320
Was I just brought into the elevator by Luo?

234
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,360
Or do I have something to do with this case?

235
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,960
Since we found a bomb under the elevator sedan,

236
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,720
Should we call the police?

237
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,480
Professional things

238
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
should be done by professionals.

239
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,160
If we remove the bomb ourselves,

240
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,120
maybe

241
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,040
It might explode.

242
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,120
the bomb exploded.

243
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,520
We have 20 minutes until the circulation.

244
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,000
It's not too late to call the police.

245
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,680
I'm a student of Lincheng University.

246
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,280
The elevator is installed

247
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,400
The elevator is installed with bombs.

248
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,600
Please send someone to demolish it as soon as possible.

249
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,920
Hello?

250
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,320
Really?

251
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,000
Okay.

252
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,760
I'll come up to you.

253
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,160
Luo.

254
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,720
Call the person in charge.

255
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,680
I didn't expect

256
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,640
they were so fast.

257
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,760
Oh no.

258
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,720
The bomb may have remote control.

259
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,320
should be in Song HaoMiao's hands.

260
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,720
I said,

261
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,920
the first time I called the police, it exploded so quickly.

262
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
I thought I didn't have enough time,

263
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,520
so I ignored it.

264
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
Find Song HaoMiao first.

265
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,120
Okay.

266
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,720
Let's go.

267
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,320
It must be those students.

268
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,520
They opened the elevator door

269
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,480
and picked up something under the elevator.

270
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,000
Which students?

271
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,120
The students from Lincheng University next door.

272
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,440
Oh.

273
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,640
Maybe.

274
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,320
It's just a prank.

275
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,480
We'll investigate whether it's a prank or not.

276
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,400
Can you tell us which students they are?

277
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,360
Well...

278
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,320
I'm not sure.

279
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,320
Where are these students now?

280
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:37,880
This...

281
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,880
He was in the surveillance room just now.

282
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,240
They were fine

283
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,520
so I let them go.

284
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,600
Now,

285
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,600
Ask everyone upstairs to gather at the square.

286
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,520
Okay.

287
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,280
Evacuate the crowd.

288
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,080
The police will find the bomb soon.

289
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,520
and evacuate the crowd.

290
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,560
I hope we can make it in time.

291
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,960
I wonder

292
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,880
after hearing the alarm.

293
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,000
Will we die here

294
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,480
will we die here?

295
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
Don't worry.

296
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,360
Jo Jin's office is right ahead.

297
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
I want to copy the video of the fall.

298
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,040
Let's go together.

299
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,080
You called me here

300
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,480
to tell me the truth?

301
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,960
Or

302
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,480
to make up stories?

303
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Last time,

304
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,720
Turn off the switch.

305
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,720
You're the one

306
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,800
is you, right?

307
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,120
Here.

308
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,480
It must be familiar.

309
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,480
I found a few unsread emails in his email.

310
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,080
It's really you.

311
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,720
How much did they give you?

312
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,080
How could you kill me?

313
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,320
You're wrong.

314
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,280
The one who wants to kill you

315
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,280
wasn't me.

316
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,280
When I heard that melody in the elevator,

317
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,000
Don't you

318
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,320
you haven't noticed?

319
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,640
What do you mean?

320
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
What else?

321
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,360
Song HaoMiao.

322
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,640
Isn't he dead?

323
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,880
So...

324
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,880
you were the one

325
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,800
was you.

326
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,560
The meaning of epiphyllum

327
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,200
The moment of beauty

328
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,360
A moment is eternal.

329
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,080
Open at 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.

330
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,800
I hope we can

331
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,000
can be complete.

332
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,080
I'm counting on you

333
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,640
will depend on you.

334
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,080
Morning, Editor Chen.

335
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,480
Morning, Luo.

336
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,840
Hey.

337
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,960
Are you done with the floral arrangement?

338
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,520
Almost.

339
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,840
But there's another video.

340
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,040
I'll take it down and sort it out later.

341
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,240
I'll work overtime tonight.

342
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,560
It should be done tomorrow.

343
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,520
Send it to me as soon as you're done.

344
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,320
Okay.

345
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,160
Ji Jinhee.

346
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,000
Don't go.

347
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,880
Ji Jinhee!

348
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,680
Stop!

349
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,000
Ji Jinhee!

350
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,880
Stop!

351
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,880
That's for the decoration team.

352
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:38,520
Mac BookPro.

353
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,320
Don't come over.

354
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,159
Mac BookPro.

355
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:40,360
Okay, Proo.

356
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,239
Come closer.

357
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:41,679
Mac BookPro

358
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,719
I'll throw it down

359
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,560
Okay.

360
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,679
I'm not going.

361
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,199
Ji Jinhee.

362
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,159
Calm down.

363
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,639
You can't take the money.

364
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,080
If you take it,

365
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,120
the president will fire me.

366
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,720
Hold on tight.

367
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:10,800
Actor table.
