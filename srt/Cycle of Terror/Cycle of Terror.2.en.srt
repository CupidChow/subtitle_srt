1
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,200
When you see your mom,

2
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,400
don't forget to call for help.

3
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,200
Don't forget

4
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
she's not my mom.

5
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,160
We had a deal before we got married.

6
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,200
This child belongs to his mother.

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,360
You didn't take care of him.

8
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,440
But now,

9
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,320
you brought your child here.

10
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,240
Are you going to give up your life?

11
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,360
Oh.

12
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,160
His mother died so suddenly.

13
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,160
Even the doctor didn't expect this to happen.

14
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
What can I do?

15
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,920
I can't let him wander around.

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,800
After all, I'm his father.

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,920
Oh.

18
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,800
All right.

19
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,120
Calm down.

20
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,040
The kid has been waiting outside for a long time.

21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's go out later.

22
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,000
He's from the countryside.

23
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,240
He can cook.

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,640
The cooking tastes good.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Maybe you'll like it

26
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,520
you'll like it.

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,360
Oh.

28
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,160
Let's go.

29
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,360
Go away.

30
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,040
What are you waiting for?

31
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,040
Call your mom.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,280
Don't.

33
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,560
I'm not your mother.

34
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,040
Just call me auntie.

35
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,360
Hey.

36
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,160
Say hello to auntie

37
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,800
Let's call her auntie first.

38
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,240
We'll change our name later.

39
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Luo Yi.

40
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,200
Call for help, Luo Yi.

41
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,960
Auntie.

42
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,760
How are you?

43
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,960
Feeling better?

44
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,320
You still have a fever.

45
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,680
Let's go.

46
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,840
Let me take you to the hospital.

47
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,080
No need.

48
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,040
I've taken my medicine.

49
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
You'll be fine after sweating.

50
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,160
You really don't have to go to the hospital.

51
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,120
The medicine and water are on the table.

52
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,360
Call me if you need anything.

53
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,960
He has such a cold.

54
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,360
If he gets infected again,

55
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,720
Let him sleep in the corridor.

56
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,720
How can I say that

57
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
How can I say that?

58
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
You're not going?

59
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,200
I'll go.

60
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,520
Go away.

61
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,360
He has a fever.

62
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,600
How can he sleep in the corridor?

63
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,840
Hey.

64
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,440
Hey.

65
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
It's time to move forward.

66
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
I'm sorry.

67
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,600
I don't know if I was mistaken.

68
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,360
I feel that after I woke up this time,

69
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,280
after waking up.

70
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,040
Zheng.

71
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,120
Luo.

72
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,520
Zheng.

73
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,200
What's wrong?

74
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,240
I'm just tired.

75
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,640
Right?

76
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
You've been through too many circulations

77
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,440
and too much energy.

78
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,040
It's possible.

79
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,720
It's not easy to stop the elevator from falling.

80
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,280
We can't rush it.

81
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,880
Get some rest.

82
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,200
I'll get you some food.

83
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,720
Zheng.

84
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,440
Here.

85
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,440
Drink the soup before it gets cold.

86
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,320
You'll feel better.

87
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,440
Are you feeling better?

88
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,840
Much better.

89
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,360
I want to go to the security room

90
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,760
to check the contact information of the elevator maintenance staff.

91
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,960
You can rest here.

92
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,280
and wait for Lu Zitired.

93
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,160
we can move together.

94
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
Don't worry.

95
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,320
I'm here.

96
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,880
Okay.

97
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,240
Okay.

98
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,720
Eat more.

99
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Come back soon.

100
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,960
Okay.

101
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,360
Don't be afraid that I'm not a bad person.

102
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,880
My parents have to work at night.

103
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,840
so they locked me up at home.

104
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,240
Are you Uncle Luo's son, Luo Yi?

105
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,720
Yes.

106
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,840
I heard about you from Uncle Luo and my parents.

107
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,120
Then why are you sleeping outside?

108
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,880
instead of going home to sleep?

109
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,480
I'm sick.

110
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,320
I don't want to infect them.

111
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,280
Aren't you afraid to sleep alone outside?

112
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,240
Don't be afraid.

113
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,480
I'll stay here with you.

114
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
Go to sleep.

115
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,480
Get well soon.

116
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,640
Okay.

117
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,680
Go to sleep.

118
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,360
Are you still there?

119
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,080
Yes.

120
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,680
Tang Xiaotong

121
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,680
Tang Xiaotong.

122
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,160
Lu Zitired.

123
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,280
Hush.

124
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,280
Ah

125
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,200
12:31.

126
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,400
Why did I sleep for so long?

127
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,600
Where did your friend go?

128
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,680
Yes.

129
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,360
Luo Yi.

130
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,200
He's not answering. Hello.

131
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,240
He's in the media building.

132
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,880
But...

133
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't know how he's doing.

134
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,960
I can't stay here for long.

135
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,600
Let's go.

136
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,800
Let's talk in my car.

137
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,200
Okay.

138
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,400
Let's exchange our phones.

139
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,600
It's convenient to contact.

140
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,640
Okay.

141
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,000
Okay.

142
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
It's out of battery.

143
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,520
Just tell me.

144
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,320
I'll write it down.

145
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,120
15.

146
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,360
Why is there no battery?

147
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,720
You played music in the elevator before.

148
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
What music?

149
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,400
I haven't played it.

150
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,720
Isn't it Lu Zitired?

151
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,600
We're almost at the media building.

152
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,840
Hurry up.

153
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,800
I'll recite it now.

154
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,160
Three minutes left.

155
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
The elevator is going to explode.

156
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,000
159324930...

157
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,720
Call me when the next round comes.

158
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,440
Where are you going?

159
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,640
I need to enter the elevator to verify the melody.

160
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,360
What is this?

161
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,400
What's that smell?

162
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,960
Is someone using a microwave?

163
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,520
What's going on?

164
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,400
Why did the elevator stop?

165
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,960
There must be a power outage.

166
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Don't worry.

167
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,360
It should be fine when the electricity comes.

168
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,400
Who played the music?

169
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,000
Not me.

170
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,760
I didn't.

171
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,120
What were you looking for in the elevator?

172
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,080
Jun.

173
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,160
Are you in there?

174
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,680
Luo Yi.

175
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,400
I'm here.

176
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,320
There was a melody before the elevator fell.

177
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,520
But this melody

178
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,440
is not released by anyone in the elevator.

179
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,240
The source of the melody may be related to the falling of the elevator.

180
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,960
Excuse me.

181
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,160
Hey.

182
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,520
It's time to move forward.

183
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,160
Hello?

184
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
This is your phone.

185
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,840
Not mine.

186
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
It belongs to my agent.

187
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,840
Where should we meet later?

188
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
I'm in the city now.

189
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,240
[I just got off the highway.]

190
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,520
It'll take about 20 minutes to get to school.

191
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,200
Zheng.

192
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,600
Lu Zitired.

193
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,520
Yes.

194
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,760
He just got off the highway.

195
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,120
20 minutes to school.

196
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,640
He wants to check where he met.

197
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,400
Hello?

198
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Let's meet at the conference room on the first floor of the media building.

199
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,600
You can go there directly.

200
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,200
Okay.

201
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Call me if you want to see me.

202
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,440
Let's go.

203
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,440
What's the melody you mentioned?

204
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,760
Do you remember

205
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,960
When the elevator fell,

206
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,360
I heard a strange melody.

207
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,560
Yes.

208
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,920
I always thought

209
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,600
it was played by Lu Zitired.

210
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,560
But in the last circulation,

211
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
I found his phone was out of battery.

212
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,320
Then I went back to the media building.

213
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,000
I checked the other two before the elevator fell.

214
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,440
I found that the melody

215
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,840
was not released by anyone in the elevator.

216
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,760
The falling of the elevator must have something to do with the melody.

217
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,600
Just like what's in the TV,

218
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,000
someone installed a bomb in the elevator.

219
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,560
Once the melody is played,

220
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,760
the device will be activated.

221
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,920
What are you thinking about?

222
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,840
If there's a bomb in the elevator,

223
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,360
why do we need music?

224
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,840
Are you playing tricks?

225
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,160
But

226
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,360
there's one thing you think of.

227
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,960
I think the falling of the elevator

228
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,160
might be done by someone.

229
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,000
What do you mean?

230
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,360
Do you remember the last time

231
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,280
I told you to go to the security room first?

232
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,240
Yes.

233
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,920
Then I went to the security room.

234
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,800
I found no one there.

235
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,600
so I went in alone.

236
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,960
and looked through the contact information of the elevator maintenance.

237
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,200
But after I called,

238
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,760
do you know what they said to me?

239
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,560
What did they say?

240
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,400
They told me

241
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,160
yesterday,

242
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,000
someone called them

243
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,720
and told them something was wrong with the elevator.

244
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,400
and asked them to send someone to check.

245
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,160
Someone else called the elevator maintenance team.

246
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,920
Yes.

247
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,720
The maintenance said

248
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
They already came.

249
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,600
They checked the elevator

250
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,760
So he refused my request.

251
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,800
and told me

252
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,760
the elevator maintenance day is coming.

253
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,400
They'll come back on the day.

254
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,760
I thought it was strange.

255
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,160
why someone called them yesterday

256
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,040
and told them something was wrong with the elevator.

257
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,440
Who is that person?

258
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,520
Did you find something wrong with the elevator?

259
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,320
So I asked them

260
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,400
to get his contact information.

261
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,360
But they said there were too many numbers.

262
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,360
They didn't know who called them.

263
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
I had no choice.

264
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I had to come back from the security room.

265
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,760
When I got here, I found you were in the elevator.

266
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,200
I just wanted to see

267
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,720
around the media building.

268
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,560
I found someone

269
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,320
who shouldn't have been here.

270
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,400
Editor Jin.

271
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,480
I saw Editor Chen

272
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,680
standing in the parking lot outside the media building.

273
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,440
looking at the direction of the media building.

274
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,320
And

275
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,560
He's looking at his watch. He's looking at his watch. He's looking at his watch.

276
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,440
Editor Chen.

277
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,800
was originally a teacher who taught application physics in our school.

278
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,360
After he resigned,

279
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,360
he became an editor with the truth.

280
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,360
The truth is self-media.

281
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,120
Unlike other professional media institutions,

282
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,200
division of work.

283
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,400
Many times, one person needs to use it for a few people.

284
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,120
So...

285
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,800
Editor Jin often brings reporters out for interviews.

286
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,200
There was an interview

287
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,600
at the city cultural museum.

288
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,640
But Editor Chen appeared in the media building.

289
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,040
So you suspect it's Editor Chen?

290
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,360
I just think

291
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,720
Editor Chen might have something to do with this.

292
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,800
I'm not familiar with him.

293
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,360
We've only met a few times.

294
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,320
I only heard his name.

295
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,160
Tang Xiaotong.

296
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,240
I'm here.

297
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,800
What's your major?

298
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,280
I...

299
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,440
I'm a vocal major.

300
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,760
What's wrong?

301
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,720
His major has nothing to do with app physics.

302
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,880
I don't think he's familiar with Editor Chen.

303
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
There might be someone

304
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,760
One of them might know you.

305
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,560
If there's someone you're familiar with,

306
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,440
it'll be easier to inquire.

307
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,320
But it's obviously too late now.

308
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,960
Hey.

309
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,080
Since Editor Chen was a teacher at our school,

310
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,720
there must be some information about him in the school's data room.

311
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,280
I want to check there.

312
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,240
I might know something.

313
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,480
Sure.

314
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,280
The application for the school data room has been approved.

315
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,360
Let's split into two groups.

316
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,800
Luo Yi and I will go to the data room

317
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,560
to find some information about Mr. Chen.

318
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,280
Find out about him.

319
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,080
Okay.

320
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,600
Found it.

321
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,240
CZP Research Team.

322
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,840
What is this?

323
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,160
This should be

324
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,440
a research group of application physics.

325
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,520
Let me check.

326
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,840
CZP research team specializes in materials science.

327
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,920
energy research.

328
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,240
Nano Science and so on.

329
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,720
CZP team

330
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,440
There are top meetings rooms in and abroad.

331
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,440
For people who study apps,

332
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,680
to join the CZP research team

333
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,120
are all top talents.

334
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Normally,

335
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,200
people from this kind of group

336
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,640
will join the research unit.

337
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,880
But Editor Jin chose to work in a university.

338
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,240
What's more ridiculous is

339
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,440
he became an editor at a self-media company.

340
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,720
Is there more?

341
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,440
Hey.

342
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,320
Isn't this Principal Zhou?

343
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,840
It's her.

344
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,440
Principal Zhou was a physics professor.

345
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,080
It’s said that she invented super nanomillic plus materials ten years ago

346
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,720
and won the National App Physics Prize in Samoto Dong.

347
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,680
and became the principal.

348
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,520
I didn't expect that Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhou

349
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,080
joined a research group.

350
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,400
Although they were in the same research group,

351
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,600
but the level is different now.

352
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,720
One became the principal

353
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,280
a silent college teacher

354
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,440
a self-media editor.

355
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,000
who used to be neck to neck with his work skills.

356
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,840
After a few years, he suddenly became his boss.

357
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,240
I guess I couldn't accept it.

358
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,800
so I became an editor.

359
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,440
Okay.

360
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,320
Alarm clock.

361
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,400
According to the previous experience,

362
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,240
Set an alarm

363
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,880
to plan the next move.

364
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,840
It's almost time.

365
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,520
We need to meet Lu Zitired.

366
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,720
I wonder

367
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,240
what he got from Editor Chen.

368
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,960
Let's take a photo.

369
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,560
Let's go.

370
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,280
I can't see anything from the information.

371
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,880
And the truth is not a mainstream media.

372
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,720
How could Editor Chen be willing to be an editor here?

373
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,560
I've heard of it before.

374
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,840
Editor Chen was going to the National Research Institute.

375
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,680
but he failed for some reason.

376
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,880
because of some reasons.

377
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,800
The smell of burning.

378
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,040
This is the burning smell.

379
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,640
This burning smell

380
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,080
This burning smell

381
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,640
came from the elevator.

382
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,040
And

383
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,600
As the elevator goes up,

384
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,480
the smell is getting stronger.

385
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,680
It's burning.

386
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,880
There must be something wrong with the elevator.

387
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,040
The elevator is about to fall.

388
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,640
The window over there

389
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,640
is where Editor Chen used to be.

390
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:45,640
Let's go.

391
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,520
Come with me to the police station.

392
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,640
Let's go. Let go.

393
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,440
Come with me to the police station.

394
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,640
You're the murderer. Let's go.

395
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,480
What are you doing?

396
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,680
You are the murderer.

397
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,600
Lu Zitired.

398
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,440
You...

399
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,600
Hey.

400
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,040
Hey.

401
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,600
Hello.

402
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,520
Who is it?

403
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,000
Give it to me.

404
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,600
Editor Chen is the murderer.

405
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,600
I rushed up and entangled him.

406
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,280
I wanted him to stop the explosion.

407
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,800
But it's too late.

408
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,240
Are you sure

409
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,480
Editor Chen is the one who blew up the elevator?

410
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
I'm sure.

411
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,160
When I tried to talk to him as planned,

412
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,880
he was looking at the watch.

413
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,240
It's like counting down.

414
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,400
It's hard to say

415
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,760
it's hard to say that you're the culprit.

416
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,160
Besides that,

417
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,800
did you find anything else suspicious?

418
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,560
I just wanted to stop him from explosioning the elevator.

419
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,480
I don't care.

420
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,960
If Editor Chen is the murderer,

421
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,360
the reason he stayed in the media building

422
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,240
is to press the elevator explosion mechanism.

423
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,400
But after Lu Zitired and Editor Chen fight,

424
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,800
the elevator exploded.

425
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,360
It wasn't convenient for Editor Chen at that time.

426
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,200
Operating button.

427
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,560
If the explosion doesn't have to be manual,

428
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,600
but automatic,

429
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,640
Then you can go to the cultural museum

430
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,200
to continue the interview.

431
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,640
Why bother?

432
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,640
Come back and count down.

433
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,360
How about this?

434
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,880
Let's meet at the media building later.

435
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,800
Bye.

436
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,000
Okay.

437
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,480
What did he find?

438
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,000
Lu Zitired told me

439
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,440
he saw Editor Chen counting down.

440
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,400
He suspected that he was the one who destroyed the elevator.

441
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,600
He's been looking at his watch.

442
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,160
He's counting down.

443
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,200
Is he really the murderer?

444
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,440
Whether Editor Chen is the murderer or not,

445
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,200
the elevator crash must have something to do with him.

446
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,680
We have to find him as soon as possible.

447
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,400
Editor Chen appeared in the media building

448
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,880
before the elevator exploded,

449
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,600
He might be near the media building now.

450
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,640
Yes.

451
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,800
Let's go to the media building first.

452
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,680
Okay.

453
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
This place is too big.

454
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,800
Let's split up.

455
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,800
Okay.

456
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,360
I'll go check the media building.

457
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,480
You can look outside.

458
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,400
Okay.

459
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Let's go. Okay.

460
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,200
contact me on WeChat.

461
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,280
Okay.

462
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,320
We've searched all over the area. We've searched everywhere.

463
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,680
but I couldn't find him.

464
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,560
There's only the basketball court across the lawn.

465
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,800
Although the basketball court is a bit away from the media building,

466
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,560
but we can't leave this place behind.

467
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,480
Oh.

468
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,520
Hey.

469
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,840
Are you okay?

470
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,840
Ji Jinhee.

471
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,840
You know me?

472
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,080
I can't say we died together.

473
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,199
So I know him.

474
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,600
The school admission office teacher mentioned you.

475
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,960
Oh.

476
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,320
The admission teacher is close to my mom.

477
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,239
But I don't think she'll compliment me like that.

478
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
Are you okay?

479
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,440
I didn't expect that basketball could fly so far.

480
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,920
I'll take you to the infirmary.

481
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,639
What?

482
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,000
No.

483
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,239
I have something to do later.

484
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,080
I have to go.

485
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,320
But you don't look well.

486
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,040
Let me take you to the infirmary.

487
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,719
Let's go.

488
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,320
Jinhee, hurry up.

489
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,600
We're still in the game.

490
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,719
I quit.

491
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,639
I have to take her to the infirmary.

492
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,280
What?

493
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,040
It's already the second half.

494
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,320
We're almost done.

495
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,600
In the previous circulation,

496
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,600
Ji Jinhee was in the elevator.

497
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,880
If he could

498
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,800
to leave,

499
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,440
are you going to the media building across the school?

500
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,600
Yes.

501
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,000
My mom is working there.

502
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,400
I have to find her later.

503
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,880
So this is why Ji Jinhee went to the media building.

504
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,640
How about this?

505
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,720
I have something to do on the fourth floor of the media building.

506
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,200
Come to me on the fourth floor after the game.

507
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,280
and take me to the infirmary.

508
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,040
Are you sure you can do it alone?

509
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,080
Yes, I'm fine.

510
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,560
Let's play a game.

511
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,400
Okay.

512
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,040
I'll definitely come to you.

513
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,880
See you on the fourth floor.

514
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,360
Okay.

515
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,680
Let's fight.

516
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,920
Hello, Luo Yi.

517
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,560
Zheng.

518
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,480
I saw Editor Chen.

519
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,560
Where?

520
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,400
He just came back to school.

521
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,960
We'll be there soon.

522
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,400
I'll be right there.

523
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,360
If Editor Chen was the culprit of the elevator explosion,

524
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,600
he should've waited in the media building.

525
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,000
Why did he rush back?

526
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,520
Let's go find Editor Chen.

527
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,520
Okay.

528
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,920
Meet at the media building.

529
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,720
Pass me.

530
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,600
Defence.

531
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,120
Send someone over.

532
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,120
Mr. Chen.

533
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,360
What?

534
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,200
Aren't you doing an interview at the cultural museum

535
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
Why are you back?

536
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,600
It's the prank text you sent me, right?

537
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,800
What text?

538
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,360
Gosh.

539
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,520
Hurry up

540
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,520
Get out of here.

541
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,920
Don't stay in the media building.

542
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,360
Hey, Editor Chen.

543
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,160
Editor Chen chased us away desperately.

544
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,920
It looks like he really knew the elevator would fall.

545
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,680
But from his performance,

546
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,760
he doesn't look like the murderer.

547
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
Let's go.

548
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,320
Get out of here.

549
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,400
You're the one who blew up the elevator.

550
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,520
There must be a misunderstanding.

551
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,920
Did you receive the text too?

552
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
What text?

553
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,880
This text.

554
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,720
Yes.

555
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,960
I sent someone to check the elevator.

556
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,280
There was no problem.

557
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,880
I thought it was a prank.

558
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,080
But I got another text from him today.

559
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,120
I was afraid something would happen,

560
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,480
So I rushed back.

561
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,680
So you're not counting down?

562
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,680
Who's counting down?

563
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,960
Let me see the watch.

564
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,080
I just want to set the time

565
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,480
to see if this is a prank.

566
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,680
Hey.

567
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,880
How did you know the elevator was going to be in trouble?

568
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,880
We're here to catch someone

569
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,280
We're here to catch him.

570
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,760
Okay. Okay.

571
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,080
Editor Chen.

572
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,040
Do you know who texted you?

573
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,720
I looked it up, but I couldn't find it.

574
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,560
I suspect the students across the school

575
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,960
are under too much pressure.

576
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,880
and made a prank.

577
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,640
So I went to the school psychology consultation room

578
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,480
to see if he knows which students are unstable.

579
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,440
But he didn't gain much.

580
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,680
The students of this school seldom go to the counseling room.

581
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,880
There are only four students since the beginning of school.

582
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,680
Look.

583
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,840
Qin Ze.

584
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,280
He's the alchemist in the elevator.

585
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,080
Qin Ze.

586
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,840
He went to the psychotherapy room.

587
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,080
Qin Ze, the code for texting is Q.

588
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,280
Qin...

589
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,840
Could it be Qin Ze who destroyed the elevator?

590
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,560
Could it be him?

591
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,880
Hey.

592
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,280
Why are you down there?

593
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,880
I almost forgot him.

594
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,520
Wait a minute.

595
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,680
I'll go up and find you.

596
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,480
It's going to explode soon.

597
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,480
Ji Jinhee appeared on the fourth floor.

598
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,160
It means the elevator is out.

599
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,080
If we get on the elevator again,

600
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,480
we'll go back.

601
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,040
No need.

602
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,280
I'll go down and find you.

603
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,840
