1
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,520
Hello. Hello. Hello.

2
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,280
What's up?

3
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,080
Do you know the long-legged lady?

4
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,240
I don't know what you're talking about.

5
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,000
Hey.

6
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,120
You must have misunderstood.

7
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,080
Ms. Long Legs.

8
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,840
It's my donor's name.

9
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,800
She said she had a friend

10
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,000
also at Lincheng University.

11
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,479
A student who likes drawing.

12
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,800
I have a question.

13
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,200
Is it you?

14
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,360
And...

15
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,920
What are you doing here?

16
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,520
I don't know.

17
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,920
I had the same thought before.

18
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,680
But then I gave up.

19
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,280
Because I have a family.

20
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,120
There are a lot of things that don't go your way.

21
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,760
I don't know what you've been through,

22
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,280
Since life exists,

23
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,200
there must be a reason for his existence.

24
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,920
Life is the easiest

25
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,320
and the easiest way to solve problems.

26
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,280
Of course,

27
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,960
the most irresponsible.

28
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,200
If you die like this,

29
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,280
what about your family?

30
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,920
What about those who love you?

31
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,960
You can die without asking about your funeral.

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
But what about them?

33
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,960
They have to wander in pain for a long time.

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,800
Hey.

35
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,800
If you can't get over it,

36
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,600
I think you can open your heart

37
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,920
and talk to your family.

38
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,200
and let them share your burden.

39
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,279
or

40
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,000
if you want,

41
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
you can come to me.

42
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,960
Who are you?

43
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,720
What are you doing in front of the meeting room?

44
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,680
I saw a strange girl

45
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,880
I saw a very strange girl

46
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,720
She was eavesdropping in front of the meeting room.

47
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,880
Are you having a meeting inside?

48
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,920
She asked me out today.

49
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
You asked me out.

50
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,800
Come out!

51
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,880
The elevator is closing.

52
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,159
Follow me.

53
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,280
Follow me.

54
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,800
Who are you?

55
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,000
My name is Tang Xiaotong.

56
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,280
I know what I'm going to say

57
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,760
might make you astonished.

58
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,440
But listen carefully.

59
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,760
In three minutes,

60
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,800
the elevator behind you will fall.

61
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,040
If you were in the elevator,

62
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,679
you'll die too.

63
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,400
We took you out of the elevator.

64
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,000
It seems like we managed to escape.

65
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,600
but it's just the beginning.

66
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,000
You will go back to the circle

67
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,160
and repeat everything that's happening now.

68
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,800
If you're in the circulation,

69
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,840
it will be two hours earlier.

70
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,040
Before that,

71
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,640
we've experienced a cycle.

72
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
more than once.

73
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,400
We're trying to stop the circulation.

74
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,360
What we can think of now

75
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,560
is to stop the elevator from falling.

76
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,640
And we found that

77
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,600
the elevator crash has something to do with your donor.

78
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,400
We want to find her.

79
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
But obviously we couldn't do it.

80
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
to find you.

81
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,160
I know.

82
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,440
you don’t believe what I said.

83
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,240
But it's okay.

84
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,680
When everything starts over,

85
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
If you really go back to the circle,

86
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,680
please contact us.

87
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,040
The elevator will slide twice.

88
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,240
and then fall.

89
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,840
What time was the explosion?

90
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,840
12:43.

91
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,800
[Everything will start again.]

92
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,760
Mom. Dad.

93
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,560
Are you kidding me?

94
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,440
Ah!

95
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,040
Two lives.

96
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,240
Is that all the compensation?

97
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
What about those two kids?

98
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,200
What about the kids?

99
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,800
Say something.

100
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,720
Why aren't you talking?

101
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,560
That family is finished.

102
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,560
Uncle, can I have an apple?

103
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,560
I...

104
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,960
What are you doing?

105
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,760
What are you doing?

106
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,360
Get up. Get up. Get up.

107
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,320
Get up

108
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,240
I'm so unlucky.

109
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,200
I'm going to kill you

110
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,960
I'll kill you today.

111
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,920
How dare you cry?

112
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,640
How dare you cry?

113
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,560
How dare you cry?

114
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
How dare you cry?

115
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,200
Eat!

116
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,960
Xiao Feng.

117
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:47,960
Hey.

118
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,240
Are you okay?

119
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,200
Is my coffee ready?

120
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,720
Just a moment.

121
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,520
Hurry up.

122
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,200
Okay.

123
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,640
Where am I?

124
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,720
It's a circulation again.

125
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,960
It's a circulation.

126
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,000
But it doesn't look like it's circulating.

127
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
Where am I?

128
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,120
Am I dead?

129
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,560
Is everything that happened before just a lie?

130
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,000
I was already dead when the elevator exploded?

131
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,800
No.

132
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,960
This is not my emotion.

133
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,560
Tang Xiaotong

134
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,240
Tang Xiaotong

135
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,840
Tang Xiaotong

136
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,120
Your phone has been ringing for a long time.

137
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,560
You woke me up.

138
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,200
10:43.

139
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,400
Another half an hour earlier.

140
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,720
In other words, Qin Ze successfully entered the circle.

141
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,360
So I went back to two hours ago.

142
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,640
I'm probably still asleep at this time.

143
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,920
Was that depression a dream?

144
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Where are you now?

145
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,560
Dormitory.

146
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,720
Are you okay?

147
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,200
I'm fine.

148
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,760
I did my homework too late last night.

149
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,839
I was still sleeping when I woke up.

150
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,800
I couldn't get over it.

151
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,920
Where are you?

152
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,160
In front of your dormitory.

153
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,640
Oh.

154
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,359
Wait for me.

155
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,599
I'll be right down.

156
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,880
Luo Yi.

157
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,880
I just got on the highway.

158
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,560
It will take about an hour and a half.

159
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,600
Don't forget to form a group chat.

160
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,600
Okay.

161
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,960
I'll join the group chat now. Bye.

162
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
You're here.

163
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,160
I was naked when I woke up.

164
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,080
I was about to take a shower.

165
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,400
You scared me.

166
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,440
Put on your clothes and come here.

167
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,120
What do you think?

168
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,960
Where are we going?

169
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,640
The coffee shop Qin Ze is in.

170
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,680
Brother.

171
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,240
You're the first person I've ever seen

172
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,920
who keeps working.

173
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,080
Since you came to the cafe last time,

174
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,680
you will come again this time.

175
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,960
Let's go somewhere else.

176
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,160
Follow me.

177
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,240
We have no clue about the cause of the elevator crash.

178
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,240
If the long-legged lady is in the circulation,

179
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,240
she and we had the same reason.

180
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,640
I'll investigate with you.

181
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
the information of the donor.

182
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,560
How much

183
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,920
about her?

184
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,320
The long-legged lady is anonymous.

185
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,600
We checked at the school sponsor center before.

186
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,040
To find out her identity,

187
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,160
but there was only one letter she wrote.

188
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,600
There was nothing else

189
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,560
nothing else.

190
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,360
The remittance information is a few screenshots.

191
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,840
There's no real information on it.

192
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,120
It should be anonymous remittance.

193
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,160
It's a bank card now.

194
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,320
Why can't I find it?

195
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,280
It could be a TM transfer.

196
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,960
If the recipient

197
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,920
doesn't want the receiver to see his information,

198
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,880
You can choose ATM to wire money without credit.

199
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,280
Like this.

200
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,760
The receiver can only see the receiver's number.

201
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,280
I can't see anything else.

202
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,520
It can be like this.

203
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,720
Did you see the bank account

204
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,360
on the screen?

205
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,320
0219.

206
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,160
All the screenshots I saw

207
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,560
on all screenshots.

208
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,040
The bank near the school.

209
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,680
In other words,

210
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,120
the long-legged lady wired money near the school.

211
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,440
There are two possibilities.

212
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,920
First, she lives nearby.

213
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,000
Second,

214
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,240
she could be a classmate or a teacher.

215
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,920
There's a supermarket next to the bank near the school.

216
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
If we can get the CCTV,

217
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,320
we might find it.

218
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,200
Sister long legs.

219
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,120
I'm familiar with the supermarket owner. I can try.

220
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,680
This one.

221
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,720
Three yuan.

222
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
The boss looks very easy-going.

223
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,840
It won't be hard to communicate, right?

224
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
Uncle Chen is nice.

225
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,080
But it's not good for us to go there alone.

226
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,560
Come with me.

227
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,680
Let's just say we dropped something when we passed by.

228
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,480
Check the CCTV.

229
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,040
Come with me.

230
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,680
Girls should talk nicely.

231
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,720
Okay.

232
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,320
Will you wait here or...

233
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,760
There's CCTV over there too.

234
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,680
It's a bit far,

235
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,280
but we might get something.

236
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
Let's go over there.

237
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,160
Okay.

238
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,520
Let's meet at the milk tea shop later.

239
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,840
Uncle Chen.

240
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,680
Hey, Xi.

241
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,400
What brings you here today?

242
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,360
Girlfriend?

243
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,480
No, no.

244
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,960
Hey.

245
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,080
Hey,

246
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,320
I misunderstood.

247
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,520
Uncle Chen.

248
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,520
She

249
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,880
dropped a notebook on the road ahead of you.

250
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,840
Yes.

251
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,880
That notebook is not important.

252
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,240
But the information inside is important.

253
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,920
So I want to see if I can adjust the CCTV here.

254
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,000
Is it convenient?

255
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,520
Okay.

256
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,040
It's your study information, right?

257
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,080
Yes.

258
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,960
But my surveillance

259
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,240
has only one week.

260
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,120
It will be covered after this period.

261
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,880
In the next few days,

262
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,880
we should be able to check

263
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,680
Let's calculate the time for the long-legged lady to wire the money.

264
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,680
It was around a week.

265
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,040
It's okay. What if we can find it?

266
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,840
Okay, let's go inside.

267
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,000
We don't know the CCTV.

268
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,000
Okay.

269
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,440
This way.

270
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,240
Okay, it's all here.

271
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,120
See for yourselves.

272
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,240
I'll get back to work.

273
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,040
Okay.

274
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,000
Here.

275
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,680
Do you remember the last payment?

276
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,760
April 24, 2024, 3:15 minutes and 27 seconds.

277
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,240
Isn't she the long-legged lady?

278
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,760
Why are they both men

279
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,440
I don't know.

280
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,080
Let's look down.

281
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,880
The security cameras in front are all covered.

282
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,240
These two are the only ones we can see.

283
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,360
But it's hard to tell

284
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,840
what they have to do with the long-legged sister.

285
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,120
Like this.

286
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,640
Give me your phone.

287
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,720
Go ask Uncle Chen.

288
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,040
Uncle Chen, do you remember this person?

289
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,760
This man

290
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,520
He sells sushi next door.

291
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,840
from Jiangxi.

292
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,680
He's quite diligent.

293
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,320
He made money and went back to his hometown to buy a house.

294
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,440
Maybe his glutinous rice was sold out that day.

295
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,840
so he was going to buy it again.

296
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,480
and bought a pack of cigarettes from my supermarket.

297
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,080
Okay, thank you, Uncle Chen.

298
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,880
You're welcome.

299
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,160
Uncle Chen, we're leaving.

300
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,840
Okay.

301
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,920
Come again.

302
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,360
Ah.

303
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,880
Bye.

304
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,280
I think we can eliminate him now.

305
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,920
The only one left is the man who can't see his face.

306
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,360
It's just too far away.

307
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,080
It's no use just looking at him.

308
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,720
Besides, he has never been to a supermarket.

309
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,640
Uncle Chen has no impression of him.

310
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,760
Let's go.

311
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,880
You're back.

312
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,280
What's going on over there?

313
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,760
We saw that the CCTV wasn't heading towards the ATM.

314
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,160
But at that time,

315
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,360
at that time.

316
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,120
I don't know who went there.

317
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,280
The bag in his hand

318
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,560
is exactly the same as

319
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,520
who can't see his face.

320
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
Look at this stain.

321
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,080
This man.

322
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,280
The man we saw came out of the ATM machine was him

323
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,440
A man

324
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,960
She didn't say she must be a girl

325
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,760
Maybe

326
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,040
he's a man who likes long legs.

327
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,160
There's only one clue.

328
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,080
There's no progress.

329
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,960
This is the bag of the Green Fruit Scholarship.

330
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,280
This is the scholarship

331
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,120
from Lincheng University.

332
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,560
There are ten places in total.

333
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,440
Qingguo Scholarship

334
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,240
is quite famous in Lincheng University.

335
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,640
I've heard about it before.

336
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,520
I won the Math Olympiad Award this year.

337
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,080
and I was awarded the Green Fruit Scholarship.

338
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,080
I have this bag.

339
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,840
I won this award too.

340
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,360
The prize money and gifts are indeed in this bag.

341
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,640
This man could have won this award

342
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,360
or a relative of the winner.

343
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,240
Not necessarily an uncle.

344
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,280
Maybe it's a boy or a male teacher.

345
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,480
But I can't tell his age from his back.

346
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,520
But his back is slimmer.

347
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,720
He looks more like a student.

348
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,720
It's the CCTV. It's so unclear.

349
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,520
Green Fruit Scholarship.

350
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,760
There are only ten winners.

351
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,760
to get rid of me and Qin Ze.

352
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,240
If we eliminate the remaining eight,

353
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,880
we can find out who this long-legged lady is.

354
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,040
There's always a list of scholarship.

355
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,160
The release date of this year should be

356
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,840
more than a month ago.

357
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,320
If that's the case,

358
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,240
there should be records on the official website.

359
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,240
Let me check.

360
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,840
I knew it.

361
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,040
Except you two,

362
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,680
and the Department of Management.

363
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,600
Law school.

364
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,160
[College of Education, Psychology, Sports] Humanities.

365
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,840
Foreign Language.

366
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,800
from different faculties like Lin College.

367
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,800
It seems that there are basically one place in one faculty.

368
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,800
The main point is fairness.

369
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,880
To find the owner of the bag as soon as possible,

370
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,080
I suggest the four of us split up.

371
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,840
I wonder how Lu Zitired is doing.

372
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,200
He should be here soon.

373
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
When he arrives,

374
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,680
let him investigate the rest.

375
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,800
I'll look into it now.

376
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,640
education school

377
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,480
and a foreign language school.

378
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,560
I'll check the Department of Humanities and Forest.

379
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,280
I'll take care of the gym.

380
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,640
I'll take care of

381
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,440
and law school.

382
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,240
Okay.

383
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
Let's move.

384
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,000
Hello?

385
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,200
I'm a reporter from Advisor Media.

386
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
My name is Tang Xiaotong.

387
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,480
Recently,

388
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,400
we are interviewing students

389
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
for students who got the Guoguo Scholarship.

390
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,840
Are you free at school?

391
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,880
Wasn't the Green Fruit Scholarship long released?

392
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,400
What took you so long?

393
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,400
We

394
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,080
are gathering for Lincheng University.

395
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,200
My company was busy last month.

396
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,040
It was supposed to be last week.

397
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,040
That's why it's been delayed.

398
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,400
I wonder if you have time for an interview.

399
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,800
But I'm not at school now.

400
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,760
I have a day off tomorrow.

401
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,560
I don't have class in the afternoon. I'm already home.

402
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,680
When you go back to school,

403
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,560
Can you bring some certificates

404
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,360
with me?

405
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,960
Do you keep that bag well?

406
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,360
Is there a stain on it?

407
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,880
No.

408
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,600
I just lost the bag.

409
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,840
Other things are still here.

410
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,800
Oh.

411
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,240
Like this.

412
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,640
Are you still going to do the interview?

413
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,160
I'll call you when you get back to school.

414
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,560
Hello?

415
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
I'm a reporter from Advisor.

416
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,880
My name is Tang Xiaotong.

417
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,240
I've excluded both of them.

418
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,400
I don't know how the investigation went.

419
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,680
I know him well.

420
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,040
It took me a lot of effort to find him.

421
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,040
We found the bag.

422
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,960
No problem.

423
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,040
I found both of them.

424
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,000
The bag is here too.

425
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,880
No problem.

426
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,000
I've ruled out the student from the Department of Humanities.

427
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,200
The other student hasn't replied yet.

428
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,400
Hello, I've reached the psychology faculty

429
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,160
and contacted that student.

430
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,600
The photo was sent.

431
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,200
There's no stain.

432
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,400
So,

433
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,640
Now all the bags are removed.

434
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,680
Except the one Lu Zitired is contacting.

435
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,360
he is the only hope.

436
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,760
He's a psychology student.

437
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,320
It sounds like a boy.

438
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,640
We saw his back in the CCTV.

439
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,560
He looks like a man too.

440
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,560
I don't know if it's him.

441
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,320
I wonder how Lu Zitired is doing.

442
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,320
We can't just wait here.

443
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,600
Let's meet Lu Zitired at the psychology faculty.

444
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,560
OK.

445
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,880
Zheng.

446
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,360
I've asked him.

447
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,000
He packed a bag of fruit back that day.

448
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,600
and gave it to a friend

449
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,720
named Jang Chi.

450
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Which neighborhood is it?

451
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,240
Dongzhou Garden.

452
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,920
The address is...

453
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,040
Building 19, Unit 3, Unit 1902.

454
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,200
Let's go together.

455
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,800
What brings you here?

456
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,080
Hello, ma'am.

457
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,160
We're Jang Chi's friends.

458
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,840
Is he home?

459
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,280
My son.

460
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,640
He went to college in another province.

461
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,160
He'll be back tomorrow.

462
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,480
We are students of Lincheng University.

463
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,480
My son told me

464
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,159
he has a friend at Lincheng University.

465
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,120
Auntie,

466
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,040
Are you talking about Guo Zihao from psychology?

467
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,360
He asked us to find Zhang Chi.

468
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,840
Didn't Guo Zihao have a bag before the award?

469
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,159
We need it for the shooting.

470
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,199
Is it at home?

471
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,840
Oh, I see.

472
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,400
What kind of bag?

473
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,199
I clean up Osamu's stuff.

474
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,000
If you're home, I can help you find it.

475
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,040
It's a green sailing bag.

476
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,800
There's a pear mark on it.

477
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,440
That green bag.

478
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,360
Osamu used it to pack fruit.

479
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,280
I put some peaches in it. I sent it to the neighbors upstairs.

480
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,360
Is this bag important?

481
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,440
It's upstairs.

482
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,239
2103.

483
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,560
Should I go upstairs and ask?

484
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,160
Don't bother.

485
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,280
We can go there by ourselves later.

486
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,680
Let me take you upstairs.

487
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,680
Something happened to his family last week.

488
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,000
What happened?

489
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,800
Last week,

490
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,880
his son jumped into the sea and died.

491
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,800
What?

492
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,160
What a pity.

493
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,360
That kid is obedient

494
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,600
and very sensible.

495
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,640
His father

496
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,600
fell off the building

497
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,960
fell off the building and died.

498
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,760
That incident was...

499
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,200
Eyes.

500
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,080
Eyes what?

501
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,520
Eyes truth.

502
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,160
Yes, the truth.

503
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,320
The truth of the eyes

504
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,920
It's trending.

505
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,520
and made a big fuss.

506
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,720
I know.

507
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,240
The netizens are very angry with the security guards.

508
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
Some time ago,

509
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,360
many people came to his house to deliver flowers.

510
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,360
It's all over the corridors.

511
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,040
It's crowded here.

512
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,720
Poor mother and son.

513
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,120
They just lost their husbands.

514
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,920
Father.

515
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,440
[was hit by cyber violence again.]

516
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,040
Our neighbors

517
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,160
avoid them.

518
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,840
Our families are close.

519
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,160
I could only sneak up there.

520
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,360
In the end, he couldn't stand it.

521
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,560
He jumped off from the sea near the community.

522
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,520
Is the person who jumped into the sea Song HaoMiao?

523
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,000
Yes, his name is Song HaoMiao.

524
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,480
Who would have thought

525
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,160
he suddenly disappeared.

526
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,240
Poor his mother.

527
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,360
He hasn't recovered from the pain of losing his husband.

528
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,760
He lost his son again.

529
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,960
The police said

530
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,960
he might have depression.

531
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,440
Online violence is the last straw to crush him.

532
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:23,960
Oh.

533
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,360
What a good kid.

534
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,360
so obedient and sensible.

535
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,840
He's very polite every time he sees me.

536
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:33,800
