1
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,000
So

2
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,800
Ji Jinhee.

3
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,000
You are the weirdest person

4
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,120
I've ever met.

5
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:40,400
You look more rational than many people,

6
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,680
But you have sympathy

7
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,080
for someone.

8
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,960
Are you a liberal arts student

9
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,000
or a science student?

10
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,000
Are you looking for this?

11
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,000
Unfortunately,

12
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,680
I told Luo Yi

13
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,960
you went missing.

14
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,360
So...

15
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,560
I can't give you my phone for now.

16
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,240
You killed Song HaoMiao's family.

17
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,840
How could you be so heartless?

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,440
Answer my question first.

19
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,079
Are you a science student or a liberal arts student?

20
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,840
I can't be entangled with him in such a boring question.

21
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,200
Calm him down first.

22
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,160
Liberal arts.

23
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,079
But I prefer science.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,800
It's just that if you have good memory in liberal arts, you can get a high score.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So I chose liberal arts.

26
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,200
No wonder.

27
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,880
Although

28
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,840
you look rational,

29
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,040
but you will be affected by emotions.

30
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
For example,

31
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,360
you made a wrong judgment

32
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
because you pity me.

33
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,760
Why did you do that?

34
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,160
Why?

35
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,840
As you know,

36
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,960
Song HaoMiao's father took the blame for me.

37
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,240
So I want to stop you from investigating the truth.

38
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
The elevator exploded.

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,160
Did you do it?

40
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,280
You want to ask

41
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,280
how this cycle was created?

42
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,399
I also want to know how this cycle started.

43
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,280
The swap was fine.

44
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,800
no one will know, right?

45
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,160
Not for the time being.

46
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,840
Do you think it doesn't exist?

47
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,440
What does it have to do with you?

48
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,960
If you weren't forced to enter the circle,

49
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,400
would you care about Song HaoMiao?

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,000
Would you care about Song Liang?

51
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,240
You don't care

52
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
whether they're dead or alive.

53
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,400
You are the one

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,880
is you, right?

55
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,080
Mind your own business.

56
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,320
I can understand

57
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,680
I understand.

58
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,840
But why can I feel Ji Jinhee’s depression?

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,800
Depression?

60
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,160
Is this the emotion of a murderer

61
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,760
who actively deprives others' hard work?

62
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,600
You said

63
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,080
if someone dies in the circulation,

64
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,040
no one knows if he can wake up next time.

65
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,600
Maybe

66
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,320
this is the last round.

67
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,040
I have to live now.

68
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,120
Otherwise, as Ji Jinhee said,

69
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,560
no one knows

70
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,800
will be resurrected in the next round.

71
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,640
But this is also what Ji Jinhee needs to consider.

72
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,960
So in the end,

73
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,800
Whether it’s Ji Jinhee

74
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,000
or us,

75
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
We have the same goal.

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,120
Stop the circulation!

77
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,440
The elevator exploded.

78
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,520
Did you do it?

79
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,040
The circulation we've been through

80
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,080
was caused by the explosion.

81
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,800
But if you didn't do it,

82
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,760
who would it be?

83
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,640
Song HaoMiao?

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,560
What nonsense are you talking about?

85
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,200
You were in the elevator too.

86
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,480
If you wanted to cover up the truth,

87
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,520
you wouldn't have let yourself die in the elevator.

88
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,159
So you're not the one

89
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
was not you.

90
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,440
but someone else.

91
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,159
Maybe he wants to kill you

92
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,360
to avenge Song HaoMiao.

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,240
What else do you want to say?

94
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,880
So you've been cooperating with us

95
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,280
you were always cooperating.

96
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,200
Because you want to know

97
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,960
who caused the elevator explosion.

98
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,480
wants to get out of this endless loop.

99
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,800
So even if you've reached Song HaoMiao,

100
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,560
and the truth you wanted to hide,

101
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,880
You didn't stop

102
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,000
You just followed us

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,400
to find out the real murderer.

104
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,040
But you didn't expect

105
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,000
we would follow what happened

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
along Song HaoMiao's case.

107
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,560
When we were about to get the answer,

108
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,600
you started to stop us.

109
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,400
You even killed and set fire.

110
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,680
You're disgusting.

111
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,800
In a sense,

112
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,040
your mental capacity is extraordinary.

113
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,360
After the fire,

114
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,440
and came back to us as if nothing happened.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,400
If I hadn't found the evidence,

116
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,160
you exposed yourself,

117
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
I didn't know you were behind it.

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,280
You know too much.

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,400
You're quite cautious.

120
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,640
You turned off your phone when it was set.

121
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,880
This is a teaching building?

122
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,200
How did Ji Jinhee get me here from the media building?

123
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,600
Did Ji Jinhee leave?

124
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,120
What should I do?

125
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,160
Call for help?

126
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,160
The first floor of the teaching office is not a place to be lively.

127
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,720
Can you call someone for help?

128
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
What if Ji Jinhee gets attention?

129
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,640
Let’s think of another way.

130
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Ji Jinhee won’t set fire again, right?

131
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,160
In my current situation,

132
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,080
I'm going to die here.

133
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,200
My phone is not with me right now.

134
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,800
I don't know what time it is.

135
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,880
The most important thing now is to inform Luo Yi and Qin Ze.

136
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,080
I don't know where Ji Jinxi has gone.

137
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,560
What if he went to find them?

138
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,800
they still don’t know who Ji Jinhee is.

139
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,080
What if they were fooled by Ji Jinhee?

140
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,240
What if something happens to them?

141
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,920
what should we do?

142
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,400
Can't get through?

143
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,800
No.

144
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,680
Luo Yi.

145
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,280
I think it's possible.

146
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,680
Ji Jinhee deliberately opened the tap

147
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,000
to make us think they are still in the media building.

148
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,640
Let's push it back.

149
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,480
Are they not here anymore?

150
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,160
It's through.

151
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,720
Hello?

152
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,200
Hello.

153
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
I'm a student from Lincheng University.

154
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,200
I picked up this phone.

155
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,920
In the field of the art center.

156
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
Art center.

157
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,120
The clues we have now

158
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,520
has nothing to do with the art center.

159
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,040
Why is it there?

160
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,760
Did you lose it?

161
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,560
Can you pick it up now?

162
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,640
I have other things to do later.

163
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,440
Ah.

164
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,520
It's me.

165
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,720
Well...

166
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,720
Wait for me.

167
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,560
I'll be right there.

168
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,520
Thank you.

169
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,200
The Art Center is so far away.

170
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,840
Why are they going there?

171
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,640
There must be something wrong.

172
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,720
How about this?

173
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
Let's split into two groups.

174
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,160
You go to the art center first.

175
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,560
I'll look for it in the media building.

176
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:23,960
Okay.

177
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,680
Be careful.

178
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,480
Okay.

179
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,960
Hey.

180
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,400
Did you pick it up?

181
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,960
I picked it up.

182
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,000
Thank you.

183
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,480
Who are you?

184
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,080
Did you see this phone when you came here?

185
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,480
No.

186
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,680
The phone is muted.

187
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,840
No vibration.

188
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,400
But we often slack off

189
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,560
This is a must.

190
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,360
So I saw this phone at first sight.

191
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,160
Well,

192
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,800
did you see anyone else?

193
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,040
No.

194
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,920
But a sports student

195
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,760
pushed the trolley to the art building.

196
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,520
and transported some equipment.

197
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,360
Okay.

198
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,160
I see.

199
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,040
Thank you.

200
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,200
You're welcome.

201
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,400
If there's nothing else,

202
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
I'll get back to work.

203
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,560
Bye.

204
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,560
It's so close to the building.

205
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,800
There are some equipment in the art building

206
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,840
in the basement of the classroom.

207
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,160
The sports girl mentioned

208
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,560
must have transported some equipment from the church building.

209
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,960
Do you think

210
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,040
they would be in the art building?

211
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,760
If Tang was in the art building,

212
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,360
Why did she drop her phone here?

213
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,960
And...

214
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,760
in order to get in touch with us,

215
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,320
she might have her phone.

216
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,960
I don't think I'll drop it when I walk.

217
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,200
One more thing.

218
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,560
I can understand her vibration.

219
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,160
But why did you mute it?

220
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,320
Did something happen to her here?

221
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,200
I don't think so.

222
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,120
It's too obvious.

223
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,160
Even if something happens,

224
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,000
the suspect won't do it here.

225
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,960
I think

226
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,960
something happened to Tang.

227
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,800
Then his phone was left here.

228
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,640
Think about it.

229
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,200
When we called her at first,

230
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,360
Her phone was off.

231
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,360
That means something happened to her.

232
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,720
We looked for her for a few minutes,

233
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,400
[and called again.]

234
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,360
I just got through.

235
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,720
Then I found my phone here.

236
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,760
Do you feel that

237
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,960
the suspect deliberately led us to a wrong place?

238
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,520
I'll try to turn on her phone

239
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,240
to find some clues.

240
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,240
No.

241
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Her password is...

242
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,920
Try her birthday.

243
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,560
Okay.

244
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,359
It's open.

245
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,800
Her phone.

246
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,160
was turned off before.

247
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,640
Then it turned on automatically.

248
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,720
She's not in the studio.

249
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,520
or the media building.

250
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,560
She can only be in the teaching building.

251
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,760
Someone must have turned off her phone.

252
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,720
She put her phone

253
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,000
on the plank truck that transports equipment.

254
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,760
The cadet dropped his phone

255
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,720
he dropped his phone here.

256
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,360
Yes.

257
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,200
To the church building.

258
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,960
Ji Jinhee.

259
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,360
Did he come back to silence me?

260
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,600
If I die,

261
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,720
If I can't come back to life again,

262
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,200
the truth will be buried.

263
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,040
Luo Yi, Qin Ze and Lu Zitired

264
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,440
don't know who Ji Jinxi really is.

265
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,120
It’s hard to tell what will happen to them.

266
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,920
No.

267
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,160
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

268
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,560
I can't die here.

269
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,400
Min!

270
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,360
Zheng!

271
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,920
It's okay.

272
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,760
It's dangerous here.

273
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,600
It's inconvenient to talk.

274
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,440
Let's go somewhere else.

275
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,560
Zheng.

276
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,800
What happened just now?

277
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
I found the case of Song HaoMiao's father's fall.

278
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,120
The real murderer they're protecting

279
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,120
Ji Jinhee.

280
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,560
What?

281
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,320
So,

282
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,560
That number is indeed the chief editor of Eye-Eye Truth, Jo Jin-jin.

283
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,400
I guess you already knew.

284
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
That's Jo Jin's personal number.

285
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,360
That's why I couldn't find it on the list.

286
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,080
Previously,

287
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,040
Ji Jinhee told me

288
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,400
But I thought

289
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,600
his mother was involved in the fall.

290
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
and wanted to go to his mother's office

291
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,360
to find evidence.

292
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,960
But I didn’t expect that video was found.

293
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,960
The real culprit in the video was Ji Jinhee.

294
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,520
He was trying to help her,

295
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,800
But he...

296
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,200
Maybe Ji Jinhee knew it too.

297
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,960
I would find that video sooner or later.

298
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,160
I put sleeping pills in the mineral water.

299
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,320
After that,

300
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,760
I was tied to the storage room on the first floor of the teaching office.

301
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,200
Was the elevator explosion also done by Ji Jinhee?

302
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,400
I don't think so.

303
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,080
He seems to want to stop the circulation.

304
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,800
So he didn't stop

305
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,040
he didn't stop it.

306
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,360
But I found that

307
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,160
Ji Jinxi seems to be very sensitive to Song HaoMiao.

308
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,840
According to his reaction,

309
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,600
I have a guess.

310
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
Maybe before the fall,

311
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,840
Ji Jinxi knew Song HaoMiao.

312
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,760
They knew each other before.

313
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,600
I just guessed it through his reaction.

314
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,400
But...

315
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,200
This can't prove

316
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
the elevator explosion has nothing to do with Ji Jinhee.

317
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,760
I asked him this question before.

318
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,160
He didn't answer me.

319
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,160
But he wanted Song Hao Miao's father to take the blame for him.

320
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,960
he didn't have to do it.

321
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,800
Because he was in the elevator.

322
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,040
He killed and set fire to cover up the truth.

323
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,440
I don’t believe he would do such a thing.

324
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,480
Maybe

325
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,440
this has something to do with Song HaoMiao.

326
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,560
You mean

327
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,720
the elevator exploded

328
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,400
someone wanted to avenge Song HaoMiao and his father.

329
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,560
And this person knows

330
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,000
Ji Jinhee

331
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,760
the real culprit of the fall case.

332
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,600
It's possible.

333
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,760
Song HaoMiao's mother

334
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,520
doesn't know the truth of the fall.

335
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,920
The most heartbreaking person

336
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,520
his mother

337
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,680
is his mother.

338
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,520
Her husband died and lost her son.

339
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,920
She might

340
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,840
she might blow up the elevator at all costs.

341
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,640
and avenge her.

342
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,360
Except her,

343
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,640
other than her.

344
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
But Song HaoMiao's mother

345
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,360
didn't know her husband was taking the blame for others.

346
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
Otherwise, when she found out the truth,

347
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,360
she wouldn't have been so upset.

348
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,760
Maybe someone else is investigating this.

349
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,520
and found out the truth.

350
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,760
This person should know Song HaoMiao.

351
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,520
If there is someone else

352
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,480
wants to avenge Song HaoMiao,

353
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,240
he must leave clues in his life.

354
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,840
How about

355
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,640
go to Song HaoMiao's house to find clues?

356
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,240
Maybe

357
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,480
leave some traces.

358
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,920
We have to contact Lu Zitired first.

359
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,240
He's too dangerous.

360
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,160
I wonder if he has his phone.

361
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,520
I need to recharge myself.

362
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,160
I'll call him first.

363
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:05,760
Luo Yi.

364
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,720
Lend me your phone.

365
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,720
I have your phone.

366
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,160
Someone picked up your phone.

367
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,440
Ji Jinhee took my phone.

368
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,560
But luckily,

369
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,760
I set an automatic switch.

370
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,160
You called in as soon as it turned on.

371
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,200
I'll contact Lu Zitired first.

372
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,920
I can't get through.

373
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,440
If we can’t get through,

374
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,200
Ji Jinhee can’t get through either.

375
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Lu Zitired should be safe in a short time.

376
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,160
How about this?

377
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,360
To save time,

378
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,440
we'll act separately.

379
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,320
You go to Song HaoMiao's house to investigate.

380
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,520
I'll go find Lu Zitired.

381
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,720
Okay.

382
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,840
Keep in touch.

383
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,360
Be careful.

384
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,320
Let's go.

385
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Who are you?

386
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,680
Hello, aunt.

387
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,240
We are Hao Miao's friends.

388
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,560
We want to see you.

389
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,320
So you're Haomiao's friend.

390
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
Come in.

391
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,400
Auntie.

392
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,960
I bought you some fruits.

393
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,560
Thank you.

394
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,280
Auntie.

395
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,880
We are also very sad

396
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,800
about what happened to him.

397
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,320
Can we see his photo?

398
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,400
When we graduated,

399
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,440
we wrote the alumni record together.

400
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,360
In his room.

401
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,920
Come with me.

402
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,360
This drawer

403
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,760
are in this drawer.

404
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,640
Take your time.

405
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,960
I'll get you some water.

406
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,240
Thank you.

407
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,720
Thank you.

408
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,960
Song Haomiao

409
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,200
is very similar to his mother.

410
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,560
Maybe it's because he met his mother many times.

411
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,760
When I first saw this photo,

412
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,360
I felt

413
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,360
a familiar feeling.

414
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,640
If there wasn't a fall,

415
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,360
the three of them

416
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,360
must be very happy now.

417
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,160
The truth.

418
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,760
Ji Jinhee

419
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,160
They ruined a good family.

420
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,840
They will be punished.

421
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,800
Hello?

422
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,800
Officer Xia.

423
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,120
Ah.

424
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,440
Ah.

425
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,760
Thank you.

426
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,720
If you find it,

427
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,280
when you find it.

428
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,960
My phone will be on all day.

429
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,960
Okay.

430
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,520
Keep looking.

431
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,360
There's a photo here.

432
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,400
Song HaoMiao and Ji Jinxi formed a band together.

433
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,760
Thank you.

434
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,160
I used to like music.

435
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,040
In order to take the college entrance exam,

436
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,720
we stopped him.

437
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,680
I used to think

438
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,680
we did it for his own good.

439
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,760
Now that I think about it,

440
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,520
I'd rather he do what he wants to do.

441
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,160
Auntie.

442
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,560
Do you know

443
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,760
Do you know him?

444
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,640
No.

445
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Once,

446
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,440
he didn't go home at night.

447
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,320
His dad asked someone to look for him everywhere.

448
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,600
and found him in an underground bar.

449
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,320
These people

450
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,560
playing music together.

451
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,440
I heard

452
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,160
you're quite famous.

453
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,360
Auntie.

454
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,760
Do you remember

455
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,640
the name of the bar?

456
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,360
It's over there.

457
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,960
I think so.

458
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,880
Don't regret the bar.

459
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,000
Handsome and pretty.

460
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,400
We're not open yet.

461
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,360
We have to be late.

462
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:21,960
Hello.

463
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,040
We want to ask you about a band.

464
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,600
Look.

465
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,880
Do you know this band?

466
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,160
Ah.

467
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,560
I know these people.

468
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
How many high school students are playing music?

469
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,920
and formed a band.

470
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,040
It's called square hour.

471
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,600
Oh.

472
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,640
We’re looking for this person and this person.

473
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,400
The vocal is Solo.

474
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,600
is Mr. Choi’s younger brother.

475
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,640
He's right here.

476
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,720
Please wait a moment.

477
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,120
Solo.

478
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Someone is looking for you.

479
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,560
What did you say?

480
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,760
Song HaoMiao is dead.

481
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,160
When?

482
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,120
His reaction

483
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,640
doesn't seem

484
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
he didn't seem to know about Song Haomiao's death.

485
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
Last week,

486
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,520
he jumped into the sea and committed suicide.

487
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,960
Ah!

488
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,600
How could this happen?

489
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,120
A year ago,

490
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,320
I formed a band with my friends.

491
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,720
We often played together.

492
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,360
It's just that

493
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,720
My grades are average.

494
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,160
and my family is poor.

495
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,320
I stopped studying after high school.

496
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,640
I came to work at a bar with my brother.

497
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,800
Have you contacted him recently?

498
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,160
The one in the photo?

499
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:06,960
Yes.

500
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,920
His name is Qiao Yuze.

501
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,960
He has been abroad for a year.

502
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,800
He's not in China.

503
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,440
He comes from a good family.

504
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,120
but his grades are average.

505
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,040
So his college entrance exam score is not out yet.

506
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,560
His parents tried to send him abroad.

507
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,159
That's strange.

508
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,719
There are only a few Song HaoMiao's friends.

509
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,159
But they don't even know what happened to him.

510
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,760
Who is the person who avenged Song HaoMiao?

511
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,360
This is

512
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,840
It's Song Haoming's, right? Yes.

513
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,840
Yes.

514
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,159
Can I have a look?

515
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,920
Sure.

516
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,360
I really miss it.

517
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,040
Song Haomiao wrote songs here.

518
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,000
What are you humming?

519
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,200
