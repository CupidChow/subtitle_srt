1
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,800
It's possible.

2
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,480
This is the last circulation.

3
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,080
I hope everyone is safe.

4
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,160
and find the real culprit.

5
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,840
That's our school's sponsor center.

6
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,039
I moved here

7
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,039
so I moved here.

8
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,480
No need to go there

9
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,640
These are the only rooms.

10
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,880
Let's look for them separately.

11
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,680
I'll go over there.

12
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,240
Really?

13
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,160
No.

14
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,400
Really?

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,440
Hey.

16
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,400
Hey.

17
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,840
What are you doing here?

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,720
Mr. Jang.

19
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,120
We'd like to ask Ms. Jang Qun-young

20
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,280
about the scholarship.

21
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,920
Are you Qin Ze?

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,160
No wonder you look so familiar.

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,880
Mr. Jang's office

24
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,600
It's at the corner over there.

25
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,200
The first office is

26
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,240
Oh.

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,040
Thank you

28
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,040
The assistant center is in this building.

29
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,400
Many students are confused when they come here.

30
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,520
We'll move back

31
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,680
we'll move back.

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,600
Go ahead.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,480
I'm leaving.

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:25,960
Okay.

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,200
Bye.

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,480
Hey.

37
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,000
I think

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,920
we should split up.

39
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,840
Five people are too obvious.

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,520
It's not safe to separate.

41
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,440
The last round was too dangerous.

42
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,480
I didn't experience it myself,

43
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,200
but when I think about it,

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,240
Yes.

45
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,320
Since we entered the circle together,

46
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,000
we should be good when we break the loop.

47
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,520
[Safety is more important]

48
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
safety is more important.

49
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,840
But think about it.

50
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,600
It just begins to loop.

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,200
No one knows what we are doing.

52
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,920
the murderer wouldn't have come to us directly.

53
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,440
I think it was found by the murderer

54
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,640
during the investigation.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,240
We should be careful this time.

56
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:19,800
How about this?

57
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,160
Let's split into two groups.

58
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,000
But don't act alone.

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,640
If someone was guarding the door,

60
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,520
he wouldn't have shown up.

61
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,120
what happened in the circulation.

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,800
Find the contact list within five minutes.

63
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,680
I agree.

64
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,640
I...

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,440
want to team up with Tang Xiaotong.

66
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,840
I still think it's not safe to be apart.

67
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,920
Now we don't know if it's true or not.

68
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,120
if it's true or not.

69
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,840
What if the murderer is here?

70
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,000
But we have to find the contact list as soon as possible.

71
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,600
If we split up, we'll be faster than five.

72
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,360
Zheng.

73
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,560
I'll team up with you.

74
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,480
Okay.

75
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,200
Oh.

76
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,480
It's my turn to team up with Tang Xiaotong.

77
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,880
Don't fight with me this time.

78
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,440
Let's go.

79
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,840
Hey.

80
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,839
Let's go upstairs.

81
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,480
Okay.

82
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,640
Stay here for a while.

83
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,720
I'll go in and check.

84
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,240
I know whose number it is.

85
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,240
Who?

86
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,440
The last loop.

87
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,400
I've seen Qin Ze.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,240
Qin Ze.

89
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,240
Isn't that Editor Chen?

90
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,680
No.

91
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
This isn't Editor Chen's number.

92
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,440
And he's a man.

93
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,680
Qin Ze.

94
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,240
It's your mother.

95
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,880
When I first heard that number,

96
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,640
I couldn't believe it either.

97
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,880
[until you called.]

98
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,720
I heard her talking.

99
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,720
I...

100
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,680
What's your mother's full name?

101
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,640
Jo Jin.

102
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,640
Your mom is the editor-in-chief, Jo Jin.

103
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,880
But the last time I called her,

104
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,520
she didn't use this number.

105
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,040
My mom has two numbers.

106
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,280
One is an office.

107
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,320
One for personal use.

108
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,240
Editor Chen applied it for private use.

109
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

110
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
I'm scared.

111
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,400
I’m afraid my mom

112
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,640
is also one of the manipulators of Song Liang’s fall.

113
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,360
Zhao Jin is the chief editor of the truth.

114
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,480
Ji Jinhee's worry

115
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,320
makes sense.

116
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,640
Think about it.

117
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,960
If something like this suddenly happens to me,

118
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,240
it would be hard for me to accept it.

119
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,520
The closest person suddenly became a suspect.

120
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,640
He even took a life indirectly.

121
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Anyone

122
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,840
it would be hard to accept it right away.

123
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,440
Maybe

124
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,520
not Chief Editor Zhao?

125
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,440
Maybe

126
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,240
she just went to pick up Luo Wenli because of work.

127
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,680
She borrowed Editor Chen's car.

128
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,840
Well,

129
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,120
will you tell Qin Ze about this?

130
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,159
Ji Jinxi told me in private.

131
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,520
Obviously he didn’t want to tell everyone directly.

132
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,280
But for this clue,

133
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,520
for this clue.

134
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,080
In the last round,

135
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,760
Lu Zitired and I almost died in the fire.

136
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,440
If this is the last round,

137
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,600
then...

138
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,600
There's no time left.

139
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,440
Actually,

140
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,200
I don't know what to do

141
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,480
I don't know what to do.

142
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,840
I can only follow you.

143
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,920
I don't understand anything.

144
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,920
But I don't want to suspect my family.

145
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,840
So I thought

146
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,680
I'll investigate it myself.

147
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Once I have a conclusion,

148
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,320
I will tell you immediately.

149
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,120
What should we do now?

150
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Now that you know,

151
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,520
the owner of that phone is Chief Editor Jo.

152
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
I should've told someone else.

153
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,799
After all... This is a key clue that everyone values.

154
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,600
And now...

155
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,640
Luo Yi, Qin Ze, Lu Zitired

156
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,920
are still searching in another floor.

157
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,680
It's a waste of time and energy

158
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,040
is a waste of their energy and time.

159
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,560
But now Ji Jinhee is obviously not in a good state.

160
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
We have to tell others about this.

161
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,040
After all, we've been circulating.

162
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,280
All we did

163
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,960
is to stop the circulation.

164
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,600
To stop the circulation.

165
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,960
we've been looking for it for too long.

166
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,680
This is the key clue.

167
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,680
How can we stop like this?

168
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,280
Tell me.

169
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,440
If something happened to us in the media building,

170
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,840
Could it be

171
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,760
Jo Jin, Ji Jinhee's mother,

172
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,920
was in the media building.

173
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,320
And Qin Ze just met her at that time.

174
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,640
That means

175
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,720
Jo Jin wanted to kill us.

176
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,080
Don't worry.

177
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Maybe

178
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,000
is not what we think.

179
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,040
I don't want to think that either.

180
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,280
And when I fainted,

181
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,920
I wasn't in the room after I fainted.

182
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,200
Could it be my mom

183
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,040
wanted to drag me away

184
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,800
Then she set fire.

185
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,600
We have no evidence now.

186
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,520
Don't think too much.

187
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,280
We'll investigate it slowly.

188
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,600
What if it's not your mother?

189
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,240
What if it is?

190
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,320
If the result of the investigation is Chief Editor Zhao,

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,760
it has nothing to do with you.

192
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,280
You're innocent.

193
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,800
I...

194
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,600
am innocent.

195
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,600
Yes.

196
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,800
No matter what the result is,

197
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,680
you're innocent.

198
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,640
So,

199
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,040
you still want to

200
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,440
tell them about this.

201
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,640
Really?

202
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,640
I think

203
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,920
we should not hide it.

204
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,480
The most important thing

205
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,800
is the most important.

206
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,040
Don't worry.

207
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,440
Qin Ze always stands by the facts.

208
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,240
Besides, Luo Yi and Lu Zitired

209
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,480
will not blame you for the problem.

210
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,320
You're right.

211
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,320
We've been through so many times together.

212
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,200
right?

213
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,080
Then...

214
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,440
contact them.

215
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,920
I know who it is now.

216
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,800
Okay.

217
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,440
I'll tell him.

218
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,440
I hid it anyway.

219
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,200
You tell me.

220
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,120
I can't.

221
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,680
I'm sorry.

222
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,600
Jun.

223
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,040
All this time

224
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
Ji Jinhee has always been cheerful.

225
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,920
In the first round,

226
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,840
when we didn’t know each other,

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,640
Ji Jinhee has been helping me.

228
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,160
and took the initiative to send me to the infirmary.

229
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,520
to investigate everything with me.

230
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,840
You're such a cheerful person.

231
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,400
But at this moment, I feel despair.

232
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,640
It's like the cloud of doomsday.

233
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,560
He's willing to tell me the truth.

234
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,720
to tell me the truth.

235
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,960
Maybe I shouldn't have forced him.

236
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,040
Let me go to your mother's office with you.

237
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,280
If she's really involved in the fall,

238
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,840
she will definitely leave a clue.

239
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,800
We can tell them

240
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,560
we can tell them.

241
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,720
Thank you.

242
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,240
Let's go.

243
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,440
Wait here.

244
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,920
I need to borrow the key.

245
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,200
Okay.

246
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,840
Does it take so long to borrow the key?

247
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,320
Why isn't he back yet?

248
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,440
Maybe

249
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,040
something happened?

250
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,720
Hello, Qin Ze.

251
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,360
Hello, Tang Xiao Zheng.

252
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,600
We found the contact list.

253
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,440
Luo Yi is checking.

254
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,600
Come to the 13th floor.

255
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,160
Oh.

256
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,480
We found it too.

257
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,480
We're checking.

258
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,400
Later.

259
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,880
I'll join you later.

260
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,880
They found it too.

261
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,560
Okay.

262
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,760
Be quick.

263
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,200
Be careful.

264
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,080
Keep in touch.

265
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,560
Okay.

266
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,000
Ji Jinhee.

267
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,840
Is that you, Ji Jinhee?

268
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,600
Ji Jinhee.

269
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,360
Is that you?

270
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,680
Ji Jinhee.

271
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,400
Ji Jinhee.

272
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,000
Where have you been?

273
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,600
I...

274
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,120
I went to buy water.

275
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,200
I thought it wasn't far.

276
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,280
so I didn't tell you.

277
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,200
Next time,

278
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,760
tell me next time.

279
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,800
Okay.

280
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,040
Let's go.

281
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,280
There's a password.

282
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,360
Do you know?

283
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I don't know.

284
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,160
Six

285
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,600
Is it Ji Jinhee?

286
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,600
No.

287
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,920
What does that mean?

288
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,280
Ah

289
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,200
It's uncomfortable.

290
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,520
Hey.

291
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,040
Is it a sex chromosome?

292
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,160
A girl.

293
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,240
Ji Jinhee's mother wanted Ji Jinhee

294
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,360
Girl.

295
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,600
Really.

296
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,280
No way.

297
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,400
You...

298
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,640
You're so good.

299
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,400
You can turn on my mom's computer.

300
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Forget about that.

301
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,560
Investigating information is more important.

302
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,200
What are you looking for?

303
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,080
Something big.

304
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,360
Like videos

305
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,880
They like to use QQ.

306
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,960
But they will ignore

307
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,840
after deleting the original file,

308
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,240
after deleting the original file.

309
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,800
So I want to try

310
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,760
to see if I can find anything.

311
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,040
We can still search like this?

312
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,480
Qin Ze didn't expect it before.

313
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,640
I was just trying my luck.

314
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,040
I might not find it.

315
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,240
My mom is the chief editor.

316
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,920
She has sent a lot of documents.

317
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,480
Take your time.

318
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,600
Here.

319
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,640
Have some water.

320
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,040
Thank you.

321
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,960
What's wrong?

322
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,880
If you're tired,

323
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,320
have some water and rest.

324
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm fine.

325
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,440
Qin Ze just called.

326
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,040
saying they have found the contact list.

327
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,960
We have to go back early.

328
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It shouldn't be.

329
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,600
Even if it's tiring,

330
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,840
it's not that tiring.

331
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,240
You found out.

332
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,760
How is it?

333
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,680
Still looking.

334
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,160
Jo Jin

335
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,960
I'm Luo Wen Jie.

336
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,000
Why did you call me?

337
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,600
Mom.

338
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,600
Why are you back at this hour?

339
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,000
What are you doing here?

340
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,160
It sounds familiar.

341
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,640
Hello?

342
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,400
Who is it?

343
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,400
Are you also a reporter who has eyes for the truth?

344
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,400
It doesn't matter who I am.

345
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,200
Take a taxi and go there.

346
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,360
I'll tell Editor Chen.

347
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,960
That voice sounds familiar.

348
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,160
Who is that voice?

349
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,840
I know who that voice is.

350
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,280
Oh no.

351
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,240
Tang may be in danger.

352
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,440
I often couldn't sleep.

353
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,880
so I made sleeping pills.

354
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,240
What a pity.

355
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,000
I used it on you.

356
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,280
So he knew his mother was behind the fall.

357
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,400
Luo Wenli, Luo Wenjie.

358
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,680
Anchor Wu.

359
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,160
All of them died for Ji Jinxi.

360
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,320
Even Song Haomiao died because of this.

361
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,800
Why Ji Jinhee?

362
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,880
But if it was because of him,

363
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,800
he's also in the elevator.

364
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,000
Why?

365
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,840
I just didn't expect

366
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,040
you could find the evidence.

367
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,400
I called Tang Xiaotong

368
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,600
It's off.

369
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,760
Ah.

370
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,240
Ji Jinhee

371
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,560
Ji Jinhee

372
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,440
Which floor are you on?

373
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,080
On the ninth floor.

374
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,160
I just went to the toilet.

375
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,600
Tang is not with me.

376
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,200
Did she meet you?

377
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,040
No.

378
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,800
Ah.

379
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,440
No way.

380
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,880
She just urged us to meet up.

381
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,800
I thought she went to you.

382
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,400
What should we do?

383
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,640
Will she be okay by herself?

384
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,160
Wait for us there.

385
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,680
We'll come to you.

386
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,400
Ah.

387
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,960
Ji Jinhee.

388
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,400
What is it?

389
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,320
Ji Jinhee.

390
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,680
Let’s go.

391
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,240
Ji Jinhee.

392
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,360
He was in the bathroom.

393
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,680
Something must have happened to them.

394
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,240
What?

395
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,400
I just

396
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,880
I heard water on the phone.

397
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,480
He must be washing his hands.

398
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,640
No.

399
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,840
With the height of the tap,

400
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,560
the splash angle

401
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,280
should be between 15 to 50 degrees.

402
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,240
If Ji Jinhee washes his hands here,

403
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,640
no matter how little water he uses,

404
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,560
there must be a stain on the sink.

405
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,480
Look.

406
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,200
There's no stain on the sink.

407
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,040
All water is under the pool.

408
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,400
There are only two possibilities.

409
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,880
The first one.

410
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,840
Ji Jinhee washed her hands here.

411
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,800
But the water was dry.

412
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,800
But when we called,

413
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,240
It's very rare these days.

414
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,840
The water won't dry.

415
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,600
So there's only the second possibility.

416
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,560
He didn't wash his hands here.

417
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,400
Be careful.

418
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,440
You're awake.

419
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,840
Be careful.

420
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,560
Ah!

421
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,720

422
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,360
