1
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,160
I will protect you.

2
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,240
Sister.

3
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,200
Thank you

4
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,160
Thank you.

5
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,280
Let's go this way.

6
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,840
It's close to the art academy.

7
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,440
Let’s go.

8
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,280
For Alice.

9
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,400
To Alice.

10
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,800
Do you know who drew this?

11
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
I drew it.

12
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,000
This is the reference of my painting.

13
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,760
Orange red double roses.

14
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,640
It's also called Alice Rose.

15
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,040
I wanted to draw Alice Rose.

16
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,960
But it hasn't fully colored yet.

17
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,280
That's why they mistook it as Rolimas.

18
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,240
It's literally written.

19
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
It's not Alice Rose.

20
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,240
It's more like a painting for Alice.

21
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,480
And this painting has begun to write.

22
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,600
It doesn't look like an uncoloured painting.

23
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,160
Luo Yi is not in the studio.

24
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,320
Should we go somewhere else?

25
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,320
Where do you think he'll go?

26
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,760
After I went to college,

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,640
I haven't been in touch with Luo Yi much.

28
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,400
I don't know where he is now.

29
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,760
We can't keep looking.

30
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,040
There's no time.

31
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,720
What's wrong with Luo Yi?

32
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,800
He's fine.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,800
I think he's good at school.

34
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,560
He got the Green Fruit Award and scholarship.

35
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,160
Shouldn't someone like him get what he wants at school?

36
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,760
I don't think so.

37
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,400
You want to kill yourself or take revenge on the society.

38
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,360
That's what I find strange.

39
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,560
Although I don't have much contact with him now,

40
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
but before middle school,

41
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,000
we were always close.

42
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,040
He's gentle

43
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,400
and kind to people.

44
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
And he's good at studying.

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,520
He's always the best in his class.

46
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,760
Although his family is not a good family,

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,760
but it's impossible for him

48
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,520
or kill himself.

49
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,840
There must be something we neglected.

50
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,160
What could it be?

51
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,000
Recall everything that happened in the circulation.

52
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,680
[Media Building, Conference Room]

53
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,320
Five people in the elevator.

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Five.

55
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,640
Why did you choose the five of us?

56
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,160
Was it a coincidence?

57
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,720
Lu Zitired was hit by Song HaoMiao's father who fell off the building.

58
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,839
Luo Yi took a picture of Alice Rose in the Dongzhou Garden community where Song HaoMiao lived.

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,320
The photo in my phone

60
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,520
was taken here.

61
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,440
Ji Jinhee went to Dongzhou Garden to play basketball.

62
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,400
Yes. This is the neighborhood we used to play basketball.

63
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,800
The basketball court is just ahead.

64
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,480
Lu Zitired, Luo Yi and Ji Jinxi

65
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,320
seem to be related to Dongzhou Garden.

66
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,400
This is the only similarity we can find on them.

67
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,560
What about Qin Ze?

68
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,920
Is Qin Ze also related to Dongzhou Garden?

69
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,680
Hello, Tang Xiaotong.

70
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,560
Have you been to Dongzhou Garden before this?

71
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,120
No.

72
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,320
So the incident at Dongzhou Garden was just a coincidence?

73
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,360
What else do they have in common?

74
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,720
I remember something.

75
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,160
I remember that day was...

76
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,600
April 14.

77
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,120
I had a presentation in the conference room in the media building.

78
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,360
So I quit my tutor part-time job.

79
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,320
My part-time job was in Dongzhou Garden.

80
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,240
But...

81
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,680
When I called

82
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,120
to book a meeting room,

83
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,320
the conference room was booked.

84
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,320
I thought since the meeting room is booked,

85
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,560
I should postpone my speech.

86
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,960
So I agreed to the tutor part-time job.

87
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,600
But not long after,

88
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,000
the manager of the conference room called me again.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,320
The meeting room is empty.

90
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,560
Is this the connection between the five of us?

91
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,480
Dongzhou Garden Community.

92
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,960
What is there?

93
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,280
And what made us

94
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,520
to connect the five of us together?

95
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,560
Or

96
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,720
it's related to Song HaoMiao's house who jumped into the sea?

97
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,000
Tang Xiaotong, are you still there?

98
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,800
Yes.

99
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,600
Can you ask the manager of the conference room

100
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,520
and ask who booked the meeting room?

101
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,760
What canceled it?

102
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,680
Because I think

103
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,320
all of us are related to Dongzhou Garden.

104
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
If the meeting room hadn't been cancelled,

105
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,320
you would have gone there too.

106
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,400
But I can't tell.

107
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
Let me check.

108
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,200
I'll call you later.

109
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,240
Don't worry. We'll find Luo Yi.

110
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,480
Thank you.

111
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,000
I've been through all the rounds by myself.

112
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,840
Later, I got more and more friends.

113
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,040
I have always trusted Luo Yi.

114
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
Because of Luo Yi,

115
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,640
I can struggle bravely in the circle.

116
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,240
I'm so contradictory right now.

117
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,240
I'm scared that he's the real culprit.

118
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,200
and that he was an accomplice.

119
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,680
If he wasn't,

120
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,280
how helpless would he be now?

121
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,520
Hello, have you found it?

122
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,240
Tang Xiaotong.

123
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,440
I checked.

124
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,040
The person who booked the meeting room

125
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,520
was Luo Yi.

126
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,640
He also canceled the meeting room.

127
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
Luo Yi.

128
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,840
Why did he book the meeting room?

129
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,040
Jun.

130
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,840
Zheng!

131
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,440
Where are we going?

132
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,520
Meeting room.

133
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,920
We found him.

134
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,800
In the conference room.

135
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,080
Luo Yi.

136
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,040
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,400
Why are you sorry?

138
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,800
Because I ran away.

139
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,680
I still can't believe

140
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,480
Luo Yi is the murderer of the elevator incident.

141
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,920
I don't think he wants to kill me.

142
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,840
On April 14,

143
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,880
Why did you book the meeting room?

144
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,200
We were worried about you.

145
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,320
Why won't you say anything?

146
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,520
Why are you

147
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
not you.

148
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,680
What?

149
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,800
You knew it all along.

150
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,840
I like you.

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,400
On April 14,

152
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,080
I want to tell you

153
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,400
I like you.

154
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,040
But

155
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,840
you never told me

156
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,280
Because I don't know

157
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,000
if you like me too.

158
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,720
I remember.

159
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,400
On the wall of the conference room that day,

160
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,080
on the wall of the conference room.

161
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,080
Did you find it?

162
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,440
There you are.

163
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,120
It's okay.

164
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,440
I'm glad you found him.

165
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,280
What's wrong with you?

166
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,400
I didn't

167
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,840
I didn't do it.

168
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,800
But the evidence points to you.

169
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
We'd better

170
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,680
wait until Qin Ze comes and everyone is here.

171
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,800
We still need to discuss

172
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,520
should be discussed.

173
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,000
No matter what decision you make,

174
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,640
I will agree.

175
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,480
If you don't believe me,

176
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
and hope

177
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,240
to lock me up

178
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,600
in the next round.

179
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,040
I'm willing to do it.

180
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,520
They're inside.

181
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
What's going on?

182
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,640
Qin Ze,

183
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,720
Let's talk alone.

184
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,160
Okay.

185
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,840
You know he likes you.

186
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,040
and wanted to confess to you.

187
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,880
So you believed him?

188
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,480
I didn't believe him.

189
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,040
I just want to make my judgment.

190
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,680
The reason we investigated Dongzhou Garden

191
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,200
because we want to investigate the long-legged sister.

192
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,240
Sister long legs is the beginning of all problems.

193
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,000
But the reason we went there

194
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,240
because of that suicide note.

195
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,440
But do you know

196
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,240
how we found out about that letter?

197
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,640
It was Luo Yi.

198
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,840
He saw you

199
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,760
went into the meeting room to find the suicide note.

200
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,280
That's why the long-legged donor was involved.

201
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,160
Since you didn't enter the circulation,

202
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,680
all the clues are related to Luo Yi.

203
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,200
If he is the murderer,

204
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,040
he doesn't have to lead us to find the truth.

205
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,840
right?

206
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,080
What are you doing?

207
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,640
There are so many things that you can’t see clearly.

208
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,440
The fact that Luo Yi likes you

209
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,560
that Luo Yi likes you.

210
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,280
If I say I like you too,

211
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,040
would you believe me without hesitation?

212
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
What did you say?

213
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,640
This is just an assumption.

214
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,640
You're in Luo's rhythm now.

215
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,000
This is not good for you.

216
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,640
You need to calm down.

217
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,440
Do you still think

218
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,440
what Luo Yi said is fine?

219
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,240
Qin Ze is right.

220
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,480
Without the video,

221
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,120
I might still trust Luo Yi.

222
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,200
Even so,

223
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,840
there is no direct evidence that Luo Yi is the murderer.

224
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,480
Am I right?

225
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,200
Maybe

226
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,000
hiding something.

227
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,360
We can investigate

228
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,400
Dongzhou Garden.

229
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,640
Leave Luo Yi in the meeting room.

230
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,320
No matter what,

231
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,520
we can't do anything to Luo Yi.

232
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,680
The circulation will only continue.

233
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,840
What we need to do

234
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,720
is to solve the truth.

235
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,800
Dongzhou Garden is indeed related to the five of us.

236
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,240
Luo Yi must have other reasons

237
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,880
for another reason.

238
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,120
Since he won't tell us,

239
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,080
we'll find it out ourselves.

240
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,440
What should we do now?

241
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,240
What time is it now?

242
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,040
12:18.

243
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,920
There are 25 minutes before the elevator explosion.

244
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We don't know if the next round will continue.

245
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We'll shorten half an hour.

246
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,440
Time is running out.

247
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,400
We must go to Dongzhou Garden as soon as possible.

248
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,440
You have to stay here.

249
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,800
Lu Zitired and Ji Jinxi will be with you.

250
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,480
Okay.

251
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,840
I'll wait for you here.

252
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,800
Okay.

253
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,920
Let's go.

254
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,640
Eyes on the truth.

255
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,400
I'll report today's news.

256
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,840
I'm Anchor Oh Yi Ren.

257
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,600
Today,

258
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,440
the truth of the eyes will bring you an exclusive.

259
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,560
Security is trying to make money.

260
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,360
The robbery attempted murder

261
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,280
pushed the girl to the top.

262
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
She accidentally fell.

263
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,720
At noon yesterday,

264
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
a couple fell off the building

265
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,240
a couple fell off the building.

266
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,280
The cause was...

267
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,120
the security at the media building.

268
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,880
Song Liang.

269
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,120
stole

270
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,480
stole the 300,000 yuan

271
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,240
300,000 yuan on Xiao Meng's desk

272
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,600
I just withdrew the money

273
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,400
to pay the office decoration workers.

274
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,000
Over ten people's hard-earned money

275
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,080
In the moment Xiao Meng went to the toilet

276
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,080
was stolen by this heartless security guard

277
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,320
When Xiao Meng found out

278
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,040
we chased to the rooftop

279
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,720
The security guard got angry

280
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,920
pushed Xiao Meng off the building

281
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,800
At the moment of falling

282
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,520
Xiao Meng caught the security guard

283
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,840
In the end, they both died

284
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,680
The security guard didn't deserve to die.

285
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,800
Poor girl.

286
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,520
She lost her life

287
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
because of a thief.

288
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
The police are investigating the details.

289
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,800
[The truth will continue to be revealed.]

290
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,440
I always find it strange

291
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,680
What is the purpose of Song Liang

292
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
steal 300,000 yuan from Xiao Meng?

293
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,120
Is your family short of money?

294
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,880
The police

295
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,040
the police must still be investigating.

296
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,240
But...

297
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,840
How far did it go?

298
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't think we can ask him.

299
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,640
I think

300
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
we can do this.

301
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,840
Let's go to Song Liang's house and ask his wife

302
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
and see

303
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,840
Did something happen during that time?

304
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
I think

305
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,360
the truth is not what we know.

306
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,800
You also think

307
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,280
there's something behind

308
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,200
behind Song Liang’s theft.

309
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,040
It's just that I vaguely feel that

310
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,240
Dongzhou Garden

311
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,160
is related to all of us.

312
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,440
is not a coincidence.

313
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,640
Let's rearrange the information.

314
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,720
Song Liang stole

315
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,440
Murder.

316
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,840
and fell off the building and died.

317
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,040
Song Haomiao jumped into the sea

318
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,480
jumped into the sea.

319
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,280
In this case,

320
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,240
Song Liang is indeed an unforgivable villain.

321
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,600
But I always feel that...

322
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,840
Is that true?

323
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,040
The truth we saw

324
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,280
Is it really the truth?

325
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,720
Forget about it.

326
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,520
When we get to Song HaoMiao's house,

327
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,000
some questions

328
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,440
there should be an answer.

329
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,840
We have less than 20 minutes left.

330
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,200
We need to speed up.

331
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,720
Before I came here, I checked

332
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
He took the college entrance exam last year.

333
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,160
You got good grades.

334
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,280
667 points.

335
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,520
He was admitted to Linqing University.

336
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,720
But after what happened to his father,

337
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,400
he never went to school.

338
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,440
He jumped into the sea

339
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,440
after his father died.

340
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,640
Who are you?

341
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,840
Oh.

342
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,760
Hello, aunt.

343
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,760
We are Hao Miao's friends.

344
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,240
We want to see you.

345
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,360
So you're Haomiao's friend.

346
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
Come in.

347
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,840
Thank you.

348
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,840
Thank you.

349
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,560
Oh.

350
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,840
Auntie.

351
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,240
At that time,

352
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,720
I went to fill out the college entrance exam application with Haomiao.

353
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,800
He forgot to return his pen.

354
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,160
Qin Ze

355
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,840
with Qin Ze, right?

356
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,600
It's okay.

357
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,920
He doesn't need it anymore.

358
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,400
Auntie,

359
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,040
I'm sorry for your loss.

360
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,080
He did a good job.

361
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,240
He has good grades.

362
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,040
And the neighbors praised him when he came.

363
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,440
They said he was very polite.

364
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,000
We don't believe what they said online.

365
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,840
We think

366
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,480
he's not that kind of person.

367
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,240
Especially after meeting you,

368
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,840
after meeting you.

369
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,720
It's easy to be influenced online.

370
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
Don't take it to heart.

371
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,440
Hao Miao always said his father was wronged.

372
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,520
We don't believe his father would do such a thing.

373
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,320
Our family is not rich,

374
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,320
but we didn't encounter any difficulties in life.

375
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,000
The university Haomiao applied

376
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,000
because he has outstanding grades.

377
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,080
the school gave him free tuition and accommodation fees.

378
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:04,920
He...

379
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,080
His dad doesn't have any motive to steal money.

380
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,720
Also,

381
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,000
when his dad was working,

382
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,840
when he was working.

383
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,040
He worked two days in a row

384
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,720
he worked two days in a row.

385
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,880
Finally, the owner

386
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,640
he paid back all the money.

387
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,040
How could a man like his father

388
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,400
hurt people for money?

389
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,880
Auntie.

390
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,240
Hao Miao insisted that his father was wronged.

391
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,240
Do you have evidence

392
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,080
or...

393
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,720
Hao Miao said he was there

394
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,520
at the scene.

395
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,400
Someone pushed his father down.

396
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,280
but he didn't see his face.

397
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,080
Then we went to check the CCTV.

398
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,240
But he said the CCTV was broken.

399
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,040
Did he tell you

400
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,720
what happened at the scene?

401
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,320
He said his father went to save people,

402
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,240
It's not about hurting people on the internet.

403
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,920
but saving people.

404
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,040
Although she said so,

405
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,240
but no one believed it.

406
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,480
Later,

407
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,280
the anchor Oh Yi Ren came to our house

408
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,880
and brought a photo.

409
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,480
In the photo,

410
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,720
in the photo.

411
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,640
his dad pushed the girl who fell off the building.

412
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,080
Auntie.

413
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,840
Is Haomiao's phone still there?

414
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,120
Is it convenient?

415
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,040
Let us have a look.

416
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,120
Find some clues.

417
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,840
Yes.

418
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,280
Yes.

419
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,640
Take your time.

420
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,840
I'll get you some water.

421
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,280
Thank you.

422
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,920
When I first met Qin Ze,

423
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,240
I thought he was a very cold person.

424
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,160
Maybe at that time, Qin Ze was overwhelmed by life.

425
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,320
So he was cold to others.

426
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,040
I asked for help several times,

427
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,720
he was indifferent.

428
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,640
And now,

429
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,800
Qin Ze has more sides.

430
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,920
His calmness

431
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,240
and rational judgment.

432
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,840
Did you find anything?

433
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,640
Just looking at the video and photos,

434
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,720
there's no clue.

435
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,320
But look.

436
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,040
I found several unsread emails in his email.

437
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,800
I want to check.

438
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,480
But I don't know if it's appropriate.

439
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,600
Have some water.

440
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,440
Thank you.

441
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,840
Auntie.

442
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,040
Can we read

443
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,120
Can we see it?

444
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,880
Sure.

445
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,040
At this point,

446
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,840
there's no privacy.

447
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,640
Take your time.

448
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,000
It turns out

449
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,520
This is the truth.

450
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,200
Unfortunately, the sender used an anonymous email.

451
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,640
We can't identify him.

452
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,680
The title is atonement.

453
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,320
Then this person could be

454
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,800
the person who pushed the photo.

455
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,120
has been living in guilt

456
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,880
I've been living in guilt.

457
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,600
I want to atone for my sins.

458
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,840
Yes.

459
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,480
Show her the video first.

460
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,520
Auntie.

461
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,280
Look at this.

462
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,600
This is the truth.

463
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,320
Miss Wu.

464
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,280
I'm Song HaoMiao's mother.

465
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:42,920
Auntie,

466
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,920
I want to ask you about Song HaoMiao's father.

467
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:53,960
Oh.

468
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,480
It's Hao Miao's mom.

469
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,240
Didn't I tell you everything?

470
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,240
The evidence is solid.

471
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,400
What's the problem?

472
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,440
just ask the police.

473
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,120
I have something to do.

474
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,040
I'm hanging up.

475
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,640
She...

476
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,040
hung up.

477
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,800
Because of her reversed story,

478
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,440
and made his father die with regrets.

479
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,640
It's all her fault.

480
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
My Haomiao just died.

481
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,080
My dear Haomiao

482
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,480
is gone.

483
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,680
Auntie.

484
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,680
No.

485
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,480
I can't let

486
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,760
die in vain.

487
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,920
I'm going to find her.

488
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,239
I want to find her.

489
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,320
I'm going to ask why.

490
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,480
Why did you write such a false story?

491
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,120
Ma'am.

492
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,120
Let her go.

493
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,679
Should we give the evidence to the police first?

494
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,880
It's too late.

495
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,840
Time is limited in the circulation.

496
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,639
If we enter the next round,

497
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,600
everything will start all over again.

498
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,040
All the clues may be gone.

499
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,440
To find out the truth,

500
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,280
we have to let Ms. Oh and Ms. Oh

501
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,480
to see what's going on.

502
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Let's go together.

503
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,520
Listen.

504
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,760
This whistle

505
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,240
Is it the melody in the elevator?

506
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,520
Could it be

507
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,120
The sixth circulation...

508
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,000
the one who caused the explosion in the elevator?

509
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,240
Is he here

510
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,800
to kill us?

511
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,040
How about this?

512
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,360
You and Luo Yi stay here.

513
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,320
I'll take a look.

514
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,680
Be careful.

515
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,480
Okay.
