00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,520
Yesterday noon,

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,160
a couple fell from the building in this city.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,240
Security Song Liang stole

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,280
stole 300,000 yuan from the construction workers.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,320
After Xiao Meng found out,

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,920
the security guard pushed her down the building.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,600
The moment she fell

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,760
Xiao Meng grabbed the security guard

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,520
In the end, they both died

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,000
The security guard didn't deserve to die.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,320
I feel sorry for a young girl.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,720
Because of a thief,

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,800
for a thief.

14
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,960
I'm calling the police.

15
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,200
What's that smell?

16
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,200
It looks like

17
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,600
A sandwich wrapped in a microwave

18
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,640
It smells burning.

19
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,520
This is the self-media office building.

20
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,440
Maybe someone is using a microwave.

21
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,440
This smell should be gone soon.

22
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,720
I'm sorry

23
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,040
Please come with me.

24
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,159
It's okay.

25
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,440
It's on my way.

26
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,440
What's going on?

27
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,800
Why did the elevator stop?

28
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,840
Is there a power outage?

29
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,000
The roads are being repaired recently.

30
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,000
Sometimes there's a power outage.

31
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,640
The lights are on.

32
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,520
Why is there a power cut?

33
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
I live in a high-ranking house.

34
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,080
There are times when the elevator stops.

35
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,840
If it wasn't a power outage,

36
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,200
it should be recovered in a few minutes.

37
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,600
Don't worry.

38
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,400
Or we can call the police according to that.

39
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,680
Hello, this is the security room.

40
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,120
What happened?

41
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,040
Building B5 is down.

42
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,840
Five people are trapped here.

43
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,240
Stay here.

44
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,480
We'll send someone over right away.

45
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,400
Scholar.

46
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,720
You're Qin Ze, the god of our school.

47
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,000
Why is the elevator falling?

48
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,040
Lu Zitired.

49
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,120
You won't die here today, will you?

50
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,240
Help!

51
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,880
Stop shouting.

52
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,440
Your voice might resonate.

53
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,800
Let the elevator fall down.

54
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,720
Just kidding.

55
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,200
Let him be quiet.

56
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
Tell me.

57
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,520
the elevator is out of power or circuit.

58
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,640
It won't fall twice or three times in a row, right?

59
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,200
There's a continuous slope.

60
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,080
It's very likely that it's a canal

61
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,680
or polishing the wheel.

62
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,120
And there's a small damage.

63
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,400
I won't let this happen in the elevator.

64
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,240
I'm afraid

65
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,520
is probably badly damaged.

66
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,360
Help!

67
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,960
I have claustrophobia.

68
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,480
Hey, Jun.

69
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,640
Don’t move.

70
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,440
But he...

71
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,120
You can play some songs

72
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,040
and relax yourself.

73
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,240
Yeah.

74
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,840
Zheng

75
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,280
What's wrong with you?

76
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,440
Why are you so surprised?

77
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,160
Hey.

78
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,680
Are you okay?

79
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,360
What happened?

80
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
You fainted

81
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,160
you suddenly fainted.

82
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,920
Did the elevator stop?

83
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,360
We just entered the elevator.

84
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,040
We haven't reached the tenth floor yet.

85
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,120
What's that smell?

86
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,960
This is the self-media office building.

87
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,040
There could be a crew using a microwave.

88
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,960
What's going on?

89
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,400
Is this a dream?

90
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,320
The elevator fell just now.

91
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,400
Jun!

92
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
Are you okay?

93
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,480
I'm sorry.

94
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,880
for letting you come with me.

95
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,960
What happened?

96
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,520
Why did the elevator stop?

97
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,120
Is there a power outage?

98
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,920
The roads are under repair.

99
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,320
There's been a lot of blackout lately.

100
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,200
Why?

101
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,920
Isn't the light still on?

102
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,800
No.

103
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,320
The elevator is wrong.

104
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,960
This isn't a dream.

105
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,000
If what happened just now is true,

106
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,760
the elevator will continue to fall.

107
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,360
I live in a high-ranking house.

108
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,000
There are times when the elevator stops.

109
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,760
If it wasn't a power outage,

110
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,120
it should be recovered in a few minutes.

111
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,520
Don't worry.

112
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,200
Or

113
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,200
we can press the alarm button first.

114
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,360
Hello, this is the security room.

115
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,880
What happened?

116
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,080
Building B5.

117
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,880
The elevator is broken.

118
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,680
Five people are trapped here.

119
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,920
Okay, stay here.

120
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,160
We'll send someone right away.

121
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,000
Zheng.

122
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,480
Are you Qin Ze?

123
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,080
He's really Qin Ze.

124
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,200
Why is the elevator falling?

125
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,800
Switch!

126
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Help! I have claustrophobia!

127
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Help!

128
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
Is anyone outside?

129
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,040
The elevator is out of power or circuit.

130
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,240
it won't fall twice or three times in a row.

131
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,240
If what happens now

132
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,600
is the same as the first time,

133
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,760
Soon, everyone will fall.

134
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,760
Help!

135
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,720
What's wrong with you?

136
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,760
Why are you so surprised?

137
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,400
No.

138
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,640
I want to live.

139
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,160
I want to escape.

140
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,680
Are you crazy?

141
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,880
What's wrong with you?

142
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,480
Hey!

143
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200
Zheng!

144
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,640
Zheng!

145
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,600
Zheng!

146
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Something will happen to the elevator.

147
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,400
What?

148
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,720
Jun.

149
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,720
Did you hear something?

150
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,480
I saw it.

151
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
I saw that.

152
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
the elevator will fall.

153
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,080
Everyone inside will die.

154
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,840
Jun.

155
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,960
Don't worry.

156
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,840
The elevator usually has a security system.

157
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,760
It might just be suspended.

158
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,120
Jun.

159
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,120
Why don't we go to the infirmary first?

160
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,360
I'll do it myself.

161
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
Just submit the manuscript.

162
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,800
Don't go.

163
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,280
I really saw it.

164
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,360
I saw the elevator falling.

165
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,520
Everyone died.

166
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,880
I saw it.

167
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,600
What does that mean?

168
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,800
I have to calm down.

169
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,000
I have to get everyone out of the elevator.

170
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,440
What are you pressing?

171
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,480
Where are you going?

172
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,200
This elevator will fall.

173
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,720
I know you don't believe me.

174
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,480
You don't have to believe me.

175
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,760
I can't save anyone who doesn't trust me.

176
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
But I'm getting off the elevator now.

177
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,920
Are you crazy?

178
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,760
Don't scare me.

179
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,680
Excuse me.

180
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,240
Is your friend not feeling well?

181
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,680
Could it be that she smelled

182
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,680
that smell just now?

183
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,560
How about I take her to the infirmary with you?

184
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,920
Get out of this media building.

185
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,880
Zheng!

186
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,480
Zheng!

187
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,080
Zheng!

188
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,680
Zheng!

189
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,960
Why?

190
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
He left the media building.

191
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,440
Zheng.

192
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm fine.

193
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,400
I just feel a little dizzy.

194
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,960
This is so strange.

195
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,360
He just left the media building.

196
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,720
It's so far from the elevator.

197
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,320
Why did I return to the elevator

198
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,440
I returned to the elevator.

199
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,600
Am I dead?

200
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,520
It hurts.

201
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,360
I'm not dead.

202
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,560
Does it hurt?

203
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,800
What are you doing?

204
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
It hurts too.

205
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,040
What's that smell?

206
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,840
This is the self-media office building.

207
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,320
It's possible.

208
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,840
Again?

209
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,280
Forget it. Save him first.

210
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,160
No one will believe me after trying so much.

211
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,280
What should I do

212
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,080
to make everyone leave the elevator?

213
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,120
Shut up!

214
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,440
Shut up!

215
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,480
Why did I lose my wallet?

216
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,560
Did you steal it?

217
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,840
What are you talking about?

218
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,640
I was so far away from you.

219
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,440
When I got on the elevator,

220
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,040
you stood next to me and stole it.

221
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,280
Bullshit!

222
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,560
I entered the elevator before you.

223
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,880
was you.

224
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,120
Luo Yi.

225
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,440
He stole my wallet.

226
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,480
I must call the police.

227
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,480
We can get the CCTV footage directly.

228
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,920
Everyone can be my witness.

229
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,520
I'll do that.

230
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
If it weren't for me,

231
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,040
I'll make you kneel and apologize!

232
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,200
Come out!

233
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,480
Come down.

234
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,640
Hey.

235
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,640
Do you need my help?

236
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,520
Of course.

237
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,040
Two people have testified for you.

238
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,240
I won't go.

239
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,440
I have something to do.

240
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
No.

241
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,840
You have to get off the elevator with me.

242
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,640
Go ahead with your work.

243
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,280
I'll take them to the monitoring room.

244
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,680
Sorry.

245
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,360
Go. What are you waiting for?

246
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,960
I've repeated it many times but no one believes it.

247
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,840
What should we do now?

248
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,280
Listen.

249
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,040
If you don't give me an explanation today,

250
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,960
I won’t let you off.

251
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,080
Zheng.

252
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,680
Let’s go.

253
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,960
I'll take you to the surveillance room.

254
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,120
This is...

255
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,040
In front of the canteen.

256
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,480
Why am I here?

257
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,280
I came out of the elevator.

258
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,320
12:13.

259
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,760
That was half an hour ago.

260
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,600
Zheng.

261
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,120
My dad came to Lincheng for business.

262
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,960
He happens to pick me up.

263
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,640
It's holiday today.

264
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,280
He asked me to ask you if you want to go with me.

265
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,280
Everything went back to half an hour ago.

266
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,280
I need to go to the media building

267
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,840
to submit the art manuscript.

268
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,280
Do you want to join us?

269
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,200
I knew it.

270
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,680
Everything is exactly the same as before.

271
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,400
Just half an hour earlier.

272
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,280
Anyway,

273
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,240
We need to check.

274
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,280
If the elevator explodes,

275
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,640
will everything continue?

276
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,640
I'll go with you.

277
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,440
The time of the explosion was fixed.

278
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:29,960
What if

279
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,840
Luo Yi and I didn't get on the elevator during that time,

280
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,080
will the elevator fall?

281
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,080
Or after the elevator falls,

282
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,000
after the elevator collapses?

283
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,040
Media Building Research Center?

284
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,960
It's quite convenient to go to the school.

285
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,840
We'll be there in a few steps.

286
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,560
It's close to your advice.

287
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,040
I didn't notice them before.

288
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,960
Now I realize

289
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,080
that everyone appeared

290
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,400
along the track.

291
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,840
This time, I won't be a bystander

292
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,560
but a bystander.

293
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,560
I won't choose to take the elevator.

294
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,480
Gosh.

295
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,200
Jun!

296
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,840
What's wrong?

297
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,760
My stomach hurts.

298
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,400
Should I take you to the infirmary?

299
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,680
It was 12:42 last time.

300
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Three minutes left.

301
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
It's you.

302
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,400
It's Lu Zitired.

303
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
How dare you frame me?

304
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,800
What are you doing?

305
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,240
He's in a loop too.

306
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,800
You saw the elevator falling.

307
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,240
Are you crazy?

308
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,600
Who are you to frame me?

309
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
steal your wallet?

310
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,960
I hate people slandering me the most.

311
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,320
Listen.

312
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,680
This is not over.

313
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,960
I'm going to make you pay for your defamation.

314
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,280
Are you listening to me?

315
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,800
What are you doing?

316
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,960
This guy...

317
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,200
Did he recognize me?

318
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,760
The elevator was destroyed,

319
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,600
I was stuck in an infinite loop.

320
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,840
At first, only 30 seconds left.

321
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,000
In that elevator.

322
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,880
Then I escaped from the elevator.

323
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,480
But once the elevator collapses,

324
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,240
I'll go back to 30 seconds ago.

325
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Because you got off the elevator.

326
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,200
because you got off the elevator.

327
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,000
Time extended.

328
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,160
30 minutes.

329
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,400
Infinite circulation?

330
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,400
What are you talking about?

331
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,000
You confused me.

332
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,240
All I think about is the scene of you getting even with me.

333
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,600
No.

334
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,400
I think I went back to the business car.

335
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,040
You made me faint.

336
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
I have to go back to the car.

337
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,760
No, you can't go.

338
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,240
There's only one minute left

339
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,760
before the elevator collapses.

340
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,040
You have to listen to me now.

341
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,400
If you open your eyes

342
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,880
and remember what happened now,

343
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,680
come to me.

344
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,000
My name is Tang Xiaotong.

345
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,880
I'm a 20-year journalist majoring in many media majors

346
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,200
and also an intern reporter.

347
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,600
30 minutes ago,

348
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,440
I will appear in front of Yuhe Garden Restaurant.

349
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,040
Lu Zitired, remember what I said.

350
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,080
You must come to me.

351
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,200
TOYOTA

352
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,760
I'm tired.

353
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,520
Did you have a nightmare again?

354
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,400
Here, have some water.

355
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,400
We're almost at the media building.

356
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,920
Let's go to Yuhe Garden Restaurant at Lincheng University first.

357
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,360
Okay.

358
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,280
If Lu Zitired remembers

359
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,080
what happened during the elevator explosion,

360
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,120
he would come to me.

361
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,760
But we don't have much time.

362
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,080
What should I do?

363
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,720
Call the police.

364
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Yes, I have to call the police first.

365
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,120
Hello?

366
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,480
This is 110.

367
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,200
Go ahead.

368
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,840
Zheng.

369
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,160
Police.

370
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,120
It's too short.

371
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,320
It's too late to call the police.

372
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,680
Zheng.

373
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,320
This time, I want to keep Luo Yi.

374
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,320
I'm going to the media building to submit the art manuscript.

375
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,320
Do you want to join us?

376
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Of course.

377
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,400
It's me.

378
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,720
A friend is coming.

379
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,120
Can you wait for him?

380
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,720
Okay.

381
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,600
Look.

382
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,280
Lu Zitired.

383
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Can I have your autograph?

384
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,400
Me too.

385
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,480
Lu Zitired.

386
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,840
What's going on?

387
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
Why do I keep repeating the same time?

388
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,720
Look, what I told you before is true.

389
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,520
It's what I said to you

390
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,720
at the entrance of the media building.

391
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,760
We repeated death many times.

392
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,320
It was always because of the elevator.

393
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,520
Gosh.

394
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,640
This is ridiculous.

395
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,800
We didn't take any thrillers.

396
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,560
Are you guys talking about the script?

397
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,720
Is she the scriptwriter you hired?

398
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,000
We're still circulating.

399
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,040
I tried to call the police,

400
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,920
but I couldn't stop the circulation because I didn't have enough time.

401
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,440
If you want to break it now,

402
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,920
there is a possibility

403
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,920
is to stop everyone from getting on the elevator.

404
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,640
Okay, I'll cooperate.

405
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,640
I don't want to be trapped in these 30 minutes forever.

406
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,080
Luo Yi.

407
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
Wait in the car.

408
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,360
We'll be right back.

409
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,760
Okay.

410
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,680
Dear listeners, good afternoon.

411
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,200
This is the sound of the noon show of Lincheng Broadcast.

412
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,040
I'm your good friend, Xiaoyue.

413
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,160
Nice to meet you again.

414
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,920
It's 12:40 p.m. on April 28.

415
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,520
The holiday is like a gorgeous painting.

416
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,600
At 12:40,

417
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,640
According to Tang Xiaotong,

418
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,320
the elevator will explode in three minutes,

419
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,600
The explosion should be at 12:43.

420
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,920
It was so ridiculous.

421
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,760
But...

422
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,360
Hurry!

423
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,600
I can't stop everyone from going in.

424
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,280
Zheng.

425
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,159
My dad came to Lincheng for business.

426
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,719
He happens to pick me up.

427
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,360
It's holiday today.

428
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,840
He asked me to ask you if you want to go with me.

429
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,280
Oh.

430
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,280
I have a friend coming over later.

431
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,760
I see.

432
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,280
I'll go to the media building to submit my manuscript.

433
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,520
I'll go back by myself.

434
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,040
Send my regards to Uncle Luo.

435
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,280
OK.

436
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,960
Are they your friends in your dorm?

437
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:11,960
Look.

438
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,760
Lu Zitired

439
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,960
is the champion of the singing contest.

440
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,520
Yes, our alumni.

441
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,080
Hurry up.

442
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,360
Why?

443
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,200
No one got on the elevator,

444
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,560
we would still come back.

445
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,120
I thought if I stopped everyone from climbing the elevator,

446
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,560
the circulation might stop.

447
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,960
But it doesn't.

448
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,360
The circulation may have something to do with the falling of the elevator.

449
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,960
You mean we have to stop the elevator from falling?

450
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,760
We only have 30 minutes.

451
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,640
It's not enough.

452
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,160
Besides,

453
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,120
only Lu Zitired is his partner.

454
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,520
He looks grumpy.

455
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,280
He's not very smart.

456
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,120
If partners and Luo

457
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,840
or Qin Ze,

458
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,080
we might have a higher chance of winning.

459
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,240
What's with that look?

460
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,680
My eyes hurt.

461
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,000
Have you done anything

462
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,440
did you do anything?

463
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,960
What can I do?

464
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,360
You framed me for stealing your wallet.

465
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,360
That's why I went down to check the CCTV.

466
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,760
If it weren't for that,

467
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
I wouldn't have fallen into this damn cycle.

468
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,360
If

469
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,000
because of the movement of getting down the elevator,

470
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,360
Luo Yi was the first one to get off the elevator.

471
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,840
Why didn't Luo Yi enter the circulation?

472
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,200
I was so angry.

473
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,120
All I could think about was you kneeling and apologizing.

474
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,200
That's why

475
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,800
to clear my name.

476
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,600
I must go.

477
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,920
Because of myself.

478
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,040
For myself.

479
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,640
Luo Yi and Ji Jinxi chose to leave

480
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,120
for me.

481
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,400
But Lu Zitired did it for himself.

482
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,320
If

483
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,920
this is the way to let others enter the circle,

484
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,520
as long as I can find a way

485
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,680
to find someone smart

486
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,040
maybe we can work together

487
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,320
to stop the elevator from falling.

488
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,080
Lu Zitired, I need your help.

489
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,000
You pretend to be a teacher in the teachers' office.

490
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
call Luo Yi

491
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,400
Ask him to go back to school

492
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,960
and get him out of the elevator.

493
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,560
Maybe he can enter the circulation after he gets off the elevator.

494
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,840
Follow him.

495
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,000
Hurry up, call him.

496
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,600
Okay.

497
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,280
I can't get through.

498
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,520
Oh, I forgot.

499
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,000
There's no signal in the elevator.

500
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,840
Zheng.

501
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,440
Luo Yi.

502
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
You're out.

503
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,480
Great.

504
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,480
What's wrong?

505
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,440
Tang

506
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,240
There's not much time left.

507
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,840
Who is he?

508
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,920
His name is Lu Zitired.

509
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,200
He's in a circle with us.

510
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,320
Circulation.

511
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,680
Circulation.

512
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,880
We're all in a circle.

513
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,040
Luo Yi, listen.

514
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,680
Soon,

515
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,640
the elevator behind you will fall.

516
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,320
Everything will start over.

517
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,840
We'll go back to half an hour ago.

518
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,320
In the first 30 seconds,

519
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,080
in the first 30 seconds.

520
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,720
I thought I could stop it

521
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,200
we might be able to stop it.

522
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,640
But the circulation continues.

523
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,640
Until later,

524
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,920
I accidentally dragged Lu Zitired into a circle.

525
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,080
It was only half an hour ago.

526
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,000
But we can't stop the elevator

527
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,080
in 30 minutes.

528
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,680
That's why we need someone else's help.

529
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,440
If we can't stop it,

530
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,280
we will continue to fall into this circle.

531
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,880
So we need you.

532
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,240
Although what I said

533
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,080
make you feel strange,

534
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,840
But please trust me.

535
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,440
When you wake up again,

536
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,640
time will go back to half an hour ago.

537
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,800
No.

538
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,000
If you're in the loop,

539
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,200
time may come earlier.

540
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,160
I need you.

541
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,640
Come to Yuhe Garden Restaurant to find me.

542
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,400
Zheng.

543
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,640
Luo Yi.

544
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,080
come to me.

545
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:34,640
