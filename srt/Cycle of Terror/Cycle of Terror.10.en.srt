1
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,520
Did Editor Chen go into the media building? Yes.

2
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,160
went into the media building?

3
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,440
If he entered this building,

4
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,880
it means

5
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,560
the murderer who was involved in the fall

6
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,840
is also in this building.

7
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,560
Who could it be?

8
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,280
Go upstairs.

9
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,480
Okay.

10
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,120
You stay here.

11
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,680
Call me if anything happens.

12
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,560
Okay.

13
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,560
Okay.

14
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,160
What's wrong?

15
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,039
I saw Editor Chen.

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,960
He's downstairs.

17
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,840
He went to the parking lot.

18
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,280
What?

19
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,920
He's not in this building.

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,360
I'll be right there.

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,200
Ji Jinhee.

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,720
Where is he?

23
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,760
Editor Chen just came from here.

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,640
I lost him again.

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,160
That's strange.

26
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,720
Since Editor Chen

27
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,800
to go to the media building,

28
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,440
Why did he go this way?

29
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,680
Maybe

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,400
Who is he meeting?

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,160
Isn't that Editor Chen's car?

32
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,360
Is Editor Chen looking for a car?

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,200
But he didn't drive the car.

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,440
How did he know the car was parked here?

35
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,800
If Editor Jin suddenly came here to look for a car,

36
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,360
there's only one possibility.

37
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,360
The person who drove his car

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,320
is in this media building.

39
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
I guess it's true.

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,560
Editor Jin just entered this building.

41
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,560
and met the driver.

42
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,960
But who can borrow your car?

43
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,640
Normally,

44
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,840
people don't lend their cars easily.

45
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,400
Unless they are close friends

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,160
or relatives.

47
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,400
I sent the location to Tang Xiaotong.

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,440
They'll be here soon.

49
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,160
You've been hanging out with Editor Chen for so long.

50
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,520
I thought I could get some useful clues,

51
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,920
but now I have nothing.

52
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,000
We only followed this car.

53
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,200
But the driver

54
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,760
is not him.

55
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,840
Is Editor Chen not involved in the fall case?

56
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,760
Don't worry too much.

57
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,320
There's a next round anyway.

58
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,320
Not this time.

59
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,440
We can do it next time.

60
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,560
Let's discuss it

61
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,760
let's discuss it together.

62
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,800
At least we got something.

63
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
We found the car.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
What's the point of finding this car?

65
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,760
The most important thing is to find the driver.

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,840
That's the key person we're looking for.

67
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,159
They'll be here soon.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,240
That's what happened.

69
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,960
It's less than 16 minutes until the round ends.

70
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,880
It's okay.

71
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,960
Editor Chen is not the only one.

72
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,400
There are other breakthroughs that we can find.

73
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,240
Don't worry.

74
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,360
The truth will come out.

75
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,200
We just found this car.

76
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,960
But...

77
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,680
the driver

78
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,920
I still don't know who it is.

79
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,920
We can check the dashcam.

80
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,000
How?

81
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,960
Smash the window.

82
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,320
To find the murderer as soon as possible,

83
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,440
I don't have time for this.

84
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,920
I made a mistake.

85
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,360
I'll bear the consequences.

86
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,560
No.

87
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
There are too many eyes here.

88
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,360
If we hit it like this,

89
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,760
it will cause more trouble.

90
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,720
We can find a screw knife.

91
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,040
There must be a screw knife in the media building.

92
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,600
I’ll go with Ji Jinhee.

93
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,520
Let's go.

94
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
What's going on?

95
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,600
Are they not back yet?

96
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,320
Maybe there's no screwdriver in the media building.

97
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,360
No way.

98
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,600
It's such a big media building.

99
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,800
You should use a screwdriver if something is broken.

100
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Why can't I find it?

101
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,720
Call him.

102
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,720
No one answered.

103
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,960
We don't leave our phones.

104
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,160
And we don't turn on mute.

105
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,560
Lu Zitired's phone has already had enough power on the highway.

106
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,640
Moreover, the phone is being connected.

107
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,040
Why isn't anyone answering?

108
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,800
Call Ji Jinhee.

109
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,840
He hung up.

110
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,120
He hung up.

111
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,560
Will they be in danger?

112
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,520
How about this?

113
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,720
Let's split up.

114
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,159
You two go find someone.

115
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,520
I'll go find the screwdriver.

116
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,120
Okay.

117
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,520
Ji Jinxi.

118
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,520
Lu Zitired.

119
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,080
Ji Jinxi.

120
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,880
Lu Zitired.

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,800
Lu Zitired.

122
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,720
Ji Jinxi.

123
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,640
I'm here.

124
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,280
I'm here.

125
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,320
Lu Zitired.

126
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,200
What's wrong?

127
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,600
Get up.

128
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,919
Slow down.

129
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,440
Slowly.

130
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:39,880
Here.

131
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,559
Let me see.

132
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,320
What happened?

133
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,800
Let's come in.

134
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,920
When I was looking for something,

135
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,480
I was knocked out.

136
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,920
and fainted.

137
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,160
What about Ji Jinhee?

138
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,280
I don’t know.

139
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,400
When I fell,

140
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,600
I heard a bang.

141
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,880
When I wake up

142
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
this room

143
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,920
in this room.

144
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,520
Luckily,

145
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,520
The things inside are complete.

146
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,880
It might hurt.

147
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,000
Hang in there.

148
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,360
Hang in there.

149
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,120
Hang in there.

150
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,720
Your wound...

151
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,360
need to go to the hospital for stitches.

152
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,920
I'm fine.

153
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,520
The next round is coming.

154
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,720
I won't die.

155
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,360
Someone got hurt again.

156
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
So scary.

157
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,920
Is it because the truth is approaching?

158
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,400
Let’s go find Ji Jinhee.

159
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,560
I'm worried something might happen to him.

160
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,360
Don't move.

161
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,480
Only 8 minutes left.

162
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,560
Jun.

163
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,480
You stay here with him.

164
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,520
I’ll go find Ji Jinhee.

165
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,360
Be careful.

166
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,120
Remember to lock the door.

167
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,680
If I come back,

168
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,200
I will remind you.

169
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,520
Okay.

170
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,720
Let me see.

171
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,720
Fortunately, the bleeding stopped.

172
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
I'm fine.

173
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,440
Don't worry about me.

174
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,880
Do you really not see

175
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,360
what the murderer looks like?

176
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,360
No.

177
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,600
But he's

178
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,160
as tall as me.

179
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,520
But...

180
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,280
I really don't know what tools he uses.

181
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,720
Like...

182
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,800
Like a stick

183
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,520
Lin Kun?

184
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Is it possible

185
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,200
this chair?

186
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
No way.

187
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,080
Don't move.

188
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,120
Let me help you up.

189
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:40,920
Come.

190
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,880
Sit here

191
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,080
There are more than one chair in this room

192
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,800
It's just that this corner is piled up.

193
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,640
If someone followed them and tried to stop them,

194
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,720
why did they use the tools in the room?

195
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,080
Since the behavior is premeditated,

196
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,280
you should at least prepare the tools in advance.

197
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,960
Did you not expect them to come in?

198
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
so I didn't have time to prepare.

199
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,120
Actually,

200
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,440
you don't have to stay here with me.

201
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,600
It's too dangerous here.

202
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,400
It's safer

203
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,600
is safer than being alone.

204
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,240
Thank you.

205
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,960
Tang Xiaotong

206
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,200
Do you smell anything?

207
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,800
It smells so familiar.

208
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,440
Why does it smell like gasoline?

209
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,640
Gasoline.

210
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,560
Fire!

211
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,160
Let's go.

212
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,680
Be careful.

213
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,440
Are you okay?

214
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,240
Did you see the culprit?

215
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,280
Why do you care about this now?

216
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,600
Let's find a way to get out of here.

217
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,200
Are you okay?

218
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,680
I'm fine.

219
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,600
Find a place to hide.

220
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,000
You're already hurt.

221
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,040
No.

222
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,960
I can't leave you here alone.

223
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,000
Be good.

224
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,800
The fire is going to burn you.

225
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,360
I can't let Tang Xiaotong die.

226
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,680
I must save her.

227
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,680
Hang in there.

228
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,160
We can start a new round soon.

229
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,800
No.

230
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,200
I can't sleep.

231
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,160
Jun!

232
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,040
Sister

233
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,360
Don't be afraid.

234
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,560
I'll protect you.

235
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,680
Alas.

236
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,000
Ziyao,

237
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,240
It's gastroenteritis infection caused by kidney failure.

238
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,040
The doctor said her life is not in danger.

239
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,200
She's so sick.

240
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,599
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

241
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,200
Ziyao.

242
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,119
I didn't want to affect your participation.

243
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,560
so he asked me to keep it from you.

244
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,400
You spent all your savings

245
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,200
for me.

246
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,960
Where did you get the medical fee?

247
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,400
You'd better sell the house

248
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,200
your mother left for you.

249
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,840
No one lives in that house.

250
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,800
I'm not going back.

251
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,960
Just sell it.

252
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,000
Can we stop talking about the house?

253
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,760
Let's talk about something happy.

254
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,840
The doctor said

255
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,160
Ziyao's kidney was lined up for two months.

256
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,480
I finally found it.

257
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,280
That's right.

258
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,200
It's a great thing to find the kidney.

259
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,040
Right.

260
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,000
You don't have enough money, right?

261
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,800
I have 95,000 yuan in total.

262
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,840
But...

263
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,200
it's not enough

264
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,600
from surgery to recovery.

265
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,560
I was wondering

266
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,680
why my kidney doesn't match her.

267
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,480
Didn't the doctor say

268
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,960
your immune system against Ziyao

269
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,880
We can't match even if we're siblings.

270
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,000
Alright.

271
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,200
Don't be too anxious.

272
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,160
Let's get the money.

273
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,280
We still have time.

274
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,200
There happened to be an advertisement.

275
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,000
We'll go for an interview tomorrow.

276
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Where is the interview?

277
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,320
The media building across Lincheng University

278
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,080
another half an hour.

279
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,400
Only 30 minutes left.

280
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,800
Lu Zitired.

281
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,440
The fire was already on him.

282
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,640
Gosh.

283
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,080
I wonder how he is now.

284
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,800
I forgot that his phone is still out of battery.

285
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,000
I remember he contacted us first

286
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,040
was his manager's phone.

287
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,800
Hello, who is it?

288
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,200
Hello.

289
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm looking for Lu Zitired.

290
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,360
Tell him I'm Tang Xiaotong.

291
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,400
Give it to me.

292
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,680
I'm here.

293
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,000
Tang Xiaotong

294
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,200
Are you okay?

295
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,600
I'm fine.

296
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,200
Are you okay?

297
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,160
Does it hurt?

298
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,880
I'm fine.

299
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,120
Don't worry.

300
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,640
That's good.

301
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,600
Find a safe place now.

302
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,040
It's too dangerous outside.

303
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,240
I didn't expect someone to set fire.

304
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,520
Wait for me.

305
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,160
I'll meet you at school soon.

306
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,280
Okay.

307
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,480
Let's meet at the teaching building.

308
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,840
Okay.

309
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,000
I didn't think much during the experience.

310
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,880
If I stop now, my spine will get cold.

311
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,960
Almost.

312
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,480
If we delay one more minute,

313
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,600
we'll die in the fire.

314
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,760
I wonder if Luo Yi

315
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,360
if Luo Yi found Ji Jinxi.

316
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,760
How is Ji Jinxi now?

317
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,560
Jun.

318
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,200
How is it going over there?

319
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,800
Did you find Ji Jinhee?

320
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,200
No.

321
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,600
I went to the building behind,

322
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,640
but I couldn't find Ji Jinhee.

323
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,200
Is everything okay over there?

324
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,320
I heard someone say

325
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,720
the media building was on fire.

326
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,360
I'm fine.

327
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,280
I'm fine now.

328
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,800
Good.

329
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,600
I’ll call Ji Jinhee first.

330
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,880
No one answered.

331
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,160
Did something happen to him?

332
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Don't worry.

333
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,600
He should be at the basketball court.

334
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,280
I haven't got his phone yet.

335
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,760
The fire at the media building

336
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,840
right?

337
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,680
in your room?

338
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Yes.

339
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,840
Not long after you left,

340
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,160
someone put gasoline outside.

341
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,240
Then there was a fire.

342
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,200
But luckily,

343
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,800
I entered the circle very soon.

344
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,880
Lu Zitired has been protecting me.

345
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
So I'm fine.

346
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,160
Someone set the fire.

347
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,640
or gas?

348
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,160
I can't believe someone tried to kill me.

349
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,560
It's fine now.

350
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,160
I just called Lu Zitired.

351
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,240
He is fine.

352
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,280
Our priority now is to find Ji Jinhee.

353
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,400
I haven’t seen him since the last round.

354
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,040
I wonder how he is now.

355
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,080
I'll call him again.

356
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,600
Hey.

357
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,360
Ji Jinhee.

358
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,440
It hurts.

359
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,160
I don't know who beat me up

360
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,440
I still have a headache.

361
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,480
I just don't know who did it.

362
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,080
Do you remember what happened?

363
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,760
Where did you go after you were knocked out?

364
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,040
I don't know.

365
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,080
I woke up and I was in the basketball court.

366
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,800
And

367
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,680
we shortened half an hour.

368
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,000
Do you think

369
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,520
Is this the last round?

370
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,760
In other words,

371
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,560
after Ji Jinhee was knocked out,

372
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,840
he never woke up.

373
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,840
until it reaches the cycle.

374
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,240
Where is Lu Zitired?

375
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,600
How is he?

376
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,600
Is he okay?

377
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,200
He's fine.

378
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,960
He was knocked unconscious last time.

379
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,960
Qin Ze.

380
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,160
Hello, Qin Ze.

381
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,880
We're at the entrance of this restaurant now.

382
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,800
Let's meet at the teaching building later.

383
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:42,760
Okay.

384
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,760
Let's go.

385
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,800
Let's go.

386
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,200
In other words,

387
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,200
when you went to find the screwdriver,

388
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,200
you were knocked out from behind.

389
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,000
Someone set fire to kill you.

390
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,200
We managed to escape.

391
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,840
There must be something in that black box.

392
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,200
Otherwise,

393
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,560
they wouldn't be so scared.

394
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,840
We found the information inside,

395
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,400
and even killed him.

396
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,600
That’s horrible.

397
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,800
Last time it was Ji Jinxi

398
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,800
This time, Tang and I

399
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,480
As we get to know the truth,

400
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,480
more and more people will be involved.

401
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,600
and danger will come.

402
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,000
So we must be more careful

403
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,560
we must be more careful.

404
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,280
What about you?

405
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,400
Did you open the door of that car?

406
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,080
I found a screwdriver

407
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,000
in an empty desk.

408
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,800
But when I was about to leave,

409
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,600
I found

410
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,280
The door is locked from outside.

411
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,200
Hello?

412
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,560
What?

413
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,600
It's locked.

414
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,200
What a coincidence.

415
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,280
I always feel

416
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,600
the murderer

417
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,800
is watching us in the dark.

418
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,760
Don't be too anxious.

419
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,760
This round has just begun.

420
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,240
We still have time.

421
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,000
Now we need to find that car.

422
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
Just get the black box.

423
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
The last circulation.

424
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,760
The reason we could check the black box

425
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,800
because we had a call with Ms. Oh.

426
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,600
After her car accident,

427
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,760
after the accident,

428
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,400
Luo Wenli was taken away from the hospital.

429
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,600
But nothing happened.

430
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
There shouldn't be any dashcam.

431
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,480
How could I forget that?

432
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,360
If we get the black box now,

433
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,440
it's useless.

434
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,600
I knew it.

435
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,840
Sometimes,

436
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,160
you only have one chance.

437
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,360
When you went to the hospital,

438
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,920
when you went to the hospital.

439
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,360
No.

440
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,360
No.

441
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,480
How did the murderer find us?

442
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,600
Could it be Editor Chen?

443
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,560
After we told Editor Chen

444
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,600
about Song HaoMiao's father,

445
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,200
We got into trouble because we followed him.

446
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,680
In this case,

447
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Editor Chen could be the murderer.

448
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,040
Anyway,

449
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,600
From now on,

450
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,400
we have to be alert.

451
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,200
If someone gets killed in this circulation,

452
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,000
A new cycle.

453
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,160
There may be no new cycle.

454
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,800
This might be our last loop.

455
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,480
So I think

456
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,120
the next action

457
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,800
the five of us will act together.

458
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,000
What do you think?

459
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,240
I agree.

460
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,280
Me too.

461
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,800
I agree.

462
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,000
Okay.

463
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,040
I don't know

464
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,560
I don't know the details.

465
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,200
But I heard he's a bit isolated.

466
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,880
Why do I feel like you all think I'm omnipotent?

467
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,200
My mom works in the media building.

468
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,160
But I'm not the one working here.

469
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,480
Who does he usually lend his car to?

470
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,240
I really don't know.

471
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,000
I don't know everyone.

472
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,400
I'll make a few calls.

473
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,080
I'll ask the HR.

474
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,240
Editor Jin went to the media building after leaving the parking lot.

475
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,240
And the house that caught fire was there too.

476
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,040
So I suspect the person who borrowed his car

477
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,000
is in the media building.

478
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,160
I asked.

479
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,600
It's the same as you said.

480
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,280
Editor Chen is a loner.

481
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,800
He doesn't have many friends.

482
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,440
And his car

483
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,080
usually drives by himself.

484
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,240
Then who

485
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,520
his car to?

486
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,400
I asked the HR.

487
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,600
He said Editor Chen

488
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,600
didn't use a car today.

489
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,040
He went to the cultural museum with a few reporters.

490
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,240
So

491
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,760
we took the bus together.

492
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,480
Is that why

493
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,280
because of this?

494
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,440
Maybe.

495
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,800
Could it be leaders?

496
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,400
People who don't get along usually don't borrow cars.

497
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,680
But if they are leaders,

498
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,000
we don't know.

499
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,440
We can just test him.

500
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,760
Just call Editor Chen.

501
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Tell him his car is blocked.

502
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,800
He needs to move the car.

503
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,800
If he didn't drive,

504
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,040
he would have contacted the driver.

505
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,520
We'll contact him directly.

506
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,360
Why don't you just give me your number?

507
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,800
Did I say something wrong?

508
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,600
That's not right.

509
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,640
Sure.

510
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,640
That's great.

511
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,000
You have to call right away.

512
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,240
I'll do it this time.

513
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,440
Hello?

514
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,880
Hello, boss.

515
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,200
Your car is blocking my car.

516
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,240
What's going on?

517
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,600
Oh.

518
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,280
Where's the car?

519
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,800
On Xincheng Road.

520
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,200
The one next to Lincheng University.

521
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,920
Is this your car?

522
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,200
Your phone number isn't on it.

523
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,760
Yes.

524
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,400
But I lent my car to my friend.

525
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
How about this?

526
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,200
I'll inform her now

527
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,360
to move the car.

528
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,360
What do you think?

529
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,880
I'm in a hurry.

530
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,280
Give me your phone number.

531
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
I'll make it quick.

532
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,640
Okay.

533
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,600
Just wait.

534
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,680
I'll call you.

535
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,560
134.

536
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,360
Three, two, one.

537
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,640
OK.

538
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,920
Hello

539
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,080
It's a female voice.

540
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:21,960
Hello?

541
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,080
Hello, Editor Chen.

542
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,360
I'm Tang Xiaotong, a student of Lincheng University.

543
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,760
I missed the bus to the cultural museum today.

544
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,040
You got the wrong number.

545
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,360
I called the wrong number.

546
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,040
Sorry.

547
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,640
What should I do?

548
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,960
I can't catch the bus.

549
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,520
How about this?

550
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,680
Don't worry.

551
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,320
Now,

552
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,760
take a taxi to the cultural museum.

553
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,520
I'll contact Editor Chen for you.

554
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,320
Okay.

555
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,720
Thank you so much.

556
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,880
Are you also a reporter who has eyes for the truth?

557
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,320
It doesn't matter who I am.

558
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,080
Take a taxi and go there.

559
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,880
I'll tell Editor Chen.

560
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,920
Okay.

561
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,480
Well...

562
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,240
She hung up.

563
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,880
I didn't get her name.

564
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,840
I didn't expect her to hang up so decisively when she called.

565
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,880
But I can tell that

566
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,520
she is a reporter with eyes.

567
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,440
That voice sounds familiar.

568
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,280
Who was that voice again?

569
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,440
I think

570
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,560
we can check the media list.

571
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,760
All the media in the media building have contacts.

572
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,080
I think it works.

573
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,040
