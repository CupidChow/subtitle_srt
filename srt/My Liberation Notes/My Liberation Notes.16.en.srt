1
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,219
Stop messing around with your hair.

2
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,515
Before Tae-hun shaves his head
and goes to live in a temple.

3
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,684
If I had a crazy sister,

4
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,480
a daughter who doesn't listen to him,
and a hysterical girlfriend…

5
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,403
Is there anything I can do as I please
apart from my hair?

6
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,159
You are quite bold.

7
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,120
Cutting your own hair at home.

8
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,413
I did go to a salon to fix it a little.

9
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:06,709
Still, what if you'd ruined it?
You said you cut it with kitchen scissors.

10
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,545
I just

11
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,256
wanted to try cutting it
with my own hands.

12
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,425
Are you feeling better?

13
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,311
SURROUND AIR MASSAGER

14
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,565
I'm thinking of getting this
for your father's birthday present.

15
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,656
You already gave him gifts
on Chuseok and New Year's.

16
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,200
You don't need to get
something for his birthday, too…

17
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,911
Just skip my dad's birthday. Please.

18
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,208
All right.

19
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,254
Thank you.

20
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,258
Have a safe trip home.

21
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,093
And enjoy your lunch.

22
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,763
You, too. Enjoy your lunch.

23
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,192
I'll have kimchi stew.

24
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,235
All right.

25
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,155
Me? I'll have kimchi deopbap.

26
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,114
Me too.

27
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,658
What's this?

28
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,163
I don't look good in anything
since my hair's shorter.

29
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,205
I know, right?

30
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,710
Oh, hello.

31
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,046
Hi.

32
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,133
What? Tae-hun?

33
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,552
-Hello.
-Hello.

34
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,679
Hello.

35
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,227
Your hair…

36
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,398
I cut it.

37
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,652
I see.

38
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,370
I guess we're enjoying lunch
at the same place today.

39
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,498
Yes.

40
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,835
Please, it's getting cold.

41
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,462
All right, enjoy your meal.

42
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,845
She's changed her style a lot, suddenly.

43
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,348
Yes.

44
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,854
Did you not tell him you cut your hair?

45
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,072
It's like a war
whenever I go through Gangnam.

46
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,908
It's not like that
when you go north, right?

47
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,493
I'm going to Gangnam, too, today.

48
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,453
I have plans with my former colleagues.

49
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:51,082
You must have gotten along with them
at your previous workplace.

50
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,454
Mi-jeong…

51
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,372
Hello.

52
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,249
It's been a while.

53
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,459
It's been ages.

54
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,419
Not for you two though, right?

55
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,088
Are you still dating Mi-jeong's sister?

56
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,507
Yes, of course.

57
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,968
Mi-jeong, you just keep getting--

58
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,473
I forgot we shouldn't talk
about stuff like this.

59
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,640
I forgot.

60
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,101
You should still finish
what you were saying.

61
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,269
"Getting" what?

62
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,563
Getting…

63
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,108
Happy New Year.

64
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,528
-Let's go inside.
-Yes.

65
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,988
-Let's go.
-Let's go in.

66
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,533
A while ago, I told my publisher friend

67
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,078
about the Liberation Club
at my school reunion.

68
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,330
And he asked me if he could see

69
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,457
what we wrote.

70
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,795
The liberation notes of all four of us.

71
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,172
He wants to publish them.

72
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,510
Publish them?

73
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,887
He said how we came together
would make a great story.

74
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,972
He said it's going to be something.

75
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,391
I have no idea what that something is,

76
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,019
but he was talking to me
with his eyes all sparkling.

77
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,604
It made me excited.

78
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,857
He says it could be a slice-of-life story

79
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,776
about ordinary office workers.

80
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,153
Apparently, it's a great subject.

81
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,613
"Liberation."

82
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,367
I told him we didn't do it anymore,

83
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,286
but he keeps asking me to show him.

84
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,206
But it's not my decision
to make on my own.

85
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,543
So, I told him
I would ask you all in person.

86
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,380
Even today, he wanted to
come here with me so I had to stop him.

87
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:07,385
Are we going to be authors, then?

88
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,847
I don't think I can do that.

89
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,932
Why? Is it too much?

90
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,601
I haven't even written that much,

91
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,604
and it's too personal…

92
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,610
What if we use fake names?
Like pseudonyms.

93
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,865
Let's make pseudonyms.

94
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,162
I've also stopped halfway.

95
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,665
Wouldn't it still be quite a lot
if we gathered all of ours?

96
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,961
I've filled about two notebooks.

97
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,338
I kept writing
even after we stopped the club.

98
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,048
That's impressive.

99
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,427
What about you, Mi-jeong?
Do you still write?

100
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,389
No, I was done
after I had finished one notebook.

101
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:59,395
It sounds like
you've accomplished something.

102
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,563
It's not that.

103
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,859
But I'm not sure if it's good enough
to be published as a book--

104
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,070
He says it is!
Just the story from the four of us is…

105
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,241
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,162
I shouldn't have told him
without asking you guys first.

107
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,664
I shouldn't act like this at my age.

108
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,626
I told him about all of you,

109
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,295
and about the things
you wanted to be liberated from.

110
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,090
He liked it. He said it has weight.

111
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,145
When we were saying goodbye,

112
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,816
we were determined to see it through
to the end wherever we are.

113
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,530
I guess I was
just caught up in the moment.

114
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,867
I don't even know
where my notebook is now.

115
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,497
I was moved by the word "liberation,"

116
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:04,794
and I was moved again when you
mentioned your father's handwriting.

117
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:09,215
I was moved by all those moments,

118
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,263
then I went back
to living the way I used to.

119
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,893
But at the beginning, I thought,

120
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:25,147
"This must have been what it's like
to fight for Korea's liberation."

121
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,527
The feeling of holding something
in your heart.

122
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,323
My liberation.

123
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,910
But…

124
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,997
even though we did make a start,

125
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,333
we didn't accomplish anything, did we?

126
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,462
But…

127
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,425
we can't exactly say we
accomplished nothing, don't you think?

128
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,262
Do you feel a little liberated?

129
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,933
Well, some days, I feel like I am.

130
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,978
And some days, I feel like
I'm back to square one.

131
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:07,607
But I still feel
I've been liberated even just a little.

132
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,986
Do you not feel like that at all, Mr. Cho?

133
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,746
I found out why I was suffering,

134
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,248
but other than that…

135
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,258
I think that's what this is all about.

136
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,555
Finding out what my issue is.

137
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,677
Let's end it with Hyeon.

138
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:21,889
Sir?

139
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,309
I'm sure he's pocketed
a lot of money all this time.

140
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,438
Make it look like we're closing the place
because business isn't good

141
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,941
and move the shop somewhere else.

142
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,480
I have a good feeling.

143
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,482
See? It's a flush.

144
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,320
A flush? I knew it.

145
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,287
-I feel bad for you.
-Damn it.

146
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,140
You kept telling me to come back

147
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,267
when I was living quietly
in the countryside.

148
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,436
It was because you needed money to gamble.

149
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,527
Can't you stop?

150
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,321
Can't you?

151
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,782
-Can't you just stop?
-You're one to talk!

152
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,367
Can you stop?

153
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,995
You drink from sunrise to sunset.

154
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,373
You can't even remember your own number.
Who are you to tell me that?

155
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,711
Mind your own business!

156
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:36,065
If the daily revenue goes below 80 million
even once starting tomorrow, you're out.

157
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,738
Understood?

158
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,163
You're out if it drops
below that even once.

159
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,009
And why do I have to remember my number?

160
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,323
Aren't you going to answer?

161
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,784
Sir?

162
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,953
Your phone's ringing.

163
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,960
Isn't this your phone?

164
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,546
What ringing, sir?

165
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,293
We'll be off.

166
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,502
Good night.

167
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,599
Well, I'm taking the bus.

168
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,934
I see.

169
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:39,939
-All right, then. Happy New…
-Yes. Happy New Year, sir.

170
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,654
Get home safe.

171
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,807
I could never forget
what you said that day, Mi-jeong.

172
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,019
You once said to me

173
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,855
that when you decided to be liberated,

174
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,235
you started feeling emotions
that you'd never felt before.

175
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,117
You said you suddenly felt so lovable.

176
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,792
I wonder what it's like

177
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,628
to feel lovable.

178
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,431
See you again.

179
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,473
Take care.

180
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,534
My gosh.

181
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,788
So you can joke around, too.

182
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,197
I thought my hands would get shaky first,

183
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,492
but I'm hearing things instead.

184
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,746
Well, my brain must be breaking down.

185
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:06,627
I deserve it. Since I drink as soon as
I open my eyes in the morning.

186
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,798
Not a lot of people
start drinking in the morning.

187
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,801
They say even heavy drinkers
can't drink in the morning.

188
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,472
But it's easier than being sober.

189
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,560
Why is it hard to stay sober?

190
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,984
When I'm sober,

191
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,490
all the people from my past come to me.

192
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,201
All of them.

193
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,371
Even the dead.

194
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,586
When I wake up in the morning,

195
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,965
the ones who were resting…

196
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,844
get up one by one

197
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,179
and come to me.

198
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,473
One by one.

199
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,809
Endlessly…

200
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,479
The ones who come for me…

201
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,357
I destroy them all inside my head.

202
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,568
And curse at them.

203
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,155
After I sit there

204
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,615
for an hour doing that,

205
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,994
I get exhausted.

206
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,081
It feels like…

207
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,377
there's sewage waste
flowing inside my body.

208
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,507
I say, "Let's get up."

209
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,634
"Let's drink."

210
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,889
"They'll all go away if I drink."

211
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,268
That's why

212
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,104
I'm more generous drunk

213
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,816
than I am when sober.

214
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,158
Among those people who came for you,

215
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,702
was I one of them?

216
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,013
What's wrong with me?

217
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:29,186
I'm not even an alcoholic,
but I understand you perfectly.

218
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,817
When I'm brushing my teeth in the morning
after a good sleep,

219
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,655
Choi Jun-ho, that asshole,
is waiting for me in my head.

220
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,158
Han Su-jin, that bitch, is there too.

221
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,286
And that bastard, Jung Chan-hyeok, too.

222
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,791
All I did was sleep and wake up.

223
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,295
But I get angry while brushing my teeth.

224
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,426
What's that bastard's phone number?

225
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,430
Just give me the number.
I'll take care of it.

226
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,978
That bastard…

227
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,398
shouldn't pay me back.

228
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,486
Because I want to prove
what a terrible person he is

229
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,364
for as long as possible.

230
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,992
I want to prove to the world

231
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:30,330
that he didn't leave me
because I was small and insignificant,

232
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,291
but because he was a terrible person.

233
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,043
That's why he left me like that.

234
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,130
I wanted to make him think

235
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,842
that he was
a terrible person during his wedding.

236
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,429
And if he ever has a child,
I want to go to their birthday party

237
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:50,600
and remind him again
that he's a terrible person.

238
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,778
That's why

239
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,449
I'm always exhausted.

240
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,332
Since I decided
to be someone who exists only to prove…

241
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,504
how terrible someone is.

242
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:28,472
Among those people
you wanted to prove were terrible…

243
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,144
was I one of them?

244
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,569
You're like…

245
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,825
a sanctuary that I keep within my head.

246
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,287
Because I decided
to keep you away from my hate.

247
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,833
After you left,

248
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,836
my mom passed away,

249
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,005
and my dad remarried…

250
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,675
I felt like

251
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,054
I was constantly being abandoned.

252
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:15,185
In every kind of relationship I've had,
I've never walked away first.

253
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,062
The other person always left me.

254
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,858
So I thought maybe
something was wrong with me.

255
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,654
And since it was so painful
to find a problem with myself,

256
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,573
I made myself believe
everyone else was the asshole.

257
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,119
But I was

258
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,247
determined from the moment I met you.

259
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,460
that I wouldn't make
any more assholes in my life.

260
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:45,841
That I'd gladly let you fly away
if you become a better person.

261
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,511
That I wouldn't be embarrassed
even if you hit rock bottom.

262
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,765
That I'd only cheer you on
from one person to another.

263
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:58,645
When I felt like I would hate you,
I begged in my head,

264
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,065
"Please, don't even let him catch a cold."

265
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:07,404
"Please don't let him suffer
from a hangover."

266
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,785
But since I was unhappy all the time,

267
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,706
when I wanted to blame you out of anger,

268
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,958
I would say,
"Jung Chan-hyeok, you bastard."

269
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,130
Whenever nothing was going my way

270
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,799
and I didn't know where to vent my anger,

271
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,678
I said, "Jung Chan-hyeok, you bastard."

272
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,142
Then it occurred to me,

273
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,145
"What if he pays it all back?"

274
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,523
"Who would I curse, then?"

275
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,696
I'm worried he might pay me back.

276
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,038
Come to think of it…

277
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,002
I've never caught a cold.

278
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,822
Everyone, run backwards
and wave your arms and say, "Welcome!"

279
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,991
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

280
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,120
Face front again!

281
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,417
See you later!

282
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,337
Hurry it up, okay?

283
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:51,132
We've got all kinds of pork.
It's an all-you-can-eat pork buffet!

284
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,904
It sure is different.

285
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,992
Mi-jeong went to the store early
in the morning to get freshly made ones.

286
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,493
Yes, you can tell.

287
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,454
Do you like the matching shirts?

288
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,169
That kimchi isn't good. Don't eat it.

289
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,505
There's amazing kimchi in the fridge.

290
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,304
Why did you get your hair cut

291
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,056
in the middle of winter?

292
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,228
I had it cut since it was
too hard to wash it.

293
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,314
It feels so light now that it's short.

294
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,565
Goodness me.

295
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,783
This is medication for your knee, Dad.

296
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,618
Take two tablets in the morning.

297
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,418
You've done well.

298
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,629
How did you pay back all of it?

299
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,257
You're amazing.

300
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,842
It's nothing.

301
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:25,352
I can treat you all to beef sashimi
and everything, now.

302
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,397
If I make 2,8 million won now,
it's all mine.

303
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,483
I reduced the amount of money I spend,

304
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,193
so I don't really spend much.

305
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,279
I can eat whatever I want

306
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,739
and still have some money left.

307
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,159
I never realized
2,8 million won was so much.

308
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,161
Just like eating an almond

309
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,872
after being on a strict diet

310
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,541
and thinking, "Wow, an almond
could taste this good?"

311
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,668
Is it something like that?

312
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,881
Seriously, I was worried
she might divorce my dad.

313
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,510
So, I just sucked it up
and paid it all back.

314
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:02,263
What would would have
my stepmother thought

315
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,682
if she saw that his children
had trouble with money?

316
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,976
She might regret marrying him.

317
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,898
She probably felt very secure
that my dad owned some land.

318
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,528
If my dad gets divorced,
I'll have to bring him to live with us.

319
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,031
You know,

320
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,450
when my mom passed away

321
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,454
and I was having all three meals
with just my dad,

322
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,082
I kept worrying that we might
grow old together like this

323
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,792
if I don't do anything.

324
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,460
It was depressing.

325
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:38,299
So I thought, "I need to get it together
and help my dad remarry."

326
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,594
As soon as
someone set him up with a woman,

327
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,430
I got him an exfoliation treatment

328
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,056
and a facelift.

329
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,853
I just can't believe Mr. Yeom even went
to the dermatology clinic with you.

330
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:50,770
Right.

331
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,772
He had to if he didn't want to
live with me forever.

332
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,527
And why would I ruin his marriage
that we put so much effort into?

333
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,990
So, I just had to suck it up
and put my all into paying it back.

334
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,953
Saving money may be hard,
but spending it was so easy.

335
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,705
The money I saved over ten years…

336
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:12,625
That's why you don't save any.
Just spend it all.

337
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,045
I really thought I hit the jackpot.

338
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:21,050
I was going to sell sweet potato ovens
to over 2,000 convenience stores.

339
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,136
And looking at the warehouse
full of ovens,

340
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:29,350
I thought I had finally
made a breakthrough in life.

341
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:34,147
But to have given all of that up…

342
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,318
I'm amazing.

343
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,279
I gave up selling them to stores

344
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,281
and only sold 300 of them that winter.

345
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,659
The other 1700 are still
sitting in the warehouse.

346
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,453
The story keeps changing.

347
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,288
You said you failed

348
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,832
since you couldn't
go to the machine testing.

349
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,584
I could but I didn't.

350
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,836
They were all loaded in a truck.

351
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,965
And the test was just a formality.
They were the number one bid.

352
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:05,053
Then why didn't you go?
It was all yours for the taking.

353
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,265
What?

354
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,309
What?

355
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,398
This is so unlike you.

356
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,776
Are you teasing me?
Why aren't you saying anything?

357
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,196
You know

358
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,241
how I always vent by talking?

359
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,869
But I don't want to this time.

360
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,040
This silence of mine.

361
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,042
The stoic and cool me
that only I remember.

362
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,671
Jeez…

363
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,465
I won't do it because if I do,

364
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,134
the weight of my silence
will be lightened.

365
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,431
It'll be my own secret, forever.

366
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,641
You little…

367
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,726
Don't worry, alright?

368
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,436
He'll tell us in a minute.

369
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,878
What's with you? The minute's almost up.

370
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,385
You know what?

371
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,055
-He'll tell us if we tickle him.
-That's right.

372
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,682
-Tell us.
-He'll tell us.

373
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:41,858
The words sit on the tip of your tongue,
wanting to come out.

374
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,653
But when you swallow them back down,

375
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,490
that's when you know you're an adult.

376
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:54,245
You fall in love with yourself thinking,
"I can't believe I held back."

377
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,043
I'm falling in love with myself again.

378
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,587
This bastard…

379
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,258
Why did he get so annoying?

380
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,931
It's amazing.

381
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,613
I didn't feel good
for even a second today.

382
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,825
But right at the end, I do.

383
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,330
I'm going to walk.

384
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,958
Please get in, sir. You'll catch a cold.

385
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,336
I won't.

386
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,520
YEAR 2008
YEOM MI-JEONG

387
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,273
YEOM MI-JEONG

388
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,745
MY FRIEND EUN-O WON TODAY
I FELL IN LOVE WITH EUN-O'S PASSION.

389
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,163
BUT I CAN'T STAND SONG JI-SEON.

390
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,507
MY LIBERATION YEOM MI-JEONG

391
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,427
MY LIBERATION

392
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,698
When I sit here

393
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:58,119
with your father and watch the snow,

394
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,874
I think, "I never thought
this kind of day would come."

395
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,199
RECENT DESTINATION

396
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,868
Has Yeom Gi-jeong decided
not to come anymore?

397
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,206
She doesn't come
to the bar anymore, either.

398
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,248
Did you break up?

399
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,669
She's in Sanpo.
It's her father's birthday.

400
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,260
I wonder what kind of excuse
she'll have next week.

401
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,483
Hello?

402
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,654
If I have to,

403
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,783
I'll take her and disappear,
so don't worry.

404
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,922
There's egg bread!

405
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,259
-Are we not buying any?
-He said Gi-jeong's not here!

406
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,100
Help yourself.

407
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:45,852
Okay.

408
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,022
I wonder if I'll ever see
Mi-jeong gossiping before I die.

409
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,526
I talk a lot.

410
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,153
With whom?

411
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,950
No. I forgot the dongchimi.

412
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,035
It's okay. There's a lot to eat here.

413
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,996
We've got amazing dongchimi.

414
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,665
Take some with you.
I'll pack them for you.

415
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,749
All right.

416
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,681
If you think you would be fine
living on your own,

417
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,850
just do that.

418
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,687
It's okay for you to do that.

419
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,611
I don't think someone who's
gotten married twice can say that.

420
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:43,201
I can because I've done it twice.

421
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:50,958
Your dad

422
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,878
isn't strong.

423
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,673
You guys

424
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,926
are better than me.

425
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,799
There's a film called Return To Paradise.

426
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,885
I saw it when I was in high school.

427
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,555
It's a story about three men backpacking.

428
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,352
They hang out for a few days together
and then part ways.

429
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,480
Two of them decide
to go back to their country,

430
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,524
and one of them decides to stay.

431
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:01,821
But after a few years,
some lawyer comes to talk to them.

432
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,950
The three of them smoked marijuana
when they were together,

433
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,538
but the one who stayed
got caught for possession.

434
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,919
But the marijuana he had was enough
for him to receive the death penalty.

435
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:22,550
The lawyer tells the two of them that
if they testify they were in it together,

436
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,469
he could avoid the death penalty
since the punishment will be

437
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,138
reduced by one-third.

438
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,098
But…

439
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:34,562
all three of them would have to
be in prison for three years.

440
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,273
I wouldn't go.

441
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:44,572
The one who was
pretending to be conscientious

442
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,116
and said they should help him
avoid the death penalty

443
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,036
runs away after seeing
how bad the prison is in that country.

444
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,371
But…

445
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,291
the one who said he didn't want to go,

446
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,920
he begins to change his mind
after seeing what it's like there.

447
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,090
He thinks, "Shouldn't we stay with him?"

448
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,596
In the end, the one who pretended
to be conscientious runs away,

449
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,100
and the man who was arrested
is sentenced to death.

450
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,604
And the one who changed his mind
testifies on his friend's behalf

451
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,189
and becomes imprisoned.

452
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,692
It's ridiculous, right?

453
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:23,819
But…

454
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,364
on the day of the execution,

455
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:31,327
when the man who was sentenced
to death is trembling on the scaffold,

456
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:36,999
the one who testified for him
shouts from inside his cell,

457
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,087
"I'm here!"

458
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,464
"Look into my eyes."

459
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,716
"I'm right here!"

460
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,928
"I'm right here!"

461
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:55,851
For those ten minutes…

462
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,479
Or maybe it was five.

463
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,234
I felt I could be
in that prison for three years

464
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,196
just to be able to experience
those five minutes.

465
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,493
Though they weren't even close friends.

466
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,167
You bastard.

467
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,796
You watched an R-rated movie
when you were in high school…

468
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:28,968
I'm on my way.

469
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,098
They told me to hurry so we can go home.

470
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,143
When are you coming again?

471
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,608
FAR-INFRARED SWEET POTATO OVEN
TASTY SWEET POTATOES

472
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,530
Yes…

473
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,825
You know the test is at our store, right?

474
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,827
I know. I'm leaving now.

475
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,538
Why are you leaving so early?
It's only 11.

476
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,000
I need to go set things up in advance.
I also need to stop by somewhere.

477
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,918
I'll see you there.

478
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,692
Hyeok-su.

479
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:44,126
Sir. Can you hear me?

480
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,170
His vitals are dropping…

481
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,589
CALLING
JI HYEON-A

482
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,094
Hyeok-su doesn't have much time left.
Hurry here, quickly.

483
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,517
We can't reach his guardian.
At this rate, it's a matter of hours.

484
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,727
Do you have any other numbers?

485
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,020
We don't.

486
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,023
Give me his mother's number.
I'll try calling her.

487
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,909
INCOMING CALL
LEE MIN-GYU

488
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:21,830
Yes.

489
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:26,502
Why aren't you here yet?
The people from HQ are here.

490
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,589
I need to hang up for now.

491
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,342
I got it. I'll call you back.

492
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,305
CALL
JI HYEON-A

493
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,390
JI HYEON-A

494
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,106
Hyeok-su.

495
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,358
I'm sorry

496
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,069
for making you feel anxious.

497
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:37,948
Hyeok-su.

498
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,619
It will be just the two of us.

499
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,704
I'll be here for you.

500
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,248
I think…

501
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,752
I was destined for things like this.

502
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,174
I was also there when my grandpa,
grandma, and my mother

503
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,717
passed away.

504
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,345
Isn't it weird?

505
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:03,724
Most people my age
haven't even witnessed one death.

506
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,311
But…

507
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,148
I think it's better that it's me.

508
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,651
Whenever I send them away,

509
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,738
I was relieved that I was there.

510
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,370
My legs led me here again, like a psychic.

511
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,333
Hyeok-su.

512
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,380
I know since I've sent three people away.

513
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,507
When you go…

514
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,387
you'll feel better.

515
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,599
Their faces told me.

516
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,106
So Hyeok-su,

517
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,067
don't be afraid…

518
00:44:58,737 --> 00:44:59,822
and leave peacefully.

519
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:01,865
Gently.

520
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,342
I'm right here.

521
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:47,578
The person you have called
is not available at the moment…

522
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:10,267
FAR-INFRARED SWEET POTATO OVEN
TASTY SWEET POTATOES

523
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:20,486
CAFE MONOLOGUE
OPENS FEBRUARY 18, 2022

524
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,091
What did they say?

525
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,969
They said to come starting tomorrow.

526
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:53,185
Didn't you say
the one in Jamwon-dong pays well too?

527
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:57,439
I'll keep working there,
and this is just for the weekend.

528
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,235
I thought it'd be nice to work in Gangbuk.

529
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,655
Take it easy, no one's after you.

530
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:11,745
I only feel alive
when I exhaust myself completely.

531
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:16,208
If I have any energy left, I feel heavy.

532
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:20,629
"Nothing has gone my way,
and I haven't achieved anything,

533
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,340
but I've done my best at least."

534
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,262
Is it like the way you feel spent
after having diarrhea?

535
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,808
I wish I had diarrhea.

536
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,019
Drink an iced latte.

537
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,729
Shall I buy you one?

538
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,482
I need to drink it at home, not outside.

539
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,615
You look better than I expected.

540
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,202
Why wouldn't I?

541
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:59,001
The weather's nice.
Spring must be on its way.

542
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,336
It must be.

543
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,590
Spring will come, then summer,

544
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,633
and then winter.

545
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,640
Bye, then.

546
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,641
Bye.

547
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,147
I'll come to the convenience store
after work on the weekend.

548
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,623
I regretted it.

549
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,501
That I said

550
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:46,256
I wanted to escape
from feeling weak at the Liberation Club.

551
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,053
I feel like I meddled
with something unacceptable

552
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,597
that I was supposed
to pretend not to know about.

553
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,141
And because you, Gi-jeong,

554
00:48:56,933 --> 00:49:00,479
were drawn to me after hearing those words
and felt sorry for me,

555
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:04,816
I realized you wouldn't be
able to leave me even if you wanted to.

556
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,445
You're right, I can't leave you.
No, I won't leave you.

557
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,947
What's wrong with being
drawn to someone out of pity?

558
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,659
With human emotions,

559
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:17,871
you can't always distinguish
between pity, respect, and love clearly.

560
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:20,624
I can't. I've got them
all balled up in a lump.

561
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,710
I respect you, Tae-hun.

562
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,213
And I pity you and I love you.
I feel all of it.

563
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,426
By the way,

564
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,846
why did you cut your hair?

565
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,390
What?

566
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,725
Can't I cut my hair?

567
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,268
Aren't I allowed?

568
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,823
I don't know how it got like this.

569
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,493
I wanted to be one to cheer you on.

570
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,537
That's what I wanted,

571
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,291
but it feels like I'm just another woman
who's making your life harder.

572
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:08,839
I mean, to be honest, I don't know
what the problem is.

573
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:10,924
"What did Tae-hun do that was so wrong?"

574
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:13,260
"And why do I feel so wronged?"

575
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:17,556
I mean, there's nothing particular
I can pick out as an example, it's just…

576
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:22,269
It's just this general feeling
that I'm losing at something.

577
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,980
I'm ashamed to be a woman
with so little self-esteem

578
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,940
who breaks down at the glare of a kid.

579
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,318
I was used to how
Gyeong-seon treats people.

580
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:33,530
She's always been that way,
ever since high school.

581
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,824
"But why are her words hurting me again?"

582
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:38,910
"Because I love Tae-hun?"

583
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,330
"But why does that have to be a reason
for me to feel small?"

584
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,001
"Love is supposed to give you strength,

585
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:52,507
but will I be happy if we broke up?"

586
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,095
But if I imagine breaking up,

587
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,140
my arm feels numb.

588
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,226
I get a kind of shock under my arm.

589
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:09,191
So, it's clear I can't break up with you,
which means I have to go further.

590
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,153
But I don't know how to do that.

591
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,203
I didn't say this
because it felt like an excuse,

592
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,206
but I'll say it anyway.

593
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,585
For some reason,

594
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,673
when I see a kid toddling along
from behind,

595
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,886
I feel bad.

596
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,139
"In thirty years,

597
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,434
what kind of burdens
will they be carrying around?"

598
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:49,064
"What kind of humiliation
will they have endured?"

599
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,151
"I was able to because it was me."

600
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,862
"But that kid…"

601
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:01,660
I wish that no child would ever
have to endure those kinds of things.

602
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,413
And of course, I'm glad I have Yu-rim.

603
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:09,167
I can't even imagine my life
without Yu-rim.

604
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,587
"Was I happy to be born?"

605
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,008
If I think about it seriously…

606
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,264
the answer is no.

607
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,521
I think that's why when you said
you weren't pregnant,

608
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:31,815
I let out

609
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,735
a sigh of relief involuntarily.

610
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,033
That was it

611
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,995
for Cho Tae-hun's excuse.

612
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:56,798
But…

613
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,386
if we have to live because we were born,

614
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,306
how are we supposed to live?

615
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:11,313
I'll be a man.

616
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,983
Four women are too much for you, right?

617
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,401
From today, I'm a man.

618
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,153
I'm a man.

619
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,989
That's why I cut my hair.

620
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,628
Go on ahead. I'll stop by the bank.

621
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,670
-Sure.
-Yes.

622
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,386
Yes, what about the chief?

623
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,515
Isn't he there?

624
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,686
I really need to discuss this with him.

625
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,439
One moment.

626
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,025
Yes, sir.

627
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,485
Take your card.

628
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,862
Yes, I just got off the phone
with Mr. Lee.

629
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,032
Yes, he said the handover wasn't complete.

630
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,242
Oh, I see.

631
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,162
Yes.

632
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:10,580
Yes, I understand.

633
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,052
He didn't. It was his bag.

634
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:03,717
Do you

635
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,302
work around here?

636
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,305
Yes, at H Card.

637
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,979
It seems you work around here, too.

638
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,107
There, at MC Mall.

639
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,572
I'll send you a million won tomorrow.

640
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,118
Give me some more time for the rest.

641
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,584
I'm sorry for dragging it out so long.

642
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,588
It's fine.

643
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,965
I'll be off. It's my lunch break.

644
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,593
Right.

645
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,677
Sure, bye.

646
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,705
Yeom Mi-jeong.

647
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,251
Yeom Mi-jeong!

648
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,109
-Where are you headed?
-To buy alcohol.

649
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,320
There's a convenience store this way too.

650
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,829
I like it when you shout, "Yeom Mi-jeong!"

651
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:10,218
When I went home, I read my old diaries,
and I was so surprised.

652
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,304
Because the childhood that I remember

653
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:15,932
and the one recorded in my diaries
were so different.

654
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:20,061
I thought I was a clueless kid
who didn't feel anything for anyone

655
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,814
and had no sense of presence.

656
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,859
But in the diaries, I've got so much love.

657
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:29,904
"I like her because of this.
I like him because of that."

658
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,490
Turns out I was a really passionate kid.

659
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,659
You didn't know?

660
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:36,911
You're passionate.

661
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,255
Why did you drink so much?

662
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,633
Because I felt good.

663
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:00,602
Sometimes…

664
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,730
very occasionally,

665
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,110
it's quiet inside my head
even when I'm sober.

666
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,448
As if…

667
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,993
everything's stopped, I guess?

668
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,873
Then I pour in the hard liquor again.

669
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,296
When I feel comfortable and happy

670
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,258
I drink to break it
because I hate feeling that way.

671
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,679
When I feel my life
is going okay, I drink.

672
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,557
I beat myself up in advance.

673
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:44,938
"I'm not happy."

674
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,567
"I'm definitely not happy."

675
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,985
"I've been miserable."

676
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,698
"So please punish me just a little.
Please, only a little."

677
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,079
"Waking up and sitting up
in the morning is hard."

678
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:05,458
"I felt like I couldn't even
take five steps back,

679
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:09,045
so I didn't go back for my umbrella
and walked in the rain."

680
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,841
"Because those five steps
were too difficult,

681
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,678
I got soaked in the rain."

682
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:23,393
"My life is too hard, I'm so tired."

683
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:28,523
"I'm already being punished harshly.
So please, I'm begging you!"

684
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,992
Why are you so adorable?

685
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,841
When those people come
to you again in the morning,

686
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,593
laugh like you did now.

687
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,472
Welcome them like that.

688
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,197
Yeom Mi-jeong!

689
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,423
Gi-jeong.

690
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,136
Gi-jeong.

691
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:50,271
Why did you buy more? I still have some.

692
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,024
I just thought of it on my way.

693
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,194
Wait. What's this?

694
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,863
I felt a bit bad about always
just bringing you egg bread.

695
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,073
Well, I'll be off.

696
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:01,949
Wait. What is it?

697
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,953
I asked you what this is!

698
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:07,914
It's my heart.

699
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:09,707
What?

700
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,207
Pick-up girl, Yeom Gi-jeong.

701
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,918
I found the head of a rose
that broke off from its stem

702
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,587
and placed it in a soy sauce dish
filled with water.

703
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:00,341
Even if I tried to make it stand,
it doesn't have a stem,

704
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,218
so I laid it in a soy sauce dish.

705
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:08,182
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if our love was a long-stemmed rose

706
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,059
blooming beautifully in a vase?

707
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:15,440
This rose lying exhausted
in a soy sauce dish reminded me of you

708
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:16,858
and me.

709
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,403
I'm afraid it would wither faster
if I'm not looking

710
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,029
so I can't take my eyes off of it.

711
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,074
That's the type of woman I am.

712
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,620
A man who buys me egg bread

713
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,790
once every three days
in the winter because I said I liked it.

714
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,461
What if I said I liked beef?

715
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,632
I compliment myself
for saying I liked egg bread,

716
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:45,553
and as for you,
who always buys me egg bread…

717
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:48,848
I love you.

718
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:02,028
Tae-hun, the buttons on your coat
are done up wrong.

719
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:35,436
I'll be back later. Take care.

-Yes, it is.

01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,431
-It's right here.
-It's here.

725
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,766

LECTURE ROOM 302

727
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:24,235
Hello, everyone.

728
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:25,528
-Hello.
-Hello.

729
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:27,655
-The weather's quite cold, isn't it?
-It is.

730
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:30,825
All right. Let me just
take a quick look at you.

731
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:32,618
All right.

732
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:40,251
So, let's take some time
to get to know each other.

733
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:42,920
You at the front, when's your birthday?

734
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,046
It's May 9th.

735
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,507
You were born on a good day.

736
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,427
-And what about your birthday?
-Mine's September 19th.

737
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:50,469
-September 19th?
-Yes.

738
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,597
You were born on an even better day.

739
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,932
And may I ask the day you'll die?

740
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,601
Yes, the day you'll die.

741
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:57,727
You don't know yet?

742
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,645
May I ask you when you're planning to die?

743
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,063
I'm not sure.

744
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,399
-You don't really know, right? Me neither.
-No.

745
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:08,696
We all know when we were born,
but we have no idea when we'll die, right?

746
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:12,491
So, whether you're alive or dead,

747
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:15,328
you're never prepared
for your last journey.

748
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,997
As those who've experienced it know,

749
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:22,251
it's very sad when a precious person
in your life passes away.

750
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:26,339
And the person
who stays beside them to help them

751
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,132
leave comfortably and beautifully,

752
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:32,637
and to help the rest of their family
see them off in peace, is…

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

A funeral director,
which all of you will soon become.

01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,690
Everyone, please take
the textbook out from under your desk.

758
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:53,866
-You've heard of a wedding planner, right?
-Yes.

759
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,702
Their job is to manage the entire wedding.

760
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:01,332
You could say that funeral directors
do the same for funerals.

761
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:05,211
Like how a wedding is a ceremonial event
for a couple embarking on a new beginning,

762
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:11,926
a funeral is also a ceremonial event
to mark the end of a person's life.

763
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:13,761
Welcome.

764
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:19,850
I'm glad to see everyone who's come here
to become a funeral director.

765
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,353
My name is Choi Seok-jun.

766
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:24,355
All right, then, what is a funeral?

767
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:25,898
Turn to page 48.

768
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:30,695
Let's take a look at the process
and the meaning of the modern funeral.

769
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:34,156
You can read the opening paragraph
at home if you'd like.

770
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,953
In a three-day funeral,
there are many tasks that you must do.

771
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:43,457
On the first day, the day the person dies,
the body is moved and placed in a coffin.

772
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:47,545
Plans are then made for the funeral
and a funeral home is chosen,

773
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:51,090
and mourners come after the news
of the death has been announced.

774
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,426
On the second day,
the corpse is dressed, and…

Until it works.

779
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,303
I would love to.

780
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:38,554
I'm in.

781
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:46,562
Let's do it.

782
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:55,863
If you leave me just like that

783
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:03,496
What will I do?

784
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,289
-Hey, Ok-ja.
-Yes, sir.

785
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:07,958
How old are you? This song's old.

786
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:11,921
It's because I have an old-fashioned name.

787
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:23,409
How dare you touch my money?

788
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:30,499
Put it down.

789
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,334
Go on.

790
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:41,510
The manager here owes us
160 million won in gambling debt,

791
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,179
but this is only 50 million.

792
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:47,641
What shall we do? When will you
give me the other 110 million?

793
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:05,075
Boss. You can leave first.
We'll take care of the rest here.

794
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,536
If we're lucky,

795
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:10,497
we might be able to get
the rest of the money.

796
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,003
Did you all take classes
to learn to talk like that?

797
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,839
How do you all sound exactly the same?

798
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:22,009
"I wasn't good in school, I'm a dropout."

799
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:26,680
Hey, Woo-bin.

01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:29,433
Kim Woo-bin.

801
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:31,352
Yes, sir!

802
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,062
Close the shop.

803
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:35,397
We won't be opening today.

804
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,069
Close the shop! We're not open today!

805
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:41,237
You bastard!

806
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,594
Hey, Chun-ja.

807
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,433
Chun-ja. Hey.

808
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:36,435
Hey.

809
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:37,394
Chun-ja.

810
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:39,521
Hey.

811
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:41,190
Yes…

812
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:42,232
Yes, sir.

813
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:41,041
HYEON-JIN

814
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:54,555
The person you have called
is currently unavailable.

815
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:58,100
You'll be directed
to voicemail after the tone.

816
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:09,653
You're now one of the people

817
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:16,910
who come to me
in the morning when I'm sober.

818
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:22,332
You're one of the people who make me
curse from the moment I wake up.

819
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:24,710
Hyeon-jin.

820
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:30,007
I'll welcome you back.

821
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:34,636
I'll welcome you with arms wide open,

822
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,391
so I hope to see you again alive.

823
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:06,562
Seven seconds.

824
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:04,536
FIVE HUNDRED WON

825
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:39,905
There's this part in my liberation note.

826
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:42,282
Yeom Mi-jeong's life is

827
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:46,620
divided into two parts,
before and after she met Mr. Gu.

828
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,178
I must be crazy.

829
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:08,100
I feel

830
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,268
so lovable.

831
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,275
Trudging on…

832
01:18:20,153 --> 01:18:22,864
step by step.

833
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:29,454
There's nothing but love in my heart.

834
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:31,957
So…

835
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,419
I can't feel anything but love.

836
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,418
MY LIBERATION

837
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:45,507
