1
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,026
Mi-jeong texts someone a lot these days.

2
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,652
There's a guy, isn't there?

3
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,530
Did you see what she said
on our chat by mistake yesterday?

4
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,866
"I'm off work now.
I just got on the train."

5
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,868
-I saw it.
-Yes, I saw it.

6
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,787
Who was that for?

7
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,288
Is it that guy?

8
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,249
The guy who ate at your house
and made you uncomfortable.

9
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,250
It's him, isn't it?

10
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:26,961
Yes.

11
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,839
-Really?
-No way.

12
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,633
-No way.
-It was just a wild guess.

13
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,219
Seriously?

14
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,512
What happened?

15
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,977
What do you like about that guy?

16
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,066
Yes, what?

17
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:50,819
I don't know.

18
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,822
That's your answer to everything.

19
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,450
What do you like about him?

20
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,870
What makes him charming?

21
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,664
What attracted you?

22
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,424
It's okay. Take your time.

23
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,884
-Take your time.
-Yes.

24
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,429
He has no shell.

25
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,981
You know, there are people
who are very polite,

26
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,359
but it feels like it's just their shell.

27
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,237
A shell so hard

28
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,824
that it feels like you'll never
be able to reach the person inside.

29
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,994
But this guy

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,288
has no shell.

31
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,714
She called him "this guy."

32
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,007
So?

33
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,302
Can't you see a clear difference?

34
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,930
She called him "this guy"
when he's not here.

35
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,726
It means he's in here.

36
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,477
Gosh.

37
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:16,112
SANPO SINKS

38
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,196
For God's sake.

39
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,156
Damn.

40
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,619
I mean…

41
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,536
CHOI JUN-HO

42
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,163
Seriously.

43
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,873
This is not it. No.

44
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,291
ADD SHADOW
CHANGE COLOR COMBINATION!

45
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,751
Gosh.

46
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,669
SPACING?

47
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,381
For God's sake.

48
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,883
It'll be so nice not to hear that
during my vacation.

49
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,898
Tell your boyfriend about him.

50
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,775
I think I will.

51
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,912
My goodness.

52
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:16,482
I used to never understand
why people took pictures of everything,

53
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,194
but now I want to do it too.

54
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:26,534
This is the food I'm eating right now.
I wonder what you're eating.

55
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,494
Why don't we…

56
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,747
The sky looks beautiful today.

57
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,123
You're right.

58
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,625
Isn't that what you call a vanilla sky?

59
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,630
-It's clearly a vanilla color.
-The things I'm doing.

60
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,050
-The things I'm seeing.
-The clouds look pretty.

61
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,428
-Or was it sky vanilla?
-Why do I want to share them with you?

62
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,598
I know you wouldn't be interested.

63
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,766
It's pretty.

64
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,246
CHO TAE-HUN

65
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,956
CHO TAE-HUN:
I'VE GOT TO RUN NOW. HAVE A GOOD LUNCH.

66
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,916
SURE. YOU TOO.

67
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,052
I LIKE IT

68
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,428
POP

69
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,183
POP

70
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,243
Shoot.

71
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,912
DELETE FOR EVERYONE

72
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,833
He wouldn't have seen it, right?

73
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,338
I'm sorry. I sent that by mistake.

74
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,680
Okay, I got it. Bye.

75
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,230
YEOM GI-JEONG:
DELETED MESSAGE

76
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,815
I'M SORRY. I SENT THAT BY MISTAKE.

77
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,669
I wonder what it was.

78
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,430
Your vacation starts tomorrow.
Do you have any plans?

79
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,271
What?

80
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:02,899
Well…

81
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,527
I might do something wild.

82
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,011
I wonder what it was.

83
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:49,487
I wonder what it was.

84
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,750
I wonder what it was.

85
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,302
I miss you. Let's meet.

86
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,930
Would you like a drink?

87
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,809
No, I don't drink when I eat.

88
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,395
I rarely eat and drink together.

89
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,608
You're truly a master of alcohol.

90
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,532
Can I ask you something?

91
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,996
Do you really do it?

92
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,751
Worship, I mean.

93
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,549
"You are the greatest of all time.
You're incredibly magnificent."

94
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,259
Do you do stuff like this?

95
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,309
Mi-jeong didn't ask him to date her.
She asked him to worship her.

96
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,353
And he said yes, apparently.

97
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,854
You did, right?

98
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,148
"Heil, Hitler.
You're the greatest of all time."

99
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,442
Isn't that what worship is?

100
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,113
Have pity on her.

101
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,116
She said she'd love
just anyone this winter,

102
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,576
but well…

103
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,535
She hasn't…

104
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,130
Call Mi-jeong and ask where she is!

105
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,935
She'll be late. She's still at work.

106
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,853
Gosh.

107
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,065
She'll have to eat alone.

108
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,492
ADD SHADOW
CHANGE COLOR COMBINATION!

109
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,369
SPACING
THICKER LINES, CHANGE FONT

110
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,006
CREDIT LIMIT AND PAYMENT DATE

111
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,924
CREDIT CARD USER GUIDE

112
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,640
THANK YOU FOR JOINING JOY CARD.
WE WILL BE YOUR HAPPY COMPANION.

113
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,314
Gosh. This isn't it.

114
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,988
If I imagine that I'm sitting here
working next to you,

115
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,408
even awful tasks like these
turn into something beautiful.

116
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,036
Work becomes bearable.

117
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,793
I'm playing a role
of a woman who is loved.

118
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,546
A woman who has everything she needs.

119
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,724
Yeom Mi-jeong's imagination comes true.

120
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,583
The way you drink is weird.

121
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,252
You just sit still
as if you're spacing out.

122
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,463
I drink to feel high.

123
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,507
I…

124
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,428
drink to feel calm.

125
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,265
When I drink,

126
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,185
it feels like the puzzle pieces

127
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:43,484
that have been floating around
in my head fall into place.

128
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,530
It also makes me gentle, I think.

129
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,953
What goes around inside your head?

130
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:57,998
Curses.

131
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,128
I curse all day inside.

132
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,007
Curse at who?

133
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,884
I don't know.

134
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,971
There must be a story behind it.

135
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,765
There's no story. I just curse.

136
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,227
I always curse

137
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,939
except when I drink,

138
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,108
when I sleep,

139
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,236
and…

140
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,241
when I talk like this.

141
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,297
Mi-jeong told him to worship her.

142
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,759
She's unbelievable, isn't she?

143
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,515
Does he have a lot of problems?

144
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,352
I have a feeling he does.

145
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,813
I think Mi-jeong did that to save him.

146
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,189
What?

147
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,822
SANPO SINKS

148
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,100
"You're the greatest of all time."

149
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,268
What are you doing?

150
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,521
I think that's Gu.

151
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:27,940
What?

152
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:30,984
Where?

153
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,528
In that truck over there.

154
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,379
Why would he be driving a truck?

155
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,995
That's Mi-jeong.

156
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,749
She never really looked at the camera
when she was little.

157
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,558
Turning the hip is still hard.

158
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,934
-What do you think?
-It looks great.

159
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,186
You think so? Look.

160
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,896
Yes.

161
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,065
It's better to straighten your arms.

162
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,739
-Did they finish reviewing?
-Yes.

163
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,743
Put it on my desk.

164
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,249
A good aesthetic sense?

165
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,002
It's something you're born with.

166
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:13,795
Sense of color?

167
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,340
It's not something you can learn.

168
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,175
I agree.

169
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,600
This is what they chose
after thinking about it for a month?

170
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,521
I wonder why they picked this
out of all the other green ones.

171
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,234
Do you know how it was chosen?

172
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,166
JOY CARD

173
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,049
My instinct tells me

174
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,844
that this is the one.

175
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,434
A bouquet in spring…

176
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,234
After all that time,
it was settled by one person's instinct?

177
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,735
The thing is,

178
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,155
I thought that was the best design
from the beginning.

179
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:28,287
But if I had told them,
would they have listened?

180
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,709
Those who deliver results
are always right.

181
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,461
We haven't delivered any results.

182
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:44,303
Still, I was grateful to her
for saying that.

183
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,766
I thought they were
in a different league from me,

184
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,769
but they just follow their instincts.

185
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,067
I think you're unhappy
because you don't know how good you are.

186
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,911
Be gentle with the door.

187
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,079
Good.

188
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,125
SUMMER VACATION
AUGUST 6 - AUGUST 11

189
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,629
Seriously. How much did you think
we were going to eat on an overnight trip?

190
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,632
We shouldn't have unpacked it.
Don't pack like this next time.

191
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,718
Stop yammering and move them.

192
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,844
I'm so sick of it.

193
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,304
All the packing and unpacking.

194
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,015
Going up and down
from the third floor. Seriously.

195
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,266
Jeez.

196
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,688
Hello?

197
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,441
Yes. I'll go pick it up.

198
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,525
Bye.

199
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,362
I have somewhere to go.

200
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,405
Where?

201
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,411
Where are you going?

202
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,872
Someone's selling Nirvana's second album.

203
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,707
I'll go listen to it before I buy it.

204
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,918
-Where is it?
-Sanpo.

205
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:03,965
That's going to be a long trip.
You've been driving for hours already.

206
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,051
It won't take long.

207
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,638
Jeez, you should just buy it.
Why go through all that trouble?

208
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,516
There are some people
that sell unusable albums.

209
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,810
Boy, you'll be driving all day.

210
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,771
Hey, if it's Sanpo,
you could just ask Gi-jeong.

211
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,065
Hang on.

212
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,613
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

213
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,199
No, it's close from here.
It won't take long.

214
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,368
BUS STOP
SANPO

215
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,012
Here we go.

216
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,903
You made scoring a good album so easy
for me. Thank you so much.

217
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,529
You're welcome.

218
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,323
I'm on vacation right now.

219
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,951
If you could ask Mi-jeong to give it
to me next week, I'd appreciate it.

220
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,120
Sure, I will.

221
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:01,166
Thank you so much.
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

222
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,876
I'll look forward to it.

223
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:14,429
I'm going to Seoul on Saturday.
Would you like me to give it to you then?

224
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,397
If I could have it even one day sooner,
that would be great.

225
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,151
What time should I meet you?

226
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,170
I missed you.

227
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:57,806
MANAGER CHO TAE-HUN:

228
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,933
I'LL GET IT FROM YOUR SISTER MYSELF
THIS SATURDAY

229
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,188
I SEE. OKAY.

230
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,541
GOING WITH THE FIRST DRAFT

231
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,928
Proper posture comes first.

232
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,847
Being accurate over being fast.

233
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,765
Okay. You're doing great.

234
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,310
Being accurate over being fast.
One, two, three, four…

235
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,853
Attention. Bow.

236
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,646
Thank you!

237
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,772
Good work, guys.

238
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,983
Hey, no running! Come on.

239
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,360
Walk! You'll hurt yourselves!

240
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,654
TEACHERS' ROOM

241
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,830
KWAK HUI-SU

242
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,707
Come. Let's talk over dinner.

243
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,013
There's nothing romantic about apartments.

244
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,433
You can't see the house
of the woman you like from a distance.

245
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:16,569
I wish there was a day set by the country
where people confess their love.

246
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,365
For shy guys like me.

247
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:24,869
My dad is shy, but he managed
to get married and have three kids.

248
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,499
-This is good.
-There he goes with the left.

249
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,335
My heart is running ahead,

250
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,504
but there's nothing I can do.

251
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,172
I can't call her.

252
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:40,218
I just keep looking at her profile
picture. I pine and fret all by myself.

253
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:43,221
If you put together all the pent-up energy
from people like me,

254
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,141
it'd be more than enough
to run a nuclear power plant.

255
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:51,187
That's how much energy
I have bottled up inside me.

256
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,899
I mean, it's a big loss for the country.

257
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,943
Hey, think about it. Okay?

258
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,779
Let's say there's a day
and culture like that.

259
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,448
Then no one would have to waste

260
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,616
their energy fretting
over things like this.

261
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,327
How great would it be?
If it was approved by the country.

262
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:11,416
There should also be a day where you
reject someone politely and considerately.

263
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:17,547
"With the country's approval,
I confess my feelings for you."

264
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,591
"I love you."

265
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,218
The country could also tell you
how to reject someone.

266
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,137
"I'm sincerely grateful."

267
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,474
"But I already have someone I love."

268
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:32,020
If I file a petition for this,
I bet many people will support me.

269
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,606
Let me get this straight.

270
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:39,694
You know she'll say no
if you ask her out, but you can't give up.

271
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,572
You want to go for it,
but you don't want to get hurt.

272
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,949
You want the country's help with that?

273
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,788
Everyone confesses their feelings,
gets rejected, and gets hurt.

274
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,081
Don't drag the country into this.

275
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:57,086
Well, they make new policies for
the minority and the weak all the time.

276
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,756
So how come there's no system
that protects the minority

277
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,549
and the weak in the world of dating?

278
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,594
You can't expect the country
to look after your faint heart too.

279
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,305
I'm saying, there should
be a culture like this.

280
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:11,267
"I'm expressing my feelings for you

281
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:15,313
in the politest way possible
allowed by the social system."

282
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,525
In other words, a healthy dating culture.

283
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,903
You're telling people you like them,
not hate them. What's wrong with it?

284
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,280
Let's say it's approved by the country.

285
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,866
If you tell her,
will she reject you or not?

286
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,701
Let your soul answer.

287
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,078
Will she reject you or not?

288
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,997
You can't lose your job.

289
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,875
She's the principal's daughter.
What if it goes wrong?

290
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,504
If I get rejected,
I'll just say I don't remember.

291
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,801
I heard a story about two people
who had accidents while riding bikes.

292
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,679
Neither of them remembers the accident.

293
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:51,057
One of them was crossing a bridge
over the Han River on a bike,

294
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,560
but when he woke up,
he was in the hospital,

295
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,187
wearing a patient's gown.

296
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,147
He was like, "What's going on?"

297
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,400
He must've fallen at some point.

298
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,694
But he doesn't remember it at all.

299
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:05,572
He was riding a bike
and he just blacked out.

300
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:09,784
The other one remembers riding a bike
in the afternoon. Right?

301
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,787
But he woke up in the middle of the night
shivering in the cold

302
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,498
and found himself sprawled out in a bush.

303
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,043
He got a call from his friend,
and he asked,

304
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,962
"Where am I? Why am I lying here?"

305
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,547
The strange thing is,

306
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,800
neither of them remembers what happened.

307
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,764
If I ask her out and get rejected,

308
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,686
come and hit me with your motorcycle.

309
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,689
I'll bust out my acting chops
and pretend to pass out.

310
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,276
What will she do if I say
I don't remember? Have me fired?

311
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,944
You think she'd believe that?

312
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,492
I'll try.

313
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,750
I'll give it a go
and see if it works or not.

314
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,643
Just give me a little push
and I'll fall on my own.

315
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,061
Cut it out!

316
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,315
Is it that hard? It's just a little push.

317
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,816
Don't even think about it.

318
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,110
Who's the poor guy this time? Jeez.

319
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,364
-Just--
-Here we go again!

320
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,200
Aren't you too old for this now? My God.

321
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,791
Hey, you better be there.

322
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,754
It's Saturday at 3 p.m.,
in a coffee shop near Gangnam Station.

323
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,714
I'll text you the address.

324
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,931
Yes.

325
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,017
That's right. The color is spring bouquet.

326
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,104
Yes, I got it.

327
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,190
-By the way, about the brochures.
-Yes.

328
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,984
The first draft looks good,

329
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,028
but why does it always look bad
after the revision?

330
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,406
CHOI JUN-HO

331
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,490
I see.

332
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,575
I'll advise the employees.

333
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,327
All right.

334
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,796
GOING WITH THE FIRST DRAFT

335
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,471
Ms. Yeom.

336
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,434
Yes?

337
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:43,021
You uploaded the brochure
to the cloud storage, right?

338
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,106
Yes.

339
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,151
I'll take it from here.

340
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,486
You worked hard. Go home early today.

341
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,972
SUPERMARKET

342
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,736
What about the booze?

343
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,863
Just these.

344
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,283
Buy them now if you're just going
to come back later.

345
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,318
I was so happy to see you
I almost hugged you.

346
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,872
Mi-jeong is doing a great deed.

347
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,424
I have this crazy friend
who used to live here.

348
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:20,761
She said she wanted to come and meet you,
but I told her not to.

349
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,098
I don't think you'll like each other.

350
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:27,643
Why not?

351
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,528
You always do that
when something is difficult to say.

352
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,032
You hesitate.

353
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,827
You guys are similar.

354
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,370
In what way?

355
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,332
You're both tough.

356
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,962
You're both wild

357
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,089
and transparent.

358
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,930
Transparent?

359
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,098
You're crazy.

360
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,393
You are transparent.

361
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,568
Are you worshiping me right now?

362
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,570
Yes.

363
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,834
ALPHA RETAIL

364
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,554
You applied for
the product development team.

365
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,431
Yes.

366
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,432
Why?

367
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,602
Because you might miss the promotion?

368
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,897
Or are you expanding your career path?

369
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,483
Well, yes.

370
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,864
Do you know eight people
applied for it from our branch alone?

371
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,243
They're hiring 3, but 67 people applied.

372
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,203
Have you ever beaten such odds?

373
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,456
I beat the odds of one in 100 million
when I was conceived.

374
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,087
Anyway, your chance
of getting promoted is one in ten.

375
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,090
So it's much better
to go all-in on the promotion.

376
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,883
Isn't it unreasonable to give up

377
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,219
the odds of one in ten
and go for one in twenty?

378
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,641
When you're driven into a corner,
you can't even do simple math.

379
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:34,895
What are you working on?

380
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,039
God damn it.

381
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:10,473
INCOMING CALL
SLIDE TO ANSWER

382
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,450
1 MISSED CALL

383
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,078
Just answer it.

384
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,006
Sam-sik said he saw you
at a gas station in Gyeonggi.

385
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,132
Is it true?

386
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,677
He said you were driving a truck.
Is it true?

387
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,889
Baek was there too, you idiot.

388
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,902
SANPO
KITCHEN SINKS, CLOSETS

389
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:08,364
You called me straight away.
I guess you really are in Gyeonggi-do.

390
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,909
You've been pretending to be somewhere far
when you were right outside Seoul?

391
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,537
I didn't pretend.

392
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:19,583
Sam-sik is sure it was you.
He'll ransack the area soon.

393
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,170
If Baek finds you, you're screwed.

394
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,090
You should pay him a surprise visit
and hit him from behind.

395
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,509
Let's throw the first punch, man.

396
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,056
Well, look.

397
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,851
I'll do that eventually, but…

398
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:38,769
"But"?

399
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,981
I'm just

400
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,024
too busy right now.

401
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,110
Doing what exactly?

402
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,364
-I have to go.
-Wait, man. Hey--

403
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:16,348
Tomorrow at 3 p.m. I'll be at a cafe
named Troppo near Gangnam Station.

404
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,683
Jeez.

405
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:20,811
LEAVE CHATROOM
CONFIRM

406
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,608
YEOM CHANG-HEE LEFT HAS LEFT THE CHATROOM

407
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,943
YEOM GI-JEONG HAS INVITED YEOM CHANG-HEE

408
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,946
I may not even tell him how I feel.

409
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,741
And if I do and it's not a big deal,
I won't do anything.

410
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,410
Just have my back like insurance.

411
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,996
If I get rejected, it'll be embarrassing
to walk away awkwardly.

412
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,749
I need to fall, tumble, or faint
and create some accident

413
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:42,917
to be less embarrassed!

414
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,336
YEOM CHANG-HEE LEFT HAS LEFT THE CHATROOM

415
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,767
Do you know
who Gi-jeong is meeting tomorrow?

416
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,534
Looking for something?

417
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,829
The minutes of the marketing meeting.

418
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,289
-The minutes?
-Yes.

419
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,917
I have it. Hang on.

420
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,670
Thank you.

421
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,895
You're not in the same department,
and he wouldn't use it against you.

422
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:45,980
So what's the problem?

423
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,402
You do all kinds of stuff
with a man whose name you don't even know.

424
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,362
I can't even tell a guy that I like him?

425
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,074
Don't push me,
or I'll tell him to worship me.

426
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,298
Eat before you go.

427
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,509
Don't starve to look thin.
You'll sweat a lot again.

428
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,899
I listened to this every single day
back in high school.

429
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:35,696
When I listened to their music,
it took me somewhere before I knew it.

430
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,866
I wanted to hold on to that feeling,

431
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,328
so I listened to it over and over again.

432
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,790
Like some kind of addict.

433
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,003
I think I know what you mean.

434
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,839
I've been listening to it
over the last few days.

435
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,549
The first track made me feel

436
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,260
like something was boiling up
from deep down inside.

437
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:02,222
I used to think it was noisy,
so I didn't listen to this kind of music.

438
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,809
But this time,
I felt something surging up within me.

439
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,646
I didn't know what it was,
but I could feel it.

440
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,650
Right? Although you don't know what it is.

441
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,037
Getting to know someone
is an amazing thing.

442
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,831
It's not just that person.

443
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,043
It's like they bring
several universes with them.

444
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:37,049
For example, a universe called Nirvana.

445
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,808
I'm so excited.

446
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,856
I can't wait to go home

447
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:54,817
and listen to it.

448
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:02,908
Hey.

449
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,953
No, I won't be long.

450
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:07,871
Bye.

451
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:21,593
How's it looking?

452
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,850
I have a feeling that he's from Seoul.

453
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:34,231
I hope Gi-jeong won't need us to do this.

454
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:37,651
But she has us here
because she thinks it won't go well.

455
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,529
With this,
your instincts are usually right.

456
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:43,824
That's what
I've been telling you every day.

457
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,617
You get it now that it's about her?

458
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,787
Gosh, humans…

459
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:55,002
I can't do it. I shouldn't have come here.

460
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,130
I can't believe I'm actually here.

461
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,350
What the hell.

462
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,396
Watch for her signal.

463
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,069
Please choose a date and let me know.

464
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,322
Okay.

465
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,240
Get home safely.

466
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,164
Wait.

467
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,874
Yes?

468
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,294
It's nothing.

469
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,674
Wait.

470
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:50,224
I'm sorry. Never mind. Bye.

471
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,353
No, wait.

472
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:01,485
When there's something I want to say,
it's hard for me to hold it back.

473
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:05,030
I'll probably say this sooner or later,
so I'll just do it now.

474
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,283
Would you…

475
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:13,205
want to be in a relationship?

476
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,129
With me, I mean.

477
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:29,263
If that's too much pressure,
we could just date casually.

478
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:43,443
You're not messing with me, are you?

479
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,408
Is this question that unexpected for you?

480
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,661
I thought you knew on some level.

481
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,331
Well…

482
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,002
You didn't know?

483
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,171
But I've been smiling like this.

484
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,424
I've always been smiling.

485
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,598
Gosh, I'm sorry.

486
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,852
I'm really sorry. I…

487
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:18,604
So that's why…

488
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,981
Well…

489
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,316
You had no idea.

490
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,986
Sorry to fluster you like this.

491
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,070
I mean…

492
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,198
It's okay.

493
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:33,827
I thought you'd probably say no,
but I just wanted to ask.

494
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,580
It's fine, really.

495
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,167
Take care then. Bye.

496
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,316
That's the signal.

497
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,602
I thought you'd probably say no,
but I just wanted to ask.

498
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,730
I'm really sorry. I…

499
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,429
You need to pass out! Do it now!

500
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:58,972
He's coming. Hey, he's coming.

501
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,141
He's coming. Hurry…

502
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,852
Are you all right?

503
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:08,690
I'm okay.

504
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,526
Where…

505
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,112
Are you okay? Let me see.
Is it your wrist?

506
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,530
Are you… Let me see.

507
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:21,912
Gi-jeong!

508
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:22,829
Hey, you idiot.

509
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,517
It hurts.

510
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,772
It hurts.

511
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,024
No, don't touch me. It hurts.

512
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,538
I said, don't!

513
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,122
Where did you fall?

514
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,542
On the street! Where else?

515
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,170
It hurts.

516
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,506
Why are you crying?

517
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,759
Because it hurts!

518
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,803
Goodness.

519
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,638
My God.

520
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,592
Damn it.

521
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:01,636
Gosh.

522
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,613
Is there fried shrimp too?

523
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,490
-Who picked this up?
-I did.

524
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,325
-You're the best.
-Is this all?

525
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:08,078
Come on, Hyeon-a
came all the way here. Jeez.

526
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,413
I'm making a fire to cook more food.

527
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,626
-It's raining.
-Damn.

528
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:15,669
Shoot.

529
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,213
-Jeez.
-Come on, hurry.

530
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,547
What the hell?

531
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,842
-Hurry.
-You want to cover this?

532
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:23,885
Yes, cover it.

533
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,304
It's just a shower. It'll stop soon.

534
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,517
-Cover it. Hey, it's pouring.
-Come on now.

535
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,602
It's pouring down.

536
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,688
Damn.

537
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,939
It's out of the blue.

538
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,316
Gosh.

539
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,863
How's Gi-jeong? Is her injury bad?

540
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,410
Well, she didn't break her bone.
It's just a crack.

541
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,577
Which hand?

542
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:51,705
Her left hand.

543
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,666
That's a relief.

544
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,085
You guys should've rehearsed it.

545
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,796
Hey, I just gave her a little push.

546
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:02,632
How could I have known
her bag strap would get caught?

547
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:06,011
I thought,
"Chang-hee must really love her."

548
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,430
"He's determined to make her pass out."

549
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:11,766
Gi-jeong has always been super dramatic.

550
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,101
Ever since she was little.

551
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:16,021
When we got into a fight
and I hit her even just a little…

552
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,064
She acted like she was dying.

553
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,233
That's why I wasn't worried
about her acting.

554
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:23,737
She said if I give her a little push,
she'd fall on her own.

555
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,988
I thought she would.

556
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,744
Amnesia, my ass. If you're embarrassed,
just be embarrassed.

557
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,663
Life is a series of embarrassments anyway.

558
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,999
It's embarrassing
from the moment you're born.

559
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,292
You're born naked.

560
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:40,503
You're right.

561
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:42,881
It stopped.

562
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,133
-Already?
-Yes, it won't rain anymore.

563
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:49,471
Where's Mi-jeong?

564
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,308
She's out with her boyfriend.
I wanted to see his face.

565
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:54,851
He's handsome.

566
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,228
That's not what I meant.

567
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,689
She doesn't even know his name, right?

568
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,358
I know men pretty well.

569
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,820
Once I see him, I'll know what kind
of life he's had since childhood.

570
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,323
That's scary.

571
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:12,327
How many men do you have to date
to reach that level?

572
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,580
All men are the same breed.

573
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:19,250
You have a relationship with one
and you know all there is to know.

574
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,836
-We're all the same breed?
-Turns out, yes.

575
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:24,923
Hey.

576
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,300
He and I are the same breed?

577
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,220
You're all the same breed.

578
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:33,264
I know you want to believe
that you're not, but you are.

579
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,351
Sense of inferiority and superiority,
self-love, and self-hatred.

580
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:39,145
You all have these things,
it's just the percentage that differs.

581
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,063
You all have them.

582
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,565
Every guy I've ever dated had them.

583
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:49,864
Here comes Gi-jeong.

584
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,161
Gosh, I admire you.

585
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,580
I mean, you're so cool.

586
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,108
What are you doing here?

587
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,029
I came to see Mi-jeong's boyfriend,
but they ran off.

588
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,824
You're not here to see me?

589
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,162
That too.

590
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,670
I'm sorry that I'm doing better
than you expected.

591
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,797
Well, let's just say that you're fine.

592
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,467
Getting rejected by a guy
and getting a cast isn't so bad.

593
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:57,599
What happened? You said you'd
pass out and pretend not to remember.

594
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,520
Jeez, not anyone can act.

595
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:05,315
I was sitting on the ground,
so how could I pass out, you jerk?

596
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,861
It turned out
I still have my quick reflexes.

597
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,738
At that moment,

598
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,449
I thought I might get hurt,
so I planted my hand down.

599
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,242
My hand moved before I realized it.

600
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,246
Why do I have such good reflexes? Damn it.

601
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:28,796
It was a perfect landing,
so how could I pass out, you idiot?

602
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,425
Jeez!

603
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,720
I'm an idiot for going there
in the first place.

604
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,975
I don't think there's anything
I can't do now.

605
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,686
I'm still growing even at this age.

606
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:49,400
I'm conquering yet another fear this way.

607
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:51,528
It's no big deal.

608
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,242
I can get over this!

609
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,576
You can get over this!

610
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,289
It's all your fault, you fool.

611
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,294
Come on! Help me with this!

612
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,337
-The fire!
-The fire.

613
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,839
Come on.

614
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,049
Do I have to help?

615
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,092
Come!

616
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:30,692
I'm relieved that you seem better
than I thought.

617
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,911
For a while, I couldn't sleep

618
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,706
and had a lot on my mind.

619
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:49,210
That's over, and I feel relieved now.

620
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:54,924
I feel better.

621
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,135
I should've done this sooner.

622
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,146
It's a rainbow.

623
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,276
It's a rainbow!

624
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,885
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU
THAT DESPITE YOUR POTENTIAL,

625
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:42,096
WE CAN NOT OFFER YOU A POSITION
ON THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM

626
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:48,728
Yeom Chang-hee, let's get promoted!

627
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,322
Hey, Yu-rim! Cho Yu-rim!

628
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:17,090
Why do I want to take a picture again?

629
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:58,715
Sometimes, I have this thought.

630
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,009
When you were three,

631
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,220
seven,

632
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,223
and 19 years old…

633
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:11,018
I wish I could go back in time

634
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,856
and sit quietly next to your younger self.

635
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,073
You're doing that now.

636
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,956
When I'm 90 years old,

637
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,754
this will be my younger self.

638
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,102
Why are you coming from Gu's house?

639
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,521
We're dating.

640
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:38,272
Who says something like that while eating?

641
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,400
But you seem better than I thought.

642
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,360
You're amazing.

643
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,906
I've looked back on it.
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

644
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,408
I will make her change no matter what.

645
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,785
I'll give my all.

646
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:52,245
Why are you following me around?

647
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,913
Hey, stop! Pull over.

648
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,125
It's really you. What are you doing here?

649
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,168
But someone died.

650
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:02,922
I think he got wind of it.

651
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,591
Say what you want to say.

652
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,344
I'll stop if you tell me to.

653
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:16,227
