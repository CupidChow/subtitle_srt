1
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:43,895
Wait here.

2
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,647
I'll go.

3
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,885
I'm getting goosebumps.
Why am I getting goosebumps?

4
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,305
Gu, you're not some regular guy, are you?

5
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,433
You used to be a national athlete, right?

6
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,435
I mean, Gu…

7
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,940
Why is someone like you
picking peppers in the countryside?

8
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,605
Go wash up.

9
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,179
Wash up and come eat.

10
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,876
Why are you wearing a hat
when we're eating?

11
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,338
They said I should avoid the sun.

12
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,675
Good going, wasting
your money just to get uglier.

13
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,699
Gosh.

14
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,578
Are there this many track and field
athletes with the last name "Gu?"

15
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,540
Can you just tell me your name?

16
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,836
Gu Jin-seok?

17
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,047
Gu Ja-yoon?

18
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:09,178
Just wait and see. Your name
must be in here, I'm telling you.

19
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,139
Gu Ja-gyeong!

20
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,141
Will you just eat?

21
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,767
Fine.

22
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,231
Gu Chang-mo?

23
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,277
Gu Chang-mo?

24
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,822
I can't believe I know Gu Chang-mo.

25
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,324
No, that can't be.

26
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,827
Even if I know, I should pretend I don't.

27
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,412
I don't know anything.

28
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,747
Gu Yoon-hoe?

29
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,510
Gu Bon-gyeong?

30
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,016
You're really perfect
for track and field, Gu.

31
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:59,979
You know, those who challenge
their limits all on their own usually have

32
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,439
a solitary side, right?

33
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,901
What's your specialty? The 800m?

34
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,615
Just let me rest.

35
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,576
All right.

36
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,038
I have nothing to say, okay?

37
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,749
And nothing I want to hear.

38
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,710
Okay.

39
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,979
Where are you going?

40
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,481
To your house.

41
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,412
Thank you
for thinking of us too. I feel bad.

42
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,539
How was the party?

43
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,332
Good, everyone ate and left.

44
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,292
Your mom will be cleaning up for a while.

45
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,670
We all helped before we left.

46
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,297
I'm sure
there's still a lot of work left to do.

47
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,679
Come on. Be careful.

48
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,306
Why does it have to be here?
It'll be noisy.

49
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,601
How can we drink in the yard?
Your dad's there.

50
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,727
My God!

51
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,981
What's with your face?

52
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,649
It's under construction.

53
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,460
Gi-jeong, come join us!

54
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,299
I can't drink if I want
these bruises to go away!

55
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,384
What did she do to her eyes?

56
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,969
I have no idea.

57
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,679
What about her eyes?

58
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,516
Why didn't you bring a table or something?

59
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,976
Just eat, dumbass.

60
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,060
My back hurts!

61
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,411
He suddenly started running,

62
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,956
and from that moment,
it was awesome. I could just feel it.

63
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,208
"He'll make the jump"

64
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,668
And he did.

65
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,421
Like paper flying through the air.

66
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,256
Anyone can do that if they train.

67
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,341
You think you can?

68
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,759
I can.

69
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,636
Bullshit.

70
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,429
Care to bet? How much?

71
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,348
If you do it within a week, 500,000 won.

72
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,516
A week isn't enough.

73
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,101
Then within a month.

74
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,854
You won't make it, moron.

75
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,857
It was scorching today.
My scalp felt as if it was melting.

76
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,027
"So this is how I kick
the bucket, picking peppers."

77
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,489
"Peppers, me, and the sun…"
My mind was all over the place.

78
00:10:56,572 --> 00:11:00,117
But seeing Gu jump
like that really blew my mind.

79
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,957
It's a skill I would've shown off
right away, but he hid it for a year.

80
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:12,421
Someone who knows how to hide
how cool he is, is a genuinely cool guy.

81
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:17,635
I knew Gu was special.

82
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,678
I could tell by his face.

83
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,517
How could you tell that by just his face?

84
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,976
I just can tell.

85
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,272
A face like yours or mine says,

86
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,235
"Yes, I'm nothing special.
What you see is what you get."

87
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,528
You little…

88
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,322
We're much better off.

89
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,826
Those who seem special but are not,

90
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,911
they're way more disappointing.

91
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,915
We're not like that. We're just
a little disappointing at first sight.

92
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,335
Take him for example.

93
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,130
Whenever he sees a girl
he doesn't know at a school reunion,

94
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,756
he goes quiet and acts cool.

95
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,092
But oddly enough, when he does that,

96
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,261
it somehow actually looks cool.

97
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,556
So some girls are attracted to him
and go on a few dates with him.

98
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,934
Then they won't even go near him.
They all just avoid him.

99
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,727
Hey, that's not true.

100
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,312
It is true, dumbass.

101
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,815
That habit's like a disease, man.

102
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,067
When you first meet someone,

103
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,487
you should act like you're nothing special
to keep their expectations low

104
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,573
and show them your good points later on.

105
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:24,034
Then you should say,
"What? You noticed that?"

106
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:28,080
"You're right. I can see that's my charm.
I had no idea."

107
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,374
But you're all about bluffing.

108
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,418
Then what am I supposed to do?

109
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,295
Act like you're nothing special!

110
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,796
I really am nothing special!

111
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,134
Nothing about me is special!

112
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,846
Look carefully. There must be something.

113
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,184
Ask a woman to find it for you.
They'll do all the work.

114
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,730
Mi-jeong! Are you on a diet?

115
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,690
Yes!

116
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,401
All right, do your best!

117
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,820
I hope you'll get prettier.

118
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,084
Do we not have a new one?

119
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,587
No, I've been meaning to buy one.

120
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,217
I'll go pick one up.

121
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,136
This late at night?
We'll just get it tomorrow.

122
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,112
Why am I feeling sad?

123
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,158
Why am I sad?

124
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,088
He always holds back.

125
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,341
He takes a step forward but then stops.

126
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,679
I'm just going to
keep wanting until the day I die.

127
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,722
Mi-jeong.

128
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,434
Don't ask for love like me.

129
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,443
I'm a great person.

130
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,947
I won't ask to be loved.

131
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,909
I'm a great person.

132
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,121
I won't ask to be loved.

133
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,714
I asked him what he stares at
every day in the yard.

134
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,632
He said mountains.

135
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,471
He said if you piled up 7,7 billion 1-won
coins, it'd be as big as that mountain.

136
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,019
Why 7,7 billion coins?

137
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,313
Don't you get it?

138
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,735
I got what he was saying right away.

139
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,820
It's 7,7 billion.

140
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,282
What about 7,7 billion?

141
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,285
The world's population, moron.

142
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:15,748
Let's say I'm a 1-won coin. Then
7,7 billion coins are about 5,000 tons.

143
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,082
As heavy as that mountain.

144
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,168
If you convert the whole thing into coins,

145
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,961
everything becomes much clearer.

146
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,713
Me and the world's population.

147
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,132
So?

148
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,426
Jeez.

149
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,430
I'm trying my best to live.

150
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:36,018
But would you even be able to find me,
just a coin, in that mountain of coins?

151
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,273
Are they sorted by country?

152
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,859
Hey, just forget it. Just stop.

153
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,446
Why wouldn't we be able to find you?
We're not piled up like a mountain.

154
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,489
That's not it, idiot!

155
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,282
Enough about Mr. Gu!

156
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,743
It's just something some alcoholic said.

157
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,412
It must have been
one hell of a long jump. Damn it.

158
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,583
Damn it.

159
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,171
How dull my life must be…

160
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,466
It's not like I saw Yuna Kim jump.

161
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,927
It was just some guy,
but I'm excited all day.

162
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:15,724
I've never felt real joy,
pleasure, or excitement in my life.

163
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,062
Except during the 2002 World Cup.
And then it was over.

164
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,693
That's why I'm going on
and on about it like this.

165
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,821
As I go on about it this way,

166
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,491
it somehow makes me feel
something similar to joy, you know?

167
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,703
Goodness. Take this.

168
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,330
Here.

169
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,838
You guys may have gotten older,

170
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,049
but it's just like when you used to
play house here as kids.

171
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,843
Your bodies got bigger,

172
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,804
but you're still the kids
who used to put grass on bottle lids

173
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,389
and serve it up saying, "Enjoy."

174
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,516
When the time is right,

175
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,437
you're supposed to meet your life partner,
get married, have kids,

176
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,188
and watch them grow up.

177
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,316
How come so many kids these days

178
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,528
refuse to do that
and just grow old all alone?

179
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,115
Shouldn't something have changed
since back when you used to play house?

180
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,491
My goodness.

181
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,286
You must be sick of it, too, right?

182
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,746
Even I can tell.

183
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,170
Try having a kid.
You'll feel full without eating.

184
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,548
Every day will be amazing.
You'll be invincible.

185
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,259
No one can beat you.
No one can beat parents.

186
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,680
But you don't know anything about that.
Goodness gracious.

187
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,682
Mother.

188
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,019
After you had us,

189
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:47,024
you enjoyed two or three short years
of joy and delight,

190
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,194
then your life got miserable.

191
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,280
Do you really want to pass
that kind of life onto us?

192
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,198
You little…

193
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,451
And if we want we want
to feel joyful at all times,

194
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:02,122
should we keep having kids
until we're 80? Until we die?

195
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,920
It's hot. Why do you close the window?
You don't even turn on the AC.

196
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,842
What do I do? It's so delicious.

197
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,930
I was full, but this is so good.

198
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,604
Goodness. All he knows
is how to run his mouth.

199
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,005
You may have gotten bigger and taller,

200
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,841
but it's still you.

201
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,300
Right?

202
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,222
I don't expect anything from you.

203
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,266
I'm just happy when you smile.

204
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,854
And when you cry, I wonder what happened.

205
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,525
Quit pigging out, asshole!
Your stomach's going to pop.

206
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,569
-Are you jealous of this?
-Shut up.

207
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:22,119
Just his size has changed.

208
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,040
SUPERMARKET

209
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,980
I'm a great person.
I won't ask to be loved.

210
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,484
I'm a great person.
I won't ask to be loved.

211
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,345
I bought some soju.

212
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,153
Take this.

213
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,533
How much was it?

214
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:45,827
It's fine.

215
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,914
Do you even have money?

216
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,710
Enough for that.

217
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,552
Are you sure?

218
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,896
That you and I

219
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,483
will have become
different people when spring comes?

220
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,326
You said I would if I worshipped you.

221
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,677
You've never tried it, right?

222
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:50,100
In my experience, you change once
you do something you've never done before.

223
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,616
Have you decided to do it?

224
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,121
I already started.

225
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,165
Earlier today.

226
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,988
Don't give me that.
Do you know how sad it makes me?

227
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:45,989
I know, dumbass.

228
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,575
-Hey.
-I have the most hair around here.

229
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,912
Keep it down! Call it a night already!
Don't you have work tomorrow?

230
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,499
ALPHA RETAIL

231
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,670
I guess she's really upset.

232
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,799
Did I tell you?

233
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:07,511
That my niece passed
the Grade Seven Public Service Exam?

234
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,553
Yes.

235
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,974
So I took her to the mall
to buy her a set of clothes,

236
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,977
but the sales clerk asked
if we were friends!

237
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,482
She's 27 years old.

238
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,693
I felt so bad for her.

239
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,946
But she's still sore about it.

240
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,950
Take a look. This is me and my niece.

241
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,536
Do we really look like friends?

242
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,663
Yes. You really do.

243
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,164
Really?

244
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,543
Did I tell you already?

245
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,754
Two years ago,
I went to a bar with a hat on,

246
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,714
and they asked me for my ID.

247
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,466
I was with all my friends too.

248
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,635
-Help, please call me.
-I was the only one they asked.

249
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,679
My friends were so mad…

250
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,721
Yes, sir.

251
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,266
-I wasn't going to tell you this--
-How can I help you?

252
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,018
Yes, I was just wondering
about the work dinner.

253
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,353
Yes, indeed.

254
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,188
That's right, yes, that's today.

255
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,940
Then I'll see you this evening.

256
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,483
Yes, goodbye.

257
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,401
Goodbye.

258
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,789
Cho Gyeong-seon?

259
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,166
Yes, Cho Gyeong-seon.

260
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:23,336
I've never seen people whispering
while drinking at a barbecue place.

261
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:28,091
Yes, it was Cho Gyeong-seon.
But how come none of us recognized her?

262
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,386
I didn't recognize her, either.
Then I saw her name tag.

263
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,972
I realized only after
reading the name tag.

264
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,349
But that man.

265
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,685
-He works at Mi-jeong's company, right?
-Yes.

266
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,313
-Then was he her little brother?
-Yes.

267
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,024
My gosh. That poor thing.

268
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,484
Oh, no. He even has a kid.

269
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,236
I know, right?

270
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:52,240
Cho Gyeong-seon as a sister-in-law.
Isn't it obvious why they got divorced?

271
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,202
Hey, keep it down.
You'll get in trouble again.

272
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,081
Apparently, he and his two sisters
all live together with his kid.

273
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,791
-The three of them?
-Yes.

274
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,294
-Gyeong-seon hasn't gotten married?
-Of course not.

275
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,213
Her sister hasn't either.

276
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,758
Oh, my God. That guy has it so tough.

277
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,760
You know what she's like.

278
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,680
Remember when she turned
the teachers' room upside down?

279
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,640
What?

280
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,142
-You haven't heard that story?
-No.

281
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,270
She went to get her official
school records to apply for jobs.

282
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:26,316
Apparently, her second-year homeroom
teacher wrote just two words on it.

283
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,943
"Poor behavior."

284
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,028
Unbelievable.

285
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,947
Wait, who was the teacher?

286
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,823
German, Class 2-8.

287
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,575
Oh, God, German.

288
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,244
She turned the place upside down,

289
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:40,747
saying he was stopping her
from getting a job and ruining her future.

290
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,540
Even the police came.

291
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,210
She wasn't exactly a model student.

292
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:50,006
The teacher kept giving her a hard time
since she'd transferred from Seoul.

293
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,469
In the end, he totally
screwed up her life with two words.

294
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,889
Eun-woo went to
Cheongryang Night School, right?

295
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,516
-Yes.
-She saw her on campus.

296
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,603
And she thought, "What's she doing here?
Didn't she hate studying?"

297
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,230
And it turned out

298
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,275
Gyeong-seon couldn't get a job
with "Poor behavior."

299
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,402
She needed a college diploma.

300
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,489
She said she went to college
thanks to that teacher.

301
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:18,994
That's crazy.

302
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,747
You can't really see the bruises.

303
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,499
I put on a ton of concealer.

304
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,961
Gyeong-seon's sister's bar
is just over there past that alley.

305
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:28,962
Do you want to go?

306
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,881
We weren't even that close.
I am curious, though.

307
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:33,967
One beer before we go home?

308
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:39,806
If Gyeong-seon hears about
what you said back, you're screwed.

309
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:40,932
She'll pull out your hair.

310
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,018
I doubt he'll tell her.

311
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,311
His kid will.

312
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,605
Don't go. It's better not to get
involved with her.

313
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,528
And the treatment wasn't that cheap.
You paid as much as you should.

314
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,412
How did the lottery tickets I gave
your brother the other day turn out?

315
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,997
What lottery tickets?

316
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,791
Your brother didn't let me
pay for the food,

317
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,501
so I gave him some lottery tickets.

318
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,837
I got them from someone too.

319
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,339
Did he win any money?

320
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,674
Hold on, let me ask.

321
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,052
Why isn't she texting me back?

322
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,068
Gift card number.

323
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,320
Where's the number?

324
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,863
ILHAENG GIFT CERTIFICATE

325
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,952
So that's where you scratch off.

326
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,871
There it is.

327
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,960
Five, three,

328
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,546
two, one, six.

329
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,800
You're so fast.

330
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,552
There. Click there.

331
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,430
Don't act like you know.

332
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,521
Watch and learn.

333
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:13,358
Soon, you and I won't even
know how to turn on the TV.

334
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,151
I'm home.

335
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,530
You're late. Have you eaten?

336
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,781
Yes. I ate.

337
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,492
What are you doing?

338
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:27,205
Hold on. I had something to ask you.

339
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,042
What was it?

340
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,670
I forgot. What was it?

341
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,965
Whatever.

342
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,342
Right!

343
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,760
Hey, Cho Tae-hun!

344
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,396
Hey. He says none of them were winners.

345
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,199
Not even one?
He didn't even win 5,000 won?

346
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,247
No.

347
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,629
"No"? Is that it?

348
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,854
GONDAL-RO ENTRANCE

349
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,171
Hey.

350
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,464
Did you just get back?

351
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,715
Don't make me talk.

352
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,759
I have to keep my momentum.

353
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,886
If I stop, I won't make it.

354
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,139
I think I get why old people jaywalk.

355
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,266
Once you stop, you can't move.

356
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,352
You have to keep going.

357
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:20,068
With all the strength
you have left after work,

358
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,530
you always drink
and take the last train home!

359
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,114
I respect you, Gi-jeong!

360
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,534
You got this! Keep going all the way home!

361
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,493
I got this.

362
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,370
I can do it.

363
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,685
If I die,

364
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:58,022
it will be because of
commuting to Seoul for work.

365
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,067
Aren't you going to wash?

366
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:18,960
I wish there was a machine to wash you.

367
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,519
Are you a man or a woman?

368
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,530
There are only two ways to make money now.

369
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,533
Cryptocurrency, or becoming a YouTuber.

370
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,411
What else is there?

371
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:57,040
Nothing. And who here has what it takes
to be a YouTuber? No one.

372
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,751
So cryptocurrency is the only way.

373
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,004
I've heard a lot of people made
a fortune investing in cryptocurrency,

374
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,714
but never actually seen one.

375
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,383
Shall I show you?
I know tons of people who have.

376
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,552
Either way, stocks are best.

377
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,222
Your L Electronics stock
must have skyrocketed these days.

378
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:17,393
-I sold that ages ago, man.
-See? Crypto is better.

379
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,270
Just try putting in ten million won.

380
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,897
I don't have that kind of money.

381
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,525
Is your mom
still confiscating your salary?

382
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,697
Even banks let you off if it's been
five years since you messed up.

383
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,074
Your mom…

384
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,787
Does your mom invest it or something?
What does she do with your salary?

385
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,080
She saves it, I guess.

386
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,625
Hey, go right now and tell her,

387
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:44,754
"Mom, housing prices
are the lowest right now."

388
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,173
"I must buy a house immediately."

389
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,801
"Even if I have to take out a loan,
I must buy a house."

390
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,552
"Mom, saving it is…"

391
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,721
Chang-hee, you…

392
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,640
Do you think I don't know that?

393
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,475
Don't order me around.

394
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:02,355
She yelled at me to take the table away,
saying her sales were dropping.

395
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,650
I almost thought
I was from a rival company.

396
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,443
We work for the same company!

397
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,029
She only cares about her own stuff.
She's so greedy.

398
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,030
Chang-hee…

399
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:12,949
sits next to Jeong A-reum.

400
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,703
For two years.

401
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,999
Hey, Yeom Chang-hee
doesn't have to pay today.

402
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,668
-Not for the rest of his life.
-That's right.

403
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,963
Being next to her must be tough.

404
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,468
Whenever A-reum opens her mouth,
it makes me feel so suffocated.

405
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,263
I can't even stand
the sight of her circle contacts now.

406
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,308
Her eyes are soulless.
It's suffocating to be looking at her.

407
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,104
My blood pressure's going up
thinking about it.

408
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,858
I only see her once or twice a week,

409
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,736
but it feels like
she's ruining my entire life.

410
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:54,949
A-reum just talks so much
that it bores people to tears.

411
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,329
I know.

412
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,291
I talk a lot too.

413
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,628
Well…

414
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,298
I find it fun to hear you talk.

415
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,388
You've fallen for me.

416
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,936
Every time I hear your voice,
my ears prick up.

417
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,355
"Yeom Chang-hee's talking!"

418
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,781
You really have fallen for me.

419
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,958
Why are you suddenly quiet?

420
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,043
I don't know.

421
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,920
-Say something.
-I'm embarrassed.

422
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,089
-Good night.
-See you!

423
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,507
Bye, get home safe!

424
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,758
-Call me!
-Yes, sure.

425
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,134
-Don't drink too much.
-Okay.

426
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,385
I'll call you! Bye.

427
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,970
-Where?
-Yeom Chang-hee!

428
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,599
You're with us, pal.

429
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,893
-Why are you going this way?
-Am I?

430
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,061
Am I?

431
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,479
-Something's up.
-How suspicious.

432
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,396
Bye.

433
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,316
-How fishy. Something's up with them!
-What are those eyes?

434
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,734
Where do you think you're going?

435
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,528
We were all going for a second round.

436
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,116
-What's this?
-What's going on?

437
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,034
-What's going on here?
-My gosh.

438
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,828
-What the…
-What?

439
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,248
-When did that start?
-Look at him smile.

440
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,457
Let's go.

441
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,299
DRINKING COFFEE LIKE IT'S WATER

442
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,885
EITHER BE SUPER HOT OR NOT AT ALL!

I don't mean to be fussy about it.

447
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:29,353
But you know,
I also have to report to someone.

448
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,105
There must be some kind of document

449
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,399
to show what it is you do
at the Liberation Club.

450
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,363
Do you have anything?

451
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,908
Like, "this is what we do?"

452
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,536
Anything?

453
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,380
Then how about keeping
a journal of your activities?

454
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,352
Do we need to have our diaries
checked at our age?

455
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,067
Why is this making me so mad?

456
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,280
I must be the problem.

457
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,995
My father passed away when I was young.

458
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,832
Weirdly, it was my dad's handwriting

459
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,753
that reminded me of him the most.

460
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:41,592
I didn't feel much
when I saw his clothes or photos of him,

461
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,680
but his handwriting
weirdly really reminded me of him.

462
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:52,270
He wasn't one to use a pen a lot,
so he just had the one address book.

463
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,148
I looked at it every day.

464
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,530
And this was written in the book.

465
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,535
"What does a man live for?"

466
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,338
I'd never thought
he would ponder things like that.

467
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,317
The weather's so hot.

468
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,934
SOJU

469
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,164
Why don't you just buy four bottles?

470
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,624
Then you won't
have to come back later. It's hot.

471
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,151
Did you have dinner?

472
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,154
I didn't feel like it.

473
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:15,908
What are you doing later?

474
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,417
What can I do
with your whole family around?

475
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,660
Goodness.

476
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,288
Shouldn't you just get me a new one?

477
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,874
You scrape it off, and then it comes back.

478
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,375
It's no use.

479
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,004
That's just what happens to freezers
that are kept outside in the summer.

480
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:55,257
This is hard work.
I could have done it myself.

481
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,932
Chang-hee!

482
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,645
-Why won't you check your messages?
-What messages?

483
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,357
The group chat! Are you ignoring it?

484
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,788
Seeing how she keeps
sending messages in the group chat,

485
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:29,291
I think she's waiting for you to reply.
Why aren't you responding?

486
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,839
Given the mood that night, it seemed like
you'd text her right away to ask her out.

487
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:36,757
Why didn't you?

488
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,886
Haven't you gotten over Ye-rim yet?

489
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,931
There's nothing to get over.

490
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:46,725
Then what?

491
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:54,108
Isn't Da-yeon on par with Ye-rin?

492
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,568
Sure.

493
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,446
Then why aren't you calling her?

494
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,575
The fact that she's on par
with Ye-rin means

495
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:09,873
that she's the kind of woman
who wants a kid.

496
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:15,754
And I think the kind of woman
I'm drawn to deserves that kind of life.

497
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,384
But the problem is, I'm not
a man who can offer that to her.

498
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,974
So that's my dilemma.

499
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:33,147
And because I keep dating girls
without resolving this dilemma,

500
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,898
I keep breaking up with them.

501
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,527
Would it be any different with Da-yeon?

502
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:42,906
What she wants is obvious,
and I know I can't give it to her.

503
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,035
You can just date her for now.

504
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,538
Do you think she just wants to date?

505
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,874
She's not getting any younger either.

506
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,601
Yes.

507
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:14,688
Yes.

508
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,691
Of course. Yes, I know.

509
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,571
Yes.

510
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,489
I see.

511
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,415
Yes.

512
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,918
Yes, goodbye.

513
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,379
Don't mention it. Yes. Bye.

514
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,843
CALL ENDED
BYEON SANG-MI

515
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,489
Why aren't you asleep?

516
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,911
I'm hungry,
but there's nothing I want to eat.

517
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,375
Then it's not food you want.

518
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,578
He wouldn't let me pay for the food.

519
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:02,040
I said I'd pay for it all,
but he insisted on leaving it out.

520
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,668
Store owners don't actually
mean it when they say that.

521
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,587
If I insist,
they let me pay for all of it in the end.

522
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,714
But he didn't do that.

523
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,259
"Yes, this guy's pretty great."

524
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,553
So I gave him all ten tickets.

525
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,722
Plus, I made a mistake the other day.

526
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:19,891
I'm sorry
for giving the tickets to someone else.

527
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:24,396
You look much softer
when you're talking about him.

528
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,735
No, I can't. He even has a kid.

529
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,988
So what?
It's not like you're going to marry him.

530
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,531
"Anyone this winter."

531
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,992
He works at the same company as my sister,

532
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,369
so if it goes badly,
it'll be awkward for her too.

533
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:43,373
And he's my friend's younger brother,
and she's really something.

534
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:48,086
But despite all that,
you already fell for him.

535
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:56,928
As soon as someone catches my eye,
I fall in love with them.

536
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,722
I don't go through the stages.

537
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,433
Other people take an interest
and slowly grow to care

538
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:05,228
for the other person
before they really fall in love with them.

539
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,565
With me, it just happens right away.

540
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:13,403
From the very beginning,
I immediately fall madly in love.

541
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,031
How did this happen? What did he do?

542
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:20,494
It's so embarrassing
that I can't even talk to anyone about it.

543
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,954
I understand.

544
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,291
I'm also a little like that.

545
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,881
The strange thing is,
I didn't feel tired for a few days after.

546
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:37,010
Because I was thinking of him,
I barely felt tired.

547
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:40,222
That's why I love.

548
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,098
You can't feel tired if you're in love.

549
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,061
But all ten tickets I gave him
were losers,

550
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,522
so I had no other reason to contact him.

551
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,149
I started feeling tired
right after I found out.

552
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:54,986
The back of my neck got stiff,
and I got all grumpy again.

553
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,155
I'm sorry.

554
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,991
How could you have such bad luck?

555
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,453
What do I do then?

556
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,455
Shall I buy you more?

557
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:10,126
For me to give them to him?
Just keep getting him lottery tickets?

558
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,851
What's wrong with me?

559
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:29,187
Why can I not stop thinking about him?

560
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,192
I must be crazy.

561
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,448
STORE-OWNER BYEON SANG-MI

562
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,579
Welcome.

563
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,681
What can I get you?

564
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,601
I'm Yeom Chang-hee's girlfriend.

565
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,438
Ex-girlfriend, that is.

566
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:20,155
I really want to get back with Chang-hee…

567
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:26,202
But every day he spends an hour
sitting out on the street on his own.

568
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:30,665
While we watch a movie,
he goes out to take a call,

569
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,084
and I end up watching it alone.

570
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:39,382
I want to smash his phone.
It's just too hard for me.

571
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,218
I'm so sorry. I really am.

572
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,262
How can I make it up to you?

573
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,890
What do I do?

574
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:51,311
Take him back, okay?

575
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:56,524
When I heard that you broke up
because of me, I felt absolutely terrible.

576
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,109
I'm sorry.

577
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,404
Take him back, all right?

578
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,448
I promise

579
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,243
that I will restrain myself from now on.

580
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,788
But that will still be
30 minutes on the phone.

581
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,168
I'll keep it under ten.

582
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,882
My ex-husband used to run this store.

583
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,759
But that asshole cheated on me.

584
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:28,723
He used to stand here with her
pretending to be a married couple.

585
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:33,395
I got this convenience store as part of
the alimony when we got divorced,

586
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:39,150
but the only person who knows
both of them is Mr. Yeom.

587
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,612
I want to bad-mouth them.

588
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:47,826
I want to bad-mouth them so badly.

589
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,204
Don't cry.

590
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:52,622
What do I do?

591
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,334
Don't cry, all right?
Please don't cry. Stop.

592
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:02,298
I saw you suffering
because of her countless times.

593
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,883
How did you know where it was?

594
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,677
Dogok-dong, Byeon Sang-mi. It's easy.

595
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,637
I just visited a few convenience stores.

596
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,725
But still, pick up her calls sometimes.

597
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,268
I do pick up.

598
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,148
I'm so good at solving
other people's problems.

599
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,649
Should I open a business?

600
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,861
Thanks. You're a lifesaver.

601
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,696
Buy me a drink.

602
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,158
Let's go.

603
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,411
What do you want to eat?

604
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:32,954
Chicken feet?

605
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,999
Does that mean I have a girlfriend again?

606
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,876
It's better that way, you know?

607
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,545
You can use it
as an excuse when necessary.

608
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,382
-Gosh.
-It's hot.

609
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:54,976
This is nice

610
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,862
A PERSON THAT I JUST LIKE

611
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:10,200
When I thought about it,
I didn't have anyone like that.

612
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:15,538
If I think about it,
the people that I thought I liked

613
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,291
all have things
that make me uncomfortable.

614
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:21,961
Things that disappoint me.

615
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,547
Things that I hate.

616
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,633
Things that I'm jealous of.

617
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,969
They all have things that make me unhappy.

618
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,808
I might seem to be getting along
with people without any problems.

619
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:36,392
But in truth,

620
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:39,979
there's not a single person I truly like.

621
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:44,776
I'm wondering if that's why

622
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,863
I'm being drained without realizing it.

623
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:53,409
If it's why I always feel alone

624
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,371
and also as if I've been abandoned.

625
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:21,020
Hey. Here. Your pay for the week.

626
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,189
Thank you.

627
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,442
I should be thanking you.

628
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:32,157
SANPO SINKS

629
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,903
Excuse me.

630
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,616
Could I have
your youngest daughter's number?

631
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,291
Mi-jeong's?

632
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,501
Yes.

633
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,259
Zero-one-zero…

634
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,560
-I told you it's good.
-Fine, let's go.

635
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:44,938
Really?

636
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,112
I GOT SOME MONEY

637
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,162
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO EAT?

638
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,376
IT'S ME, GU

639
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,963
Even the people I think I like,
if I stop and think about it,

640
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:54,757
they all have things
that make me uncomfortable.

641
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:59,554
There's not a single person I truly like.

642
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:04,142
I'm wondering if that's why

643
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,562
I'm being drained without realizing it.

644
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:11,065
If it's why I always feel alone…

645
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,025
MY LIBERATION

646
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,777
…and also as if I've been abandoned.

647
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:15,778
YEOM MI-JEONG

648
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,906
Is this even possible?

649
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,576
It's not even easy to truly like your kid.

650
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,582
I've decided to try finding

651
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,627
someone like that.

652
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,755
Even if the other person
blows hot and cold,

653
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,758
I won't let myself sway.

654
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,806
I'm going to just keep liking them.

655
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:47,894
Wouldn't that be better
than dealing with people

656
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,271
without any purpose?

657
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,942
I want to try living differently.

658
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:57,130
Why don't you have anyone you like?

659
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:58,923
You have your family.

660
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:05,805
I don't love everything
about my mom and dad.

661
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,266
I dislike my brother and sister a lot.

662
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:12,103
I just feel sorry

663
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,147
for my dad.

664
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,736
I don't think he's ever been happy.

665
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:25,992
And I think my mom thinks
she's unhappy because of her kids.

666
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:30,413
So I say this when something bad happens.

667
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:33,374
"It's fine as long as
Mom doesn't find out."

668
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,604
Do you think lies will work?

669
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,773
"You're pretty," "You're cool."

670
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,233
You can say whatever you want.

671
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:07,033
But the moment you say it,
it'll become the truth.

672
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,494
All words are like that.

673
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,083
Try it. Just say anything.

674
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:55,641
I'm as happy as when I get my paycheck
whenever you message me.

675
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:58,769
She must be out of her mind.

676
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,730
You're making me look really bad here.

677
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:03,316
Apparently, A-reum has poached
three stores that way.

678
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:06,694
From now on, I'm going to put my life
on the line and love A-reum.

679
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:09,030
I have to listen to their gibberish.

680
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:11,616
My heart started pounding,
and I couldn't say anything.

681
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,368
I thought I had done something wrong.

682
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:15,661
I'm going to practice now.

683
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,497
What could you practice
with that alcoholic?

684
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,333
All the neighbors know.

685
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,753
I don't care
even if the whole world disproves.

686
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:25,296
I let them in too much.

687
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:27,256
Why don't you keep going?

688
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:34,639
