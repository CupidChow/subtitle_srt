4
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,675
Sorry!

5
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,559
Hang on. This is our dad's truck.

6
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,769
Why did I say sorry? Jeez.

7
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,105
What the heck?

8
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,123
SANPO SINKS

9
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,263
We're home.

10
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,264
Hey.

11
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,808
Wash up quick and come eat, okay?

12
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,977
I'll pass today.

13
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,646
Why? Wash up and come eat, okay?

14
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,775
Did you eat while you were out?

15
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,444
Of course not.

16
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,113
Then why isn't he eating?

17
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,139
Just leave him.

18
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,391
Why do you keep bothering him?

19
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,811
Then what? Just let him starve
when he worked all day?

20
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:53,107
He must want to drink on an empty stomach.

21
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,068
We know he drinks every day.

22
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,904
You take care of him every day.
Do you think he loves that?

23
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,865
It's like you're saying,
"Pull yourself together already."

24
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,367
He probably feels pressured.

25
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,118
Who's pressuring him?

26
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,578
You are, Mom.

27
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,309
I don't know what to take photos of.

28
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,648
I saw a tricycle on my way here.

29
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,713
Why do you drink every day?

30
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,465
What else would I do?

31
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,343
Should I give you something to do?

32
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,471
Worship me.

33
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,685
I've never felt whole before.

34
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,480
One asshole after another…

35
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,942
Every guy I've ever dated was an asshole.

36
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,321
So worship me and make me feel whole.

37
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,034
It'll be winter soon.

38
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,704
Nothing survives when winter comes.

39
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:34,167
There will be nothing to see sitting there
and no work at the factory.

40
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,378
If you drink all day,
you'll only feel like crap.

41
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,255
It'll be like hell.

42
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,800
You have to do something.

43
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,512
I want to feel whole for once.

44
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,682
So worship me.

45
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,019
Love isn't enough.

46
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,022
Worship me.

47
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,501
Go home.

48
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,961
Go home and sleep.

49
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,380
You have nothing to do anyway.

50
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,299
Do you think I want to do anything?

51
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,055
Do you know my name?

52
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,434
Do you know anything about me?

53
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,900
Why do you think
I'm living quietly in this countryside…

54
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,320
without telling anyone my name?

55
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,369
I don't want anything to do…

56
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,205
with anyone.

57
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,916
Not a thing.

58
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,603
Why are you still here?
Are you not going home?

59
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,191
I don't want to go home.

60
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,160
You don't want to go home?
What's gotten into you?

61
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,413
I've never heard you
say you don't want to go home.

62
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,290
Where should we go? A bar?

63
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,128
It looks delicious.

64
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,590
So tell me, why don't you want to go home?

65
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,634
Just because.

66
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,886
There you go again.

67
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,346
You always dodge questions like that.

68
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,682
Before I beat you up to make you spill,

69
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,808
just tell us.

70
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,314
There's this guy

71
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,942
that eats at my house.
And it's uncomfortable.

72
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,527
He eats there? Who is he?

73
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,528
Is he good-looking?

74
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,113
What does he do? How old is he?

75
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,032
I don't know, either.

76
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,658
-What?
-What?

77
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,288
I really don't know.

78
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,499
I don't even know his name.

79
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,793
I don't even know his name,

80
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,213
yet I made a huge mistake.

81
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,797
So what kind of mistake?

82
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,181
Spill it already! Spill! Now!

83
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,729
You lent a guy money, didn't you?

84
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,568
Guys can be sly as a fox too.

85
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,699
He saw that you're the kind of woman
he could borrow money from, screw over,

86
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,494
and get away with it.

87
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,377
So stop avoiding it
and deal with the problem at hand.

88
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,716
Once that jerk's paid all the money back,

89
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,636
will my life be fine?

90
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,138
I think it will still be the same.

91
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,977
I'll still have never felt whole

92
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,354
in this crappy life
with these crappy people

93
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,856
acting like they're so great

94
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,651
and just talking away thoughtlessly.

95
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,529
How they talk…

96
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,331
Sorry.

97
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,585
I'm an asshole, too.

98
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,810
Oh, no! The last train!

99
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,731
What?

100
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,277
I really don't want to go home.

101
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,529
Hey.

102
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,489
Just miss the last train.

103
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,992
-Miss it!
-Miss it!

104
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:23,998
-Miss it!
-Miss it!

105
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,917
-Miss it!
-Miss it!

106
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,211
Asshole.

107
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,130
Idiot.

108
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,841
All he ever does is drink every day.

109
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,764
Do you want to win by cheating
your friend like that, asshole?

110
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:40,848
Whatever.

111
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,684
-That's your problem.
-Hey.

112
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:34,879
Mom.

113
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,091
Please, let's turn
the air-conditioner on. Please?

114
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,388
Mother. I beg you.

115
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,801
Why has he turned
his back against the world?

116
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,933
The number you have dialed cannot be--

117
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,355
I MADE THIS MONTH'S PAYMENT. CALL ME.

118
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,566
THIS MESSAGE WAS DELETED

119
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,675
She asked if anything's up with you.

120
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,677
What's going on?

121
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,807
I got called to the Joy Support Center,

122
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,728
and I cried
because I didn't want to join a club.

123
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,438
Goodness.

124
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,273
Just join anything

125
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,984
and say you're too busy to attend.
That'll do it.

126
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,239
She's too straitlaced.

127
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,415
How about joining
the photography club with me?

128
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,209
No one drinks, and everyone's really nice.

129
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,714
It must be annoying
to keep being called in over such a thing.

130
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,301
I want to stop learning things.

131
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,473
When I learned to swim,
I couldn't swim freestyle.

132
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,309
But since there were a lot of us,

133
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,103
we moved on to the backstroke,
then the breaststroke…

134
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,898
School was the same.

135
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,361
I hadn't learnt the multiplication table,
but we still had to move on to fractions.

136
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,741
After that, I was just sitting there.

137
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,081
In a club, the same thing
will just happen again.

138
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,000
Besides, nothing's fun for me.

139
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,253
I shouldn't have told you

140
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,923
about Su-jin and the others
going on a trip.

141
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,761
You think I'd have fun on a trip?

142
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,185
Here you go.

143
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,448
Why are you asking
around for Se-yeong's number?

144
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,993
I've been paying
your money back consistently.

145
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,537
I've even worked part-time
to pay it back every month.

146
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,831
It's just this one month I couldn't pay.

147
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,084
I'm racking my brain now for a solution.

148
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,754
But if you call Se-yeong,
you can forget about the money.

149
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,965
For God's sake.

150
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,595
Crazy bastard.

151
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:03,313
DESIGN TEAM 3, CHOI JUN-HO

152
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,459
Were you…

153
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,379
talking to me?

154
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,347
No.

155
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,100
I was reading my text…

156
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:55,157
I guess he knows he's a bastard. If you're
going to a cafe, let's go together.

157
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,744
No. I'm going to do it at home.
See you tomorrow.

158
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,496
Okay, see you.

159
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,388
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY.
IMMEDIATELY HE SPOKE TO THEM AND SAID,

160
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,349
“TAKE COURAGE! IT IS I. DON’T BE AFRAID.”
(MARK 6:50)

161
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,198
I hate this season.

162
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,161
Where the air you breathe in
and breathe out

163
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,080
are the same temperature.

164
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,933
Can we get coffee here?

165
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,769
Well, you can,

166
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,314
but it doesn't taste all that good.

167
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,400
Should we just go?

168
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,110
Our coffee beans are old.

169
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,987
I'm sorry.

170
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,801
Has anyone come
to take a look at your cafe?

171
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,554
What do you think?

172
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,480
Can't you turn on the air-conditioner?

173
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,206
Is she crazy? Why would she come
to my friend's wedding?

174
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,542
If she broke up with me,
she should be done with my friends too.

175
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,420
How could she think
of coming there all dolled up?

176
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,673
And what? "Let's stay friends."

177
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,883
She hurt me so badly.

178
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,219
After saying I'm "unbearably
and disgustingly old-fashioned,"

179
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,971
she wants us to be friends.

180
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,098
Is she insane?
Does she think I'm an idiot?

181
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,975
Sorry.

182
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,311
She said she and that guy weren't a thing,

183
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,605
and they picked up
two more people right after.

184
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,858
What does that have to do with me?
Why did she even tell me that?

185
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,696
If it's over, just let it be over.
That's normal.

186
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,072
But her being friendly…

187
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,284
End things beautifully?

188
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,495
Don't make me laugh. There's
no such thing as a beautiful breakup.

189
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,415
Then she took it out on me

190
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,791
saying I embarrassed her

191
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,293
-in front of others.
-Asshole.

192
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,432
Can't they just get married
without other people?

193
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,269
In the past, people went to weddings
to eat food since they were poor.

194
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,146
But they all eat well now.

195
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,898
Hey, I'm hungry.

196
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,536
So you live in Uijeongbu?

197
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,163
Yes.

198
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:17,044
Then this is a meeting between
North Gyeonggi-do and South Gyeonggi-do.

199
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,465
We have penetrated the egg yolk to meet.

200
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,013
Oh. That's what my brother says.

201
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,391
That Gyeonggi-do is like the egg white
wrapped around Seoul,

202
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,310
which is the egg yolk.

203
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:38,482
So we've both come into the yolk to meet.

204
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,861
That's funny.

205
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,950
Does it take you about an hour and a half
to get to Seoul from there, too?

206
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,619
Yes.

207
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,246
Right, me too.

208
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,917
A round trip of three hours
for both of us.

209
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,795
We might as well go on a trip.

210
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,465
Isn't the commute pretty bad?

211
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,508
It's the worst.

212
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,594
Are you managing?

213
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,179
Not really.

214
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,182
I feel like my batteries are
going to run out soon.

215
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,017
Same here.

216
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,061
So I should decide soon

217
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,647
whether to change jobs or move to Seoul.

218
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,818
I'd decide to move to Seoul.

219
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,863
You haven't let go of that dream yet?

220
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,533
Have you let go?

221
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:34,371
It's still too early to give up just yet,
so hold on a little longer.

222
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:47,843
You were saved
in Jeong-su's phone as "Pick-up Girl."

223
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,427
What does that mean?

224
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,181
Oh, that?

225
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,767
"A girl who always picks up the phone"?

226
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,520
I asked him, but he said it wasn't that

227
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,772
and told me to ask you directly.

228
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,149
What does it mean?

229
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,442
This again.

230
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,029
I'm tearing up, just thinking about it.

231
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,660
Once, with my friends,

232
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:18,748
we were talking about
"What's the noblest romance there is?"

233
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:22,085
And I was reminded of something I saw
in a history book at school,

234
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:28,884
about a woman who ran to pick up the
severed head of her husband in her skirt.

235
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,428
When I was young,
it was too gruesome for me,

236
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,889
but now that I'm older, I think,

237
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,684
"Yes, I would pick it up,
no, I'd have to pick it up."

238
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:41,396
"I can't let it fall to the ground.
I should run and catch it in my skirt."

239
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,814
Yes.

240
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,274
Don't you think so?

241
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,942
Isn't that only right?

242
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:50,071
And one summer, ages ago,
I spent a short time at Bible Camp.

243
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,033
I heard the story
of how Jesus was nailed to the cross,

244
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,328
but weirdly, it was Mary
that my heart went out to.

245
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,830
It took about six hours for Jesus to die

246
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,374
after getting whipped
and nailed to the cross.

247
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:05,045
For those six hours,
Mary followed the entire way

248
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,881
and took Jesus's body down.

249
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,634
She's amazing.

250
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,137
I should stay by my partner's side, too.

251
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,084
Why would you talk about that?

252
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:50,465
They'd be too scared about
being beheaded to fall for you.

253
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,051
You need to watch what you say.

254
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,011
Why would you say that
to someone you just met?

255
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,764
Well, he asked.

256
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:58,807
So what?

257
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,060
Would you tell him how your poop was
this morning if he asked?

258
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,478
Yes, I'd tell him everything.

259
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,190
Just live alone.

260
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,693
Why are you trying so hard
to love just anyone?

261
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,946
Don't do it. No one will love you.

262
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,906
No man would fall in love with a woman

263
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,325
who says she'd pick up
their lover's severed head.

264
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:22,497
I just mean, if such a thing happens.
Hypothetically.

265
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,458
Exactly, why are you
imagining that situation?

266
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,170
We don't want to be beheaded.
We don't want to imagine that.

267
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,924
Why did you have to
give him such a gruesome example?

268
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,845
That's the noblest romance?
We're not living in that era.

269
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,728
She's not looking for a boyfriend,
she's looking for a comrade-in-arms.

270
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,064
You must feel so much regret
that you were born in such peaceful times.

271
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:53,028
You must want to charge at enemies
and risk your life to save the country.

272
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,071
So sitting and eating dinner with a guy

273
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,158
must be terribly dull
and unsatisfying for you, right?

274
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,499
All right, then.

275
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,127
One. Women who run away.

276
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,587
Two. Women who faint.

277
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,506
Three. Women who pick it up.
Which woman do you want?

278
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,430
Which one would you prefer
out of the three?

279
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,599
Hey, which woman are you?

280
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,188
I'd pick it up too if it came to that.

281
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,190
She's a pick-up girl.

282
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:34,319
Girls who flirt and act all feminine
like Lee Ye-rin would never pick it up.

283
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,321
Those kinds of girls would run away.

284
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,198
Is that love?

285
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:44,079
So you're saying
that your man should be beheaded.

286
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,039
Hey, Du-hwan.

287
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,832
We need to start a war.

288
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,251
Gi-jeong's man
absolutely must be beheaded.

289
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,338
As long as it's not me.

290
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,798
Oh Du-hwan.

291
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,426
Your name could start a war. Oh Du-hwan.

292
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:02,013
Yeom Chang-hee. Your name's just as bad.

293
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,142
Mi-jeong, go buy some more alcohol.

294
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,646
No.

295
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,606
No?

296
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,609
Then go borrow some from Gu.

297
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,072
Just go borrow some already.

298
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,575
You bring him food every day.
I'm sure he'll give us some.

299
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,744
Hurry. You and Mr. Gu are close.

300
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,248
As if.

301
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,458
Let's just call it a night.

302
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,669
We're short by just one drink.
Hurry up and go.

303
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,048
There's no alcohol at Mr. Gu's place.
So enough.

304
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,467
Why wouldn't there be when he's a drunk?

305
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,971
Alcoholics never have alcohol stored away.

306
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,931
They just keep two to three bottles.

307
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,143
At first, he thinks,
"Just two bottles today."

308
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,438
"I'll just drink two bottles."
And he only buys two bottles.

309
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,274
Once he finishes them, he just wants more.

310
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,235
So he goes all the way
to the train station to buy more.

311
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,196
It would have been better
if he had started off with four bottles.

312
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,781
But it's always two.

313
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,659
That's how hard it is to be an alcoholic.

314
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,996
You two must be close.

315
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,373
We're next-door neighbors.

316
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,418
Have you guys even talked?

317
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:16,796
Once.

318
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,592
So, while drinking,

319
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,261
he always goes in
and brings out a new glass.

320
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,682
He always has two or three
shot glasses on the table.

321
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,934
So I asked him why,

322
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,229
and he said he changes glasses
when he gets bored.

323
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,403
What a poor, lonely guy.

324
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,157
I thought he was really cool.

325
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,367
Right.

326
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,536
See, during the day,

327
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,123
he drinks one glass
looking at the window on this side.

328
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:57,712
When the sun sets, he drinks one glass
looking at the porch over there.

329
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,298
At night,

330
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:04,135
he drinks one glass
looking at the other window.

331
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,972
He only changes the direction

332
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,850
staying still like this.

333
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,022
It's as if he's standing guard.
Like a neighborhood watch.

334
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,446
Hey, he's not out there today, though.

335
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,076
Come on. It's too hot and humid.

336
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,120
There's no breeze, either.
He's probably inside with the AC on.

337
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,292
Let's call it a night.

338
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,294
Bring those with you.

339
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:41,923
Should I go over?

340
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,038
This wall is perfect
for catching mosquitoes.

341
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,541
You can see everything. It's so clean.

342
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,503
If a mosquito gets into my room,
I can never find it.

343
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,881
The wallpaper's a mess,
everything's a mess.

344
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,343
How many bottles have you had?

345
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,684
I have the feeling that's the second.

346
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:40,940
I came because I thought it might
be more fun to have a drinking buddy

347
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,775
than change glasses.

348
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,823
Can I join you?

349
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,577
Where's a glass?

350
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,794
HANJO BANK

351
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,439
Do I look pathetic to you, too?

352
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,486
No way.

353
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,070
YSTAT RESEARCH

354
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,158
Everything else is almost done,

355
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,660
but we don't have enough
single men in their 40s from Gangwon-do.

356
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,872
We won't make it up
with cold calling by 6 p.m.

357
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,165
We should widen the limit.

358
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,168
Let's try for a bit longer.
There's still time.

359
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:09,088
But it's a long shot. We haven't
gotten anyone in the past two hours.

360
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,009
Let's just widen the limit.

361
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,803
Then…

362
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,930
how about until eight?

363
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,016
Let's try until eight o'clock.

364
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,325
Working overtime again today?

365
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,619
He's making us every day.

366
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,539
That's why he gives out
those lottery tickets so often.

367
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,878
By the way, how did your blind date go?

368
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,007
You know…

369
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,510
We agreed to meet again next time.

370
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,181
Doesn't "next time" usually mean "never"?

371
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,604
I was wondering,

372
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,065
did you get your chompers done?

373
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,568
It's just that they look so straight.

374
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,533
Don't you usually use
the word "chompers" with animals?

375
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:23,162
For people, we say "teeth."

376
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,800
You can use the word chompers
on people too.

377
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:40,513
You can say chompers, teeth,
or gnashers. Right?

378
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,182
We can use any of them. What's with her?

379
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,704
Hey. Are you on your way home?

380
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,497
Yes.

381
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,916
Good job today.

382
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,626
You too, Mr. Park.

383
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,436
Can I ask you a question?

384
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:29,770
Sure.

385
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:38,446
How many of those lottery tickets
have you given out to women?

386
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,824
I'm sure it's quite a lot.

387
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,826
And not just to women.

388
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,207
Do you know
you've never once given one to me?

389
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,550
No way.

390
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,552
Not even once.

391
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,265
Hold on, wait.

392
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,017
Well…

393
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,895
I'm sorry, that shocked me quite a bit.

394
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,315
I should have been more subtle.

395
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,235
I'm embarrassed.

396
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,446
-I'm so sorry.
-No.

397
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,753
You know,

398
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,340
I've decided to love someone this winter.
Just anyone.

399
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,760
Don't be nervous.

400
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,976
I've been so impatient lately,
I just want to die already.

401
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,520
After 14 years, my job is the same,

402
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,897
the meetings are the same,
and the people are the same,

403
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,651
I curse and get mad the same way.
It's all the same endless repetition.

404
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,112
"Will it be this way until I die?"

405
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,240
"Let's not live like this anymore.
Let's just love anyone."

406
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,326
"Even a relationship
I force myself into could turn into love."

407
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,788
"I'll love him passionately.
I'll make him my whole world."

408
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,874
But…

409
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,918
no one comes near me.

410
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,671
Everyone skips over me, like you.

411
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,632
Well, that was…

412
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,968
A subconscious decision?

413
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,555
I want to know
why it was that you did that.

414
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,141
Why does everybody skip over me?

415
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,769
I'm willing to hear
whatever you have to say

416
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,605
even if it shatters my pride.

417
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,274
Why do you think that is?

418
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,235
Well…

419
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,614
First of all, from my perspective,

420
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,118
the type of woman
a man likes never changes.

421
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,706
Whenever my friends introduce me
to their new girlfriends,

422
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,250
I find that they date people
who are just like their exes.

423
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,044
Men's tastes don't change.

424
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:04,091
In general, comedians marry comedians,
and actors marry actors, right?

425
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,595
-Well, that's who they see the most.
-No.

426
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,180
That's not the reason.

427
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,390
It's because
they're attracted to those types.

428
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,353
It's whether you prefer
someone who makes you laugh

429
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,813
or someone who makes your heart flutter.

430
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,398
I prefer the latter.

431
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,442
I prefer the latter too.

432
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,535
People who have a lot of dating experience
know what they want.

433
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,162
But those who don't,

434
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:36,624
don't know what they want
or what type of person they are.

435
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:40,211
They just want passionate romance
because that's what they hear people want.

436
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,004
But when they finally have it,

437
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,174
many find it
too embarrassing and can't stand it.

438
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,635
It can be embarrassing, but I like it.

439
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,680
When you're embarrassed about something,
it means you find it uncomfortable.

440
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,183
So…

441
00:39:56,352 --> 00:40:01,065
You might be very natural and charming
in a different genre, Ms. Yeom.

442
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,859
Melodrama isn't the only genre
of relationships, right?

443
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,862
There's comedy, surrealism,

444
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,573
thriller… Yes, that's a good one.

445
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,660
What else, slice-of-life? Suspense?
There are so many.

446
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:18,290
In which genre among those
do you think you'd be most effective?

447
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,591
What are your strengths?

448
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,809
I'm like a Jindo dog.

449
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,771
I stand by my man and never betray him.
I protect him.

450
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,065
And my man must be a real man.

451
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,526
But I don't mean
he has to be all big and burly.

452
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,864
Yes, I have my own idea of masculinity.

453
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:50,948
A man, yes.

454
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,075
Slice-of-life it is. Yes.

455
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,536
It almost veered toward thriller,

456
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,288
but you're the slice-of-life type.

457
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,666
Many are not really interested
in surprise events or grand gestures.

458
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,627
The most important thing to them
is their attitude toward life.

459
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,087
They look at a person's core.

460
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,674
The core.

461
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,468
Attitude.

462
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,097
Anyway, if you keep that in mind,
you'll usually make the right choice.

463
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:20,519
And rather than being recklessly
determined to love just anyone,

464
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:25,274
deciding to go for it
when you meet someone you like

465
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,734
will be far more constructive.

466
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,743
You really are an expert.

467
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,369
Okay.

468
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,874
If I meet a man I like,
I'm going to try to make the first move.

469
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,667
Not just the first move,

470
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,377
but the first confession.

471
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,257
That's so embarrassing though.

472
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,717
My mom always says,

473
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,387
"A house and spouse will come
to you when the time is right."

474
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,932
You'll find one when the time is right.

475
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,267
-Will he?
-He will.

476
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,312
Okay.

477
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,901
I feel like I need to give you
a fortune-teller's fee or something.

478
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:09,985
No.

479
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:25,501
If I go this way, I can get home faster.

480
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,294
Get home safe.

481
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,548
You must really not be
interested in me at all.

482
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,383
You can't wait to go home.

483
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,095
No, I'm just kidding.

484
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,430
-Let's go together.
-No, go ahead.

485
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,307
-It's fine. Go ahead.
-All right.

486
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,894
-See you tomorrow.
-Go on, off you go. Go ahead. Go.

487
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,563
See you tomorrow.

488
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:19,763
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

489
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,434
Something good, my foot.

490
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:58,927
I'm going to go.

491
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,598
Hey, use the restroom before you go.

492
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,100
I'm fine.

493
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,936
Do as I say.
It's a long way back to Seoul.

494
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,980
I just wanted to try coming here once.

495
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,985
I came here for a change!

496
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,404
To your neighborhood, Dangmi Station!

497
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,407
It's nothing special.

498
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,095
Even if you need to pee, hold it.
This is the last train.

499
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,222
Hold it until you get to Seoul.

500
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,813
I'm home.

501
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,481
Mom and Dad aren't here.

502
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,150
Where are they?

503
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,317
At a funeral.

504
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,403
Who passed away?

505
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:40,779
Mom's uncle.

506
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,628
Why are you acting like you got dumped
when it was you who dumped her?

507
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,631
What do you mean?

508
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,177
Lee Ye-rin. You're the one who dumped her.

509
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:08,098
Watching the movie
and going to the restaurant alone

510
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,975
when you promised to go together.

511
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,978
Who wouldn't break up after that?

512
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,068
He always does something
that'll get him dumped.

513
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,154
He totally deserves it.

514
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,697
Do you have another girl?

515
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,367
Did you want to break up with her
because you met someone else you liked?

516
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,456
-Do you think I'd do that?
-Then why did you do it?

517
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,084
Lee Ye-rin went home after crying
for a while at Dangmi Station.

518
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,965
I guess she knows she messed up.

519
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,884
You're the one who messed up.

520
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,844
She started it!

521
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,638
I saw that look in her eyes.

522
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:51,016
The look in her eyes that says,
"This guy's nothing special."

523
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,810
The look I've seen
in their eyes many times.

524
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:57,189
"This guy's nothing special.
How shall I break up with him?"

525
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,066
"What excuse should I come up with?"

526
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,152
At first, I do as they say and play along.

527
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,446
"Yes, I know I'm nothing special."

528
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,866
"But I'm fun to be around.
At least I'm not a bore."

529
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,994
But if that doesn't work,
what am I supposed to do?

530
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,663
What else can I do
when they want to end it?

531
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,998
From that point on,
I start fighting them constantly.

532
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,834
And that's when the reason we broke up
becomes that I watched a movie alone,

533
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,962
or that she texted some guy late at night.

534
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:24,967
And it can never be because
she found out what a pathetic loser I am.

535
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,230
I know it, too.

536
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,776
That I'm not the best she can have.

537
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:50,200
I know that she thinks she can
find someone better.

538
00:47:56,832 --> 00:48:00,002
He always asked, "Aren't you
curious about my neighborhood?"

539
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,714
"Aren't you curious about Dangmi Station?

540
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,967
Tell him I know now.

541
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:09,720
DANGMI

542
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,389
Now every time I pass near here,

543
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,100
I'm sure I'll think of Yeom Chang-hee.

544
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,311
YEOM CHANG-HEE

545
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,689
YEOM CHANG-HEE

546
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,969
Where are you going this late?

547
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,699
I'm sorry

548
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:14,701
for the other day.

549
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,829
I was drunk and crossed the line.

550
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,709
I'm not that rude usually.

551
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,467
We should drink together sometime
and get to know each other.

552
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,642
What should I call you?
I only know your last name.

553
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,731
I was born in 1985…

554
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,782
I'll just call you Gu.

555
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,055
Did everyone just arrive?

556
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,349
I worked overtime. I didn't drink.

557
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,772
You're home.

558
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,294
If you think about it,

559
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,339
all the assholes in my life

560
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,050
started with that same look in their eyes.

561
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,345
Eyes that seemed to say,

562
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:40,972
"You're not good enough."

563
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,854
It makes you feel so small.

564
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,899
Like you're insignificant.

565
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:56,988
It was that look
that made us sick and exhausted.

566
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:02,285
Repetitive relationships you jump into
to find something to love about yourself,

567
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:07,040
only to come out of them even more sure
of how unattractive you truly are.

568
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,379
Where should we look for the answer?

569
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:17,217
What about you?
Have you ever made anyone feel whole?

570
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:06,182
SANPO KITCHEN SINK, CLOSET
CUSTOM-DESIGNED FURNITURE

571
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,267
It's too hot.

572
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,768
I want to eat something cold.

573
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,063
Hey.

574
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:17,027
Does that guy still eat
at your house these days?

575
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,531
Are you still uncomfortable around him?

576
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,452
Stop already. Forget what I said.

577
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,414
-Hey, the omelet's pretty good.
-Really?

578
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:31,124
-Today's my lucky day.
-Is it?

579
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:40,550
I'd like to discuss the details
of a new club with you.

580
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,762
So could you come
by the Center sometime today?

581
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:09,079
These guys are seriously pissing me off.

582
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,930
Should we just report it
to the commission?

583
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,482
Are you going to go?

584
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:43,571
Let's just make one ourselves. Anything.

585
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:50,453
It seems they're going to
keep calling us until we join a club.

586
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,040
We can just tell them we'll form one,

587
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,167
and not do anything.

588
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,463
But they'll probably be suspicious.

589
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,722
What if they ask what we're doing?

590
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,516
A book club?

591
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,435
There's already a book club.

592
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,104
What don't they have yet?

593
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,484
Hiking's probably taken.

594
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,319
Definitely.

595
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,451
We have to choose carefully.

596
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,871
If it's something they already have,
they'll make us join that.

597
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:34,372
Calligraphy?

598
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,753
Can't we get a list
of all the workplace clubs?

599
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,129
If we can, it'll be easy.

600
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,923
I think it's on the website.

601
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,676
Here, there's a list.

602
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,844
Right, let's see.

603
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,058
How about we actually do it?

604
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,314
"The Liberation Club."

605
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,196
I…

606
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,282
want liberation.

607
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,118
I want to be liberated.

608
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:17,791
I don't know where I'm trapped,
but I feel trapped.

609
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,752
There's nothing in my life
that relaxes me.

610
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,130
I feel cramped and stifled.

611
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,052
I want to break free.

612
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,182
Liberation?

613
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,186
I like it.

614
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,282
The three of you?

615
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:53,618
Yes.

616
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:59,999
What does "liberation" entail?

617
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,586
The Republic of Korea
was liberated in 1945,

618
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,381
but we have yet to find liberation.

619
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:08,633
What?

620
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,928
What?

621
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,140
That's it?

622
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,729
Well, so…

623
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,692
what are the three of you going to do?

624
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:27,819
Liberation.

625
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,071
That's what we'll do.

626
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,744
JOY SUPPORT CENTER

627
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,674
My gosh.

628
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:04,439
What are we actually
trying to liberate ourselves from?

629
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,608
What do we have to do?

630
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:18,786
Then let's first think about what we're
trying to liberate ourselves from.

631
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,369
Oh, my.

632
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,625
Cover it up.

633
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,363
Do you

634
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,032
want me to worship you?

635
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,832
It seems you've never felt whole too.

636
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,546
Let me know if you want me to.

637
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,461
I'm heading out.

638
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,774
Let's at least say hi from now on.

639
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,115
Let's at least say hi from now on.

640
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,462
The bus is coming. You better run.

641
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:21,969
I said, run.

642
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,569
You've found someone, right?

643
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:02,695
We're really going to do it.

644
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,489
You cheer them on.

645
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,074
Yeom Gi-jeong.
Wait, are you Yeom Gi-jeong?

646
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,952
Have you lost it?
He's Gyeong-seon's little brother.

647
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,371
He's a single father.

648
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:15,291
I wonder how he managed
to get that nasty old man to pay.

649
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:17,293
I doubt he beat it out of him.

650
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,630
Why are you so moody?

651
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:22,882
To each one's own.

652
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,844
-What is it?
-Where is Mr. Gu going?

653
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,971
Do you know someone around here?

654
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,474
You would've been in trouble
if you had kept going.

655
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,935
Get inside now! I said, get inside!

656
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:41,692
