1
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,839
Here. Help yourself
as much as you want, okay?

2
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,633
Go on.

3
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,013
I'm done.

4
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,609
I've never heard that man

5
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:53,113
compliment anyone on the job.
Not even once.

6
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,989
But he loves you.

7
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,618
He says you're a good worker
and that you'd be good at anything.

8
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:03,123
I've never heard him compliment
anyone other than Mi-jeong.

9
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,043
She's always been his favorite, you know.

10
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,380
He always glares at me
when he sees the drawers I make,

11
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,882
but he never complains about her work.

12
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,388
She could install moldings and use every
machine since she was in third grade.

13
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,807
And she was quite good.

14
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:28,148
Look. That's her at the workshop
when she was little.

15
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,323
Her siblings would always
toss their book bags

16
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,075
and run outside after school,

17
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,870
but she'd go to the workshop
even before doing her homework.

18
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,747
I guess she found it fun.

19
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,958
Otherwise, she wouldn't
have been so into it.

20
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,043
Hey, I need a basket!

21
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,086
Okay!

22
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,087
Seriously.

23
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,881
Zip it until we get home.

24
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,300
I'm your only older sister. How could you?

25
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,011
Jeez, that's enough!

26
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,764
-What are you talking about?
-Here we go again!

27
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,060
That asshole said "fuck" to my face
in front of everybody!

28
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,938
I never said anything like "fuck"!

29
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,064
I heard it!

30
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,566
Okay, fine, I said it. I said "fuck."

31
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,693
Who brings their coffee
onto a bus these days?

32
00:03:55,777 --> 00:04:00,156
There was only ice in the cup.
I just couldn't find a trash can, dumbass.

33
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,534
Why do you wear high heels when you
can't even balance yourself properly?

34
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,371
Why did you have to
carry it and fall into my arms?

35
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,289
I didn't fall into your arms.

36
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,415
When did I?

37
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,125
-I was just like this.
-Damn it!

38
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,168
-I didn't.
-Jeez!

39
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,420
This is embarrassing.
Cut it out and get inside.

40
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,506
For God's sake.

41
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,590
-Jeez.
-Gosh.

42
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,177
That little bastard.
How dare he glare at me like that?

43
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,349
Yeom Chang-hee.

44
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,142
Yeom Chang-hee.

45
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,327
Jeez, look what you did to her.

46
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,275
Hey, that's…

47
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,654
That's my slipper.

48
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,330
Seriously, why would you throw that?

49
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,373
Jeez.

50
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,042
You go get it.

51
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,050
All the other kids
get along with their siblings just fine.

52
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,136
So what's wrong
with the kids in this house?

53
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,222
All you ever do is yell at each other,
you know that?

54
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,559
Aren't you old enough to know
how embarrassing it is?

55
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,478
I held back until I got home.

56
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,240
You've got to be careful with Mi-jeong.

57
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,700
She has a temper.

58
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,827
It's scary when she loses it.

59
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,871
I mean, she's…

60
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,164
How should I put this?

61
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,917
The thing about kids who can't fight is

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,544
that they don't know when to stop.

63
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,755
Gi-jeong and I fight all the time,

64
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,633
but we still make sure
not to cross the line.

65
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,885
But with Mi-jeong, if she gets angry,

66
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:29,055
she'd just kick you right off of a cliff,
if you know what I mean.

67
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,475
She just doesn't think.
She doesn't care about the consequences.

68
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,491
Jeez, this is utterly exhausting.

69
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,720
I was really making an effort
not to badmouth people.

70
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,348
"Right, this is just where I am now."

71
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,100
"I'm at their level."

72
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:18,271
"When the time comes and I'm ready,
I'll find myself around better people."

73
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,273
I decided to think that way.

74
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,484
But after a long, hard day,
it's not so different at home.

75
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,793
I want to live alone
and use the air-conditioner all I want.

76
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,671
Somewhere I can't hear
anyone else's voice.

77
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,929
Just like you, Gu.

78
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:53,931
Someone who lives alone.

79
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,272
By the way,
how did you end up moving here?

80
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,486
No one moves into the neighborhood.
People only move out.

81
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,030
Do you know someone around here?

82
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,913
No.

83
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,873
How did you end up here, then?

84
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,253
Did you live in the area
when you were young?

85
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,340
I got off at the wrong stop.

86
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,967
Sorry?

87
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,770
That son of a…

88
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:47,193
Why the hell did you lock the door?
There's nothing to steal in there!

89
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,488
I didn't lock it!

90
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,822
That little…

91
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,202
See you later.

92
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,504
You're just going to leave?

93
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,366
I told you to wash your hair
before going to bed!

94
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,785
You two always hog the bathroom
in the mornings.

95
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,962
I keep telling you
we need another bathroom.

96
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,385
We won't need two bathrooms
once you all move out.

97
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,724
Move out within a year.
And into a place with two bathrooms!

98
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,667
ALPHA RETAIL

99
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,127
I went through the same thing.

100
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,881
So I go to the store
I hate to visit the most first.

101
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,384
When I was new, I'd visit them last.

102
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,722
But you know how uncomfortable you feel
until you visit the store.

103
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,850
So it's better
to make it your first stop of the day.

104
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,229
But still, you shouldn't
have said that to the store owners.

105
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,857
I didn't tell them that.

106
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,573
She says she wants a different manager,
but we can't just do that.

107
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,741
Just talk to her.

108
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,118
Have you called her?

109
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,622
She won't answer my calls
or return my messages.

110
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,750
You'll just have to
keep trying until she does.

111
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,005
Something felt weird yesterday.

112
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,175
Every owner asked
which store I went to first.

113
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,928
I asked them why,

114
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,554
and they said A-reum told them

115
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,224
that I always visit
the person I hate the most first.

116
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:30,272
You should tell her
to mind her own business.

117
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,609
She's not in charge of them anymore.

118
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,028
Why does she still see them
and cause this trouble?

119
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:42,201
Do you think she's trying to keep you
in check because of the promotion?

120
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,538
Damn it.

121
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,374
Hey, it's going to be okay.

122
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,877
Fighting and making up with
store owners is 70 percent of our job.

123
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,046
This won't affect the promotion.

124
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,133
I do usually go to the store
I hate to visit the most first.

125
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,467
But not yesterday.

126
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,095
The owner there works alone all night,

127
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:05,182
so I went there first so she could
go home early and get some rest.

128
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,458
Hello--

129
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,584
Thank you.

130
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,003
Thank you for answering my call.

131
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,591
No, I'm not that good at acting.

132
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,052
I can't walk into a place I don't like
with a smile and chat like that.

133
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,512
I can't do that.

134
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,308
Honestly, it's Ms. Choi's shop
that I have the hardest time dealing with.

135
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,352
I wouldn't even be so upset
if people knew, because it's true.

136
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,772
But this misunderstanding with you…
It's just not true.

137
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,359
GYEONGDONG RICE BOWLS

138
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,945
Someone really needs
to tear A-reum a new one.

139
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,823
She does things
knowing she'll cause trouble.

140
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,285
She wants there to be trouble.
She destroys relationships.

141
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,371
I want to eat everything here.

142
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,334
I'll have this. Extra large.

143
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,085
Me too.

144
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,879
-Two extra larges, please.
-Sure.

145
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:22,176
A-reum talks too much. Way too much.

146
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,429
If I die,
make sure you file a petition online.

147
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,890
"A man dies of stress
listening to a chatterbox."

148
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,810
Why is a day at the office
even harder than being outside?

149
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,564
I have to hear everything that happened
in the past week, including what she ate.

150
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,983
It's an illness.
She'll go crazy if she can't talk.

151
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,945
But she doesn't know
that it drives me crazy. She's so selfish.

152
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,616
I'd rather get a call from Byeon Sang-mi
than hear her babbling on. It's that bad.

153
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,745
And when I come in early,

154
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,498
I have to listen to exactly
the same story three times.

155
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,543
She tells me,
then Mr. Kim, and then Mr. Baek.

156
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,294
The same exact story three times.

157
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,506
And she gets upset
if I don't remember any of it.

158
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,050
"I told you this,
but you obviously forgot."

159
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,843
"You don't care about me, do you?"

160
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,136
Why would I even care?

161
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:11,600
And it's not like
we can swap seats like in school.

162
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,436
It drives me insane.
It makes me want to jump out the window.

163
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,439
I have to get promoted this time.

164
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,318
A promotion is the only way
to get away from A-reum.

165
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,695
Excuse me.

166
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,862
Thank you.

167
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,824
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

168
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,035
This is a lot.

169
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,956
You should really
give her a piece of your mind this time.

170
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,041
-I won't.
-Hey.

171
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,920
I know if I grill her about this,
she'll have nothing to say for herself.

172
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,381
So why am I not going to do it?

173
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,635
I don't want to sink to her level.
I'm going to get out of this place.

174
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,971
I'm not going to stoop to her level.

175
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,140
That's why I won't do it.

176
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,229
I'd love to work
with good, decent people too.

177
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,355
So why can't I?

178
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,525
It means I'm not decent myself.

179
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,070
Why? Like attracts like. It's science.

180
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,116
It sucks, but this is my level.

181
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:14,496
If I were a decent person, there's no way
I'd be working with someone like A-reum.

182
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,414
Why?

183
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,833
Because it's scientifically impossible.

184
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,960
That's why I always tell myself,

185
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,005
"I should be a decent person
instead of hoping she'll become one."

186
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,633
It's like spiritual training.

187
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,430
Damn it.

188
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,766
Crap.

189
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,142
What?

190
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,896
Do I talk too much too?

191
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,898
It feels like I'm the only one talking.

192
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,027
If you think I talk too much,
you have to tell me. Okay?

193
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,528
Yes, just eat.

194
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,366
Gosh.

195
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,159
How horrifying.

196
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,209
Everyone. Come look.

197
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,591
RECOMMENDED CLUBS
THE LIBERATION CLUB

198
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,259
THE LIBERATION CLUB

199
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,428
"The Liberation Club"? What's that?

200
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,930
Let's see who's in it.

201
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,891
MEMBERS
PARK SANG-MIN, CHO TAE-HUN, YEOM MI-JEONG

202
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,478
No way. It looks like
they randomly tossed it together.

203
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,898
What do you do in The Liberation Club?

204
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,567
Liberation.

205
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,987
So what exactly do you do?

206
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,614
Liberation.

207
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,120
I'm not so sure either.

208
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,789
-Come on.
-Come on.

209
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,460
Did you just make a fake club so
the support center would stop calling you?

210
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,798
We're really going to do it.

211
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,467
So let's hear it then. What do you do?

212
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,802
You must do something.

213
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,929
What do you do together?

214
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,099
We don't do anything together.

215
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,851
We do it individually.

216
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,352
What do you do individually?

217
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,738
I'm going to break free.

218
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:13,782
From what?

219
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,326
From here.

220
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,120
To where?

221
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:26,962
To there.

222
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,674
-Come on.
-Come on.

223
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,440
Why would I install
a 400,000-won kitchen sink

224
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,901
when the rent is just 300,000 won?

225
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:52,071
Do you think I just collect rent
and don't spend any money?

226
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,491
When a tenant moves out, I have to hang
new wallpaper and clean the place.

227
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,367
That's not a small amount of money!

228
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,703
The Black Rose Hair Salon
only paid 300,000 won.

229
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,580
So why is it 400,000 won for me?

230
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,709
They only installed the lower cabinets
without the upper ones.

231
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,044
I saw it for myself.

232
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,213
It looked exactly the same
as this one. Jeez.

233
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,965
No, they didn't install
the upper cabinets.

234
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,634
Whatever.

235
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,928
You think you can fool me
because I'm an old man?

236
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:19,014
Forget it. Just rip it out!
Take it all back!

237
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,100
Wait. Sir--

238
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,720
What is it?

239
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,181
I'll be back in a bit.

240
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,182
Where are you going?

241
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,822
Where is Mr. Gu going?

242
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,682
Who is it?

243
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,738
SANPO SINKS

244
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,068
How did you get him to pay?
I don't know how to thank you.

245
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,362
Come and have dinner. I've set the table--

246
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,864
You're skipping dinner again? Come eat!

247
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,161
My gosh.

248
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,955
-I'm home.
-Hey.

249
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:01,885
I wonder how he managed
to get that nasty old man to pay.

250
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,847
Old fogies like him are
usually no match for young men.

251
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,517
Still, don't say that about your elders.

252
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,314
Maybe you should call him.

253
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,233
I doubt he beat it out of him.

254
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,279
Don't call him
and make a fool out of Mr. Gu.

255
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,072
Still. Whenever he needs something

256
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,701
the old man always comes to us
instead of other businesses.

257
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,787
Because it's cheap.
Because you let him haggle all the time.

258
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,497
Because you do whatever he wants.

259
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,490
She said you seemed
to like sweet potato stems.

260
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,242
So she sent some.

261
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,544
Why are you so moody?

262
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,427
You're okay one minute and cold the next.

263
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,431
You two are the same.

264
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,560
You and your dad.

265
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:36,646
I mean…

266
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,483
Why do you act
like you've done something wrong

267
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,818
when you're asking for
what's rightfully yours?

268
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,284
Want me to get it back for you?

269
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,707
If you keep being nice,
he won't pay you back.

270
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,963
Taking things to the extreme
with people you used to know…

271
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,966
Not everyone can do it.

272
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,886
Even if I don't get my money back,

273
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,598
stooping so low and ending up
on the same level as them

274
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,226
is much harder for me.

275
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,700
I'm sorry.

276
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,370
I'm just a drunk after all.

277
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,586
To each one's own.

278
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,383
I don't ever intend to change…

279
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,387
and neither do you.

280
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,680
I said, get off!

281
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:38,310
By the way,
how did you end up moving here?

282
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,564
I got off at the wrong stop.

283
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,456
This is perfect for vacation.

284
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:03,001
Once it's wet, the color will
look darker and different in photos.

285
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,255
You should pick bathing suits in colors
that won't change much when they're wet.

286
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,215
White or black.

287
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,509
Mi-jeong, what color is your bikini?

288
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,804
I don't have a bikini.

289
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,016
Is it a one-piece then?

290
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,018
Yes.

291
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,561
What's with you?

292
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,521
I thought you were going to be liberated?

293
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,106
What color is it?

294
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,651
Navy.

295
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,446
Gosh.

296
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,534
Hey, just get this. The white one.

297
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,162
It's going to be see-through.
The models have been waxed.

298
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,538
-What do you know?
-Hey…

299
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,004
You guys go ahead.

300
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,881
Where are you going?

301
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,424
Somewhere.

302
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,931
SEOCHO 1-DONG COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTER

303
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,088
-Damn it.
-My goodness. You should take it slow.

304
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,091
I'm rushing things because I'm tired.

305
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,635
I can't take it slow.

306
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,555
Gosh, why am I so tired?

307
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,225
I mean, my blood pressure is normal.

308
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,436
Should I get a blood test?

309
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,855
What is wrong with me?

310
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,650
I'm short of breath
and I just feel so tired.

311
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,194
Maybe your bra is too small.

312
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,114
Actually…

313
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,200
all your clothes seem too tight.

314
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,663
When you put on weight,
you need to wear bigger clothes,

315
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,041
but many women insist
on wearing the same size.

316
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,878
You buy clothes in the same size, right?

317
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,923
I don't buy clothes.

318
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,093
How much weight have you gained?

319
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,472
I don't know. I don't weigh myself.

320
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,890
My goodness.

321
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,517
How could you not weigh yourself?

322
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,936
Don't you weigh yourself every morning?

323
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,565
-I don't do it either.
-Oh, my.

324
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,819
Why would I do that
every morning and ruin my day?

325
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,700
I just tell myself that today is the most
beautiful and thinnest I'll ever be.

326
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,173
Under Article 33 of the Statistics Act,

327
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,342
your information
will be kept confidential.

328
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,553
We'd appreciate it
if you can spare a moment of your time.

329
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,474
Let's continue the tourism survey
through the weekend,

330
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,559
and push the agents more.

331
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,104
-Yes, sir.
-And…

332
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,858
I usually buy ten lottery tickets a week
to give out to the staff,

333
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,570
but this week all ten of them are yours.

334
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,365
Gosh, that many?

335
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,035
You're finally giving me lottery tickets.

336
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,704
It must have been hard
to fight against your subconscious.

337
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,836
-I'll just take five.
-Come on.

338
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,213
I got them for you. Please take them all.

339
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,340
I'm never lucky with these things.

340
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,717
I don't want all of them to be a waste.

341
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,010
Just take them.

342
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,012
So it feels like a proper apology.

343
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,307
Apologize for what? It was subconscious.

344
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,728
-Come on now.
-All right, I'll stop.

345
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,396
Thank you.

346
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,360
I hope I win the jackpot
and pass out from the shock.

347
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:02,949
I'm so tired, but I can't even pass out
or get so much as a nosebleed.

348
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:06,494
I sound like I'm sleep-talking.
I'm so out of it.

349
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,122
I'm sorry. I just feel so weak.

350
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,041
I don't know why.
Maybe my period is coming--

351
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,377
God, what am I saying?

352
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,629
I'm sorry. I'm really out of it today.

353
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:22,010
Take a deep breath. Slowly. Come on.

354
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,976
Once more. Slowly.

355
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,399
When you're tired, take deep breaths.

356
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,401
It makes you feel a little better.

357
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,695
You feel better, right?

358
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:48,495
I want to shave off my hair. All of it.

359
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,833
I mean, my hair has never made me
look any better,

360
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,461
but I hold on to it
as if it's a symbol of my femininity.

361
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,715
I wash it and blow-dry it every morning
until my arms are tired.

362
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,303
It feels like I've been struggling
over something meaningless all my life.

363
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,223
If I shave it off,
I won't have any more false hopes,

364
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,183
and it'll make me feel that much lighter.

365
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,394
If I shave my head, will you fire me?

366
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,773
I thought you said
you'd love anyone this winter.

367
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,651
If you shave your head, no one will…

368
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,862
Well, not right now. In winter.

369
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,406
I'm going to do at least one of them.

370
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,743
I'm so tired that
I even find it annoying that I have hair.

371
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,203
Everything bothers me.

372
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:35,166
I wish I could take apart my arms, legs,
and head at night, clean them, oil them,

373
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,210
and put them back together in the morning.

374
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,631
That's the reason why

375
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,800
I never stop loving.

376
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,221
You never get tired
as long as you're in love.

377
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,186
I feel embarrassed.

378
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,523
I'm sorry.

379
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:30,013
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

380
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,604
I want to be pretty.

381
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:12,889
What's funny?

382
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,601
I just realized something strange.

383
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,729
When I think to myself,
I speak so politely.

384
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,441
Why is Hyeon-a late?

385
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,194
It's quite windy today.

386
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,947
Perhaps there's a storm coming.

387
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,450
You've found someone…

388
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,453
haven't you?

389
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,665
I haven't.

390
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,041
Yes, you have.

391
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,751
What do you want to eat?

392
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,670
Anything.

393
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:44,963
When is your vacation?

394
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,756
I haven't decided yet.

395
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,715
Why not?

396
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,300
I don't have anywhere to go.

397
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,552
I'll just save it for later.

398
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,013
All right. I'll join you then.

399
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,432
What about your part-time job?

400
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,350
I quit.

401
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,227
-Why?
-I got fired.

402
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,190
I fought with a customer.
He swore at me as soon as he sat down.

403
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,447
People who live in tall buildings
like that must be mentally strong.

404
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,785
They could end it all in one step,
but they don't.

405
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,249
Not because their lives are hard,
but in the spur of the moment.

406
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,126
They can end it when they feel like it.

407
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,005
That's why I still live in a basement.

408
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,299
Basements are much safer.

409
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,512
-You want more ketchup?
-Yes.

410
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,646
I know it's hard,
but don't think about moving out.

411
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,649
You'll enjoy it for a while,

412
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,776
but your life can become a mess
in an instant.

413
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,031
It's so cold. I feel like
my skull is going to crack open.

414
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,782
Turn it off then.

415
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,660
I can't find the remote control.

416
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,913
I can only turn it on and off.
The temperature is set at 18°C.

417
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,334
Clean your house. You'll find it then.

418
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:20,308
I left all my nice things
at that jerk's place.

419
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,437
All my pretty clothes are there too.

420
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,148
Go get them.

421
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,237
I don't know how to end it.

422
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,324
I haven't made up my mind yet.

423
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:48,795
We've already broken up dozens of times.

424
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,423
So why do I hit rock bottom
every time we break up?

425
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,052
And why does it always
feel like it's the first time?

426
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,681
Just stay with him then.

427
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,642
No.

428
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,062
There's no more love for me to give him.
I used it all up.

429
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,196
I'm just going to
keep wanting until the day I die.

430
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,284
"Love me."

431
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,953
"I'll love you back."

432
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,788
"Love me more."

433
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,124
"I'll love you more too."

434
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,293
"I don't need any presents

435
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,921
or surprise events."

436
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:37,426
"Just give me love.
I'm still hungry. Give me more."

437
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,764
Jeez, all the love in the world
wouldn't be enough for me.

438
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,354
Mi-jeong.

439
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,357
Don't ask for love like me.

440
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,114
You've found someone, right?

441
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:06,122
Just give him everything, okay?
Give him everything like a warrior.

442
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:09,208
Just set off an explosion with your love.

443
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:16,591
Never ask for love like me.

444
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,530
Yes, okay. I got it.

445
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,659
He's on his way now.

446
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,369
Let's hurry and finish cleaning.

447
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,370
-Okay!
-Okay!

448
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,747
I wish the president visited every day.

449
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,457
You've made the store so clean.

450
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,049
INCOMING CALL
STORE OWNER BYEON SANG-MI

451
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:01,904
Right.

452
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,572
Of course.

453
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,366
Yes, I know.

454
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,629
Leave him be. It's part of his job.

455
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,385
Okay, good night.

456
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,470
Hang in there.

457
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,222
Bye.

458
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,353
Damn, one hour and thirteen minutes?

459
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,464
Do you want seconds?

460
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,471
Look.

461
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,974
How long are you going to live?

462
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,611
How long are you going to live?

463
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,407
How would I know how long I'll live?

464
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,951
Kids your generation will live to 100.

465
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,330
That means you still have
60 to 70 more years to go.

466
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,290
What's your plan?

467
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,840
To live well.

468
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,179
What else can I do other than that?

469
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:53,808
How can you plan for 60 to 70 years?
Even the government can't do that.

470
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,770
Then are you going to live
all those years without a plan?

471
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,898
How can you possibly make plans
for that long in the future?

472
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,276
If I were to live 60 to 70 more years,
a lot of things could happen.

473
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,071
Why should I make plans
that may not even come true?

474
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:10,324
I hate it when people ask
children about their dreams.

475
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,701
What dreams?
Your CSAT score decides those.

476
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:16,038
You can't go
to med school with 320 points.

477
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,750
You're living like that
because you have no plan!

478
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,670
You're wasting your life
listening to some woman's grievances.

479
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,764
Why do you spend time
listening to someone else's grievances?

480
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:34,890
You call that work?

481
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:38,602
I have a colleague that's even worse.
She's not that bad compared to her.

482
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,691
Let's just eat.

483
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:54,118
You keep wasting time like that
because you have no plans.

484
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,334
Have you lived your life
the way you planned?

485
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:07,798
You have two daughters who only make you
worry and a son who never listens to you.

486
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:11,343
You have two jobs,
but you can't even afford your own car.

487
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,054
You have to work
without air-conditioning in summer.

488
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,765
Is this the kind of life
you planned for yourself?

489
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,312
Is it? Say something!

490
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,861
Damn it. I'm hungry.

491
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,696
I should've finished my meal.

492
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,073
Go back in and eat then.

493
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,035
Come with me.

494
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:37,786
I already ate.

495
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,038
Can't you eat more?

496
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,043
You always try to bring me home
when you're in trouble.

497
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:44,960
Go home, man.

498
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:46,962
Damn it.

499
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:55,971
The crystal bracelet
comes with a necklace and earrings.

500
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:59,517
This is an unbelievably good deal.

501
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,144
You can see the pattern engraved

502
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,230
even on the back.

503
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:10,653
An internationally renowned craftsman
affixed them one by one by hand.

504
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,821
No matter which direction
you look at it from,

505
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:16,200
it shines so beautifully.

506
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:20,538
Whenever you wear this bracelet,
I'm sure all eyes will be on you.

507
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,289
You will feel it.

508
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,834
And the surface that surrounds your wrist

509
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,878
is made of 14k gold.

510
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,755
-Three players were there.
-Yes.

511
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,008
I'd say it was a pretty good attempt,

512
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:36,470
but it would've been better
if he'd passed to another player.

513
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:41,350
Realistically speaking, it'll be hard
to turn the tables at this point.

514
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,518
That's right.

515
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,063
When we watch the match again…

516
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,820
KITCHEN SINKS, CLOSET
CUSTOM-DESIGNED FURNITURE

517
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:00,911
My gosh.

518
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,877
It's raining hard.

519
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,264
Should we cancel tonight?

520
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,600
MANAGER CHO TAE-HUN

521
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,938
It's our first gathering, so we should.

522
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,899
We shouldn't cancel our first meeting.

523
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:35,154
Right? Is it okay with you, Mi-jeong?

524
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,032
Yes, I'm up for it.

525
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,451
By the way,

526
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,287
we're a group of people
who want to be liberated,

527
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,998
so I think it should be
a comfortable gathering.

528
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,335
Can we meet somewhere
where we're not face-to-face?

529
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,345
Somehow, I feel uncomfortable
when I sit across from other people.

530
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,307
Sitting face-to-face…

531
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,644
feels a little aggressive.

532
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,064
I feel like I have to
fill the silences too.

533
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,568
Do you feel uncomfortable
sitting like this?

534
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:17,988
No.

535
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,574
It's nice and relaxing.

536
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,953
There's nothing to it.

537
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:29,166
To be liberated, I'll have to
quit my job and get a divorce.

538
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,047
I've done one of them,

539
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,301
but it didn't exactly liberate me.

540
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:41,845
I'm sorry.

541
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,350
There will be people
who frustrate you anywhere you go,

542
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,937
and those people will never change.

543
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,939
Then that means it's me who has to change.

544
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,526
but I don't want to
let go of this anger I feel.

545
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,029
My anger is perfectly reasonable.

546
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,198
It is all too reasonable.

547
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:05,536
It's so hard to suppress
this reasonable anger each time.

548
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:10,207
There are people who suck at their jobs
but don't want to be criticized.

549
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,626
They call me condescending
whenever I open my mouth.

550
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:16,296
So I tell myself to just hold it in.

551
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,967
You're doing a good job.

552
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:22,761
Does it show?

553
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,474
AMUR DERMATOLOGY CLINIC

554
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,936
Botox injections to the salivary glands
can make your jawline smoother.

555
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:35,107
The high-frequency mega-cell 500
will tighten your skin from the inside.

556
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:39,987
And for sunken eyes, you can rebuild
collagen using salmon DNA injections.

557
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:40,988
With these,

558
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:44,324
you can easily make yourself look
15 years younger without surgery.

559
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,536
By the way, do you usually speak
this quietly in a barbecue restaurant?

560
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:51,165
I've never seen people whispering
while drinking at a barbecue place.

561
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,292
Take a look.

562
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,253
-Oh, boy.
-Pretty bad, right?

563
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:59,423
But after the three treatments
I told you about…

564
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,675
AFTER TREATMENT

565
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:06,013
It's the same person, but doesn't she
look much younger and livelier?

566
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,641
You see, when you were little, and
someone told you to draw an old person,

567
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:12,394
you'd draw lines over here, right?

568
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,313
We're getting rid of those lines.

569
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,606
Like this.

570
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,524
CONSULTANT
CHO GYEONG-SEON

571
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:21,320
You don't have prominent lines
around your lips.

572
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,906
You'll look much younger by just
removing the lines under your eyes.

573
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,534
We recently treated a celebrity as well.

574
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,661
I see.

575
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,248
Excuse me.

576
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,500
Yes?

577
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,419
Did you go to Sanpo Girls' High School,
by any chance?

578
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:39,880
Yes.

579
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:44,927
Who…

580
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:47,930
"Yeom Gi-jeong."

581
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,558
-Wait, are you Yeom Gi-jeong?
-Yes.

582
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:55,479
Oh, my God. I do know Yeom Gi-jeong.
But who are you?

583
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:57,731
Right.

584
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,692
I think I saw you a few weeks ago.

585
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,944
Where?

586
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,695
At a barbecue restaurant in Gangnam.

587
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,240
What?

588
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,867
I think it was your niece's birthday.

589
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,036
That place?

590
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,956
Then you should've said hi.
Why didn't you?

591
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,457
What?

592
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,418
How did you recognize me right away?

593
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,128
Well…

594
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,842
I gave you a really good price.
Even I can't do it at that price.

595
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:31,139
-You never brought a friend from Sanpo.
-Yes, it's my first time meeting one.

596
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,350
We don't really talk about Sanpo.

597
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,769
It was a dark time
for me and my two siblings.

598
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,313
You know I have a younger brother, right?

599
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,273
Yes.

600
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,525
You remember a lot about me.

601
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,569
How do you even remember that?

602
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:48,782
She recognized me straight away
when she saw me on Yu-rim's birthday.

603
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,701
You should've said hi then.

604
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,202
Where in Sanpo do you live?

605
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,664
Near Dangmi Station, not in the new town.

606
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,291
Near that reservoir?

607
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,625
Yes.

608
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,044
Isn't there a famous sujebi place
around there?

609
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,297
Yes, there is.

610
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,174
Our aunt used to take us there sometimes.

611
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:07,801
Is it still there?

612
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:08,885
Yes.

613
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,846
I want to go back there sometime.

614
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,390
I think of their sujebi from time to time.

615
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,350
She called it dining-out,

616
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,603
but it was just boring old sujebi.

617
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,564
Still, we've gotten where we are
all thanks to Auntie.

618
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,483
Without her, we wouldn't have known
about the inheritance tax,

619
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,570
or how we were supposed to cough up
such a large sum of money.

620
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,240
We rented out
the apartment on the third floor,

621
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:34,161
paid the inheritance tax with that money,
and moved in with our aunt.

622
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:38,457
All our relatives tried to take
this building away from us, remember?

623
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,336
You should know
that auntie did her best to protect us.

624
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,920
Was that why the food was so horrible?

625
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,380
Her family ate the same food.

626
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,175
No, they'd always go out to eat
by themselves.

627
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,429
Now that I have
a niece of my own, I get it.

628
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:55,807
I find her so precious and adorable.
How could she treat us like that?

629
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,811
Yu-rim is little, but we weren't.

630
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,648
You think you'll still find her adorable
when she's older?

631
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,858
Yes. I'll find her adorable forever.

632
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,698
It looks like we have a similar skin type.
Those bruises won't go away quickly.

633
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,409
They will if you don't drink.

634
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,584
-Hi, Yu-rim!
-Hey.

635
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,088
Look at you. You're all wet.

636
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:30,217
Hey, this is my friend from high school.

637
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,513
She saw us at the barbecue restaurant
on Yu-rim's birthday.

638
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:44,690
Yu-rim, did you have dinner?

639
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,483
Aren't you hungry?

640
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:47,401
Yu-rim.

641
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,361
You'll have to excuse her. Puberty.

642
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,448
Kids grow up fast these days.

643
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,370
-Oh, welcome!
-Welcome!

644
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,287
Welcome.

645
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:23,687
Hey.

646
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,648
I'm sorry. I really am,

647
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,401
but he could never get married again.

648
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,903
Cho Gyeong-seon used to be delinquent.

649
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:35,657
Close siblings, one of whom
used to be delinquent? It's over.

650
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,118
No woman would want
to get in the middle of that.

651
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:41,037
I can see why he got divorced.
It's so obvious.

652
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,041
When it comes to marriage,
the three of us are much better.

653
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,586
We'd just ignore each other
outside of the house.

654
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,630
Three close siblings without parents?

655
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,799
No one wants that. Jeez.

656
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,261
Turn off the light.

657
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,474
Oh, hey. Watch him closely
and see if he disappears or not.

658
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,188
I should still get my share.

659
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,070
-Here.
-Oh, no. It's fine.

660
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,656
I told Gyeong-seon
that this one was on me.

661
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,575
Well…

662
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:21,411
Let her pay. I gave her a good price
for her wrinkle treatment.

663
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,123
She's right. Here you go.

664
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,001
You can just pay for the drinks then.

665
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,213
No, please ring up everything,
the bean sprouts and all.

666
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,340
I'll just ring up the drinks.

667
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,387
Please come again.

668
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,398
Here you go.

669
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,566
Thanks.

670
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,609
Thank you.

671
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:55,237
Here. It's a gift.

672
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,158
I'm really sorry about that day.

673
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,410
No. It's okay.

674
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,998
Just take them. Someone gave it to me,
but I'm never lucky with these.

675
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,170
If you win,
I'd suggest you go off the grid,

676
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,630
or else I'll mooch off you.

677
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:29,062
To you, the most important thing
is his attitude toward life.

678
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,064
You look at his core.

679
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:38,864
Have you gone mad?

680
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:43,994
He's Gyeong-seon's little brother.
He's a single father.

681
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,082
Please come again.

682
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:51,293
Come again.

683
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,382
Have you lost it?

684
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:59,926
Of course he'd say that.
He owns the place.

685
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,400
Mi-jeong, why did you think
of The Liberation Club?

686
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,740
My gosh.

687
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,496
People are scared
of thunder and lightning,

688
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:11,748
but strangely

689
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,125
I find them calming.

690
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,505
"The world might finally come to an end…

691
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,383
as I wished."

692
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,850
It feels like I'm stuck,
but I don't know how to get out.

693
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,270
That's probably why I hope
everything ends all at once.

694
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,316
"I'm not unhappy
but I'm not happy either."

695
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,362
"I wouldn't care if the world ended now."

696
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,253
"Everyone is on their way to their graves,

697
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,922
so why is everyone so happy and excited?"

698
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:08,722
Sometimes, I think
that people who are damaged

699
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:14,352
are much more honest
than those who live their lives happily.

700
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:54,851
Get inside!

701
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,438
Get inside now!

702
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,527
I said, get inside!

703
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:40,563
I don't know where I'm stuck
but I want to break free.

704
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:45,777
I wish I was genuinely happy

705
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,782
and be able to say things like,
"Yes, this is life."

706
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,118
"This is what life is all about."

707
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,537
I want to be able to say these things.

708
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,684
SANPO SINKS

709
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,020
You should go check on him.

710
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,398
Just let him rest.

711
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:27,819
Go check. Maybe he's hurt again
and can't move.

712
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:30,655
Come on.

713
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,202
PHARMACY

714
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,968
Do you want to go grab
a cold glass of beer?

715
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,487
Do what you can do standing up.
You'll hurt your back too.

716
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,407
This is farm work. There's nothing
you can do standing up.

717
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,113
Why didn't you just stay at home?
Your foot isn't healed yet.

718
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,935
Jeez. You should
cross the bridge over there.

719
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,270
No, it's faster that way.

720
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,855
It's faster this way.

721
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:36,025
Can't you eyeball that?
It's faster that way.

722
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,527
But…

723
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:46,619
Wait here.

724
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:50,957
I'll go.

725
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,132
Wait.

726
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,259
It's over there.

727
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,307
Where is he going?

728
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,150
By the way,

729
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:19,819
how did you end up moving here?

730
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,489
I said, get off!

731
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,913
You would've been in trouble
if you had kept going.

732
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:32,749
How did you know to run?

733
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,964
So worship me.

734
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:42,383
So that when spring comes,

735
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,343
you and I

736
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,554
will have become different people.

737
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:56,207
Are you sure?

738
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,668
That you and I

739
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:02,380
will have become
different people when spring comes?

740
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:05,675
I'm positive.

741
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,262
How do you worship someone?

742
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:11,806
You cheer them on.

743
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:15,017
You tell them they can do anything

744
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:17,854
and that everything is possible.

745
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:21,649
You cheer them on.

746
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,113
You used to be a national athlete, right?

747
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,115
Gu Jin-seok? Gu Ja-gyeong? Gu Chang-mo?

748
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:13,576
You hid this for a year?

749
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:16,495
I have nothing to say or hear from you.

750
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:22,126
If Gyeong-seon finds out about that,
you're done for.

751
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:23,961
I doubt he'll tell her.

752
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,671
His kid will.

753
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,341
It seemed like you'd text her right away.

754
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:29,842
Haven't you gotten over Ye-rim?

755
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,803
Did you have dinner?
What are you doing later?

756
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:34,847
Take this.

757
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,643
He always holds back.

758
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:43,022
Could I have
your youngest daughter's number?

759
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:50,279
