1
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,492
I'm on my way to church.

2
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,285
CHO TAE-HUN

3
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,372
Okay, have a nice time praying.

4
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,962
Sorry. It's always going
to be like this on Sundays.

5
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,341
It's okay.

6
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:36,429
I'm just happy to have someone
I can text on Sunday morning like this.

7
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,981
-See you later.
-See you.

8
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,613
Take it easy.

9
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,124
Can you wash these already?

10
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,551
Wash and hang the sneakers to dry
while the sun's strong.

11
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,762
-You told me to do the dishes.
-Are you still not done?

12
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,849
I should just break
these damn phones or something.

13
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,356
We used to have a goat.

14
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:30,900
Okay.

15
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,195
But you feel weirdly sorry
when you raise cows or goats

16
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,447
since you're going to eat them eventually.

17
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,035
Goats like humans.

18
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,996
It used to follow me around,

19
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,498
and it made me feel bad.

20
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,209
So?

21
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,795
Did you eat it?

22
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,881
The one that liked you?

23
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,385
We swapped goats with our neighbor.

24
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,100
We usually swap them before we eat them.

25
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,814
Do people have to go that far?
I'd rather just not eat it.

26
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,568
Would you throw them out, then?

27
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,447
Can't you just keep raising them?

28
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,658
You can't. They eat so much.

29
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,036
They eat nonstop
except when they're asleep.

30
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,622
Dad got too tired to get grass for it,
so we ate it.

31
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,128
How could you eat something
you had spent time with and given a name?

32
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,548
It didn't have a name.

33
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,638
We don't name the ones we're going to eat.

34
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,436
Hey.

35
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,732
Give me a name already, okay?

36
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,485
Give me a name so you can't eat me.

37
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,071
You're Mr. Gu.

38
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,799
Father. I loved today's sermon.

39
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,635
Thank you very much.

40
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,937
-Oh, Yu-rim's here.
-I'll be off then. See you.

41
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,938
Goodbye.

42
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,607
What do you want for lunch?

43
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,484
Sushi.

44
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:40,238
That's my Yu-rim. Excellent choice.

45
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,710
Put your coat on! The wind is strong.

46
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,379
Don't forget the kneepads.

47
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,215
I told you to come out,
but here you are, eating ramyeon…

48
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,300
Eat this.

49
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,970
It's the special, and there's uni, too.
Tae-hun bought it for you.

50
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,110
Watch out for cars.
And pick up a recorder for Yu-rim.

51
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,862
All right. Let's go.

52
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,823
Try it out at the shop first!
Don't just get anything.

53
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,033
I got it!

54
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,745
Son of a…

55
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,372
Bastard.

56
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,542
Doing anything you want
behind our backs, damn it.

57
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,794
Leave him be. Pretend not to know.

58
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,921
This isn't the time for him to be dating.

59
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,717
Then, what? Should we tell him to
not see anyone until Yu-rim grows up?

60
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,430
Gi-jeong is okay, all right?

61
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,223
She wouldn't give him a hard time.

62
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,934
Leave them be. Don't bother him.

63
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,938
Do you think Gi-jeong only wants
to date him? At her age?

64
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,611
The three of us can live together
if they get married.

65
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,447
Why do we have to sacrifice ourselves?

66
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,407
Then you can move out, too!

67
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,159
I can live with Yu-rim.

68
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,665
We've lived like
decent human beings all thanks to Yu-rim.

69
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,044
Without Yu-rim, we're nothing.

70
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,174
Thinking of them getting married
and taking Yu-rim away from us…

71
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,510
That makes me even sadder.

72
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,262
Life wouldn't be worth living.

73
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,897
Why did you fight with Auntie?

74
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,694
We didn't fight.

75
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,030
It's nothing.

76
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,619
Do you like that lady?

77
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,913
Auntie's friend.

78
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,210
I know it's very cliché,

79
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:02,130
but it's the only way
to put it now that I've experienced it.

80
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,636
I feel like I'm flying.

81
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,766
I don't think I've ever felt this light.

82
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,269
My brother tells me this all the time.

83
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,439
The people who don't know me
are the lucky ones.

84
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,649
Since I speak ill of everyone I know.

85
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:25,653
The moment you become someone I know,
I start speaking badly of you.

86
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:29,699
Even if everybody says you're all right,
I still do it somehow.

87
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,536
That must include us.

88
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,787
Many times for me.

89
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,081
Only sometimes for you.

90
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,082
Right…

91
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,835
But…

92
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,963
I don't feel like bad-mouthing anyone.

93
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,340
Since I've let go of that,

94
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,926
I feel lighter than ever before.

95
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,806
So that's how heavy hatred is.

96
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,476
I felt like something was
dragging me down to the ground.

97
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,395
But now, I feel like I can even fly.

98
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,983
I'm jealous. I guess
you'll be seeing him every day?

99
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,943
I can't see him often.

100
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,071
We're both so busy.

101
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,782
Still…

102
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,036
just the feeling of having someone

103
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,664
is enough for me.

104
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,296
I feel like I'm alone
even though I have someone.

105
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,717
And when you know
that you don't have anyone…

106
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,972
We broke up.

107
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,357
Bring me with you.

108
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,446
Where is it? Be honest.

109
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,864
I told you yesterday.

110
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,452
Did you have lunch?

111
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,037
Yes.

112
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:08,130
You've heard from your sister, right?

113
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,259
Yes.

114
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,561
Relax your right hand.

115
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,897
That's it.
Totally relax as it goes out, perfect.

116
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,817
Try pushing it through more smoothly.

117

SANPO KITCHEN SINKS, CLOSETS

00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,198
BATH HOUSE

119
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,326
It's 800.

120
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,578
"Eight hundred."

121
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,330
And 1,000.

122
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,126
Be sure to get half in advance.

123
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,420
For the cost of the wood.

124
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,756
That way, even if they cancel
after we've cut them, we won't lose money.

125
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,302
If they cancel after you cut everything,
you can't even use any of it.

126
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,054
And if possible,
don't take jobs from interior designers.

127
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,641
They always say they'll pay you
after getting money from the landlord.

130
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,385
Is this really the place?

131
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,601
Can I help you?

132
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,104
Goodness, nice to meet you.

133
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:51,567
Do you know where I can find
the people who work here?

134
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,216
These three siblings are all
so good-looking.

135
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,637
But it looks like none of them
have gotten married yet?

136
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,473
There aren't any wedding photos.

137
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,101
No, they haven't. I'm sick of them.

138
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,995
Here they are now.

139
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,398
Do we have a guest?

140
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,067
Hello.

141
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,193
Yes, hi. Who…

142
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,612
He says he's Mr. Gu's friend.

143
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,532
He couldn't reach him,
so he came to check on him.

144
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,742
-Goodness, is that so?
-It's nice to meet you.

145
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,286
-Nice to meet you, yes.
-Yes.

146
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,412
Nice to…

147
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,041
Please, have a seat. Please come.

148
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,420
God, I've been waiting for so long.
I'm so hungry!

149
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,549
Hurry up and sit.

150
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,102
I was worried he might get drunk and hurt…

151
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,021
Why didn't you answer my calls?

152
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,564
Jesus Christ.

153
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,109
I get why he wants to stay here, though.

154
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,069
I want to stay, too.

155
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,577
Well, I might be the older one,

156
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,787
but I can only make ends meet
thanks to him.

157
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,541
He's at the top, you know.
Everyone's beneath him.

158
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,212
You must be famished. Help yourself.

159
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,755
-Thanks.
-Please.

160
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,007
Yes, well, thank you for the food.

161
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,510
Let's see…

162
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,186
Let me offer you a drink. Honey.

163
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,395
I'm fine, thank you.

164
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:35,898
I brought my car.

165
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,858
Right…

166
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,487
-This is delicious.
-Please, help yourself.

167
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,334
What on earth are you doing here?

168
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,422
Is it fun? Living a lie?

169
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,760
Enough with the show, punk.

170
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,804
Carpentry just doesn't suit you.

171
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,976
Think about all the people
who rely on you, you bastard.

172
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,228
Our boys are all in ruin now.

173
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,814
Seung-jae works at the host bar.

174
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,733
Yeong-il works in a kitchen.
They're telling me to be a waiter!

175
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,988
We only used to be somebodies
because you were there with you.

176
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,866
Have we ever been capable
of doing anything by ourselves?

177
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,540
I'm sorry.

178
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,878
I'm depending too much on you
even though I'm older.

179
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:46,552
Hey, you should've come back
when Chairman Shin told you to.

180
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:50,097
Why did you make him upset?
He came all the way here for you!

181
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,435
Forget about Baek trying to kill you.

182
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,270
It'll be Chairman Shin now.

183
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,817
You have a girl here, don't you?

184
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,950
You do?

185
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,329
You do, you bastard.

186
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,212
Oh, my God.

187
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,632
Someone joined the Liberation Club.

188
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,051
Have a look, see who it is.

189
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,309
MY LIBERATION

190
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,894
SO HYANG-GI

191
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:06,025
Since I sat in on the meeting that day,
I've wanted to join all along.

192
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,820
I finally got up the courage to do it.

193
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,242
There are more than a few things
I want to be liberated from, but first…

194
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,163
This expression…

195
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,124
I can't stop making this expression.

196
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,212
When I see someone in front of me,

197
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,841
my face automatically makes
this expression.

198
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,927
Even though I'm not happy at all.

199
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,891
Well, I'd be lying
if I said I was unhappy,

200
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:43,812
but I'm not happy enough
to smile like this.

201
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,565
When I see someone,

202
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,360
I automatically make this expression.

203
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,321
So…

204
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,784
it's really difficult for me
to attend funerals.

205
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,582
Every time I go to a funeral,

206
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,877
I try to force myself
to put on a neutral expression…

207
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,383
but it's so hard.

208
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,515
Welcome.

209
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,102
First, let me tell you
the Liberation Club's rules--

210
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,520
Yes, I know.

211
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,648
"Do not give advice,
and do not try to comfort."

212
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,149
That's a sub-rule.

213
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,986
Go ahead and explain.

214
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,241
Since the purpose of this club
is to become happier,

215
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:41,745
we've made three tenets

216
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,039
in order to take
an honest look into our lives.

217
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,125
I see.

218
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,170
"One. I will not pretend to be happy."

219
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,382
All right.

220
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,218
It applies to me perfectly.

221
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,596
"I will not pretend to be happy."

222
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,684
"Two. I will not pretend to be unhappy."

223
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,732
"Three. I will be honest."

224
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,155
I wonder why…

225
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,700
I feel so afraid

226
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,119
of being honest?

227
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,165
Just be honest with yourself.

228
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,749
On the inside.

229
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,793
I see.

230
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,379
Gosh, that scared me.

231
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,090
I was so scared,
I almost quit immediately.

232
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,059
Shall I buy cheese or jerky?

233
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,228
I just bought both.

234
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,984
MR. GU
CALL

235
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,831
VILLAGE BUS STOP
SANPO

236
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,096
It's Yeom Mi-jeong!

237
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:35,192
I thought that lady was genuinely
a really happy person.

238
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,237
I guess everyone is just pretending.

239
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,199
Does anyone live without pretending?

240
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,244
Do you pretend, too?

241
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,038
All the time.

242
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:50,958
Don't you?

243
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,586
Of course I do.

244
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,588
I pretend to be easygoing.

245
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,886
If you think about it another way,

246
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,349
it's because everyone is pretending
that life on Earth flows so smoothly.

247
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,187
If I lived today
without pretending at all,

248
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,567
I would've killed and eaten someone.

249
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:28,036
It's weird, but when I see something cute,
I get the urge to squeeze it and eat it.

250
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,246
In one bite.

251
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,509
You just tell me anything you want now.

252
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,492
Ms. Jeong's dad is still better than her.

253
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,871
He's annoying, but he doesn't
turn you inside out or anything.

254
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,666
Ms. Jeong badmouths someone
I don't even know for an hour

255
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,128
and tells me that I'm like them,
after cursing them out for an hour.

256
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:23,717
Why does it feel like the effect
of the car is slowly wearing off?

257
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,597
In my opinion, getting a girlfriend
would be more effective.

258
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,892
I said get a girlfriend.
I didn't say get marriage.

259
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,977
What's wrong, married man?

260
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,316
I really love Sang-ji.

261
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,485
I love her like crazy. But…

262
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,820
It's hard.

263
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,614
Da-yeon!

264
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,032
It's been ages.

265
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,700
Did you just get off?

266
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,827
-Yes.
-I thought you said you couldn't come?

267
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:55,457
Well, I was going to go home
then heard Chang-hee was here.

268
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:08,553
Hey, what's wrong? She's being
very forward. Why are you ignoring it?

269
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,430
What do you mean, "forward"?

270
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,141
How much more obvious can it be?

271
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,356
What's with him?

272
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,737
When you're finally done
with your education, job-hunting,

273
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,697
having kids, and raising them,

274
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,741
you move on to their education,
job-hunting,

275
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,452
and raising children,
all over again, you know?

276
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,665
A man and woman meeting
and falling in love should be the end.

277
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,334
It should stop there.

278
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,671
But saying, "Let's not have kids,"

279
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:47,008
sounds super cold, like you're saying,
"I don't love you that much."

280
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,052
That's why people can't say it.

281
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,931
So they end up opening the door
to a lifetime of hardship

282
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,766
and cause another person

283
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,935
to suffer.

284
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,441
So, how do we explain nicely to women

285
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:08,029
that not wanting to
have children with them

286
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,450
doesn't mean you don't love them?

287
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,578
Chang-hee. How?

288
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,622
Did you understand?

289
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:27,465
Hey, you guys had this kind of vibe
last time, too. Are you still there?

290
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,260
What's going on with you two?

291
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,597
Should I

292
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,224
give you a ride home tonight?

293
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,110
Stop it.

294
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,281
Hey.

295
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:55,035
Hey, he's offering you a ride home.
You can't eat the squid…

296
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,122
Have some fruit, all right? It's sweet.

297
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,836
-Bye!
-Bye!

298
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,171
-Take care.
-Yes.

299
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,297
-See you.
-Go.

300
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,466
Gosh…

301
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,220
Hey!

302
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,512
Off you go.

303
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,431
Good luck.

304
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,024
Aren't they picking up?

305
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,613
Give me a sec. Stay here.

306
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,826
Excuse me, is the owner
of car number 6145 here?

307
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,705
Is the owner of car number 6145 here?

308
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,442
I'm sorry.

309
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,154
What for? You can just
give me a ride next time.

310
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,910
It's here.

311
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,454
-I'll see you, then.
-Yes.

312
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,833
Don't fight with them.

313
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,085
Get home safe.

314
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,005
Good night.

315
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,798
Good night.

316
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,485
Excuse me

317
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,362
Yes?

318
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,490
How could you not answer your phone
after parking like this?

319
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,160
But I didn't get any calls.

320
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,579
What do you mean?
I called you so many times.

321
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,497
I didn't receive any.

322
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,958
Look. I didn't.

323
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,295
Look at this. See how many times
I called you.

324
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,717
You've got the number wrong.

325
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,886
It's eight, not zero.

326
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,227
And you must've kept pressing redial.

327
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,147
Why would I not answer my phone
when I parked my car here?

328
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,401
I thought it was odd that no one
asked me to move my car.

329
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,487
Then…

330
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,864
you should have come check.

331
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,348
"How to date
a woman who lives in Gyeonggi."

332
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,975
Never give me a ride home.

333
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,062
It will take forever for you to get back.

334
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,356
You'll think you won't do it ever again.

335
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:15,068
But if you do it once
and never do it again,

336
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:19,280
it'll feel like I did something wrong
and I'll feel sad.

337
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,783
So, just never give me a ride
from the beginning.

338
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,747
When someone offers sometimes,
I say no and run away.

339
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:32,419
Even when the subway has closed,
I say it's still running and run away.

340
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:38,675
All right.

341
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:44,848
Now, please teach me
how to date a guy who has a child.

342
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,692
It's okay. I should know.

343
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,826
On holidays like Christmas
and New Year's Day,

344
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,079
we won't be able to spend time together.

345
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,375
Right.

346
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:17,422
Since you have to be alone
on the days you should spend time

347
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,340
with the person you like,

348
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,385
you'll become dispirited.

349
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,099
I get what you're trying to say.

350
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,813
Well, I'm not really the type
to place a lot of importance

351
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,940
on days like Valentine's Day or whatever.

352
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,402
And what else?

353
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,906
Well, the other things are

354
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,700
just things that you would expect.

355
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,744
I'll be busy,

356
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,497
many unexpected things will crop up,

357
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,167
and I might even cancel
our plans sometimes.

358
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,755
Don't hesitate for even a second,
and just call me right away

359
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,883
and cancel them. No apologies.

360
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,890
Do you like that lady?

361
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,851
Auntie's friend.

362
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,648
Why do you like her?

363
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,033
She lets me…

364
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,328
relax.

365
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,872
Catch your breath, just for a minute.

366
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,253
I don't have to be

367
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,673
super energetic and fun.

368
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,802
That's why.

369
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:56,646
You know that I'm…

370
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,440
not that fun.

371
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,696
That's good.

372
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,501
I'll give you a ride today.

373
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,004
It's fine, I told you earlier.

374
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,505
I'm okay. I'll be off, then.

375
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,799
I really want to give you a ride.

376
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,717
Get in, please.

377
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,385
I can just take the train.

378
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,804
Why would you drive that far?
I'm off, all right?

379
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,723
Really, I want to give you a ride.

380
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,684
No! You should go home.
I'll see you. Good night.

381
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,859
You idiot.

382
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,862
Where else are you going to kiss him?

383
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,448
Damn it.

384
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,242
He probably meant to kiss me tonight.

385
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,718
Let's sleep together next time!

386
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,824
ALPHA RETAIL

387
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:46,589
I mean, why does an HQ employee
have to apologize for this?

388
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,258
Did I sigh?
It was the store owner who sighed.

389
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:52,095
I mean, I'm so busy right now.

390
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,348
It's annoying enough that this crazy guy
paid for a pack of cigarettes

391
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,683
with 10 and 100 won coins.

392
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,850
But the store owner

393
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,104
counted all the coins and sighed
while other customers watched.

394
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,564
Isn't that also being an asshole?
At that busy time?

395
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,067
Seriously.

396
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,527
God damn it!

397
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,030
Why does he want
to get an apology from me?

398
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,117
I have nothing to do with it!

399
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,576
That's enough.

400
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,620
I mean, think about it.

401
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,289
Why do we have to
apologize for things that happen

402
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,417
between the store owner and a customer?

403
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,043
Don't you agree, Mr. Yeom?

404
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,547
Chang-hee! Let's go for a drive
together later, all right?

405
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,383
I need to visit the Gangdong branch later.
Is that okay?

406
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,219
Seriously.

407
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,365
-What about that place yesterday?
-I said it wasn't there.

408
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,701
There was a car blocking this car.

409
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,371
-Hello, yes, hi.
-Here.

410
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,248
This is my colleague's car…

411
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,083
Looks like you've made it big.

412
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,835
No. Just take a look.

413
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,963
Oh, dear.

414
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,590
Oh, dear.

415
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,678
When did it happen?

416
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,472
He doesn't know.

417
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,141
He says it was like this
when he came to work today.

418
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,269
And the car dashcam
doesn't have a memory chip in it.

419
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,107
Wouldn't this kind of car
have more than just a dashcam?

420
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,817
Of course not.

421
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,946
From the location of the scratch,
it must have been a sedan…

422
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,823
And it's silver.

423
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:45,083
First, you need to remember
the places you parked in

424
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,085
and go through the CCTV footage.

425
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,879
If you report it to the police,
they'll show you.

426
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,256
There's one place I'm thinking of.

427
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,467
The place we parked yesterday afternoon.

428
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,594
But they don't have any CCTV.

429
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,138
Gosh, you guys just have no luck.

430
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,186
Then what do we do?

431
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,104
Right.

432
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,731
We need to ask people
who parked there yesterday

433
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,400
if we could see their dashcam footage.

434
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,069
How will we find those people?

435
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,905
So, you need to go there right now

436
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:19,617
and ask all the people
who have parked there one by one.

437
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,662
"Did you park your car here
yesterday afternoon too?"

438
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:26,541
And if you find anyone, then you
should ask them to show you the footage.

439
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,545
You'll have to hurry up.

440
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,463
Dashcam footage only lasts for one day.

441
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,381
One day?

442
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,268
Aren't you supposed to look around
the car every time you get in and out?

443
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,477
It's a luxury car.

444
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,604
I did, at first!

445
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,110
The company is holding a design contest.

446
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:58,239
The winner should come from
the design department, shouldn't it?

447
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:02,660
I'll be really embarrassed if
another department wins it this time, too.

448
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,287
Kim Ji-hui.

449
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,372
Yes, sir.

450
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,707
Han Su-jin.

451
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,333
Yes, sir.

452
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,127
Pay extra attention to it.

453
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,880
Show me what you're made of.

454
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:18,843
The prize money and evaluation merits
are worth putting in the effort for, no?

455
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,109
What an asshole. Leaving out us temps…

456
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:39,113
Mi-jeong, you should win it
and get a permanent position.

457
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,491
Don't you have to leave the company
if you don't get it this year?

458
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,661
They wouldn't fire an employee
who's won the design contest.

459
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,458
You should pull all-nighters to win.

460
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,418
And I'll win next year.

461
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:29,914
Gosh. Goodness me.

462
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,458
-What is it now?
-Gosh.

463
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,803
HYE-SUK

464
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,682
Gosh, he left his phone at home!

465
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,101
Call Chang-hee and ask him where he is.

466
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,103
Tell him to pick up some dried pollack.

467
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,400
BRUSH PEN

468
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,859
Yes, thank you.

469
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,281
WHOLESALE STATIONERY

470
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,743
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO REPLACE
THE BUMPER OF A ROLLS GHOST?

471
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,121
AROUND 20-30 MILLION WON.

472
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:43,506
WE PREPARED THIS PLACE
FOR YOUR SPIRIT, FATHER.

473
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,326
Tell Mr. Gu to come over and have a drink.

474
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,298
How much did you pay to rent that car?

475
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:35,391
The car in front of Du-hwan's café.
How much did you pay to rent it?

476
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,603
What do you mean "rent"?

477
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,523
I didn't lease it. It's a friend's.

478
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,400
Which friend?

479
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,155
Do you know all of my friends, Dad?
Just one of them.

480
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,033
Which friend?

481
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,087
Gu.

482
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,305
That's right, Gu's superrich.

483
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:18,017
He lent it to me to drive around.

484
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,611
Mi-jeong's so lucky, Dad.
She's hit the jackpot.

485
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,879
Don’t drive other people's cars.

486
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:59,308
We eat with him under one roof.
Isn't he practically family?

487
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,019
I'll never drive a car like that again.

488
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,104
Can't I just enjoy this moment?

489
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,567
It's like you hate that I'm happy.

490
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,694
Why would you drive someone else's car?

491
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,780
Such an expensive car, at that.

492
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:25,292
Just say, "I understand,"
and drive it in secret, you dumbass.

493
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,546
Mr. Gu is on his way, stop it.

494
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,048
Mr. Gu is coming.

495
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,846
Come have a seat, all right?

496
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,190
Here.

497
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,314
What are you doing?

498
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,357
What?

499
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,109
I'll eat somewhere else.

500
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,069
Just eat here.

501
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,769
Stop trying to fix it on your own.

502
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,103
Just tell him the truth.

503
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,025
Just tell Mr. Gu the truth
and get hit a few times.

504
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,276
And use the insurance.

505
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,363
He definitely has insurance
on the car. I'm sure.

506
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,031
He owns it, doesn't he?

507
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:16,880
Hello…

508
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,190
What would be better?

509
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,610
Would it be better to just get o
n my knees here and spare Gu the trouble?

510
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:23,614
Or should I make him
too exhausted to even hit me?

511
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,410
But would he ever
get too exhausted to hit me?

512
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:54,019
You are like…

513
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,562
Stop! I'm the only one
who needs to understand me.

514
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,439
You don't need to act like you know me.

515
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,987
You're rough and transparent.

516
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,906
You're crazy.

517
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,576
You're transparent.

518
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,460
Mr. Gu!

519
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,254
Mr. Gu!

520
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,798
Here.

521
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,604
Hey, Chang-hee! Here!

522
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,904
Nothing goes my way.

523
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:50,617
I once read a book about how to
be a good writer to become a writer,

524
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,703
and it said that a good drama is

525
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:55,581
one where the main character
tries hard to achieve something

526
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,498
but can't do it.

527
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,458
So I gave up.

528
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:02,087
Why would I write something
that's like life? It's so boring.

529
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,603
He says he wants to meet you.

530
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,981
Since I told him about you all the time.

531
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,083
Look who's here.

532
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:33,632
You came all the way here?
What's gotten into you?

533
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,641
When I was running the club,

534
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,562
we had this guy who was super unpopular.

535
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,192
I got why he was unpopular, that punk.

536
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,153
He had no charm.

537
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,616
I mean, everyone has

538
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,036
their own charm.

539
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,876
He would lie or brag all the time.

540
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,962
So I really laid into him.

541
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:17,384
I wondered if he would have quit,
but he still works in this field.

542
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,763
So I thought, "How the hell
did that asshole survive?"

543
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,808
It turned out he became a dealer.

544
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,361
He sells drugs.

545
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,285
And I saw him
at Baek's place a few days ago.

546
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,130
Baek, that bastard is selling drugs.

547
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,638
I'll attack Baek then!

548
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,682
I'm going to trust you, okay?

549
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,103
I'm telling Chairman Shin
that you're coming back!

550
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,713
Now I can understand her.

551
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,551
What do you mean?

552
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,179
He's not in the office.

553
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:27,681
Of course not. I told you.

554
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,145
Hey, block the exits
and search in groups of two!

555
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,605
-Yes, sir!
-Let's go.

556
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:55,667
You bastard.
So are you going to come up here?

557
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,877
Get up here and try me, you bastard!

558
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,089
This is why I don't trust bastards
who worked in host bars.

559
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:04,259
You bastards don't know how to play fair.

560
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:07,220
You acted like you would
come fight me in person.

561
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:09,055
But you just ratted me out.

562
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,725
You just wait there for me,
you son of a bitch.

563
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,393
I'll go to Sanpo right now.

564
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,152
I've decided to leave.

565
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,033
Where will you go?

566
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,329
To Seoul.

567
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,210
Why all of a sudden?

568
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,674
It just happened.

569
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,640
SANPO SINKS, CLOSETS
CUSTOM-DESIGNED FURNITURE

570
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,315
I'll call you sometimes.

571
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:08,610
Let's meet once a month,
or once every two months.

572
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,031
What for?

573
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,664
I want to live a clear-cut life.

574
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,710
I'm sure you roughly know

575
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,254
what kind of life I led until now.

576
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,799
This world is this world,

577
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,928
and that world is that world.

578
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,307
I told you, I don't care
what kind of life you've led.

579
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,809
You don't care what kind of life I've led?

580
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,814
What about the kind of life I'll live?

581
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,695
I'm just fine

582
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,281
with my life.

583
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,501
Curse me out if you want.

584
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,712
Don't regret it later.

585
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:19,764
Go ahead.

586
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,939
Aren't you angry?

587
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,194
I'm…

588
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,281
You're what?

589
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:39,617
Say it.

590
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,413
I'm…

591
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,709
not angry.

592
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,755
I'm quitting and leaving,
but you're not angry?

593
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,552
You want to go back.

594
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,097
You want to leave,

595
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,393
and I could tell you not to…

596
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,148
or I could ask you to stay longer.

597
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,489
I'm just sad.

598
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,576
But I'm not angry.

599
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,580
I don't know, I might be angry later.

600
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,056
You too.

601
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,435
Live in Seoul if possible, all right?

602
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,147
Like an ordinary person.

603
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,566
Surrounded by people.

604
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,194
I'm ordinary now, too.

605
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:57,945
Exhaustingly ordinary.

606
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,280
Being ordinary…

607
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,369
is when you have common desires.

608
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,705
That's when you can say you're ordinary.

609
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,291
Not "worship" or "liberation."

610
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,335
The desires that everyone else has.

611
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:17,423
As your brother said, like the women
who have the strollers they want.

612
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,719
I'm going to carry my kid.

613
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,059
I want to carry you.

614
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,395
I want to carry you

615
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,939
at one year old.

616
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,902
That's why you live like this.

617
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,030
I'm going to live like this.

618
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,202
I'm just going to live like this.

619
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:56,045
I'm going to call.

620
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,881
Even if you answer grumpily.

621
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:05,680
But not often.

622
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,907
SANPO SINKS

623
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:41,257
If you ever change your mind,
you're always welcome here.

624
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,137
2019 MONTHLY SCHEDULE

625
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,361
SANPO CITY
OFFICIAL DUTIES

626
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:49,534
What's wrong?

627
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,540
Hello.

628
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:58,584
This is Officer Yeo Min-gu.
Please send an ambulance.

629
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,051
Shit.

630
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:38,332
The number you have dialed
is not in the directory.

631
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,376
Check the number and please try again.

632
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,883
Did you miss me?

633
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:13,678
You, punk.

634
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,973
Watch your expression
in front of the boys.

635
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,308
Why?

636
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,018
Did someone die?

637
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:26,148
Someone did.

638
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:28,818
Someone did die.

639
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,100
Me…

640
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:06,731
I'm the kind of person
who's happy when someone dies.

641
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:09,608
You know?

642
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,587
"I will not pretend to be happy."

643
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,048
"I will not pretend to be unhappy."

644
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:35,009
"I will be honest."

645
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:40,264
I hoped every man
who ever left me would be unhappy.

646
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:44,852
As if I wanted all the people who
saw how small I was

647
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:46,395
to disappear from this world,

648
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,522
I hoped they would die.

649
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:53,027
For you, I'm going to hope
that you never even catch a cold.

650
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:57,573
I'm going to hope that you don't suffer
a single day of being hungover.

651
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,964
He ran because he was
afraid of being happy.

652
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:58,300
Why did he leave in such a hurry?
He should've said goodbye.

653
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:00,845
We're just dating.

654
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:03,222
I'll just stop by and take a look.

655
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,432
Don't let Hyeon-a go.

656
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:06,851
It's not like we dated.

657
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:09,478
She talks about you all the time.

658
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,605
-Bastard.
-He's afraid

659
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:13,566
that you might win the contest.

660
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:17,236
Yeom Mi-jeong is moving in
for the final blow.

661
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:20,322
I want to be in a really good mood,

662
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,908
but I have no idea what I should do.

663
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,785
Come for me.

664
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,830
Yeom Mi-jeong!

665
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:35,754
