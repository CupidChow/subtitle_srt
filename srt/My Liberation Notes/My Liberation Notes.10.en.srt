1
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,917
Damn it. It's not just us
who's been taking money on the side.

2
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,921
He's raked in even more dough than us.

3
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,257
He must want to get rid of us
and keep it all to himself.

4
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,051
Chairman Shin must know that. So why?

5
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,928
Why do you think he's doing nothing?

6
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,933
Have it your way.

7
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,103
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,817
I'm sure he's waiting.

9
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:54,489
He's waiting for us to take down Baek.

10
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,282
Listen, Ja-gyeong.

11
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,535
Let's get him.

12
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,620
Come on, we can take him down together.

13
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,373
Listen.

14
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,043
I'm…

15
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,090
completely exhausted.

16
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:31,401
SUPERMARKET

17
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,200
It's just what you say when you want
to end it with a woman, isn't it?

18
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,120
"The woman I used to live with died."

19
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,289
"Because of me."

20
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:13,753
No! Go away!

21
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,383
You damn mutts!

22
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,638
Go! Go away! Go! I said, go!

23
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,098
Hey!

24
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,855
Hey! Get lost! Go!

25
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,983
Goddamn mutts.

26
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,993
I told you, they're wild dogs.

27
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,153
You keep making things worse.

28
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,870
Today, I'll get my arm bit off,
and tomorrow, a broken nose.

29
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,206
Misfortunes should come in small doses,

30
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,542
but you keep stopping them
and making them bigger.

31
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,882
I'm scared every time you stop them.

32
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,677
"Now it's gotten even bigger."

33
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,221
"How bad is it going to be?"

34
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,450
You…

35
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,578
have to kill your instincts.

36
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,291
You have to go to the city and numb them.

37
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,420
So that instead of talking
about frogs being crushed to death,

38
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,174
you have to be able
to sincerely talk about superficial stuff

39
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,927
like other women do.

40
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,679
Until you get sick of it.

41
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,558
Until you're sick to death of men.

42
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,897
Women with sharp instincts can be scary.

43
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,073
You…

44
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:53,913
scare me.

45
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,552
As long as you live in a place like this…

46
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,639
you won't be able to kill your instincts.

47
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,699
Gosh, I see you've had a lot to drink.

48
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:29,133
I should take a picture of us
being so chummy.

49
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,021
Gu.

50
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,148
Now we can say

51
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,984
we've watched the stars together.

52
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,280
Get up.

53
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,998
SANPO SINKS

54
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,388
ALPHA RETAIL

55
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,681
Is this Sanpo City Hall?

56
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,349
Good afternoon.

57
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,060
I live at 748-6, Gondal-dong.

58
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,146
There are dangerous dogs
on the way to Gondal Reservoir.

59
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,148
The new product orientation
will begin now!

60
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,735
Yes, on the way to Gondal Reservoir.

61
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,988
Yes, all right.

62
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,489
-Yes, thank you.
-Sir.

63
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,949
Yes, let's go.

64
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,746
Since we have new employees,

65
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,207
why don't we move around
the assistant managers?

66
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:49,005
I think Jeong A-reum and Yeom Chang-hee
on my team should be separated.

67
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:49,964
Why?

68
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,800
Are they on bad terms?

69
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:58,556
Well, Yeom is
in charge of A-reum's father's store,

70
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,684
and both of them failed to get promoted
for the second time.

71
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,937
I'm afraid things will only get worse.

72
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,898
But who'd take A-reum? I'd take Yeom.

73
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,484
Yes, I'd take Yeom too.

74
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,699
Let me introduce our main product
for the second half.

75
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,118
As you know, retro is trending right now.

76
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,495
So we've given our liquor a retro style.

77
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,873
It's a collaboration with Jingwang Liquor.

78
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,375
It's 16,9 percent alcohol
and goes down nicely

79
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,710
with a refreshing taste.

80
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,962
Sujak, a masterpiece in the world of soju.

81
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,381
From the first scent to the aftertaste.

82
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,175
SUJAK

83
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:38,846
What?

84
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,484
You can all take a bottle with you.

85
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:52,985
Excuse me.

86
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,112
Can I take two?

87
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,698
Why can't you catch them?

88
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,534
Those dogs run off to the mountains
when they see us.

89
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,829
They recognize the ambulance and our car.

90
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,999
They're in the middle of the field
so they can run away easily.

91
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,669
Well, can't you use the tranquilizer gun?

92
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,422
We have to get close to them for that.
We can't shoot at them from that far.

93
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,760
But what's the point of setting the traps?
They won't go in.

94
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,805
They won't even go near them.
They're in the field during the day.

95
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,849
But at night, they roam
around the village looking for food.

96
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,560
When I see those glowing eyes in the dark…

97
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,855
Gosh. They look like wolves, you know.

98
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,734
My kids might run into them at night.
That's what I'm most afraid of.

99
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,446
Well, we'll wait for a week. If the traps
don't work, we'll call a specialist.

100
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,323
Please check the traps periodically.

101
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,866
I'm telling you, they won't.

102
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,451
Thanks anyway.

103
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,120
-Sure, have a good day.
-Goodbye.

104
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,375
SANPO SINKS

105
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,824
Damn it. He saw me.

106
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,682
Just stop by for a second.
I have something to give you.

107
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,311
At what time?

108
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,150
-Hey.
-Yes?

109
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,902
-Go sit next to A-reum.
-Yes, sir.

110
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,503
What do I do?

111
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,841
What? Is this your seat?

112
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,801
No, it's fine.

113
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,398
All right, everyone. Fill your glasses.

114
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,400
Here.

115
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,443
Cheers.

116
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,028
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

117
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,538
It looks great.

118
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,628
Who wraps it in dried laver these days?
How tacky.

119
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,799
Put it away.

120
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,176
Just eat it the way you want.

121
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,596
Clearly, you haven't had
high-quality tuna before.

122
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,099
This isn't exactly high-quality either.

123
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,433
Go on and eat.

124
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,484
What's the best way to enjoy it then?

125
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,030
Look at the meat. It's fatty.

126
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,575
This type of meat

127
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,703
tastes best
with just a little bit of wasabi.

128
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,998
Just a little bit of wasabi.

129
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,606
I said I'd treat you to a nice meal,
but you want cold noodles?

130
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,774
Let's eat something else.
I have enough money.

131
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,068
That's what I want to eat.

132
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,321
We'll have some sushi too then.

133
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,495
Why do you keep glancing at me?
Do you think he beat me?

134
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,165
Here, look. It's just fashion.

135
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,092
I had a big fight with that jerk
at his place before.

136
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,304
That asshole is so cheap.
He was all furious, but I could see

137
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,723
that he was throwing only the cheap stuff.

138
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,643
Things like mug cups
that cost 1,000 or 2,000 won.

139
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,312
Then he comes
and trashes my place like that.

140
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,564
He completely ruined my wallpaper.

141
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,317
The most expensive thing
in my house is the wallpaper.

142
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,111
If it gets dirty, I have to pay
500,000 won when I move out.

143
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,738
It's 500,000 won.

144
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,949
Hey jerk, you better wire me the money.

145
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,952
You'd better. Before I sue you.

146
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,580
So how would you score this guy?

147
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,169
About 15 points?

148
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,671
He wasn't bad.

149
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,050
But I think 15 is too generous.

150
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,219
He's violent and he cheated on you.

151
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,472
Well…

152
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,516
He didn't make excuses.

153
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,018
When he cheated and got caught,

154
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,437
he panicked for a second
and apologized right away.

155
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,525
It's like he becomes stupid
when he gets caught doing something bad.

156
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,694
Like a puppy that made a mess.

157
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,197
There are a lot of crazy jerks
who do bad things

158
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,532
and blame you for it.

159
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,246
So, Mi-jeong,

160
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,331
What's your boyfriend's score?

161
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,629
I guess he's at least above 15
since he doesn't make excuses either.

162
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:47,965
And?

163
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,389
And? What else?

164
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,602
You'll be surprised if you see him.

165
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,271
You might think he's homeless.

166
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,566
He must be one hell of a guy.

167
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,788
Am I scary?

168
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,794
He says I scare him.

169
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,050
I guess you see right through him.

170
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,763
Just tell him to grovel.

171
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,932
You should grovel when you're scared.

172
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,144
But they always want to run away.

173
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,774
He does have some problems.

174
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,574
Since when did we care about that?

175
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,951
Even with the same person,

176
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,747
you can name a thousand reasons
to love them,

177
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,250
and a thousand reasons not to.

178
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,795
Look at Chang-hee.

179
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,423
He hates Jeong A-reum so much,
even for wearing circle lenses.

180
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,966
I wear them too, you know.

181
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:19,598
Wearing circle lenses could be
one of the thousand reasons to love me

182
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,685
and one of the thousand reasons
to hate Jeong A-reum.

183
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,897
There's no reason.

184
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,233
You just love

185
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,819
or hate someone because you want to.

186
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,625
Hey.

187
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,545
Here, it's alcohol.

188
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,964
It's really good.

189
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,633
I want to give it to Gu,
but I'm going to be late tonight.

190
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,097
Make sure to tell him it's from me!

191
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,986
My sister is on her way home.
I'll have to take the train.

192
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,907
Why don't you go home
with your brother then?

193
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,869
I don't take a cab
with that brat alone. It's gross.

194
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,831
Why do you always call it the train,
Ms. Yeom?

195
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,252
Like an old person.

196
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,465
What else should I call it then?

197
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,344
Doesn't everyone call it the subway?

198
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,096
It doesn't run underground in Gyeonggi.

199
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,974
Why would they dig up the ground?
The land is mostly empty.

200
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,727
Don't make it so obvious
you live in Gyeonggi.

201
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,729
Just call it the subway.

202
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,399
I do live in Gyeonggi.

203
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,163
Hello?

204
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,750
What are you up to? Are you off work?

205
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,044
Yes.

206
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,129
Are you on your way home?

207
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,465
No, I'm having a drink with my colleagues.

208
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,467
Where?

209
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,844
It's close by.

210
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,305
Want some octopus? You like octopus.

211
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,601
She's the one who wants it. She's just
trying to use someone else as an excuse.

212
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,727
Don't you?

213
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,606
Just tell them you're leaving
and join us here. It's fresh.

214
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,691
Tae-hun owes you a meal anyway, right?

215
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,280
Come on. My sister
cooks octopus very well.

216
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,867
Come and let's enjoy
its sweetness together.

217
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,582
Start cooking. Gi-jeong says she'll come.
And he'll pay.

218
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,336
I was going to take her
to a nice place, not here.

219
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,422
Octopus is more than
what she deserves for what she did.

220
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,008
She just picked up a record for you.

221
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,178
This is his treat.

222
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,730
I'm just trying to get your sales up.

223
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,328
What's the matter?

224
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,207
I've just been invited over for a meal.

225
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,750
By that guy?

226
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,714
No.

227
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,426
By my friend, his sister.

228
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:48,265
She called and said he'd buy me
the meal he said he would tonight.

229
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,727
I'm not sure if I should go or not.

230
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,573
Hello?

231
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,577
Gyeong-seon called you without asking me

232
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,331
because she wants to eat octopus.

233
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,583
So don't worry about it.

234
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,842
Should I not come then?

235
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,680
I just thought it was rude
to invite you so abruptly.

236
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,058
I wanted to take you to a nice place.

237
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,351
I mean, it's my place, so…

238
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,898
You mean, your home upstairs?

239
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,399
No.

240
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,443
My sister's bar.

241
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,074
Well, I don't mind.

242
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,164
I have to go. Bye.

243
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,546
It's close to here, right?

244
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,549
Yes. It's behind the food alley,
three minutes away.

245
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,886
Oh, Gosh. Three minutes.
It's so close. I'm nervous.

246
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,348
Don't rush. Take your time.

247
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,522
I'm about to cross another mountain now.

248
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,483
My first encounter with the guy
who rejected me.

249
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,859
You can do this.

250
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,361
I can do this.

251
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,008
I don't like that lady.

252
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,761
Why not? She's my friend.

253
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,642
Is that why you don't like her?

254
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,001
Welcome.

255
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,511
Hello.

256
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,897
You're here.

257
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,024
Hello.

258
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,777
Sit, you came on a good day since there
are no customers. Let's have a drink.

259
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,070
Sure.

260
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,578
Please have a seat.

261
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,330
Okay.

262
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,503
Where's Gyeong-seon?

263
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,423
She'll be down soon.

264
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,758
I see.

265
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,261
Did you have dinner?

266
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,764
Yes.

267
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,311
What would you like to drink?

268
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,480
Beer.

269
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,191
And a bottle of soju, please.

270
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,277
-You want to mix them?
-Yes.

271
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,029
Sure.

272
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,293
I wanted to take you to a nice place.

273
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,171
This place is nice too.

274
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,341
I also like octopus.

275
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,192
All right.

276
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,195
Should I mix them for you?

277
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,032
-Sure.
-Right.

278
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,511
I get tipsy really quickly, you know.

279
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:41,016
So when I drink soju bombs,
I get all hyped up in ten minutes.

280
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:53,445
I really was going
to take you to a nice place.

281
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,240
This place is nice, really.

282
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,541
Bottoms up?

283
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:07,959
Okay.

284
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:24,142
In exactly ten minutes,
I'll be all hyped up and chatty.

285
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,103
Ten minutes?

286
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,482
Well, that is fast.

287
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,659
Thank you.

288
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,749
I mean it.

289
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,213
I tried to cross a mountain.

290
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,010
Thanks to you, I was able to cross it.

291
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,309
I mean, there was
this mountain in front of me.

292
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,105
And crossing it

293
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,358
has given me courage.

294
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,947
Now I want to face
the mountains one by one

295
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,491
instead of avoiding them.

296
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,452
So today…

297
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:31,459
I came here
to get over the embarrassment--

298
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,294
Why are you embarrassed?

299
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,631
I'm treating you
to thank you for the favor.

300
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,261
Thank you

301
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,221
for coming.

302
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:10,248
All right. I've had two soju bombs.
I'll become really energized now.

303
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,364
It's from my brother.

304
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,793
It's not some excuse I made up.

305
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,045
He really asked me.

306
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,131
I know.

307
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,675
He texted me.

308
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,400
Don't you have anything to say?

309
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,324
That's a surprise.

310
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,453
You just sounded
like one of those dull women.

311
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,250
What?

312
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,378
Do you want me to apologize?

313
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,007
If you have something to say, say it.

314
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,430
Women always ask for things
like I owe them something.

315
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,932
I don't owe you anything, do I?

316
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,568
That's how life is.

317
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,280
It seems to go well
and then stabs you in the back.

318
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,743
Did you think
it was always going to be peachy?

319
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,623
Idiot.

320
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,088
It's not like I asked for a diamond.

321
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,216
It'd be easier to get you a diamond.

322
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,719
How do you worship someone?

323
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,304
I have no idea.

324
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,434
You were ready to let a dog
bite off your arm.

325
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,145
And yet, you find it hard to hold a woman?

326
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,650
You think it's cool to endure pain
with clenched teeth,

327
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,487
and it's dull to have a cute, happy life
with a woman?

328
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,657
Which is harder?

329
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,703
Getting your arm bitten off by a dog
and getting your nose broken,

330
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,580
or being nice to the woman you like?

331
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,707
Which do you think is harder?

332
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,547
You treated me like a fool
who couldn't even get her money back.

333
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,758
You're no better.

334
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,178
You went to Sanpo Middle School?

335
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,806
Yes, I finished middle school in Sanpo.

336
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,767
Do you know Yeom Chang-hee, by any chance?

337
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,895
He's my younger brother.
He went to Sanpo Middle School too.

338
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,605
-Really?
-Yes.

339
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,941
You're his senior.

340
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,361
He actually works near here as well.

341
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,530
He's probably drinking
somewhere around here.

342
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,949
-You should ask him to come.
-No. God, no.

343
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,909
I'd never. I'm sick of him.

344
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,454
Hello.

345
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,001
What took you so long?

346
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,632
Hey, the octopus tastes great.

347
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,717
Come have a seat.

348
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,885
-You were dying to eat it.
-Yes.

349
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,610
What?

350
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,203
What happened to your hand?

351
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,874
This?

352
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,418
I got hurt.

353
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:16,262
Hey, divorced dad. Unless you want
to be shot dead, go get me some beer.

354
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,642
Watch what you say.

355
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,937
Watch what you say,

356
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,315
or my sister will kick your ass.

357
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,988
What's with you?

358
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,077
She's my guest.

359
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,664
It was…

360
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,628
Yu-rim's birthday that day.

361
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,300
We didn't know each other then.

362
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,179
Yu-rim and I were just having dinner,
and we happened to overhear her.

363
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,266
She apologized many times afterward.
She wanted to apologize to Yu-rim too,

364
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,644
but I told her not to.

365
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,986
Oh, no! The stove!

366
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,531
I really left the stove on.

367
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,481
Hui-seon, I'm sorry.

368
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,237
I'm sorry.

369
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:01,117
You don't have to apologize anymore.

370
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,998
Right. She didn't know any better then.

371
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,544
It's okay. Let's just drink.

372
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,509
Hui-seon and I are

373
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:23,055
going to take care of Yu-rim for
the rest of our lives and then die.

374
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:28,311
Her mom made another family
with another man and had…

375
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,317
Had another child.

376
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,570
We'll never let her feel betrayed
and hurt like that ever again.

377
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:44,202
We're not going to give our affection
to anyone else until the day we die.

378
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:48,706
We're going to die after loving
and cherishing just Yu-rim alone.

379
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,624
That is

380
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,418
the only reason why I'm still alive.

381
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,715
But he won't die single like us.

382
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,092
He's seeing a woman.

383
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,638
I told you, I'm not.

384
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,766
I don't have anyone.

385
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,564
I don't.

386
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,025
I really don't.

387
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,613
What was that? Why are you
so concerned about what she thinks?

388
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:25,868
What's going on?

389
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,913
Do you have feelings for Gi-jeong?

390
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,795
I…

391
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,049
told him I liked him,

392
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,636
and he rejected me.

393
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,231
Yu-rim.

394
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,858
We won!

395
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:02,113
A very nice play from Cho Tae-hun!

396
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,115
For God's sake.

397
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,033
-We need to talk.
-No way, you prick.

398
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,285
Hey!

399
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,161
No thanks, brother.

400
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,247
Where's Chang-hee?

401
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,417
He went to the district office.
He'll be here soon.

402
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,086
A-reum's father apparently
keeps giving him errands.

403
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,965
He should take care of
his own business with the district office.

404
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,217
Does he think
the HQ employees are his butlers?

405
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,681
Just between you and me.

406
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,768
I'm trying to separate
A-reum and Chang-hee,

407
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,021
but no one wants to take A-reum.

408
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,316
So I'm thinking,
how about you and Chang-hee switch teams?

409
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:24,945
You want me

410
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,573
to sit next to A-reum?

411
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:28,991
Yes.

412
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,578
Gosh.

413
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,914
What?

414
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,499
It could be different with you.

415
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:37,500
Why don't we

416
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,127
wait and see for a while?

417
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,296
Chang-hee seems okay these days.

418
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,300
He didn't even complain about going
to the district office. He was smiling.

419
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,637
I mean, he used to throw
a tantrum over things like that.

420
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,307
But today, he just smiled and said,
"I'll see you later."

421
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,851
He does seem different, doesn't he?

422
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,104
Is he dating someone?

423
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,690
I don't think so.

424
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,318
-Here.
-Hey.

425
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,445
Man, it's hot.

426
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,906
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

427
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,449
No, I just got here.

428
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,577
Look at you.

429
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,163
-I'm okay.
-What do you want to eat?

430
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,041
I'll just have the ox bone soup.

431
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:20,876
You?

432
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,503
Same.

433
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,090
-Excuse me. Three ox bone soup, please.
-Where's the cup?

434
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,261
What is it?

435
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,973
It can't be a girl.

436
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,061
You're not going to tell me?

437
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,570
A few days ago,

438
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,489
I almost died trying to hold in my poop.

439
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,743
It was right about to come out so I had
to barge into my neighbor's house.

440
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,287
The guy who works for your dad?

441
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,122
-Yes.
-The one that jumped that long distance?

442
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,791
Yes! It was so freaking cool.

443
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,627
I didn't even have time
to turn the lights on,

444
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,421
but the power was out anyway.

445
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,426
So I was sitting in the dark,

446
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:14,305
and I saw something glimmering
next to my butt.

447
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,891
It was a bidet.

448
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,935
I thought, "This guy uses a bidet."

449
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,522
"Of course. I'm sure he used to be rich."

450
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:28,777
He seemed like a guy who used to be rich.
I just had the feeling.

451
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,573
Then I saw something else in front of me.

452
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,992
I was like, "Is it a glowing watch?"

453
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:41,540
No, it was a key to a Royce, my dream car.

454
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,585
The moment I saw it,

455
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,463
I could picture his past at once.

456
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,632
A man who fell from the very top.

457
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,968
A man who doesn't care where
he puts the key to his luxury car.

458
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,429
My savior.

459
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:04,605
I don't know why, but I wanted
to get close to him. I just did.

460
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,357
It's like my soul knew.

461
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,567
"Cling to him. Grovel, Chang-hee."

462
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,361
And I really groveled.

463
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,947
Well, you know I'm good at it.

464
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:16,325
But to him, I just shut up and groveled.

465
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,827
I don't know his age,
but I treat him like he's older.

466
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,205
How great are my animal instincts?

467
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,547
He likes me too, you know.

468
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,215
If I go…

469
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,384
"Hey."

470
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:39,139
"Your car that you just ditched somewhere.
Can I drive it?"

471
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,392
He'll let me.

472
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,310
I'm 100 percent sure.

473
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,318
What if he only has the key?

474
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:06,000
You want to ruin it, right?
Okay, I get it.

475
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:16,218
Since that day, what A-reum says
doesn't bother me anymore.

476
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,931
She's just too trivial
to ruin my saintly mood.

477
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,852
I've tried everything to not hate her.
Meditation, Buddhist chants…

478
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,061
None of them worked.

479
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:30,316
I thought, "When you hate someone,
you just can't help it."

480
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,444
But what I needed was
something beyond mere willpower.

481
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,621
I use his bathroom every morning and night
to check on the key.

482
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,965
Thanks for letting me use your bathroom.

483
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,302
What?

484
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:02,973
It's good, isn't it?

485
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,564
Good night, then.

486
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:19,281
I hope he and Mi-jeong make up soon
so I can bring it up.

487
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,702
Mi-jeong, I'm counting on you.

488
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,329
Throw yourself at him!

489
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:51,689
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

490
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,196
I told you,

491
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:04,535
I don't care if you're
a notorious criminal or even an alien.

492
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,328
So what's the big deal?

493
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,168
I still think you're okay.

494
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,504
So let's carry on.

495
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,339
Let's keep going.

496
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,436
VILLAGE BUS STOP
SANPO

497
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,728
It's now chilly…

498
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,315
in the morning.

499
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:04,261
I don't get why you'd ask a man
for dating advice.

500
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:08,432
Shouldn't you ask another woman
for that sort of thing?

501
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:14,480
To me, it looks like an excuse
to make a move on him.

502
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,859
Am I overreacting here?

503
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,195
No, you're not.

504
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:23,697
I'm sorry.

505
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,117
You're absolutely right.
I don't know what to say.

506
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,369
I'm so embarrassed.

507
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,080
Please try to understand
how it makes me feel.

508
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:35,209
Because you and Mr. Park seem so close,

509
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,337
people are starting to wonder
if he and I have broken up.

510
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,173
I'm really sorry.

511
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,050
I'll be careful.

512
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,305
I'm really sorry.

513
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,391
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

514
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,692
Why are you crying?

515
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,861
Now you're making me feel bad.

516
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,404
No, I…

517
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,407
I'm just so ashamed of myself.

518
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,536
I just embarrass myself every day.

519
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,046
But you have nothing
to worry about though.

520
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,173
I'm not Mr. Park's type.

521
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,426
He didn't even give me
any lottery tickets.

522
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:27,886
That's right.

523
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:45,362
What did Ms. Yeom say?

524
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,241
She said she just became close
with Mr. Park

525
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,993
while asking for dating advice.

526
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,704
But who knows?

527
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,914
Maybe she just made up the whole story.

528
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,722
-Really?
-Yes.

529
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,433
You two seem to
be very interested in your looks.

530
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:52,429
Nirvana reminds me of you now.

531
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:57,726
I'd like to buy you two meals
as an apology

532
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,102
without Gyeong-seon.

533
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:00,729
Please, let me.

534
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,534
Hey.

535
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,744
Hey!

536
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:04,209
Hello, sir. It's been a long time.

537
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,960
"Export investments
in the second-quarter slump."

538
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:53,091
"The economy is in a recession
for the fifth straight month."

539
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,593
"This is the longest recession

540
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:58,805
since the government started giving
monthly economic reports in March, 2005."

541
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,766
"The recession in the real economy is

542
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,351
continuing due to the difficulties
in foreign trade,

543
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:07,522
but the government believes that it is
not a sign of economic stagnation."

544
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,984
What are you doing?

545
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,368
My partner is a man of few words.

546
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,413
He says nothing all day.

547
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,586
So I've become a slow talker.

548
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,088
I even stutter now.

549
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,593
It's been a while,
so I didn't want to stutter and look bad.

550
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,477
I wasn't able to sleep for days.

551
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,771
I was too angry.

552
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,236
I thought about what made me so angry.

553
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,865
What are you doing here? Are you putting
on a show? Acting like you're broken?

554
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,744
You think I'd put on a show?

555
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,460
Why do I have to act like I'm broken?

556
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,587
Tell me.

557
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:14,756
I'm taking a break.

558
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,718
For 15 years, I listened
to the drunks yapping

559
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,554
and singing in basements like this.

560
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,599
Then I went home to…

561
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,107
I was practically a dead man walking.
I was barely alive.

562
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,610
But you saved my life

563
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,863
by stabbing me in the back.

564
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,409
Thanks.

565
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,537
You asshole.
You're talking down to me now?

566
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,789
Then what? You stabbed me in the back.

567
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,886
I'm a little busy these days,

568
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,597
making sinks and stuff.

569
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,976
I'll come back if I decide to.

570
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:14,357
Do I decide that I like making sinks
and want to leave this world behind,

571
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,528
or do I decide that this is the world
that I need to conquer?

572
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,863
It's one or the other.

573
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,283
I'll be back after
I make the decision, so just wait.

574
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,538
If you keep lurking around
and pissing me off,

575
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,459
I will come back for good,
so just wait quietly.

576
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,132
Got it?

577
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,757
Hey, you need a new sink.

578
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,844
Sam-sik!

579
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,223
Sam-sik!

580
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,559
Sam-sik!

581
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,146
That son of a bitch. I should just…

582
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,152
Order one from Sanpo Sinks.

583
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:42,821
I…

584
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:45,907
I've changed my name.

585
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:59,671
I'm not the one who texted you
to come to Oido Station that winter.

586
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,134
Mr. Baek had borrowed my cell phone then.

587
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:07,971
I wouldn't dare to tell you
to come there to drink with me.

588
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,180
I know.

589
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,557
Hyeon-jin told me.

590
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:17,439
SANPO SINKS

591
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,760
Go ahead, guys.

592
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,339
Let's go before the traffic hits.

593
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:31,471
Did…

594
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,848
Did that guy go home already?

595
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,019
Your boss who always throws a fit.

596
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,434
Looks like they made up, right?

597
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,824
What do you think you're doing?
Don't follow me.

598
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:02,872
Go back.

599
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:08,920
Go away.

600
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,717
You punk. I said, go away.

601
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,344
You little…

602
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,915
I will die if you tell me

603
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,168
that it's just the key you have.

604
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,171
I really want

605
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,008
to live as a saint for a while.

606
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,679
Even if you don't have the car,
please say you do.

607
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:04,976
Please tell me you'll give it to me
when the time comes.

608
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:11,274
Please. I want to feel this way
for a little longer.

609
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,216
Listen.

610
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,219
I…

611
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,891
just came back from Seoul.

612
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,520
And you want me to go back?

613
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,503
Gu.

614
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,506
I love you.

615
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:12,603
Really?

616
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,386
Gu.

617
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,055
Gu!

618
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:52,143
Gosh, thank you. I love you.

619
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:47,758
-Ten! Nine! Eight!
-Ten! Nine! Eight!

620
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,928
-Seven! Six! Five!
-Seven! Six! Five!

621
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:54,974
-Four! Three! Two! One!
-Four! Three! Two! One!

622
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:39,518
One asshole after another…

623
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:43,648
Every guy I've ever dated was an asshole.

624
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:39,578
Are you nervous?

625
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:43,165
Call Baek now.

626
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,834
What did Mr. Gu use to do?

627
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:48,045
I have a feeling
that he'll disappear once I ask that.

628
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,756
My heart has never
settled with one person.

629
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,216
Want a ride?

630
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:54,260
Oddly enough, I become very gentle.

631
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,886
It's just like then.

632
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,555
You can't always wait for him.

633
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,223
Let's make him anxious.

634
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,435
I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue.

635
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,646
I feel like I'm going to collapse.

636
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:08,774
Did you miss me?

637
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,819
I don't care
about where I'll go after I die.

638
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:20,119
