I got it.

3
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,669
Put this over there. Right there.

4
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,879
This is the top.

5
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,048
-That's the top, okay?
-Okay.

6
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,151
Gosh.

7
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,851
Thanks for this.

00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,520
You're welcome.
Get washed up and come have lunch.

Yeom Mi-jeong doesn't live here.

12

You're at the right place.

13
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,143
What? But this one
is addressed to her house.

00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,188
-Should I leave this here too?
-That goes over there.

It's never been this hot.
What's happening to this planet?

19
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,325
I can't wait for winter to come.

20
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,663
When it does,
you're going to wish it was summer again.

21
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:55,295
Let's remember how we're feeling right now
and use it when it gets cold.

22
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,756
We'll save it for winter.

23
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,136
You can just use your memories
from last winter right now then.

24
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,847
Didn't you save anything to remember?

I'll pick it up later.

I'm home.

29
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,963
What did Mr. Gu say to you?

30
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,676
It's not like him to say something first.

31
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,053
What did he say?

32
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:32,433
He has some of our plates to return.
I said I'd pick them up later.

33
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,729
I tell him to bring them over,
but he always forgets.

34
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,608
The table is set. Eat before you wash up.

35
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,986
I'll be heading out then.

36
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,739
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay, see you.

37
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,706
You know, my neighborhood really is great.

38
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,209
It's close to work
and it's a nice place to live.

39
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,336
I can show you around when you're free.

40
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,088
Yes, sure.

41
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,841
Just pick whatever day works for you.

42
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,634
I can always make time.

43
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,928
All right, see you.

44
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,388
Okay, see you tomorrow.

45
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,389
Bye.

46
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,133
Tell him to eat something
if he's going to be drinking like that.

47
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,762
I'm home.

48
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,682
Hey, you did a good job today.

49
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,517
Did you eat?

50
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,402
I left work when it was bright outside,
but it's already night.

51
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,654
My evening is gone.

52
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,033
Come and eat.

53
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,994
You'll feel better if you eat this.

54
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,121
I already finished three bowls.

59

I'll leave this here for now.

60
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,551
I can't keep it at my house.

61
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,474
Someone might see it.

62
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,979
The bank

63
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:09,191
refused have it sent anywhere
other than my registered address,

64
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,569
so I changed my address to here.

65
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,572
I'm sorry. I didn't have time to ask you.

66
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,362
Why does he want me to move
to his neighborhood? He has a girlfriend.

67
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,406
Because it's a nice place to live.
He's not into you.

68
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,992
But he shouldn't say that
to another woman.

69
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,870
Can't people with girlfriends tell others
how nice their neighborhood is?

70
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,792
That's not all he said.
He says I should move there.

71
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,795
Do you ask just anyone
to move to your neighborhood?

72
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,886
You fell for him already, didn't you?

73
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,559
It's because he told me
to move to his neighborhood.

74
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,479
I had no interest in him at all
before that.

75
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:34,568
Jerks who lead girls on for fun like him,

76
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,530
should all go extinct.
They should be straightforward like me.

77
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,740
If I don't like them,
I kick them to the curb--

78
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,910
Kick them to the curb?
What is this, a taekwondo match?

79
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,162
Look what you've done.

80
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,207
What?

81
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,625
Don't play dumb.

82
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,173
Thank you for dinner.

83
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,883
Sure, good night.

84
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,470
That's right. Seeing how…

85
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,474
-Yes. That was great.
-And with that he…

86
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,292
If a payment is over five days late,
my credit card will get suspended.

87
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,003
So I made this month's payment.

88
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,796
Call me.

89
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,400
I checked my lunch mates for today,

90
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,694

MIN HO-SHIK, MARKETING, ASSISTANT MANAGER

93
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,885
-Iced? Iced Americano?
-Yes.

94
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,564
I like iced Americanos too.

95
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,128
I don't think
the tables are randomly picked.

96
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,009
We're all people
who didn't sign up for any clubs.

97
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,931
I'm a member of a club though.

98
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,726
-You are?
-Yes.

99
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,360
Haven't you joined any?

100
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:04,862
No.

101
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,156
You two don't either?

102
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,916
No.

103
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,130
Why not?

104
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,347
I live too far away.

105
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,765
I see.

106
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,309
Where?

107
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,812
Sanpo.

108
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,524
It's near Suwon.

109
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,401
I see.

110
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,575
What about you, sir?

111
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,745
Who would want me in their club?

112
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,178
Two iced Americanos and a hot one, please.

113
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,430
What do you want, Ms. Bang?

114
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,224
IA, please.

115
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,981
And one IA, please.

116
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,486
They're now making lunch
uncomfortable too.

117
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,740
Do I have to know everyone here?

118
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,162
Why do I need to know
people in other departments?

119
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,664
It's hard enough with those in mine.

120
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,795
It's as if everyone here used to be
popular kids at school.

121
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,632
I'll never join any club.

122
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,225
-Bye.
-Bye.

123
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,237
My sister…

124
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:56,575
wanted me to tell you
that she was sorry about the other day.

125
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,914
Was she your sister?

126
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,333
Yes.

127
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,378
I see.

128
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,590
You don't look alike.

129
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,395
Thanks.

YSTAT RESEARCH

131
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,585
Isn't it Ms. Lee's turn
to do the emergency research?

132
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,423
I'll tell you later.

133
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,844
All right, let's head inside.

134
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:57,928
Hello, Ms. Yeom.

135
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,643
Yesterday, a well-known politician said

136
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,728
35-year-olds should no longer
be considered young

137
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,189
and that youth ends at the age of 29.

138
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,985
Some people consider his remarks
to be more anachronistic than others do.

139
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,572
I, for one, believe I'm still young

140
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,032
so I think it's absolutely preposterous.

141
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,870
I was just joking. Now.

142
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:27,374
We're all here today to figure out

143
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,627
at what age the general public
considers youth to be over.

144
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,547
Thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

145
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,592
I will relay a few things to keep in mind.

146
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,094
-Hello? I'm calling from Ystat…
-Hello? We are a research company…

147
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,013
…will not be used to make a profit,

148
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,348
and under Article 33
of the Statistics Act,

149
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,434
your information
will be kept confidential.

150
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,562
We'd appreciate it
if you could spare a moment of your time.

151
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:52,399
Park Jin-u broke up with Ms. Lee.

152
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,867
Well, she's not the first woman
he's dated at work.

153
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,286
Did she think they'd last longer?

154
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,371
Anyway, it's good.

155
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,666
Now that he's dated every woman here,
there isn't anyone left for him to date.

156
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,001
He'll be quiet for a while.

157
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:18,467
What age range
would you consider to be youth?

158
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,932
Rumor has it that he and a new girl
in the management are a thing.

159
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,770
Unbelievable.

160
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:37,110
Ms. Yeom, agent 37 keeps
on asking leading questions.

161
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,238
I think we should scrap all of their data.

162
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,530
Okay, I'll check.

163
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,490
Okay.

164
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,160
You didn't hear anything, okay?

165
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,397
Where's Hyeon-a?

166
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,023
She's coming with Mi-jeong.

167
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,908
It's been a long time
since you came out to Seoul, right?

168
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,536
You should've worn gold chains too.

169
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,039
Du-hwan.

170
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:32,958
Oh Du-hwan.

171
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,837
Don't ever meet
any girls during the summer.

172
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,588
You seriously smell.

173
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,883
Make sure you only see them in winter.

174
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,304
How could you be so cruel?

175
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,098
He lives alone.
He wouldn't know unless someone tells him.

176
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,064
Yes. Have a drink.

177
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,817
Toss that shirt out. I'm serious.

178
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,862
Once it starts to stink,
it'll never go away. Throw it away.

179
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,531
If I see it again, I'll burn it. I swear.

180
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:09,244
You've kept that for years
because it's designer.

181
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,204
No one would consider this designer.

182
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,044
A politician's comment
regarding the age of young people

183
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,628
has sparked controversy.

184
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,673
Currently, each local government
defines it differently.

185
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,509
In Seoul, it is considered that
youth ends at the age of 29,

186
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,470
but in Jeolla-do, it's 39,

187
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,890
and in Bonghwa-gun,
North Gyeongsang-do, it's 49.

188
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:33,518
We asked the citizens of Seoul what
they considered to be the appropriate age

189
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,188
at which a person should
no longer be classified as youth.

190
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,273
And 56 percent of the respondents

191
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,567
answered that youth should be
between the ages of 19 to 29.

192
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,863
-If youth is defined to be…
-I just don't get it.

193
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,911
Is he addicted
to dating people at work or what?

194
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,996
Can't he find a girl anywhere else?

195
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,957
I guess Park Jin-u
has found himself a new girl.

196
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,338
I feel like I know him now
because you talk so much about him.

197
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,173
It's not just him.

198
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,258
It's the girls that I have
a harder time understanding.

199
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,594
They all know who he's been with.

200
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,805
He's already dated
a bunch of girls at work.

201
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,473
Why do they still go out with him?

202
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:15,936
Why do they want to belittle themselves
by becoming another one of his girls?

203
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,270
I really don't get it.

204
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,815
You don't have to get it.

205
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,650
It's you that I don't get.

206
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:26,696
They're fine with having a casual fling.
How is it any of your business?

207
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,533
And how is that belittling?

208
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,285
Then have the girls I've dated
belittled themselves too?

209
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,747
From my point of view,
they're like one of the girls I've dated.

210
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,873
I mean,

211
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:40,085
does everyone need to be like you
and only ever love one person,

212
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,880
or pretend they're the only person
they've ever been with?

213
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,424
They live in a different world from yours.

214
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,552
So just leave them to enjoy themselves.

215
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,179
They're all happy and having a blast.

216
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,889
They don't care what others think.

217
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,350
You can bad-mouth them,
but they just don't care.

218
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,399
Why hasn't he ever asked me out?

219
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,830
You've got to be kidding me.

220
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,208
He dates everyone, so why did he skip me?

221
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,337
I'm sure Jin-u has his own taste in women.

222
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,048
I'm at least in the top ten at work.

223
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,802
Out of how many women? Are there like 20?

224
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,346
He's even dated
someone way less attractive than I am.

225
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,223
So why won't he date me?

226
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,558
See?

227
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:40,103
When I hit her with the facts,
she just ignores me and keeps going.

228
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,813
You should've become a politician.

229
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:46,193
Some of them may be prettier than me,
but none of them are as charming as me.

230
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,786
It's true. I think I'm pretty awesome.

231
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,834
I'm a woman who has a lot of charm.

232
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,383
Hey, drink up. Let's just drink.

233
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,470
Why aren't the girls here yet?

234
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,807
You know, I…

235
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,688
I'm embarrassed
that you're my older sister.

236
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,780
I feel you, Gi-jeong.
I can see why you're offended.

237
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,864
Yes.

238
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,704
This may not be the right time to ask,

239
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:45,543
but that girl in your office with
"nasty, nasty, nasty" all over her face,

240
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,174
Park Jin-u's dated her too, right?

241
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,596
I knew it.

242
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,473
It's just as expected.

243
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:01,434
I bet she has a beautiful face.

244
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,352
Right?

245
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,272
I am 100 percent sure she's pretty.

246
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,483
And I think she's not just pretty

247
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,569
but also pretty charming.

248
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,201
Hey.

249
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,954
I'm in front of the statue in the square.

250
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,872
Where are you?

251
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,085
Over here!

252
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,675
You got off late today.

253
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,176
So we could go together.

254
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,428
Let's go.

255
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,096
Hold on.

256
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,684
That jerk…

257
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,186
Who is it?

258
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,441
Nobody. Let's go. Who's there?

259
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,781
-Hey, they're here.
-Right.

260
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,950
-Hey!
-Hey, guys.

261
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,201
Hey.

262
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,244
You're so late.

263
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,370
What took you so long?

264
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,413
Sorry.

265
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,665
Someone here has been a serious buzzkill.

266
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,751
-Why?
-You should've come sooner.

267
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,629
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

268
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:15,592
Happy birthday dear Hyeon-a
Happy birthday to you

269
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,389
Cheers.

270
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,557
Bottoms up.

271
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,730
Here, try some of this.

272
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,523
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

273
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,781
What do you mean there are no guys?

274
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,949
There's a bunch right here.

275
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,703
It's because you look for
someone who's worth 80 points.

276
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:47,082
And even if you do find him,
you grill him about the 20 points he lacks

277
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,251
while you look for someone better.
That's what you do.

278
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,087
Love is not for everyone.

279
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,546
Don't kid yourself.

280
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:59,636
I mean, I go out with guys who are
worth 20 points because I like them.

281
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,347
What's wrong with 20 points?
That's 20 points above zero.

282
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,683
If I get lucky and meet someone
who's worth 30 points, I'm just grateful.

283
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,519
And if it's 40points,
then I've hit the jackpot.

284
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:13,274
I mean, I'd understand
if you're worth 80 points yourself.

285
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,444
Do you want me to be honest
and tell you how many points you're worth?

286
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,571
Should I be brutally frank?

287
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,614
Hey.

288
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,701
I'm just saying,
you could use a little self-awareness.

289
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,621
Everyone else knows you except for you.

290
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,293
Besides, you're not going to do it anyway.

291
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,087
You're not going to love just anyone.

292
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,342
That's enough. Why are you being so mean?

293
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,097
And why are you guys
letting Gi-jeong do this to herself?

294
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,267
Mi-jeong. Why did you let it come to this?

295
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,811
You're at fault too.
Knock some sense into her.

296
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:50,770
Hey.

297
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,606
Why are you so upset anyway?

298
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,152
We all waited for you
to celebrate your birthday.

299
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,738
They came all the way here from Sanpo.

300
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,450
Do you want to stop seeing
your hometown friends?

301
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,868
Were we too dense to notice?

302
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,872
It's not that.

303
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,873
Then what?

304
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,834
It's her birthday.
Cut her some slack, okay?

305
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,795
Hyeon-a can do
whatever she wants to do today.

306
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,505
Be as crabby as you want!

307
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,471
I'm going to break up with my boyfriend.

308
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,104
Why?

309
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,443
Forget it. I'm not even interested.

310
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,986
It's not the first time.

311
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,866
He says he's going to buy a bed…

312
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,042
when we've been together
for over two years.

313
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,758
I mean, you know beds aren't cheap.

314
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,970
I'm supposed to buy one when we
get married, so why would he buy it?

315
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,599
It didn't occur to him
because he's not planning to marry me.

316
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,479
Maybe he's just rich.

317
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,688
Yes.

318
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,405
That jerk has no money.

319
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:29,077
And it's not even a double, it's a single.
An 800,000-won single bed.

320
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,789
That's crazy, isn't it?
He wants to be single forever, right?

321
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,297
-And he's 43 years old.
-Right.

322
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,558
You want to get married?

323
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,519
Of course.

324
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,314
Can't I get married just because
I prefer open relationships?

325
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,524
I'm open to anything.

326
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,943
I'm up for anything.

327
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,452
We've been together for two years.

328
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,664
But even after two years,

329
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,083
he still doesn't think I'm the one.

330
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,338
Just ask him
if he's going to marry you or not.

331
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,841
No, why would I do that?

332
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,642
By the way, who has he been talking
to for so long?

333
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,813
Is he on bad terms with his girlfriend?

334
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,274
They broke up.

335
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,611
They already broke up.

336
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,529
Who is it then?

337
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,786
It must be Byeon Sang-mi then.

338
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,498
Some convenience store owner.

339
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,542
She's the type of woman

340
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,170
who calls you whenever
and yammers on for an hour

341
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,131
complaining about her husband,
her son, and so on.

342
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,053
You've got to be kidding me.

343
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,560
I hope somebody rescues him.

344
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,491
Hey! Why would you go in there?

345
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,585
Hey. What are you doing?

346
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,295
We're breaking up!

347
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:48,049
How could you ditch your girlfriend
to talk to another woman for an hour?

348
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,884
Just go out with her instead then!

349
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,621
People are

350
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,749
so good with words.

351
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,589
Once you reach a certain point,

352
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,925
you start playing with your words.

353
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:36,431
And once you start to enjoy drawing
attention to yourself with your words…

354
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,392
there's no turning back.

355
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,731
Do you think there's even a single thing

356
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,358
coming out of my mouth
that's actually worthwhile?

357
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,569
There isn't. Not one.

358
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,532
So I don't

359
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,869
want you to ever reach that point.

360
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,665
It feels like I'm taking a detour

361
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,084
because I'm too afraid
to walk on the right path.

362
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,588
But I've come so far away

363
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,258
that I can't even dare to turn back.

364
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,471
I like

365
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,349
that you don't try to get attention
from people with your words.

366
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:26,022
That's why each and every word
you utter is so special.

367
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,136
If I ever get to be born again,

368
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,722
I want to be born as you, Hyeon-a.

369
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,478
I was like you in my previous life

370
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,857
and decided to live recklessly
if I were born again. And that's me now.

371
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:14,487
Then I'll realize
that this isn't right either

372
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,241
and decide to have a quiet life
the next time around.

373
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,325
And that's you.

374
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:25,414
You and I have been switching
back and forth millions of times.

375
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,875
Why are you acting so naive?

376
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,193
I want all of us to be happy.

377
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,447
As bright and cheery as a sunny day.

378
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,284
Without so much as a crease in our hearts.

379
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:16,674
WE WILL BE WITH YOU 365 DAYS A YEAR

380
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,348
Hello.

381
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,562
You want to add more shelves?

382
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,855
MANAGER BYEON SANG-MI

383
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:35,693
God, it's cold. Aren't you cold?
I think you set the temperature too low.

384
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,488
Well, adding a shelf to everything
won't really work.

385
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,241
You still need
to be able to see the mirror.

386
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,577
So how about just doing
this one and that one?

387
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,122
I think about 30cm should do it.

388
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,713
Hey, did you really break up
because of me?

389
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,009
It was about time we did anyway.
Don't worry about it.

390
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,137
What have I done?

391
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:11,145
Why don't I call your girlfriend
and try to explain things?

392
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,316
Which works better for you,
the 25th or the 27th?

393
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,193
For the maintenance team to come.

394
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:25,826
Hello?

395
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,120
Yes.

396
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,456
I see.

397
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,376
The plastic chair was spinning around
because of the wind

398
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,754
and dinged that car all by itself.

399
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,300
The owner said I'd have to sell
this store if I was to pay for it.

400
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,803
Jeez, what a load of crap.

401
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,430
He said his car was…

402
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,307
I've never even heard of it before.

403
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,227
I thought my life was over then.

404
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:55,189
Call me when something like that happens.
Insurance covers all of that.

405
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,025
You looked like a god to me
at that moment.

406
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,361
Jeez, seriously.

407
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,322
Mr. Yeom, we have to
stick it out together until the end.

408
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,784
I'll replace the table with a wooden one
with benches attached.

409
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,077
Thank you so much.

410
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,537
Mr. Yeom.

411
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,373
You and I have to
stay partners forever, okay?

412
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,458
-Did you get the health certificate?
-Right.

413
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:18,129
I told you you need to have it
to put a coffee machine in the store.

414
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,339
I just don't have the time.

415
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,174
Can you ring this up?

416
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,092
Sure.

417
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:35,980
Why did you come? It's raining.

418
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,982
Wait, hang on.

419
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,361
-Can I help you find something?
-Wet wipes.

420
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,280
They're over there, right there.

421
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,364
Okay.

422
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,577
We'll take this too--

423
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,208
That'll be 9,000 won.

424
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,296
We should hurry and get out of Seoul.

425
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,970
Have a good day.

426
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,096
Are you working?

427
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,099
What are you doing here?

428
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,435
There are no cameras around here,
so I'm just killing time.

429
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,437
Did you have lunch?

430
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,231
Expired food.

431
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,607
Aren't you sick of it?

432
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,275
Not yet.

433
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,488
I wish I could work in an office.

434
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,157
I want to sit inside a building

435
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,994
where it's quiet even if
there's a thunderstorm going on outside.

436
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,833
We've been working like this
for eight years.

437
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,877
If neither of us
makes team leader this time,

438
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,963
let's just quit.

439
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,259
We'll make it this time.

440
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,761
We have to.

441
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,350
-See you later.
-Bye.

442
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,859
-Isn't it great?
-How many tickets did he give you?

443
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,694
-Five.
-Five?

444
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,612
I've never won 5,000 won on the lottery.

445
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,532
-This is amazing.
-Seriously. I've never--

446
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,076
I guess Mr. Park gave that to you.

447
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:56,871
Yes.

448
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,208
You're the new hire
with the management team, right?

449
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,587
Yes. Nice to meet you.

450
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,675
He said he was gifting you excitement
when he gave it to you, right?

451
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,553
That you'd be excited on Saturday.

452
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,222
How did you know that?

453
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,519
There isn't a single girl here
who hasn't received a lottery ticket

454
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,937
from Mr. Park.

455
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,775
Why does he always give them
on Mondays and not Fridays?

456
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:30,196
He wants you to think about him
all week whenever you look at your ticket.

457
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,823
It's such a cheap move, don't you think?

458
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,949
It costs 5,000 won.

459
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,455
But it still makes you pretty excited.

460
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:43,083
On the weekend, you suddenly go,
"Right, the lottery ticket."

461
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,668
Isn't that right?

462
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,132
Right.

463
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:55,221
Apparently, he spends at least
50,000 won on lottery tickets every week.

464
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,724
Isn't he a pretty good boss?

465
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,769
I like it better than coffee.

466
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,920
Again, he's given
lottery tickets to everyone but me.

467
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:34,260
He's given them to married women
and new employees.

468
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,181
He's given them to everyone but me.

469
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,813
Just ask him straight up
why he keeps on leaving you out.

470
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,829
I just want to get a call from anyone…

471
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,874
and talk about anything.

472
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,754
You've been talking all this time.

473
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,965
You talk all the time.

474
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,467
You still want to talk more?

475
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,056
I've never said
what I really wanted to say.

476
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,105
I don't want to just say things
to feel like I exist.

477
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,317
I want to talk to relax.

478
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,237
A conversation…

479
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:44,580
Words that make you feel relaxed.

480
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,295
I say I want to have sex,

481
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,758
but the truth is,
I want to talk with a man.

482
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,778
Yes.

483
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,285
Why are you asking about Chan-hyeok?

484
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,290
I want to ask him something
but I can't reach him.

485
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,336
He's been borrowing money here and there,

486
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,338
so things have gotten awkward
for everyone.

487
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:40,177
I had a bad feeling when he started
to boast about starting his own business.

488
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,430
I heard he closed his business
and went to Thailand.

489
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,892
He couldn't carry on here
because of his bad credit.

490
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,229
And who did he go to?
I bet he went to Se-yeong.

491
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,816
Some say Se-yeong suggested it first.

492
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,903
They broke up and got back together
over and over. Now it's come to this.

493
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,366
But why do you need to talk to him?

494
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,661
It's nothing.

495
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,538
Come on, tell me.

496
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,623
It's nothing.

497
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,834
Don't tell me

498
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,503
you went out with him.

499
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,173
Of course not.

500
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,220
He walked me to my house.

501
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,433
But he's… What do I do
if he's not replying anymore?

502
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,017
You'll find out in the end.

503
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:30,978
I have a blind date.

504
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:33,814
He's a dermatologist.

505
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,191
-What if he keeps staring at my skin?
-No way.

506
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,319
It was great when we were eating.
He even took me home.

507
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,991
-But he won't return your texts?
-Correct.

508
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,618
Maybe he doesn't check his phone.

509
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,079
Please, in this day and age?

510
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:49,997
Hey.

511
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,832
Should I text him again?

512
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,292
Should I text him?

513
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:56,044
Hey, isn't Mi-jeong adorable?

514
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,754
-She is.
-Yes.

515
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,923
She's so cute.

516
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:00,883
She's cute.

517
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,135
She's very cute.

518
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:13,896
When I was in the first grade,
I once scored 20 out of 100 on a test.

519
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,277
I was told to get
my parents' signatures on the test.

520
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,738
I couldn't bring myself to show them.

521
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:27,034
And whenever I looked at my bag,
my heart felt heavier than a rock.

522
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:33,790
I had to get it signed
but I couldn't show them.

523
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,084
Something I had to figure out

524
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,462
but couldn't bring myself to.

525
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:44,843
I wonder why
I'm reminded of that right now.

526
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:07,199
I don't know what I should be
more embarrassed about.

527
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:11,828
Is it me, the fool
who lent money to some guy?

528
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:15,249
Or is it him, the guy who couldn't
pay back the money he owes to a girl?

529
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,291
Or is it

530
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,836
the fact that he ran off
to his ex-girlfriend?

531
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:26,802
I can't tell which of the three
is the test paper I'm trying to hide.

532
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,480
Maybe…

533
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,858
it's just me who's worth 20 points.

534
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:34,036
Oh, dear. What are we going to do
about all this blood?

535
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,372
Good heavens. Gosh, are you okay?

536
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:40,834
Oh, dear. This is terrible.
Absolutely terrible.

537
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,339
What's taking him so long?

538
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,551
-Come on, Mr. Gu. Let's get you up.
-Oh, God. Here.

539
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,387
Here we go. Put your shoes on.

540
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,224
Oh, good heavens.

541
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,184
Be careful.

542
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,311
-Gosh.
-Oh, my God.

543
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,534
Oh, dear.

544
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,872
Get back inside. I'll see you later.

545
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,248
Be careful.

546
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,216
SANPO SINKS

547
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,016
Oh, dear.

548
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,269
How terrible.

549
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,231
My goodness.

550
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,485
I went to get him for dinner,

551
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:51,488
and he woke up
with a bruise and blood on his face.

552
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,157
I asked him what happened,
and he didn't even know.

553
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,618
He must have gotten drunk and tripped.

554
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,454
He was too drunk to feel anything
and just passed out.

555
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,624
He was drunk all winter, wasn't he?

556
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,752
We just barely turned him
into a decent human being,

557
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,672
then he does this
the very moment he gets a day off.

558
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:13,218
It's not as though we can give him work
when there isn't any work to give.

559
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,595
What did he use to do?

560
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,763
How would I know?

561
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,599
He doesn't give me
a straight answer when I ask him.

562
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,437
I asked his name,
and he hesitated to tell me.

563
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,023
I asked him what I should call him,
and he just said, "My last name is Gu."

564
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,443
Maybe he's in hiding here.

565
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:40,203
Don't look after him too much.
We don't even know who he is.

566
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,926
I'm sure he's not a bad person.

567
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,471
He probably had
something bad happen to him.

568
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,682
I doubt he'd do something bad.
He's probably the victim.

569
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:06,938
So-ra's grandma calls me all the time
to go and check on Mr. Gu.

570
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,358
She's just worried that someone might die
in the house she's renting out.

571
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,694
She said he paid a year's rent upfront.

572
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,571
This town

573
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,909
isn't dramatic enough for someone
as young as him to suddenly drop dead.

574
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,827
In my entire life,

575
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:26,625
all I've ever seen happen here
is old people dying and floods in summer.

576
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,377
Nothing big happens around here.
Nothing at all.

577
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,225
He is impossible.

578
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,231
He bought alcohol again.

579
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,434
AMERICANO

580
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:20,030
Hey, are you going to Guam too?

581
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,866
Guam? What are you talking about?

582
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:32,250
I was upset because I thought you were
also going but weren't telling me.

583
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,214
Su-jin, Ji-hui, and the girls
are going to Guam for vacation.

584
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,593
They'd stop chatting whenever I showed up.

585
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,975
Why would they keep it a secret?
It's offensive.

586
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,477
As if we'd tag along.

587
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:54,648
But I thought you and Su-jin
were quite close.

588
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,987
I don't have money for that.

589
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,160
-It's very nice.
-You have it here too.

590
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:08,286
It's so pretty.

591
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,579
I wish they were longer.

592
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,373
Do you know a good place?

593
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,376
It's beautiful. I love it.

594
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,418
Yours look nice too.

595
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:17,796
They look great on you.

596
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,214
-Thanks.
-Really?

597
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,008
I messed up so many times.

598
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,389
Damn it.

599
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:33,269
Oh, for God's sake.

600
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,942
EMPHASIZE

601
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:57,627
JOY SUPPORT CENTER

602
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:04,843
I've found the perfect club
for you, Ms. Yeom.

603
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,512
A recital club.

604
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,140
"Recital."

605
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,642
It rolls right off the tongue, doesn't it?

606
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,978
I like it

607
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,814
when a word matches exactly how it sounds.

608
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,065
"Recital."

609
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,318
It somehow sounds lonely and aloof.

610
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,237
It's the perfect word for it.

611
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,284
This club has been formed recently

612
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:32,495
by three employees
from the engineering department.

613
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,206
I thought of you immediately
as soon as I saw it.

614
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,000
"She should join the recital club."

615
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,961
"Ms. Yeom is perfect
for the recital club."

616
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,557
I don't think I can do it.

617
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:56,811
Sorry?

618
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,273
It's exhausting.

619
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,323
Okay.

620
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,536
Right, sure.

621
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,997
You live far away and all.

622
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,221
I'm exhausted.

623
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,726
I don't know
when it all started to go wrong,

624
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,021
but I'm exhausted.

625
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:45,443
Every relationship

626
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,071
feels like work.

627
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,992
Every moment that I'm awake…

628
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,787
feels like work.

629
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,379
Nothing ever happens.

630
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,216
No one ever likes me.

631
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,801
Why do you drink every day?

632
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:00,852
What else would I do?

633
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,647
Should I give you something to do?

634
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:08,485
Should I give you something
to do other than drink?

635
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,198
Worship me.

636
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:31,090
I've never felt whole before.

637
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,512
One asshole after another…

638
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,306
Every guy I've ever dated was an asshole.

639
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:45,563
So worship me and make me feel whole.

640
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:51,986
It'll be winter soon.

641
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:55,490
Nothing survives when winter comes.

642
00:58:56,574 --> 00:59:00,119
There will be nothing to see sitting there
and no work at the factory.

643
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,582
If you drink all day,
you'll only feel like crap.

644
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,044
It'll be like hell.

645
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,091
You have to do something.

646
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,970
I want to feel whole for once.

647
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,266
So worship me.

648
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,189
Love isn't enough.

649
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,360
Worship me.

650
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,134
DICTIONARY
WORSHIP

651
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:58,636
TO LOOK UP TO IN HIGH REGARD

652
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,598
IN ENGLISH

653
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,626
Let's at least say hi from now on.

654
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:14,629
I don't want to do anything with anyone.

655
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:16,547
How did the blind date go?

656
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,633
…the severed head of her husband.

657
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:21,594
I stand by my man and never betray him.
I protect him.

658
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,513
Just live alone.

659
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:24,555
Should I go?

660
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,641
Why wouldn't there be when he's a drunk?

661
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:28,893
I was drunk and crossed the line.

662
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,812
You and Mr. Gu are close.

663
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,397
Have you guys even talked?

664
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,108
This crappy life with these crappy people.

665
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,234
Were you talking to me?

666
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,736
I feel trapped.

667
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,905
How about we actually do it?

668
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:45,243
-So what are the three of you going to do?
-I'm going to break free.

669
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,205
If you call Se-yeong,
you can forget about the money.

670
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,374
You lent money to a guy, didn't you?

671
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,418
Want me to get it back for you?

672
01:01:56,087 --> 01:02:01,092
