1
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,718
You sit there under an umbrella
while everyone's working.

2
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,428
Don't you feel sorry for them?

3
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,764
They're not working right now, you know!

4
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,062
They're on a date.

5
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,115
Jeez.

6
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,367
God, it's hot.

7
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,370
The weather's so freaking hot today.

8
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,206
Gosh.

9
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,585
God, he's trying so hard.

10
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,170
Jeez.

11
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,714
Let's go.

12
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,931
You should've parked in the shade.

13
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,392
It was in the shade earlier.

14
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,645
You should've parked so it would be
in the shade when you came out.

15
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,022
How am I supposed to know that?

16
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,691
You don't even know
which way the sun sets?

17
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,651
Where will this shade move to later?

18
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,862
I'm sure it'll go wherever it wants to go.

19
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,949
When it snows,

20
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:25,997
it's amazing to have a barbecue here.

21
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,292
Watching the snow pile up
all around, you know?

22
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,586
When you grill meat on a campfire here,

23
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,631
you think, "Where am I?"

24
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,009
It feels unfamiliar

25
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,344
but cozy, you know?

26
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:40,720
Yes.

27
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,805
Sounds really nice.

28
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,434
You should invite us some time.

29
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,438
Yes. Of course, yes.

30
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,731
You promise?

31
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:52,815
Yes.

32
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,985
Bye.

33
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,570
We'll be off then. Goodbye.

34
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,739
See you at school after the break.

35
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,575
Sure. Take care.

36
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,175
Why won't you accept payment
for the farm work?

37
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,473
It's because I like doing it.

38
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,227
Still, I feel bad
making you work for free.

39
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,228
Let me pay you.

40
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,314
It's really fine. I enjoy it.

41
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,943
But still, it doesn't sit right with us.

42
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,861
We should pay you for--

43
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,281
He says he enjoys it.
Well, why wouldn't he?

44
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,826
He enjoys it,
so take a hint and stop insisting.

45
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,732
What?

46
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,067
Keep at it.

47
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,905
I have you at my mercy.
How dare you glare at me like that?

48
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,162
What does it feel like to date
someone who lives in the area?

49
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,041
You're just like the people in Seoul,
dating within the neighborhood.

50
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,463
All this time, I thought
you had to take the bus and the train

51
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,257
to go all the way
to Seoul to meet someone.

52
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,054
I never even imagined you would be
able to find someone in this countryside.

53
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,015
It's so nice and economical.
You can even eat together at home.

54
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:07,366
GONDAL-RO ENTRANCE

55
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,970
Since you're tall and skinny, I can see
if you're on a bus even from afar.

56
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,515
I can see you too. Since you're fat.

57
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,817
I'm dying of hunger.

58
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,777
Are you that hungry?

59
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,362
I feel like I'm going to die.

60
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,490
Right. Go have dinner if you're hungry.

61
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,785
Come with me. Let's eat together.

62
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,329
No, I'm not hungry.

63
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,206
What's wrong?

64
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,752
What happened?

65
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,549
Apparently, Ms. Kwak

66
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,009
broke up with her boyfriend.

67
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,141
All right.

68
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,031
Don't you have any coffee beans?

69
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,200
They're in the freezer.

70
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,996
I'll have an iced americano.

71
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,831
Me too.

72
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,460
You said you weren't hungry.

73
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,546
I was just pretending.

74
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:44,964
To look sentimental.

75
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,343
You're lucky I forced you to eat with me.

76
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,303
You know, right?

77
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,847
How much I hate being
messed with when I'm hungry.

78
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,060
When is Ms. Kwak going to get married?

79
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,438
She should already.

80
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,982
You always get hopeful
when she breaks up with someone,

81
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,109
and become hopeless
once she starts dating someone new.

82
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,113
At this rate, if she does get married,
you'll wait for her to get divorced.

83
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,909
I never waited for her. Ever.

84
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,915
You know already, right?

85
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,459
It's not going to work.

86
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,920
I know.

87
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,715
But…

88
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,676
when I heard that she broke up
with her boyfriend,

89
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,430
my heart started beating fast again.

90
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,607
I don't get how you can like someone
so much that your heart pounds.

91
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,988
It's not that I've never
liked anyone that much.

92
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,783
I've never really liked anyone that much.

93
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,038
Anyway, my heart only pounds
when something bad is happening.

94
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,916
When I'm embarrassed,

95
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,001
when I'm angry,

96
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,671
before a 100-meter sprint…

97
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,632
It was always for bad things.

98
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,552
My heart never beat fast
because I liked someone.

99
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,056
When I really like someone,

100
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,644
I think the opposite happens.
My heart beats even slower.

101
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,980
Like I've been freed from something.

102
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:29,694
Like I feel peace
in my heart for the first time.

103
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,242
I guess I'm just weird.

104
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,748
Mi-Jeong just gave the perfect answer.

105
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,128
When you're happy, you just are.

106
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,588
But your heart pounds

107
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,215
when you think
you have a chance at something.

108
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,842
Like some kind of expectation.

109
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,094
When something's yours, you just know.

110
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,347
Does your heart pound when you get paid?
No, because it's yours.

111
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,809
But when it's not yours
and you know it's not,

112
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,353
but you think you might get it
if things work out…

113
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,230
That's when your heart starts pounding.

114
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,733
Relationships are the same.

115
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,526
Some married couples say,

116
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,695
"I just knew they were the one
at first sight."

117
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,072
If you ask them, they say when they met,

118
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,700
it was like, "You're the one."

119
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,493
Their hearts didn't beat like crazy,

120
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,787
but they were just like, "You're the one."

121
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,956
You just know that it's yours.

122
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,794
Relationships are like that.
There's nothing to long for. It's yours.

123
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,006
Rich people don't yearn
for designer clothes. They just buy them.

124
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:37,887
When you desperately long for something,
your soul already knows deep down

125
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,347
that it's not yours.

126
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,726
You want it, but you know it's not yours.
That's what drives you crazy.

127
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,688
Damn it!

128
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,106
Oh, my God!

129
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,193
So that's why I can't have a car.

130
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,240
Well, tell your soul that you can have it.

131
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,576
You try. You try telling your soul.

132
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,538
That things might work out with her.
You try making your soul admit that.

133
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,460
Damn it.

134
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,259
GYEONGGI SANPO POLICE STATION

135
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,229
Your household register is missing.
Please bring it next time you visit.

136
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,898
But I submitted it last time.

137
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,775
They ask for it every time.

138
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,783
GENERAL AFFAIRS

139
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,994
-All right. Thank you. Have a good day.
-Thank you. You too.

140
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,791
YEOM JE-HO, KWAK HYE-SUK,
YEOM GI-JEONG, YEOM CHANG-HEE

141
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:56,799
Excuse me?

142
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,843
I think there's a mistake here.

143
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,971
There should be five people,
but there are only four.

144
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,104
Four is correct, sir.

145
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,482
But Yeom Mi-Jeong is missing.

146
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,776
Ms. Yeom Mi-Jeong…

147
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,780
recently moved her address.

148
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,160
To where?

149
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,830
I think you should ask your daughter.

150
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:37,423
SANPO SINKS

151
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,846
YEOM JE-HO, KWAK HYE-SUK,
YEOM GI-JEONG, YEOM CHANG-HEE

152
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,253
YEOM MI-JEONG

153
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,095
I'll be late today.
I have a club meeting at work.

154
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,597
Did I tell you what club it is?

155
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,685
It's called The Liberation Club.
It's for people who want to be liberated.

156
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,312
There are only three members.

157
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,988
Mi-Jeong, you're coming with us today.
All right?

158
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,283
I'm definitely putting some
colored varnish on your poor nails today.

159
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,619
I have a club meeting today.

160
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,665
What on earth do you talk
about with two middle-aged men?

161
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,584
She said it's four today.

162
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,586
You already got another member?

163
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,463
The team leader of the Joy Support Center
is sitting in today.

164
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,591
She's even sitting in?

165
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,759
She must be suspecting the same thing.

166
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,638
That they made up a fake club
and actually do nothing.

167
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,392
Just come clean
before they find out it's fake.

168
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,977
Just tell them you're sorry

169
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,688
and come with us
to do our nails. All right?

170
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,523
-Come on.
-Let's do our nails together.

171
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,061
Throw out.

172
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,439
Throw out.

173
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:44,818
Throw out.

174
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,904
Oh, my…

175
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,865
You're organizing things
for real this time?

176
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:54,244
You should've brought stuff home
little by little. How overwhelming.

177
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,080
You know how far I live.

178
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:00,626
When I carry something heavy on
my way home, I just want to throw it away.

179
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,836
I even want
to toss out my own body somewhere.

180
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,546
Throw out.

181
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,798
Throw out.

182
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,468
Hey, can you come over to my office?
I have too much to carry by myself.

183
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,680
What club?

184
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,515
When will you be done?

185
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,684
Damn it!

186
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:18,936
Then what do I do?

187
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,108
After breathing, what I do the most

188
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,444
is look at this watch.

189
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,365
I look at it so often, over and over.

190
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,077
"Time really flies.
Is it this late already?"

191
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,581
Just like that, I look at it all day long.
24 hours a day.

192
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,585
I go to work, finish work, eat, and sleep.
Every day is the same.

193
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,756
So why do I keep looking at my watch?

194
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:55,556
I think I feel a compulsion
to live a productive day,

195
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,392
but there's not much to show for it.

196
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,937
I'm just constantly looking at my watch
and being chased by time.

197
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,110
As soon as I realized
I've lived that way my whole life,

198
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,697
weirdly, my heart suddenly started

199
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:19,329
to pound like thump, thump, thump.

200
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:24,126
Before, it was like bam-bam-bam-bam.

201
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:32,259
I can't believe it took me about 50 years
to realize this.

202
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,434
I'm kind of like that too.

203
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,396
Doesn't everyone
experience something like that?

204
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:49,985
And since you spent
all your time wisely like that,

205
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,653
not wasting a single second,

206
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,782
you were able to become
an important member within the company.

207
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:58,118
"Do not give advice.
Do not try to comfort."

208
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,746
Those are the rules of our club.

209
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,290
Okay, sure.

210
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,377
I may not be able to be completely
liberated from time,

211
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,964
but resting when I've done enough,

212
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,092
and waking up when I've slept enough…

213
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,928
Finding my own rhythm like that

214
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,515
might be the liberation I need the most.

215
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,269
So I've decided
to name my plan "Finding My Own Rhythm."

216
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,857
My time is up.

217
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,321
We divided up the speaking time
by the number of people here.

218
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:38,283
Otherwise only talkative people like me
would speak.

219
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,619
That's nice.

220
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,374
Who's next?

221
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,464
May I?

222
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,841
Sure.

223
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:54,842
Thank you.

224
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,389
STOP FEELING ****

225
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,600
Why is this…

226
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,688
I was worried someone would see.

227
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,822
Someone's been calling you.
Should we take a break?

228
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,906
Shall we?

229
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,449
It's fine. We don't have to.

230
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,535
Let's take a ten-minute break.

231
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,787
-All right.
-Sure, that's fine with me.

232
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,339
I like it.

233
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,301
Now that I've participated,

234
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,596
I can see exactly
what kind of club this is.

235
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,848
I also liked your

236
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,893
"Someone who makes me happy
when I think of them."

237
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,855
It's very good. The Liberation Club.

238
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,482
Excuse me.

239
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,859
Go ahead.

240
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:56,945
Yes.

241
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,406
I've been calling you forever! You…

242
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,701
Come out. I'm here, just come out.

243
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,453
You said you would be done by nine.

244
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,955
It's almost nine, so just come out.

245
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,166
I'm so exhausted.

246
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,669
Just tell them you live far away.
I'm sure they'll let you go.

247
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,341
Hey, what kind of club
has only three people in it?

248
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,219
I have a lot of stuff with me.

249
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,222
So what do I do? Do you want me
to sleep on the street tonight?

250
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,224
-Excuse me.
-Yes. How…

251
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,436
I'm sorry.

252
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,397
Hi.

253
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,524
What are you doing here?

254
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,069
Well, I was meeting someone here.

255
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,820
I see.

256
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,241
Fancy running into you here.

257
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,534
I'm waiting for Mi-Jeong, by the way.

258
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,994
Since I have so much to carry,

259
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,914
we were going to go home together,
but she has some club thing.

260
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,042
But she's never had
any interest in those things.

261
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,503
Oh, my God! You're in the same club,
aren't you?

262
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,545
Well…

263
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,299
-Yes.
-Okay.

264
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,719
Why didn't she tell me that?

265
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,639
-So you're in the same club.
-Yes.

266
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,141
This is Mi-Jeong's sister.

267
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,977
-Okay.
-Okay.

268
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,561
Nice to meet you.

269
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,820
We'll be done soon.
Why don't you wait inside? It's cooler.

270
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,907
Come in. We're almost done.

271
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,452
Shall I?

272
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,080
Carry that for me.

273
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,124
-Let me.
-No, it's…

274
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,046
Those books are as heavy as bricks.

275
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,343
Please, take your time.

276
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,639
Well, shall we wrap it up? She's waiting.

277
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,724
No.

278
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,685
Just finish it up. Take your time.

279
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,146
Don't mind me, and take your time.

280
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,068
Where were we?

281
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,780
I don't think it's necessary
to do this often.

282
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:07,034
Everyone has their own life

283
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,536
-and we have work to do.
-Okay.

284
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,049
After I lost my dad in fifth grade,

285
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,719
I also lost my mom
when I was in sixth grade.

286
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:31,683
When I went to school
after my mom's funeral…

287
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:37,773
the kids made me fight someone.

288
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,734
Someone who could never beat me.

289
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,989
He was big but didn't know how to fight.

290
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,785
But the mood was weird.

291
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,166
It felt like I had to lose.

292
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,002
So…

293
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,214
I let him win.

294
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,053
"So this is what it's like

295
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,472
to have no parents."

296
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,060
It felt like I lost one of my arms

297
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,771
when I lost my dad.

298
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,317
When my mother passed away too…

299
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,530
it felt like both my arms were gone.

300
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,914
What if…

301
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,376
my daughter also…

302
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,506
feels like she's lost an arm?

303
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,654
You're coming home now?

304
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,784
I think you got even prettier today.

305
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,335
I never walked home

306
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,422
when she was younger.

307
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,591
I ran

308
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,759
because I couldn't wait for us to meet.

309
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:35,348
When I arrived,
that little girl would scream with joy.

310
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:40,604
-She would spin around in place.
-Dokdo is our land.

311
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,818
We were both so happy then.

312
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,988
As if we could soar high past the skies.

313
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,455
Ever since my parents passed away,

314
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,167
I've had this feeling of weakness
inside me.

315
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,005
I need to liberate myself
from this feeling

316
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,050
for my daughter to get over it too.

317
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:20,227
STOP FEELING WEAK

318
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,088
What's Cho Tae-hun's phone number?

319
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,426
I just want to ask him something.

320
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,640
He's my friend's little brother.

321
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,398
I'll hunt down
those bastards who put him in that fight.

322
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,822
There's watermelon in the fridge.
Have some after you wash up.

323
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,367
Hey.

324
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,423
I'm so afraid of having someone
who's really precious to me.

325
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,800
I mean, she's just my niece,

326
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:37,095
but I'm so scared
that something might happen to her.

327
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,139
It must be worse for you.

328
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,855
It's amazing how you deal with that fear.

329
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,692
You just do.

330
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,236
You just do when the time comes.

331
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,125
What's wrong? Have a few more drinks.

332
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,043
I'm done.

333
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,303
I'm home.

334
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:20,930
I'm home.

335
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,379
-See you later.
-See you tonight.

336
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,130
All right. Have a good day.

337
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,483
Where did you change your address to?

338
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,155
What do you mean?

339
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,908
She's not on the household register.

340
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,460
My friend asked me…

341
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,631
to change my address to her place.

342
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,969
What for?

343
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,472
My friend…

344
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,978
had filed for bankruptcy,

345
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,814
so she couldn't sign a lease.

346
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,191
So I did it for her.

347
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,403
Are you insane? Seriously.

348
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,324
Move it back to here.

349
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,079
You shouldn't do that,
no matter how close she is.

350
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,915
You should keep your records clean.

351
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,502
Don't deal with people
who ask you to sign things

352
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,755
or ask for you to stand surety for them.

353
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,407
So…

354
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,701
About my dad's store…

355
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,662
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable
for you to manage?

356
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,041
Why would it be? It's fine with me.

357
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,546
Why don't I do it?

358
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,758
-Why don't you give it to me?
-No. I can do it.

359
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,678
I mean,

360
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:09,849
won't it be uncomfortable if the store
owner is your colleague's father?

361
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,976
Uncomfortable? Never.

362
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:16,231
I treat all of the store owners
like my own mother and father.

363
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,233
Gosh.

364
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,568
My dad's hard to deal with.

365
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,488
My dad isn't a walk in the park either.

366
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,618
All right then.

367
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,995
Am I crazy? Why would I give it to her?

368
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,705
The daily revenue there is huge.

369
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,083
Who knows what she'll do with it?

370
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,293
She'll probably plot with her dad

371
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,004
and order tons of the new products
to get a promotion.

372
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,715
She thinks she's the only smart one.

373
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,554
Gosh, you've put a stop
to A-reum's plan for an easy promotion.

374
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,848
Of course.
That store's under my management.

375
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,852
Even A-reum must be the perfect girl
to some guy, right?

376
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,770
She's good at work and makes good money.

377
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,565
That guy will never be my friend.

378
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,359
I'll hate him. I don't even
have to meet him to know that.

379
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,699
Give me a list of the people
who put you in that fight.

380
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,492
I can't just let it slide.

381
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,203
I spent all last night
running simulations in my head.

382
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,872
I've already planned out

383
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,041
all the things I'll do to them,
all the curses I'll say,

384
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,418
and with what expression.

385
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,378
Just give me the list.

386
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,600
I'm good friends with them now.

387
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,687
How? Why? For what reason?

388
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,106
It happened when we were young.

389
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,483
Being young is no excuse.

390
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,444
Just give me the list

391
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,029
so I can at least curse them!

392
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,538
You're my sister's friend. Why don't you…

393
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,924
I'll find out myself at all costs.

394
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,098
I've…

395
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,559
got to run now.

396
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,436
Have a good lunch.

397
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,505
I was wondering if anything else
might be sent in the mail.

398
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,384
I can't let my family find out.

399
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,012
Mail is sent when there's a delinquency,

400
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:56,724
a change in the interest rate,
or if a notice needs to be given.

401
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,772
What about filing a lawsuit?

402
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,733
Your account has the transaction records.

403
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,527
You can file a lawsuit with that.

404
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,658
You can't keep paying it off for him
forever like this.

405
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,410
It's not a small amount.

406
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,838
HANJO BANK

407
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,683
My family is about to find out that
I took out a loan to lend you money.

408
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,269
We need to talk today. Call me.

409
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,898
Hey. Aren't you going home?

410
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,737
-No, I'm going to head out later.
-Why?

411
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,947
I have plans.

412
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,366
Plans? That's rare.

413
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,451
See you tomorrow.

414
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,119
-See you.
-Bye.

415
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,846
I'm not going home until you pick up.

416
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,451
Hello?

417
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,287
It's me, Se-yeong.

418
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,541
Why are you picking up?

419
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,629
I have nothing to talk about with you.

420
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,757
Let me talk to Chan-hyeok.

421
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,553
I'm really sorry, Mi-jeong,

422
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,515
but Chan-hyeok really doesn't have money.

423
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,725
He honestly doesn't.

424
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,853
I had him come over
because he might actually die

425
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,688
if he stayed in Korea.

426
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,443
Soon, my cards will be frozen,

427
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,862
and I'll become a delinquent borrower.

428
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,242
Why should I become a delinquent borrower?

429
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,496
I'm really sorry,

430
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,915
but I don't know what to do.

431
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:31,629
I'm also living from hand to mouth.

432
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,011
-Who is it?
-It's nothing.

433
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,429
Tell me who it is.

434
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,598
-Give it here.
-Just leave it.

435
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,975
I said, give it to me!

436
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,527
What are you two doing over there?

437
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,115
I guess you had the money to fly there?

438
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,034
I came to sell my organs.

439
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,208
I guess you haven't sold any yet?

440
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,925
I'll be a delinquent borrower soon.
Then I'll have to quit my job.

441
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,388
Your family has money, don't they?

442
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,893
They can pay it off for you so why would
you become a delinquent borrower?

443
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,190
Why should I ask my family
when it's your fault?

444
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,403
I'll pay you back.
But since it's urgent, pay it first.

445
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,322
I'll pay you back later.

446
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:43,034
What do you expect me to do?
I literally have no money right now.

447
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,247
Whatever you do,
you can make at least 1,500,000 won.

448
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,543
Hey, do you think you're the only one
asking me to pay them back?

449
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,423
I'm trying my best to make money, but
they're chasing me and ruining everything,

450
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,967
telling me to cough it up immediately.

451
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,803
How can I do that
unless I steal it from somewhere?

452
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,057
They blame me if I sleep,
they blame me if I eat.

453
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,976
Unless I starve to death,
they'll never believe me.

454
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:13,564
Stop trying to say I'm not
paying you back because I don't want to!

455
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,654
How could you do this to me?

456
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,033
How could you do this to me?

457
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,290
Don't. Stop it!

458
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,212
Stop it!

459
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,758
I don't know how it got like this.

460
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,721
I just decided to focus on one thing only.

461
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,556
Jung Chan-hyeok…

462
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,101
I won't let him die while he's by my side.

463
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,955
Drink slowly.

464
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,420
It's me, you know. It's exactly me.

465
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,214
No one could feel weak
if they were with me.

466
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,718
I'm the pick-up girl,
the girl who's like a Jindo dog.

467
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,847
All he has to do is be with me.

468
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,641
I want to tell him it's me so badly.

469
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,236
You know, I really want to tell him
to go out with me right now.

470
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,489
Should I just say it?

471
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,745
What?

472
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,747
Why shouldn't I?

473
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,332
Who said you shouldn't?

474
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,293
Hey, I'm turning 40 soon.

475
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,337
I decided to love anyone this winter.

476
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,173
But he isn't just anyone,
not by a long shot.

477
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,633
He's a genuinely decent guy.

478
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,760
Tell him if you want to.

479
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,515
How can someone change so much
in just one month?

480
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,101
Remember what you said here a month ago?

481
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,771
Hey, where can you buy a gun in Korea?

482
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,523
A slap in his face won't cut it.

483
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,400
I should just put three bullets in him.

484
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,699
Time's a fickle friend, right?

485
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:02,460
Why is it so difficult
to tell someone you like them?

486
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,880
It's not like you're telling them
you hate them.

487
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:11,218
Because your soul knows
you're going to get rejected for sure.

488
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,557
If you hesitate to say something
but then actually say it,

489
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,601
you're guaranteed to regret it.

490
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,729
You hesitate
because you know you shouldn't say it.

491
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,484
But you still end up saying it
and making yourself miserable.

492
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,863
Humans are really nonsensical animals,
you know?

493
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,244
Du-hwan.

494
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,999
Stray puppy, egg white, one-won coin.

495
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:45,711
What's wrong with you,
you unbearably old-fashioned egg white?

496
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,423
Don't do it.

497
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,677
Just don't.

498
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,430
You know what Gi-Jeong said?

499
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:01,143
She wanted to get a gun to shoot someone
because they told her they liked her.

500
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,024
She wanted to shoot anyone
who smiled or winked at her.

501
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,651
She was always looking for a gun.

502
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,653
If someone below her standards liked her,

503
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,738
she would go off
as if they had insulted her.

504
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,365
Girls, you know?

505
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,368
If a guy they think is below them
says he likes them,

506
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,703
they get deeply insulted.

507
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,499
Every girl in the world is like that.

508
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:25,751
Except Hyeon-a.

509
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,630
Everyone used to like her
when we were in school, right?

510
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:33,676
Seriously, literally everyone, including
some weirdos, said they liked her.

511
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,097
She was so kind even to them.

512
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,683
Even when she was rejecting them.

513
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,310
When we were in college,

514
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:46,438
I saw her get rejected by guys
a few times.

515
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,024
But she didn't…

516
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,696
She didn't even get mad, you know?

517
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,283
She didn't even get embarrassed
or anything.

518
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,994
She always used to be grateful

519
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,538
to the boys who liked her at school
when she was young.

520
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,707
So she assumes others feel that way.

521
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:08,627
That's why Hyeon-a is the only one of us
who's always dating.

522
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,213
Yeom Gi-jeong?
She's going to love anyone this winter?

523
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,592
I don't think so. She can't.
Nothing's happened so far.

524
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,678
There's no way someone decent
will ask her out all of a sudden.

525
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:22,933
That means she has to ask first.
Someone decent or literally anyone.

526
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,769
But how will she,
knowing what she's done in her life?

527
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,647
Maybe the guy will end up
shooting her dead.

528
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:34,778
What I'm saying is that it's her karma.

529
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,449
But you went out with anyone too easily.

530
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,242
Mi-rim really wasn't a good idea.

531
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,202
I had no choice. She said she liked me.

532
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,872
But still. I can't believe you dated her.

533
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,206
Hey, that's enough.

534
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,042
She's someone's mom now.

535
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,376
I'm home.

536
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,507
-You're here.
-Hey.

537
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,937
Who asked who out first?

538
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,317
With Mr. Gu, I mean.

539
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:17,946
I did.

540
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,662
I didn't ask him to go out with me.

541
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,500
I told him to worship me.

542
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:31,877
What?

543
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,421
I told him to worship me.

544
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:24,012
SLIDE TO ANSWER

545
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:28,767
Yes?

546
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,186
Hello?

547
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,814
Yes, what?

548
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,650
Hey, you asshole. How could you…

549
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:42,322
How could you ignore a message
from your brother saying he was dying?

550
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:47,911
If I were really dying,
I would've killed you before I died.

551
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,539
Where are you hiding?
Are you even in Seoul?

552
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:57,671
Sam-sik ran into
Chairman Shin at a funeral recently.

553
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,716
Apparently, he asked
if he was in contact with you.

554
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,095
You know he's not important enough
to be able to talk to the chairman.

555
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,098
But it seemed the old man
followed him to the restroom.

556
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:14,730
I'm hearing that Mr. Baek
has fallen out of favor with the chairman.

557
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:20,402
If we just step in here,
it'll be over for Mr. Baek.

558
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,532
Hey, are you listening?

559
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,243
How's Ssaebi doing?

560
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:29,620
Ssaebi?

561
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,455
Yes.

562
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,791
How would I know?
I haven't seen him in ages either.

563
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,085
Why do you ask about Ssaebi?

564
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,088
Did someone take your money?

565
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,008
How much?

566
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,350
NAME: YEOM MI-JEONG

567
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,985
Have you looked into this?
You'd probably be at the top of the list.

568
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,573
I just want to close the account.

569
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,247
It will mature in four months.

570
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,261
HANJO BANK
LOAN PAYMENT RECEIPT

571
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,727
Thank you.

572
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,566
Miss.

573
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,693
Cheer up.

574
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,042
DANGMI TOWN OFFICE

575
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,143
Did you buy something?

576
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,854
Why are you here at this hour?

577
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:24,359
I had something to take care of.
I asked for a half-day off.

578
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,697
You must have finished early today.

579
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,466
It's not that hot today.

580
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,718
Seems like summer's almost over.

581
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,494
I've changed my address back.

582
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,247
What if more mail comes?

583
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,375
That won't happen.

584
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,794
I sorted it out.

585
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,172
Did you pay it off for him?

586
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,842
He says he'll pay me back later.

587
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,514
I'm sure he will.

588
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,186
What's this asshole's name?

589
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,108
Don't worry. He says he will.

590
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,112
I just need his name and phone number.

591
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,948
I won't do it myself.
Someone else will do it.

592
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,082
Are you still not over him?

593
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,005
You're scaring me.

594
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,507
Why don't you sit down?

595
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,013
How far do you want me to go?

596
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,642
You could've just told me that I dealt
with it well without making a mess.

597
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,062
Why do you keep bringing me down?

598
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,984
I'm the kind of idiot,

599
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,654
you only see on the internet
that gives money away to guys.

600
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:19,117
Do you want my parents and
everyone in the world to know that?

601
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:25,248
You're scared of that, aren't you?

602
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,629
That bastard knows you are.
That's why he's doing this to you.

603
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,264
After money got involved,

604
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,352
he treated me like some headache,
but I put up with it.

605
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:49,940
Whenever he was annoyed,
it felt like it was all my fault.

606
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:53,819
I felt guilty asking him to pay me back.

607
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,864
It feels like it's my fault
for getting myself in this situation.

608
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,534
That's just who I am.

609
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,913
I can never understand those
who help women divorce

610
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,707
and rip off their problematic husbands.

611
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,836
Just leave me be.

612
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,006
Even if I look like an idiot,
just leave me be.

613
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,925
Don't try to help me unless I ask you.

614
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,763
People like me can't see things to an end
with people the way you want.

615
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:26,059
Even fighting with someone is hard for me.

616
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:28,645
So how can you expect me
to fight him to the end?

617
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,735
You don't seem to have a problem
fighting with me.

618
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,155
Because…

619
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,241
you like me.

620
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,922
You can do anything
in front of someone who likes you.

621
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,428
That's why

622
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:04,514
you should worship an idiot like me.

623
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,268
So I can get so confident
that I might even come to love myself

624
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,480
and be able to tell that bastard
everything I want to say.

625
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,442
I want you to make me that person.

626
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,945
Someone who doesn't worry
about other people knowing

627
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,323
and doesn't care what others think.

628
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,451
So worship me.

629
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:49,893
Eat.

630
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,031
You were trembling.

631
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,950
Come eat.

632
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,208
This is me worshiping you.

633
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,001
Come eat.

634
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,184
Water.

635
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,802
You'll be surprised if you find out
what kind of person I am.

636
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,263
You know?

637
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,060
I'm a scary person.

638
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,814
I won't even blink
if I was stabbed in the stomach.

639
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,110
But…

640
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,321
you scare me.

641
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,909
I get nervous when you're in front of me.

642
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,163
And that annoys me
because it makes me feel like an idiot.

643
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,292
But even though it annoys me…

644
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,420
I still wait for you.

645
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:44,215
Okay?

646
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,761
You should know,

647
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,471
Yeom Mi-jeong.

648
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,599
You should know who you are.

649
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,695
Keep going. I like it.

650
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,740
They're strays.

651
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,618
Seems like they were abandoned.

652
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,998
They must think it's safe there
since it's an open area.

653
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,750
They sleep there even when it rains.

654
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,337
They must have had owners once.

655
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:18,643
Don't go near them. It's better
not to get close to a barking dog.

656
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,030
You got this.

657
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:52,802
Why are my emotions like this?

658
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,597
They just do whatever they want.

659
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,225
Nothing's happened, but they're just…

660
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,853
Does it make sense?

661
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,982
This isn't in my control.

662
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,734
Something must be broken.

663
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,285
It's fine.

664
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,247
I may fall in love easily,
but I can hate people just as easily.

665
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,917
I fall in love in the morning
and hate them by the evening.

666
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,668
One day, I'll be like this again,

667
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,505
"That was close.
I'm so glad nothing happened."

668
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:34,177
The day I feel nothing will come.
It'll be like I never liked anyone.

669
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,060
Which one do you prefer?

670
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,188
Having no emotions just like before,

671
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,690
or being frustrated
since you like somebody?

672
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,862
Damn it.

673
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,908
This is driving me nuts.

674
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,245
Why don't you just tell him?

675
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,915
Nicely and politely.

676
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:08,586
I don't think I can.

677
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,256
Why not?

678
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,809
But how will she,
knowing what she's done in her life?

679
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:27,730
She wanted to get a gun to shoot someone
because they told her they liked her.

680
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,732
So how can she tell anyone she likes them?

681
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,610
Maybe the guy will end up
shooting her dead.

682
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:37,532
She treated a guy who liked her so badly
because he was below her standard.

683
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,035
She must be scared to be treated that way.

684
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:56,134
There are so many people like me.

685
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:58,011
I'm not the only one.

686
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:02,515
But why does it
feel like I'm the only one?

687
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,703
Please stay beside me

688
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:30,126
Please don't leave me

689
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,806
It's been a while since I had a good cry.

690
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,751
I'm so sorry.

691
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,464
I was arrogant and rude.

692
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:20,843
To those people who got cursed at
for telling me their feelings,

693
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,096
I'm sincerely praying for forgiveness.

694
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,056
I was wrong.

695
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:27,016
I'm so sorry.

696
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,353
If you still have a scar on your heart,

697
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:33,606
I pray that it will be healed tonight.

698
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,694
I sincerely wish for your happiness.

699
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,112
Thank you.

700
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,447
Thank you so much
for ever liking someone like me.

701
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,407
Thank you.

702
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:46,494
Thank you. I hope you can forgive me
for everything.

703
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,295
I'll get going.

704
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,094
See you later.

705
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:20,820
See you later.

706
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,036
YEOM JE-HO, KWAK HYE-SUK

707
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,747
YEOM GI-JEONG, YEOM CHANG-HEE

708
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:31,873
YEOM MI-JEONG

709
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,963
See you tonight.

710
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:59,567
SANPO SINKS

711
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,290
What?

712
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,375
Hey, wait.

713
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:19,462
Wait. Hey, wait! Me too!

714
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:20,421
Hey!

715
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,633
Me too.

716
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:26,594
Scooch over.

717
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:41,901
TOWN BUS STOP
SANPO

718
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:50,076
What? When did you get here?

719
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:53,996
Her boyfriend gave us a ride.

720
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,186
Don't tell me…

721
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,899
Does he have a lot of problems?

722
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,484
You always do that
when something is difficult to say.

723
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,321
A good aesthetic sense?
It's something you're born with.

724
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,114
Tell your boyfriend about him.

725
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:12,909
Do you really do it?

726
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,870
"You are the greatest of all time.
You're incredibly magnificent."

727
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,622
I might do something wild.

728
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,123
I have somewhere to go.

729
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:20,750
-Where?
-Sanpo.

730
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,418
I missed you.

731
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:24,921
I guess you really are in Gyeonggi-do.

732
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:27,590
He'll ransack the area soon.

733
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:35,348
Yeom Mi-jeong's imagination comes true.

734
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:42,438
