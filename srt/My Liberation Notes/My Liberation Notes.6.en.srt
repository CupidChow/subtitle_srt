1
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,720
-I'm home.
-Hey. Did you eat?

2
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,971
I did.

3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,601
I'm home.

4
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,187
You girls came home together? Did you eat?

5
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,939
I ate.

6
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,612
Fold your own clothes, okay?

7
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,573
I can't do any more of this. Gosh.

8
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,826
Goodness.

9
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,162
She must be out of her mind.

10
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,867
Good morning.

11
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,915
We're giving out free glasses
to the customers who buy soju.

12
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,166
Should I get you a set?

13
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,503
They're pretty nice.
It's a set of four, and they're pretty.

14
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,507
I'll get you one.

15
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,650

Get in.

00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,503
I'll see you later.

19
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,607
It's nice to be in a car
with someone else driving for once.

20
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,991
I got some money. Is there anything
you want to eat? This is Gu.

21
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,537
Pork cutlets.

22
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,998
I know a place near the station.

SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

27
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,333
Tell the store owners
to keep this special term a secret.

28
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,334
Got it.

29
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,921
They know we give rental assistance
to the stores with high sales,

30
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,673
but they'll get jealous
if they see it happen around them.

31
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,674
I know.

32
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,760
Have him sign it by this week if you can

33
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,720
before other chains make better offers.

34
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,474
He may not sign it,
but he won't switch over to a competitor.

35
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,729
Five years?

36
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:42,443
Hey. I'll be 83 in five years.

37
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,155
Who knows if I'll still be around then?

38
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,574
Come on, everybody lives
to be over 80 these days.

39
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,118
Not everyone.

40
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,455
Look. I got this pair of shoes
for 160,000 won,

41
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,042
but they tried to sell me
two pairs for 240,000 won.

42
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,504
Who are they kidding?
One pair will be enough until I die.

43
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,049
I buy only one pair of underwear
at a time too.

44
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,344
They'll all go to waste when I die,
so why stock up?

45
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,099
I mean, it wouldn't be surprising
even if I died today.

46
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,184
Five years?

47
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,853
Jeez.

48
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,189
When I die,

49
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:25,820
one of my kids will have to
come and clean this place up.

50
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,614
The thought of it keeps me up at night.

51
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,243
"Just two more years to go."

52
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,537
"Just one more, and I'm done."

53
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,249
That's how I completed my contract.
But you bring me a new one?

54
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,172
Should I bring you
a ten-year contract then?

55
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,551
Keep telling yourself, "Just one more
year," and you'll live ten more years.

56
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,762
And when it ends,
sign another ten-year contract.

57
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,972
You might as well curse at me.

58
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,518
Then are you going to give up the store
that makes you ten million per month?

59
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,146
Like you said, you don't know
when you're going to go.

60
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,234
I've made enough money.

61
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,571
More than enough.

62
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,116
I should pack it in
while I can do it myself.

63
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,204
I'm done.

64
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,998
See if anyone wants to take over.

65
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,714
Why don't you do it?

66
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:41,145
DAD

67
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,029
DAD

68
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,364
CALLING
DAD

69
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,834
Shoot, hang on.

70
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,295
Damn it.

71
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,181
We can manage the store directly,
so make sure the word doesn't get out.

72
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,307
Yes, sir.

73
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,434
All right, bye.

74
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,816
It's 300 million for the deposit
and the premium?

75
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,109
That's a really good deal.

76
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,278
They earn five million won daily.

77
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,655
And the monthly net profit
is eight to ten million.

78
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,449
Just talk to your dad about it.

79
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,618
He'll have to sell his land
to come up with 300 million.

80
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,830
Do you really think he'd do that
to run a convenience store?

81
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,208
I already asked him once when the store
in Yeoksam-dong became available.

82
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,003
He called me an ingrate
who wants to sell our family land.

83
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,673
How else would we make 10 million a month
with a 300-million investment?

84
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,011
He never listens.
He won't believe me or listen to me.

85
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,721
Even if it rained money

86
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,432
and everyone in the country
started picking them up,

87
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,517
I'm sure he'd just be
working at his warehouse.

88
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,523
I mean, I respect that.
What else can I do?

89
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,571
What about you?
You should take over if you can.

90
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,240
You think I have 300 million?

91
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,075
Can't you take out a loan?

92
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,828
You think I have the assets
to borrow 300 million with?

93
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,999
What about your friend, Du-hwan?

94
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,669
All he has is his house.
I can't ask him to sell it.

95
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,756
This is driving me crazy.

96
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,883
Ten million per month
is right in front of me.

97
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,929
How come everyone I love
doesn't have any money?

98
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,229
Don't you ever end up loving me. Got it?

99
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:26,977
Han Su-jin.

100
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:28,813
Kim Ji-hui.

101
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,440
Park Bo-bae.

102
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:33,818
Park Sin-yeong.

103
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,449
Good going.

104
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,285
You printed out your plane tickets
using the company printer?

105
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,462
Guam?

106
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,257
Must be nice to go on a trip to Guam.

107
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,893
By the way,

108
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,272
why aren't you
going along with them, Mi-jeong?

109
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,180
-Hyeok!
-Yes, sir.

110
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,389
What's for lunch today?

111
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,974
How about the usual?

112
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,519
Aren't you going for lunch?

113
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,359
What do we do?

114
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,072
I'm still not going to quit.

115
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:47,451
The way people look at me
when I come in and out of this building.

116
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,246
That's enough for me.

117
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,415
I used to envy people who work here.

118
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,627
"I want to work at a place like that."

119
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,797
And I work at that place now.

120
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,048
That's enough for me.

121
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,969
No one knows what I go through in here.

122
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,097
Who cares what my employee number
begins with?

123
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:12,059
I'm just relieved
I don't have to wear a different lanyard.

124
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,937
Other companies have temps
wear different colored lanyards,

125
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,814
so it's humiliating to be seen wearing.

126
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,525
Even the nearby store owners can tell

127
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,569
whether you're a regular employee
or a temp.

128
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,615
They wouldn't have invited me
even if I was a regular employee.

129
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,244
Because I don't own a bikini.

130
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,771
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

131
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,857
It's just outside of Seoul.

132
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,818
I feel better when I see this.

133
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,418
I'll drive.

Damn it.

143
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,798
Shoot. Let's take some out.

144
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,471
Why were you keeping all these bottles?

145
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,224
You should've had us throw them out.

146
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,434
You're not collecting these, are you?

147
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,355
Just leave them.

148
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,524
It won't take long.

149
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,652
Why don't you take a shower?
We'll take them to the junk shop.

150
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,871
I said, leave them.

151
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,585
But it'll only take a minute.

152
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,464
If someone wanted to clean up your shit,
would you like that?

153
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,730
Shouldn't we put these back?

00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,499
Stop staring.

164
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:54,878
Hey.

165
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,839
I'm the one
who decided to love just anyone.

166
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,468
You literally picked just anyone.

167
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,348
Hanging out with Dumbo as a kid
made you develop terrible taste in men.

168
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,602
We live in a small town.
What are you going to do?

169
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,109
What are you so afraid of?

170
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,906
You've been picky with men all your life.
Where has that gotten you?

171
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,701
You said our mistake was that

172
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,912
we passed on guys
without giving them a try as practice,

173
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,373
and that's why
nothing ever happened to us.

174
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,250
And?

175
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,585
I'm going to practice now.

176
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,172
What could you practice
with that alcoholic?

177
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,468
Don't say he's not an alcoholic.

178
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,721
And don't say I drink more than him.

179
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,017
Gi-jeong.

180
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,393
You be quiet.

181
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:04,948
Hey.

182
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,285
Yes, a little.

183
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,704
Yes, go wait at my place then.

184
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,207
It's going to be a while.

185
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,751
Yes.

186
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,420
There's some pizza in the freezer.

187
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,422
Yes.

188
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,426
Weren't you going to break up with him?

189
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,803
I did.

190
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,308
Come on, don't be so square.

191
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,061
Hey, don't hang out with her anymore.

192
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,979
You stay away from Mi-jeong from now on.

193
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,106
You've become like her.

194
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,702
When I was dating Chan-hyeok,

195
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,457
he said he'd quit his job
and start a business of his own.

196
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,959
That made me happy.

197
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,466
Because then I could tell people
that my boyfriend

198
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,052
ran his own business.

199
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,554
I thought it sounded cool.

200
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,058
But then,

201
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,269
when he became very successful,

202
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,647
it made me anxious.

203
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,858
We weren't even married yet.

204
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:29,074
Then hise business began dwindle
because he sold defective products.

205
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,287
So I tried to be nicer to him than ever.

206
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,710
It felt like he knew I was relieved.

207
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,924
I was looking for someone

208
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,885
who'd make me look like a better person.

209
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,972
A boyfriend who'd make me look better.

210
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,852
Even with all my picking and choosing,

211
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,272
I never fully supported him.

212
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,650
I wanted him
to be more successful than I was,

213
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,361
but not too much.

214
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,868
I've never given my everything
to someone or vice versa.

215
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,708
I'll never do something like that again.

216
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,378
If my partner finds success
and I'm afraid of losing him,

217
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,297
I'll gladly let him go.

218
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,382
Even if he hits rock bottom,

219
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,926
I won't be embarrassed of him.

220
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,470
Even if everyone points the finger at him,

221
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,849
I'll treat him as I always did

222
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,602
and just support him.

223
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,150
Even our own parents

224
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,028
never gave us that kind of support.

225
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,299
Why are you crying?

226
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,553
Hey.

227
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,934
Can I order chicken gizzards?

228
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,354
Go ahead.

229
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,523
One plate of chicken gizzards, please!

230
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,297
Listen, Dad.

231
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,426
I'm just telling you this

232
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,180
because I think I'll regret it if I don't.

233
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:01,893
This is just a suggestion
so please hear me out.

234
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,442
There's a good store that's become
available. The deposit is 300 million.

235
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,404
The owner makes a net profit
of eight to ten million per month.

236
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,073
He's run the store for ten years

237
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,325
so he's earned at least a billion won.

238
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,454
If you want me to bring you
the sales records to prove it, I can.

239
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,833
Now, you might ask
why the owner is quitting then.

240
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,710
He's turning 80 soon.

241
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,546
He has two kids. One lives in the U.S.
and the other in Yeosu.

242
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,964
Neither can take over.

243
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,093
This is not for my sake.

244
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,596
If you think I want to quit my job
and make easy money with the store,

245
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,597
that's not it.

246
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,392
It's finders keepers. It's up for grabs.

247
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,728
Many people want this kind of information,

248
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,565
but he asked me first
because I'm the manager in charge.

249
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,320
If you're interested, this is
a great investment opportunity for you.

250
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,375
I can make a living just fine on my own.

251
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,502
If you want to do it,

252
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:13,131
come up with 300 million
and do it yourself. I won't stop you.

253
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,145
Okay.

254
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,877
I'll give you the money if you want.

255
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,965
If I divorce your dad,
I'll probably get 300 million at least.

256
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:59,010
I didn't mean that I wanted to do it.

257
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,304
Everyone else makes
their money grow this way.

258
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,602
Why is my family always like this?

259
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,653
Please enjoy.

260
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,321
-Thank you.
-It looks delicious.

261
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,031
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

262
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,951
-Hello.
-Oh, hey.

263
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,499
Where's Gyeong-seon?

264
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,542
She'll be late.

265
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,504
He found the remote
for the air conditioner.

266
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,590
-Wait, hold on.
-Thank you.

267
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,135
He should stop rummaging.
Who knows what he might find?

268
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,220
-What do you want? Beer?
-That's it.

269
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,182
We'll have this and…

270
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,029
-Give me my beer.
-Let me.

271
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,703
You should've asked me for it.

272
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,372
I figured you'd be tired.

273
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:13,084
I only help out on busy days.
We don't get too many days like today.

274
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:14,878
Apologize!

275
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,880
They have fun like this. What's with them?

276
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,006
Look.

277
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,051
I didn't know people actually said that
in everyday life.

278
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,430
Is it just me,
or does that make you uncomfortable too?

279
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,849
It makes me uncomfortable too.

280
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:28,767
Right?

281
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,770
I mean, I had this thing
with a researcher at work.

282
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,438
She said, "Apologize."

283
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:37,025
My heart started pounding,
and I couldn't say anything.

284
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,027
Like, "what did I do that was so wrong?"

285
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:44,991
I think it's okay to say, "I'm offended,
and what you did was wrong."

286
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,702
But when you say, "Apologize,"

287
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,330
it's like coming to a conclusion
without even arguing

288
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,583
that you're the victim,
and they're the offender.

289
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,709
Right? Exactly.

290
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,586
Jeez, you're right.

291
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,381
When I heard that, it felt like
I had been sentenced to death,

292
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,927
had fallen into a pit,
and had cement poured down on me.

293
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,179
It felt like I was someone
who deserved that

294
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,056
so I couldn't sleep at all that night.

295
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,393
The worst part is
that I apologized to her the next day.

296
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,229
I didn't even know what I did wrong.

297
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,315
You're too nice.

298
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,444
That woman knows how much
those words throw people off.

299
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,114
Is asking for an apology
a new way of arguing with people?

300
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,574
Maybe it's like throwing the first punch.

301
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,371
Apologizing used to be
such an awesome thing to do.

302
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,372
Right?

303
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,498
Yes.

304
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:37,210
It used to be an act of bravery

305
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,380
that took self-reflection
and was excruciatingly painful.

306
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,550
I don't know when it turned

307
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,261
into such a cowardly thing
that's forced upon you.

308
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:52,183
You never really see
those brave, touching apologies anymore.

309
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:56,145
It makes me quite sad.

310
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,653
By the way, I'd like to apologize.

311
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:07,824
For that day.

312
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,828
You did. You even gave me
ten lottery tickets.

313
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:16,082
No, I didn't do it properly.
I just glossed over it.

314
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,044
You said getting married was
the best thing you'd ever done.

315
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,506
And that if you hadn't, you would never
have had such a lovely daughter.

316
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,009
It's been weighing on my mind
for a long time.

317
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,469
I realized I was wrong.

318
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,847
It's such a valuable relationship to you.

319
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,475
I shouldn't have mocked it like that.
I'm sorry.

320
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,561
Don't be. It's all right.

321
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,104
No, I'm really sorry.

322
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,522
It's really okay.

323
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,985
I think I should apologize
to your daughter as well.

324
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,695
Gosh, please don't.

325
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,489
It'd be better not to.

326
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,618
Are you trying to heat up the beer?

327
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,537
Jeez, what is she doing,
hugging them like that?

328
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,790
Three draft beers, please.

329
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,334
Coming right up.

330
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:00,919
Okay then.

331
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,601
You can only date someone
who scores a hundred points

332
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,145
only when you can date
someone who's a zero.

333
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,148
You always look for someone on your level.

334
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:26,527
Maybe 64,238? Somewhere around that.

335
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,489
Honestly, I score 78 at the least.

336
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,658
That's what you think.

337
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,242
No, I really would.

338
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,371
Just forget about the grading system.

339
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,290
My point is, don't limit yourself.

340
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,459
You have the whole world
trying to limit you.

341
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,462
So why would you want
to do that to yourself?

342
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,298
You're so cute.

343
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,511
You're so adorable.

344
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,722
I'm just trying to help you.

345
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,432
Don't drink by yourself.

346
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,147
I'll be home late tonight.

347
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,024
I'm having a drink with my sister.

348
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,492
I can't help but wait
for you to text me back.

349
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,371
But I won't let get to me

350
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,873
and do the same to get even with you.

351
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,628
I've always tried to silently
get even with my ex-boyfriends.

352
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,131
I'm done with it.

353
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,645
I love that
I don't have to measure your affection.

354
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,773
All I need to do is worship you.

355
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,651
I love it.

356
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,569
AVAILABLE

357
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:06,646
Hello.

358
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:25,623
God. I ran into Mr. Gu on my way here,
and it was so awkward.

359
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,669
I even rehearsed
what I'd do if I ran into him.

360
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,380
But I never thought
he'd suddenly show up in front of me.

361
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,423
He totally caught me off guard.

362
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:39,971
He was getting closer, and I didn't know
if I should turn my head or not.

363
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,474
Then I missed the right timing
and greeted him so awkwardly.

364
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,689
Well, Chang-hee told me to come over
to his house yesterday,

365
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,566
I was so shocked.

366
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,027
There was a dazzling light
coming from his room.

367
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,655
I thought there was an alien in there.

368
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,741
His room was full of empty soju bottles.

369
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,787
It was so hot in there too,
with the sun beating down on it.

370
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,957
So we tried to clean it up,
but he got mad at us for it.

371
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,252
Well, he didn't really flip out,
but anyway…

372
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,755
Jeez, he got angry at us
for trying to clean his room.

373
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,465
It was so embarrassing.

374
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,428
Did he ask for your help?

375
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,936
Did he ask you to throw them out?

376
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,567
If not, why would you do that?

377
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,319
Then what? I couldn't ignore it.

378
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,286
It's arrogant how you're
trying to change him.

379
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,915
Wait, arrogant?

380
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,208
You got it all wrong.

381
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,668
It was an amount
he couldn't throw out by himself.

382
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,338
That's also the amount of alcohol
he had by himself.

383
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,547
And he got caught.

384
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,508
"Got caught?"
It's not like we didn't know about it.

385
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,389
All the neighbors know.

386
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,605
Move over.

387
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,910
SANPO SINKS

388
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,537
-You got it?
-Yes.

389
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,886
Wait and see.
I'm going to get rid of them later.

390
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,514
Hurry up. Let's get it done
while he's out.

391
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,057
Don't.

392
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,075
Boy, she must've drunk a lot last night.

393
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,054
Hello, sir.

394
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,140
Yes.

395
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,560
What? When?

396
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:38,774
But…

397
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,942
Right.

398
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,807
I got a call from the store owner.

399
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,019
Someone has already signed
a lease contract with the landlord.

400
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,979
I think the landlord listed it for lease

401
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,023
when he heard
the store owner was quitting.

402
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,567
Why would he do that
without even discussing it?

403
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,321
Find out who signed the lease
and for what kind of business.

404
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,865
We can't lose that spot.

405
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:28,824
Yes, sir.

406
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,452
All right.

407
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,501
SANPO SINKS

408
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,598
I should've kept my distance.

409
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,767
I let them in too much.

410
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,654
Sometimes I'm okay with it.

411
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:11,909
But other times…

412
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,831
I hate the sight of people
moving around in front of me.

413
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,711
I hate it more when they start talking.

414
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,509
I have to listen to their gibberish
and have to say gibberish back to them.

415
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,388
What should I say?

416
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,434
It's taxing to think of what to say next.

417
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,397
I feel the same way.

418
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:48,779
Out of the 24 hours in a day,
I only feel okay

419
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,157
for about a couple.

420
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,910
And it's not like I even feel good,
I just feel okay.

421
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:59,707
I just try to get through the rest.

422
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,839
It's been like that since I was little.

423
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,925
When I looked at the kids
running around happily,

424
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,511
I was upset even at that young age.

425
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,389
"What are they so happy about?"

426
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,726
"Why am I not happy like them?"

427
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:23,105
"I eat and sleep. Eat and sleep."

428
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,234
"Why do I have
to waste such a long amount of time?"

429
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:32,990
I'd be perfectly okay if I only
got to live 8 years instead of 80.

430
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,121
I don't do anything
but I'm already exhausted.

431
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,297
Still, I drag myself along,

432
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,176
like driven cattle.

433
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,304
"Let's keep going."

434
00:41:56,472 --> 00:42:00,434
"I don't know why I have to live,

435
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:04,230
but let's have a decent life
while I'm alive."

436
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:10,027
That's how I barely manage to drag myself

437
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,446
every day.

438
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:17,993
A cattle drive?

439
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,703
A cattle drive…

440
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,707
You must have seen it before.

441
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,252
A few times as a kid.

442
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,151
Ice cream?

443
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,113
I bought it

444
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,365
because I was drunk.

445
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,957
When I'm drunk,

446
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,085
I'm more human than I am when I'm sober.

447
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,886
I like that.

448
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,401
I didn't put it up for lease.

449
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,570
The real estate agency called me first

450
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,156
to ask if the store owner
was closing down his store.

451
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:22,159
I didn't know what they were
talking about, so I asked him,

452
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,870
and he said he really was quitting.

453
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,664
But I didn't tell the agency.

454
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,625
Why would I do that
when I'm not the landlord?

455
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,251
It wasn't me either.

456
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:36,423
But they said someone who knew about it
came to rent this place.

457
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,551
Do you know what kind of business
they want to do here?

458
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,887
A convenience store.

459
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,557
Do you know which chain?

460
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,726
This chain. The same one.

461
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,357
Apparently, their daughter
works at the head office for this company.

462
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,983
She used to manage this store.

463
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:57,736
Gosh.

464
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,617
She came here a couple of days ago.

465
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,327
Damn it.

466
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,627
You could've told me at least.

467
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:21,176
I didn't know my dad would go
and sign the lease right away.

468
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,847
I just stopped by the store
to say hi to the owner,

469
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,266
and he told me he was going to quit.

470
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,684
All I told my dad was

471
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:32,938
I don't get why he's quitting
when the store is doing so well.

472
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,774
I really didn't know
he'd rent the place right away.

473
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:36,984
You didn't know?

474
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,528
Do you expect me to believe that?

475
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,864
His daughter works at the head office.

476
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:45,075
What kind of father signs the lease
without checking with her first?

477
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,287
He even knew
to contact the real estate agency first.

478
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,666
Do you want me to call my dad and ask?
Should we all meet and talk?

479
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,294
Forget it.

480
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,963
Let's think of it as a good thing.

481
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,967
It's better than losing the spot
to another chain, right?

482
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,056
You're making me look really bad here.

483
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,934
Like I pulled
some dirty trick or something.

484
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,186
Darn it.

485
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,570

Please insert…

492
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,545
Why isn't my dad like A-reum's dad?

493
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,381
I was the one

494
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,635
who insisted on giving that store
rental assistance.

495
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,428
And in the end,

496
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,806
I ended up making the rent
cheaper for A-reum.

497
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,520
It always turns out this way.

498
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:58,482
The person I hate the most
takes everything.

499
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:00,943
From now on,

500
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:05,447
I'm going to put my life on the line
and love A-reum.

501
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:09,660
I'm going to love her
more than anyone in the world

502
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,120
and make her go completely bust.

503
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,122
Just you wait.

504
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,085
Soon enough,
you'll see the power of my love.

505
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,971
Please choose a transaction.

506
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,056
Please insert your bank book or card.

507

Please insert your bank book or card.

512
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,586
Excuse me.

513
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,885
Normally, I'm ready to
pass out around ten.

514
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:12,389
But it was two in the morning,
and I was totally fine.

515
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,600
I mean, I felt like
I could drink all night.

516
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,644
I almost winked at him like this.

517
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,773
I like him so much.
God, I almost winked at him.

518
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,610
No winking.

519
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:28,280
No one in the world winks anymore.
It's gone extinct.

520
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,823
What era do you live in?

521
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:32,075
I know, right?

522
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,619
But I can't help myself.

523
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,246
There are no steps in-between.
I'm diving right in.

524
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,873
I shouldn't do this, right?

525
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:42,294
I'm skipping all the steps
and running towards the end.

526
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,630
-I just like him so much.
-This is so frustrating.

527
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,632
Wink at him, and it's all over for you.

528
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,676
-Well, I didn't wink at him.
-My God.

529
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,802
But you know…

530
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,653
You're here.

531
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,696
What do you want to drink?

532
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:16,328
Apparently, A-reum has poached
three stores that way.

533
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,163
Her family's like a corporation.

534
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:21,083
The daughter gathers intel
and the father calls the shots.

535
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,709
We work at the same company,

536
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,795
but she has her own business
while I don't.

537
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,673
I should learn from her

538
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,591
but I don't want to.

539
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,802
Even if I did, my dad wouldn't.

540
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,888
Let me meet her.

541
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:38,517
Jeong A-reum? I'll make her
lose her ability to talk for a month.

542
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,562
She's doing that knowing that
people will put up with her.

543
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,439
That's why she keeps doing that.

544
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,234
She should meet someone like me
who won't tolerate it.

545
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,696
My story isn't over yet.

546
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,074
Fine. Let's hear what you have to say.

547
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,617
What did you want to brag about?

548
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,162
So I went to take some cash out,
all angry.

549
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,500
It was like no one there knew
how to use an ATM.

550
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,085
They were all so slow.

551
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,130
Shouldn't you use the machine just once?

552
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,298
They should line up again
if they need another transaction.

553
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,926
But they took their time
with multiple bank books.

554
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:15,929
I thought, "This must be how it feels
to die of frustration."

555
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,725
I felt like I might lose it.

556
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,393
One bad thing had happened,

557
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,729
and it felt as if
it was building up to something.

558
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:45,333
One day, my friend got drunk
and made a scene after a breakup.

559
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:48,253
Then he got into a fight at a bar
and was taken to the police.

560
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:52,048
And it turned out the other guy
was feeling miserable that day too.

561
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,925
Like attracts like. It's science.

562
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:57,262
People who are similar
always get together and cause trouble.

563
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,267
I knew I had to be careful.

564
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,810
I might meet someone

565
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,773
who also wants to beat somebody to death
and get into serious trouble.

566
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,107
I had to be careful.

567
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:12,569
Then someone tapped on my shoulder.

568
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,570
I'm sorry, but…

569
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:17,532
He said his bus was arriving soon
and asked if he could go first.

570
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,368
I guess he was taking
an intercity bus or something.

571
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:23,205
I thought, "Here it comes."

572
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,876
I didn't think I could say anything nice.

573
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,798
Welcome.

574
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,977
That's it?

575
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:49,731
Good job.

576
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,983
Call Jeong A-reum here.

577
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,235
Jeez.

578
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,320
We should go.

579
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:06,248
He probably didn't want to miss his bus.
He left in a hurry.

580
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,999
So I could see his bank balance.

581
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,252
INSUFFICIENT FUNDS FOR
THE REQUESTED WITHDRAWAL OF 50,000 WON

582
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,464
He couldn't withdraw 50,000 won
because he didn't enough money.

583
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,554
I was glad I let him go first.

584
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,389
It made me feel better.

585
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,517
But it's not because
I think I'm better off than he is.

586
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,893
That'd be rude.

587
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,314
If you ask me if I'm the kind of jerk
who takes comfort in others' misfortune,

588
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,440
I am.

589
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,651
But I don't want to do that to that man.

590
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,279
He didn't even have 50,000 won.

591
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,990
If he missed his bus too,
it would have been the worst.

592
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,700
Because I gladly let him go first…

593
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,536
Well, maybe not gladly.

594
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:48,957
Anyway, because I let him go first,
he probably caught his bus.

595
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:50,417
You see,

596
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:54,462
it's amazing
how I always know when it's time.

597
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,423
Time to back off.

598
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:01,177
Even when I go crazy and out of control,
I still get a hold of myself.

599
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,512
Things happen that way.

600
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:07,058
I think it's fate that I live like this.

601
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,311
I'm like a drizzle.

602
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:14,524
I may not have a big current of my own
like the river or the ocean,

603
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:19,446
but I'm like a drizzle
that soaks people without them realizing.

604
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,239
That's right.

605
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,533
I think I'll be able to afford that.

606
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,828
Drizzle? That's nice.

607
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,539
But don't forget
about Jeong A-reum though.

608
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,459
You brought your resume, right?

609
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,752
-Yes.
-Okay.

610
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,508
Hello.

611
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:43,762
Oh, the girlfriend.

612
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,099
This promotion has already ended.

613
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,685
I keep forgetting to take it down.

614
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,314
You didn't need to bring a resume.
You're Yeom's girlfriend.

615
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,733
I can't vouch for her.
You have to be careful.

616
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,653
RESUME
NAME: JI HYEON-A

617
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,405
"Ji Hyeon-a." What a pretty name.

618
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,074
May I?

619
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:07,953
When can you start?

620
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,496
I can start immediately.

621
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:10,747
-Really?
-Yes.

622
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,123
That's perfect.

623
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,876
"5885"? That should be easy to remember.

624
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,045
Memorize it already. I memorized yours.

625
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:21,299
You didn't even memorize
your girlfriend's phone number?

626
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,933
I guess you two are okay
with things like that.

627
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:35,814
Welcome.

628
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,026
All right. Let me teach you this first.

629
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,155
We can't take this many.

630
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:48,410
We can only take 30 bottles
from each person per day.

631
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,953
This is just too many.

632
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:54,040
What are you going to do with all these?

633
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,055
Here. Thank you.

634
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:20,859
Hello.

635
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:26,948
Here.

636
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,244
I sold the bottles.

637
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,918
This is for your friend.

638
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:43,798
Thank you.

639
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,396
He really sold them all.

640
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:13,286
I wonder what the man living there
was doing at that time.

641
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,048
Probably having a drink.

642
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:42,816
I'm as happy as when I get my paycheck
whenever you message me.

643
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,739
Right.

644
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,950
The number for the courier
has changed, right?

645
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:53,493
What is it again?

646
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,164
Hang on.

647
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,087
Here.

648
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,967
Something smells nice. What is it?

649
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:09,884
What?

650
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:11,553
It's my hand cream.

651
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,139
This one.

652
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:19,602
It's lovely.

653
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,187
Right? I can get you one.

654
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,480
No, it's okay.

655
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,566
It's not expensive. I'll get you one.

656
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,151
Try it on.

657
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,363
It smells nice.

658
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,157
Thanks.

659
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,282
I cleaned my house for a change.

660
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,534
What do you think I’ll do
in my clean house now?

661
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,167
Drink.

662
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,385
Today…

663
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,597
I worked hard to drive myself,

664
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,475
like cattle on the range.

665
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,942
I locked myself in that room
and drank all winter.

666
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,362
When I tried to sleep,

667
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,158
there were bottles in the middle.

668
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:43,496
I could've just pushed them aside

669
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,792
but I couldn't even bother to do that.

670
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:53,673
So I curled up around them
like I was incubating an egg.

671
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,509
I could've just thrown them out.

672
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:05,351
But it felt as if I was walking out
of my own grave.

673
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,270
Completely hopeless.

674
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,691
Looking at the soju bottles,

675
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,775
I thought…

676
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:16,321
"I guess this is it for me."

677
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,991
"There's no turning back now."

678
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:34,005
Today, I did something
I thought would take me forever to do.

679
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,924
I wonder if I can sleep tonight.

680
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,440
I'm not going to ask you what happened.

681
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,068
I won't ask you where you're from.

682
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:57,612
Or why you moved here
and keep drinking the days away.

683
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:00,448
I don't care if you don't know
how to write Hangul

684
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,075
or you don’t know your ABCs.

685
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,827
I won't tell you to stop drinking either.

686
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,080
And I'm not going to cling to you.

687
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,540
I'll be done once I feel whole.

688
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:14,921
That's cool.

689
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:25,682
I just worshiped you.

690
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:32,814
Why don't you keep going?
I don't think that was enough.

691
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,212
How much if I jump over it?

692
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,089
Why would I pay you for that?

693
01:01:58,172 --> 01:01:59,465
Because I'll do it.

694
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,550
Go ahead then.

695
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,260
Jeez, seriously.

696
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,600
Can you give me
some pointers before I jump?

697
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:12,061
Don't do it.

698
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,021
Why not?

699
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:17,358
You need to be able to run 100m
in under 11 seconds to make it.

700
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,402
You need the momentum.

701
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,197
How about 12 seconds flat?

702
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,660
As if you can actually do 12 seconds.

703
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,619
I can!

704
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:33,666
I'm sure I can make it.

705
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,710
I'll make it over easily.

706
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:39,881
Sure. You have to try to find out.

707
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,841
Don't you dare!

708
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,096
How far are you going?

709
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,347
Are you going home?

710
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,444
I told you to stop!

711
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,376
5 MISSED CALLS

712
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,837
Gu Ja-gyeong. Pick up your phone.

713
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,798
Where the hell are you hiding?

714
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,927
It's time for us to move. We have to go.

715
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,012
You don't have to hide anymore.

716
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,646
He won't make it.

717
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,357
Damn it!

718
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:53,621
I told you not to.

719
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,244
So, what does it feel like to date
someone who lives in the area?

720
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:35,454
I like doing it.

721
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:40,042
I feel peace
in my heart for the first time.

722
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,295
Yeom Gi-jeong? Nothing's happened so far.

723
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,755
There's no way someone decent
is going to ask her out all of a sudden.

724
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:49,176
What time is okay for you?
I couldn't wait for us to meet.

725
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,845
What about filing a lawsuit?

726
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:53,514
-Please, just leave me be.
-Are you still not over him?

727
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,433
Don't try to help me unless I ask you.

728
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:57,935
It feels like it's my fault
for getting myself in this situation.

729
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,312
Where did you change your address to?

730
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,942
How could you do this to me?

731
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:13,618
