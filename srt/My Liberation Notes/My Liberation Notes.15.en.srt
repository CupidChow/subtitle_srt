1
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,274
What's your name?

2
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,862
It's Gu Ja-gyeong.

3
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,742
How did you get my phone number?

4
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,661
I went to your house.

5
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,250
When?

6
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,961
A few days ago.

7
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,922
Why all of a sudden?

8
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:31,925
Just because.

9
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,972
You must have heard my mom passed away.

10
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:40,809
Yes.

11
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,520
And that my dad got remarried.

12
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,491
What is it?

13
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,870
It's just strange.

14
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,332
So this day came, after all.

15
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:09,879
"When might we meet again, and how?
Will we ever meet again?"

16
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,675
"I'd be so happy
if he called me right now."

17
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,428
When I was sincerely wishing for it,
I never heard from you,

18
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,389
and when I least expected it, you…

19
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,433
What were you doing?

20
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,062
Preparing for war.

21
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,190
I was ready
to bring out my evil side today.

22
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,067
Against who?

23
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,366
Where are we going, by the way?

24
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,452
Good point. Well, it's cold, right?

25
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,080
Shall we go inside somewhere? A cafe?

26
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,041
Are you cold?

27
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,460
No. What about you?

28
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,380
I'm alright, too. Let's just walk.

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,218
It'll be awkward
sitting face to face with a cup of coffee.

30
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,055
Now that I think of it,

31
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,809
I've never had
a cup of coffee with you at a cafe.

32
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,396
Of course not.
How could we while we were there?

33
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,358
We just drank cold water
after picking cabbages and radish.

34
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,573
Just as I thought,

35
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,242
we suit the fields better.

36
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,412
It's comfortable.

37
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,958
Trees, wind, and rocks don't irritate us.

38
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:35,048
I get irritable
when I'm in places with a lot of people.

39
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:40,595
Even someone sitting alone at a table
next to mine in a café irritates me.

40
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,973
Even though they're not doing anything.

41
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,353
Maybe we just hate people.

42
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,024
I thought I was the only one.

43
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,279
If someone comes your way
when you're walking like this,

44
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,073
don't they irritate you?

45
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,252
Do you think he was irritated by us too?

46
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,424
When it's one against many,
it's always the one that gets irritated.

47
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,302
The many don't really care.

48
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,224
But the one is always on their guard.
Since they're alone.

49
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,690
I get weird when I'm with you.

50
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,068
I keep saying things I never thought of.

51
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,866
Are we a two? Or just one against one?

52
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,046
Are you drawing a line between us?

53
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,853
Why didn't you call me sooner?

54
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,123
GWANGCHANG MARKET

55
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,554
They fit you well.

56
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,599
No, I'll pay.

57
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,976
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

58
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,438
Put it in my bag.

59
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,048
There…

60
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,187
Is it good?

61
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,610
Excuse me, would you mind moving this
so we can sit here?

62
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,528
Sure…

63
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,908
The gimbap is really good here.

64
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,000
SAM-SIK

65
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,175
SAM-SIK

66
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,181
Why are you calling me on a Sunday?

67
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,184
Today's Saturday.

68
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,690
Today's Saturday.

69
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,077
I got it. I'll call you back.

70
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:39,876
What is it?

71
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,716
Just go. You can come back, can't you?

72
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,636
I'll come back.

73
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,892
I'll be back soon. I'll come back.
Go and wait somewhere.

74
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,768
Take your time.

75
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,228
I'll be back soon.

76
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,504
-Let's get out.
-Sir?

77
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,130
-Let's run.
-Yes, sir.

78
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:40,871
What?

79
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,142
-Stop.
-You son of a bitch!

80
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,101
Let me go, you…

81
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:06,314
Let go of me, damn it. How dare you?
You got me fired.

82
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,691
I'll report all of you, you bastards.
Let go of me!

83
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,401
Let go of me, you bastards!

84
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:14,655
She's been here drinking since the
early evening, yelling that she got fired.

85
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,576
I knew she was going to cause trouble.

86
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,912
Let go of me!

87
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,372
Hey!

88
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,335
Let me go! I'll report you all!

89
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,713
Let go of me! I said, let go!

90
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:35,384
I'm reporting you, you son of a bitch!
Let go of me!

91
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,677
Let me go!

92
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,347
Let me go! Let me go, you bastards!

93
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,433
Let go!

94
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,392
Wait…

95
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,436
Let go of me, you scumbags!

96
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,482
-For God's sake!
-Let go of me! You bastards!

97
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,364
You changed your number and
ghosted us to get out of paying us back.

98
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,742
But you're upset
we came to your workplace?

99
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,747
Was I supposed to go to you
and gently ask, "Please pay me," then?

100
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,958
Why? Tell me.

101
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:13,089
Why do I have to be respectful of you
when you weren't from the beginning?

102
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:14,799
Why?

103
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,258
Why?

104
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,973
Hey, Ja-gyeong.

105
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,642
Ja-gyeong.

106
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,939
Mr. Gu, there weren't that many customers
yesterday, for real.

107
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,025
This is all! I swear.

108
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,529
Check the CCTV footage if you want,
you bastard!

109
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,447
Hey, Ja-gyeong. Wait!

110
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,606
Why?

111
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,026
To play cards all night again?

112
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,532
I didn't mean to do it,

113
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,118
but the gambling debt I racked up before…

114
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,246
They'll kill me
if I don't pay it back by today.

115
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,266
You must be losing your touch.

116
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,727
You've been cut.

117
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,523
It was a bottle, sir.

118
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,035
You must be drinking every day.
Except for maybe a few hours a week?

119
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,476
YEOM MI-JEONG:
TAKE YOUR TIME

120
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,478
Where to, sir?

121
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,650
Take your time.

122
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,129
JUNGJEONG

123
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,808
It's painted on.

124
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,108
You've come back as a different person

125
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,235
in just an hour and a half.

126
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:47,947
Hey.

127
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,741
That's life.

128
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,578
Just when you think it's going well…

129
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,206
I've never even had one whole perfect day.

130
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,134
Five minutes a day.

131
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,638
If you have
five minutes of peace, it's bearable.

132
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,603
When I hold the door open
for a kid at a convenience store

133
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:23,232
and the kid says, "Thank you,"
that makes me happy for seven seconds.

134
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,903
When I open my eyes in the morning
and remember it's Saturday,

135
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,322
that makes me happy for ten seconds.

136
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,325
Fill up five minutes a day like that.

137
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,997
That's how I survive.

138
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,764
Well…

139
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,975
do you still

140
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,728
live the hard way,

141
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,523
trudging on step by step?

142
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,830
Let's go together.

143
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,833
Step by step,

144
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,627
trudging on.

145
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,921
Excuse me.

146
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:28,881
Yes, sir.

147
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,795
A while ago,

148
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,839
people had to abandon their cars and walk

149
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,759
because of the heavy snow.

150
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,803
I remember.

151
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,056
I also had to leave my car
on Yeongdong Bridge and walk.

152
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,350
And I suddenly thought,

153
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,937
"If the earth just stopped
for a while like this,

154
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,983
I would just keep walking
until I reached Sanpo."

155
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,989
"If I take the shortest route,
it should be about 28km."

156
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,408
"I'd be there by dawn."

157
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:43,747
I was heading there in my head,
figuring out where to make turns.

158
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,666
It was funny

159
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,586
that I was thinking about walking there
if the Earth stopped,

160
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,755
when I could just drive there.

161
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,305
Do you remember

162
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,935
the guy who borrowed my money
and left the country to go back to his ex?

163
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,480
You never told me he went to his ex.

164
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,776
It was that jerk's wedding today.

165
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,740
He still owes me six million won.

166
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,577
But he still managed to pay
for all the preparations required

167
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,661
and had a buffet.

168
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,416
So I said if he had that much money,
he should pay me back.

169
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,794
Then he ranted at me for half an hour.

170
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,254
While I was listening to him,

171
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,174
I broke the cup I was holding.

172
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,724
He must have thought I was the same
Yeom Mi-jeong he remembered.

173
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,062
I decided to go to his wedding

174
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,816
and stand behind the bride and groom
with a really scary expression

175
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,193
when they take a photo.

176
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,404
And to take the congratulatory money
on my way out.

177
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,658
I went there determined to do that.

178
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,122
Like you said, it was one against many.

179
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,000
I've decided to be the one
to ruin everything

180
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,045
while the others
are there to congratulate them.

181
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,047
"Let's do this."

182
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,424
"It's me against everyone else."

183
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:23,180
When the photographer asked
the friends to come up for a picture,

184
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,015
I stood up…

185
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,228
and that's when you called me.

186
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,314
Hello?

187
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,527
Hello?

188
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,782
It's been a while.

189
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,159
It's Gu.

190
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,042
"This man…"

191
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,129
"He'd never let me hit rock bottom."

192
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,676
"He's stopping me."

193
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,181
Hello?

194
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,934
He's not getting up.

195
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,395
Yes, can you come to the station?

196
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,753
JONGNO-GU ALLEYWAY JOURNEY
MEET THE LANDSCAPE OF HANYANG

197
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,472
10TH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL EXHIBITION
JOSEON'S LANDSCAPE PAINTINGS

198
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,780
Hold on.

199
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,674
Don't bother.

200
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,093
There are too many.

201
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,230
This place is freezing!

202
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,942
It's broken.

203
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,252
Does the hot water work?

204
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,798
Only warm water.

205
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,305
I can't believe
you're living like a refugee

206
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,432
in such a nice apartment.

207
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,684
An alcoholic

208
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,021
just needs a clean glass.

209
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,192
Why don't you hire help? Aren't you rich?

210
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,318
I can't be bothered.

211
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,570
Telling them the passcode

212
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,323
and sending them money every month.

213
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,288
My nose is cold.

214
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,822
Was I an asshole, too?

215
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,535
Not anymore.

216
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,164
You called in the end.

217
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,086
But I was an asshole till yesterday?

218
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,993
Welcome.

219
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,213
-Thank you.
-Have a nice day.

220
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,387
Aren't you going to church?

221
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,390
I'm not.

222
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,692
What's gotten into you, staying out?

223
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,657
Are you seeing someone?

224
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,077
Aren't you going to church?

225
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,162
I'm not!

226
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,969
So I'll go there tomorrow
with my girlfriend.

227
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,972
Based on the way
things were going at that store,

228
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,391
she didn't think
she'd get paid after a month.

229
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,979
So she quit after five days.
She needs to get paid for those five days.

230
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,274
But they keep saying
they'll pay her tomorrow.

231
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:10,694
So I'll go meet them in person.
Calling them will never work.

232
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,030
How shameless of them,
trying to not pay her.

233
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,119
It might not be because they're shameless.

234
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,163
It might be
because they don't have the money.

235
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,166
Are you taking their side
as a store owner?

236
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,462
I was once paid a salary, too.

237
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,340
So I know how it feels
not to be paid in time.

238
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,928
But I'm now in no position to curse
at people who can't pay their employees.

239
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,557
When I was running a business,

240
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,269
if I could pay my employees
by sacrificing one of my arms,

241
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,314
I would have gladly done it.

242
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,651
The sweet potato oven business?
Every house has an air fryer now.

243
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:56,323
Not for households, for businesses.
The one that's bigger than that one.

244
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,290
I was so frustrated
and wanted to go somewhere to pray,

245
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,084
but there weren't
any churches open that early.

246
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,295
The only place I could go to

247
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,922
was a convenience store.

248
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,676
And when I was sitting here,
all depressed,

249
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,220
I got a message from a colleague.

250
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,432
He asked if I wanted to run
a convenience store in my neighborhood.

251
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,435
And that was this place.

252
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,938
That's who I am.

253
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:34,194
I always know in advance
where I belong, like a psychic.

254
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,530
Sir.

255
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,493
Then go sit in some chairman's office
of a big company tomorrow.

256
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,371
Tell them that's where you belong.

257
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,039
Tell them you just know it.

258
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,291
Instead of going to Gyeongbokgung Palace.

259
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,045
Why do you keep going to the palace
where there's no chance?

260
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,089
Your last name isn't even Yi.

261
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,217
Take care.

262
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,268
Where's Gi-jeong?

263
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,353
She says she's busy.

264
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,650
I think I know why she's upset.

265
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,403
Me too.

266
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,616
All rise.

267
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,120
We'll sing hymn number 38.

268
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,795
I took a day off
to attend the kid's graduation ceremony.

269
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,590
But she asked me why
since I won't even be in the photos.

270
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,968
She said someone like me
shouldn't be in a picture with her

271
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,178
on her graduation day,

272
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,764
since if someone asks,
"Who's this lady?" one day,

273
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,349
then she'll have to say,
"Someone my dad used to date."

274
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,603
I mean, how could she say that?
When I'm right there with them.

275
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,855
Did I say anything wrong?

276
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,399
Tell her to know her place.

277
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,612
Only your family
should come to your graduation.

278
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,448
Why would she be there
when you're just dating?

279
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,868
But they're not just dating.

280
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,453
They're going to get married.

281
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:52,332
Then she should join when they're married.
Who knows what will happen?

282
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,796
She still shouldn't have
suddenly looked at her phone

283
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,048
and left saying, "I forgot I had plans."

284
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,842
She was obviously lying

285
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,053
and showing that she was upset.

286
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,471
That was so immature.

287
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,307
And that wasn't the first time.

288
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:14,103
When I raised my voice a bit,
she said she forgot she had other plans.

289
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,856
Why does she forget about her plans
every time?

290
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:20,193
She should make up
different excuses, at least.

291
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:23,404
She always has to show that she's upset.

292
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,407
Is she supposed to argue with you then?

293
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,454
Father's looking.

294
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,624
Today, even those who get angry
at their own siblings

295
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:38,211
or call them idiots or dummies…

296
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:42,340
Just get married already
without worrying about me.

297
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,469
Spit out your gum.

298
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,931
Lastly, we will end the Mass

299
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,767
-with the Prayer of Confession.
-My lord.

300
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,686
-I'm to blame,
-I'm to blame.

301
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,438
-I'm to blame. It is my fault.
-I'm to blame.

302
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,400
It's not the first time
you've treated her like that.

303
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,485
But you've never
apologized to her properly.

304
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,321
Do you think I do it for no reason?
It's for Yu-rim's sake.

305
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,115
Stop using her as an excuse!

306
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,075
Or I'll move out with her.

307
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:13,371
What? So Yu-rim's all grown up now, huh?
Are you saying you don't need us anymore?

308
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,456
Seriously…

309
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,721
I'm sorry.

310
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,557
I got too upset.

311
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,519
What do you want for lunch?

312
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,326
It's puberty.

313
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,582
Chang-hee just came back
and had lunch with us.

314
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,667
Yes.

315
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,879
Mr. Gu visited.

316
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,007
I…

317
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,926
gave him your number.

318
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,470
Did he call you yet?

319
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,015
We met up.

320
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,687
I see. That's good.

321
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,107
Take care. Bye.

322
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,109
Okay, take care, Dad.

323
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,781
Who did you meet?

324
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:14,450
CARD ISSUING OFFICE
NO PHONES OR CAMERAS

325
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,725
It's like a blank check

326
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,686
since the card
has the customer's personal information.

327
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:45,356
So, the security tends to be tight here,
even within the company.

328
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,484
Even one misprint, and you'll require
authorization to discard it.

329
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,488
About ten million cards are issued a year.

330
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,702
Everyone owns more than one card, right?
And they need another one if they lose it.

331
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,788
And there are about a thousand
different kinds of cards.

332
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,502
Once a card is launched,
it's almost impossible to end the service.

333
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,380
Since there are cards
organizations have used for a long time.

334
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:13,176
And the VIP cards
are handcrafted one by one.

335
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,349
A lot of work for the VIP department, too?

336
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,559
Yes, it's Monday.

337
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,235
Mi-jeong.

338
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,826
Let's go.

339
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,953
You look like you belong in Yeouido.

340
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,581
Wherever you are,
you always look like you belong there.

341
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,583
Even in Gangnam.

342
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,587
I also look like
someone from Sanpo when I'm there.

343
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,590
You live in Gangbuk now, though.

344
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,552
But it doesn't
feel like my neighborhood yet.

345
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,936
Compared to the workload,
the salary isn't as high,

346
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,730
but it's better than working at Joy Card.

347
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,608
They also don't treat permanent
and temp workers differently.

348
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:15,029
If I started my career at this company,
I'd be an assistant manager by now.

349
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,242
I shouldn't have wasted my time
at Joy Card.

350
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,329
Did you hear Han Su-jin left?

351
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,749
I checked the job title chart,
and Han Su-jin was gone.

352
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,335
Why would you check that?

353
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,797
I always check
where those people have gone to work.

354
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,967
It's ecstatic to know
I don't have to work with them.

355
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,969
"Yes, she has finally disappeared."

356
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,848
We've beat them, Mi-jeong.

357
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,768
I'm not even in the design field anymore.

358
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,062
But you're not staying there forever.

359
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,939
I'll stay.

360
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,233
What? Don't waste your talent.

361
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,610
It's a talent that only you recognize.

362
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,448
Be honest with me. Are you really
not aware how good you are?

363
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,329
Before, if I worked on the design
all night and submitted it

364
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,749
and they rejected it, I would think,
"What did I work all night for?"

365
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,211
Even if I thought I did a good job,
if they said no,

366
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,964
all the work I did
would go down the drain.

367
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,508
But it's different here.

368
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,469
It really feels like I'm working.

369
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:24,432
I think I'm better suited for jobs
that require precision over creativity.

370
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,352
Give your skills to me,
if you're not going to use them.

371
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,355
Take them.

372
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:36,402
I used to feel bad for her
since she was very quiet and looked sad.

373
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,155
How could she turn into a delinquent,
all of a sudden?

374
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,782
You get farsighted
before you know it as you age.

375
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,993
She became a delinquent just like that.

376
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,829
I get scared and stutter when she talks.

377
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,918
I'm not confident
I could live with a kid like that.

378
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,756
But I can't leave her with her aunties
and live with Tae-hun alone.

379
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,424
My conscience won't let me.

380
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,136
We agreed to get married
when she turns 20.

381
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,430
But when she's 20,

382
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,559
I'll be 50, damn it.

383
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,519
Hey.

384
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,772
Didn't we reach 40 so fast?

385
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,609
Wouldn't 50 come fast, too?

386
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:19,779
It can't! Hey, 50 shouldn't come so fast.

387
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,073
But you said you'd marry Tae-hun at 50.

388
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,407
I know, but…

389
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:28,329
It shouldn't come too soon,
but I hope it does at the same time.

390
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,084
Age 50…

391
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,674
Do you think you'll
even have any emotions when you're 50?

392
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,593
Won't it just be like
being an animal at that age?

393
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:47,556
Living just because you are alive
and eating fodder, right?

394
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:19,922
As a 50-year-old lady who's living
just because I'm alive and eating fodder,

395
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:24,218
I'll tell you something.

396
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:30,433
I understand why you think that way.

397
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,685
I really do.

398
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:39,191
I thought I would be so cool
when I turned 30,

399
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,277
but it didn't turn out that way.

400
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,490
And I thought,
"How will I live in my 40s?"

401
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,950
"And my 50s?"

402
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,871
-"What's the point of living?"
-We should just die.

403
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,956
"I should just die then."

404
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,291
But…

405
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,168
at age 50?

406
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,378
It's just the same.

407
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:04,175
You become 50 years old
before you realize it.

408
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:09,096
I feel like I took a short nap

409
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,974
one day when I was 13

410
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,935
and just woke up.

411
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,855
Don't you feel the same?

412
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,273
Twelve for me.

413
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,108
You always try to count one year less.

414
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,986
-What about you?
-Hey, let's go.

415
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,739
-Where?
-Home.

416
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,578
Hey, drink.

417
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:39,210
You'll probably feel the same
as me at 80, too, I bet.

418
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,923
Hey, bottoms up.

419
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,686
INWANGJESAEKDO BY JEONG SEON
216TH NATIONAL TREASURE

420
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,148
When I saw
ink paintings in art books in school,

421
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,193
I'd wonder, "Is this China? North Korea?"

422
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,488
I've never seen mountains like these.

423
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,449
All the paintings from
the Joseon era are of rocky mountains.

424
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,661
When I moved here, I realized,

425
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,579
"So this is where they were."

426
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,251
"Jeong Seon just painted
what was in his back garden at the time."

427
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,380
The mountains of Gyeonggi were green
and covered in scrub.

428
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,466
Weirdly, these rocky mountains
can only be found in Gangbuk.

429
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,677
Not south of the Han River.

430
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:38,310
I was really surprised while taking a walk
around Gyeongbokgung Palace.

431
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,855
You can pass through four neighborhoods
in ten minutes.

432
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,483
I was wondering why the neighborhoods
were divided up so small,

433
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:49,029
and it turns out they didn't divide them
by area, but by population,

434
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,950
and the population density there
during the Joseon era was extremely high.

435
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,412
Have you ever heard of Palpan-dong?

436
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,415
It's a neighborhood
behind Gyeongbokgung Palace.

437
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:03,043
During the Joseon era, they say that
eight ministers lived in that area alone.

438
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,545
So it was called "Palpan-dong."

439
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,088
Do you have an exam?

440
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,012
What are you studying so hard for?

441
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,015
I'm a Seoul man now.

442
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,642
Sir.

443
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,520
People from Seoul
don't know any of that stuff.

444
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:26,317
Also, your family must live in Seoul for
three generations to be really from Seoul.

445
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,235
Says who?

446
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,155
That professor who studies Seoul.

447
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,659
If you live in Seoul, you're a Seoul man.
Three generations, my ass.

448
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,537
Are you a Seoul man?

449
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:42,041
Of course. We've been living
in this neighborhood since my grandpa.

450
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,251
Good for you.

451
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,799
Then I guess my grandson
will be a Seoul man.

452
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,219
But you won't get married.

453
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,723
Didn't you say
it was over between you two?

454
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,603
She was pretty.

455
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,193
Do you ever miss Seon-u?

456
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,905
Well, sometimes?

457
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,242
I'd be very lonely

458
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:19,745
if the person I'd lived
with for seven years was gone.

459
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,999
It is lonely, but there are
many improvements too.

460
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,043
For starters,

461
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,504
no in-laws.

462
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,130
That's good.

463
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,924
That'd mean no more Cho Gyeong-seon.

464
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,718
Now that I'm on my own,

465
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:41,350
I feel sorry for pitying my friends who
weren't married and living alone before.

466
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,436
I realized I was arrogant.

467
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,857
Even if you live alone, it's fine.
You can be perfectly happy.

468
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:53,654
You can eat whatever you want,
whenever you want,

469
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,198
and sleep whenever you want.

470
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,825
Eating and sleeping…

471
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:03,372
I had no idea that doing these simple
things however I want was such a joy.

472
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:09,628
Even if I don't clean for a week,
things stay where I left them.

473
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,464
-Hey.
-Yes?

474
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,342
The thing you liked
about being married before

475
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:19,138
was having someone to go
and eat tteokbokki with at 2 a.m.

476
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,889
When I heard that, I thought,

477
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,101
"I see. That sounds nice."

478
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,853
You have no idea how jealous I was.

479
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:31,400
Do you think I'd get a craving
for tteokbokki at 2 a.m. every day?

480
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,947
After being single again, I realized

481
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,411
what a difficult life I'd been living
all this time, like a wheel going round.

482
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,581
Having to go to my in-laws' house
when the time came.

483
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:49,376
There were so many people
I had to have meals with.

484
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,758
No matter how you look at it,
life as a human,

485
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:59,094
whether it's married life or work life,

486
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,097
is about putting in the effort
to get on with others.

487
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,436
Now that my husband is gone,
I've let it all go.

488
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,813
"It's fine."

489
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:14,193
"I don't have to
try to get on with anyone."

490
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,364
"It's okay to live alone."

491
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,242
I didn't even get to try that yet.

492
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:26,080
-Gosh, it's so cold!
-Get off me.

493
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,665
PREGNANCY TEST

494
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,086
What shall we get?

495
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,547
I want gan jjambbong.

496
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,548
Sure.

497
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,925
I want this one.

498
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,428
What?

499
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,556
Did you just finish your academy?

500
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,147
Oh, this…

501
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,358
I'm not.

502
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,319
If I buy one of these,
my period always starts.

503
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,905
So, I just end up wasting
my money every time.

504
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,826
I'm not, I'm definitely not.

505
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,536
Yu-rim.

506
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:12,084
That lady just put a pregnancy test
in her pocket.

507
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,627
Who?

508
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,549
I'm going to pay for it. I am.

509
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,281
BOOK RETURNS

510
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,749
What brings you here, sir?

511
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,376
I was in the area for lunch.

512
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,339
Why do you order so many new products?

513
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,467
You're helping Mr. Kim out too much.

514
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,594
Even if I could never make team leader,

515
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,763
I'm going to make my branch manager
a team leader.

516
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:14,897
I'm impressed.

517
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,775
You paid off that loan.

518
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:23,363
I would have just given up.

519
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,449
How did you hold out?

520
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,869
Well, it was do-or-die.

521
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,711
There was this guy I knew.

522
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,048
He used to stare
at the mountain every day.

523
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:45,469
He said there were 7,7 billion people
just like him on Earth,

524
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,474
but he didn't know
how much 7,7 billion was,

525
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:55,938
so he said if you replaced each human
with a one-won coin,

526
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:59,274
a total of 7,7 billion 1-won coins…

527
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,780
would be piled up
to the size of that mountain.

528
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,162
I realized I was just a tiny one-won coin…

529
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:19,378
and there was no need
to make such a fuss through life.

530
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,715
Who said that?

531
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,093
Yu-rim said she saw it.

532
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,304
If she says she's pregnant,

533
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,683
don't beat around the bush,
and just ask her to marry you.

534
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,478
I think that's the right thing to do.

535
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,565
Dragging things out like this
will only be hard on both of you,

536
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:44,444
and Yu-rim will dote on the baby
once she sees it wriggling around.

537
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:48,865
All right.

538
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:50,826
Okay. Bye.

539
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:09,136
SHALL WE GET DINNER TOGETHER TODAY?

540
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,057
Sounds great!

541
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:25,736
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO EAT?

542
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,908
I want to eat everything!

543
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,469
They should have delivered the heater.

544
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,220
It'll be at your door.

545
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,393
Your habit of leaving me on read
hasn't changed.

546
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,857
SAFEGUARD HEATER

547
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,194
Unlike the others in this field,

548
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:53,532
you don't gamble, you don't chase women.

549
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:56,993
You don't do anything else.
You just drink quietly by yourself.

550
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:00,247
I liked that, and that's why
I came this far with you.

551
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,000
But now, alcohol is the problem.

552
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:11,550
I heard that you beat up one
of your managers recently over nothing.

553
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,928
You're not as thorough as you used to be.

554
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:19,433
Do you really have no plans to stop?

555
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:23,186
Don't tell me you're not an alcoholic.

556
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:30,235
If you don't have the willpower,
try taking medicine.

557
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,282
Try everything you can.

558
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,162
Are you going to go down like this?

559
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:48,211
I heard you told Baek's younger sister

560
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:52,799
to go to the hospital and get therapy.

561
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:58,054
Telling her about
some two-thirds point or something.

562
00:50:58,764 --> 00:50:59,806
What was it?

563
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:04,853
The point where it all becomes nothing.

564
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,190
Were those all empty words?

565
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,409
I do see

566
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:21,870
a doctor.

567
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,831
They told me you don't come anymore.

568
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,792
I changed my doctor.

569
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,462
Dr. Kim was boring.

570
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:35,425
Is therapy supposed to be fun?

571
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,678
I can't talk to a dull person
even for ten minutes.

572
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,264
What did you talk about?

573
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,480
He said I was always

574
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,066
on guard.

575
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,280
Because I'm "one."

576
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,787
Watching out
for a knife or a bottle coming at me,

577
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,957
or if someone pocketed any money.

578
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,376
I watch them,
catch them, and beat them up.

579
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,592
It's not like I have a partner
that I can share the workload with.

580
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,844
I'm always alone.

581
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,346
One.

582
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,400
I try to be happy
for just five minutes a day.

583
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:36,736
So I try to gather up

584
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:41,032
moments of excitement
in four and seven-second chunks,

585
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,871
to fill five minutes a day.

586
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,626
But I haven't even been able
to gather one second today.

587
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,924
Just now, while talking to you…

588
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,305
I got excited for three seconds.

589
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,228
It's six seconds now.

590
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,442
It's quite long today.

591
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:24,993
Twelve times.

592
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,537
Your nickname is now "Twelve Times."

593
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,915
You change your mind twelve times a day.

594
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,589
Don't underestimate me.
It's a million times.

595
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,895
Do you want a part-time job?

596
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,399
What kind of part-time job?

597
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,238
Cleaning?

598
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,408
No.

599
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:07,661
Then what?

600
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,248
Listening to me talk.

601
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,422
When I…

602
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,717
started out as a host,

603
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:27,973
I quit after just two weeks, thinking,
"There's no way I can do this."

604
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,809
All people do is complain.

605
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,104
"My husband is having an affair,"
and so on.

606
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:41,987
I would rather go and get beaten up
until my nose bleeds than do this.

607
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,575
You should get paid
to listen to someone else talking.

608
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,376
How about ten sessions?

609
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:02,465
You usually get therapy
in sets of ten sessions.

610
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,301
After the ten sessions,

611
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:10,432
if I still have things to say,

612
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,891
we'll do another ten sessions.

613
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,273
You like listening to me talk.

614
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,404
You're putting words in my mouth now.

615
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:39,044
She became a widow
after seven years of marriage.

616
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:39,961
But…

617
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,130
while they were married,

618
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,925
she says half her brain was
always thinking about preparing food.

619
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,677
"What do we have in the fridge?"

620
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,930
"We need to eat the vegetables
before they go bad. The fish!"

621
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,185
I know what she means.

622
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:59,064
After Mom passed,
I always thought, "Feed Dad!"

623
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,902
Exhausted after working overtime,
I'd be on my way home sleepily,

624
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:06,488
and remember, "Right, I didn't get flour."

625
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,453
Eat slowly. You'll get indigestion.

626
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,913
You already ate a big dinner.

627
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,916
Weirdly, for me, with fruit,

628
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,418
I have to fill up my whole mouth
for it to taste good.

629
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,212
Like when you drink juice.

630
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:26,299
You know? With fruit juice,
you have to fill your whole mouth.

631
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:33,556
And, I feel like I eat more on that day.

632
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:40,355
When it starts, I get cravings.
Everything is so delicious.

633
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:44,442
Before period, everything's annoying.
I want to knock everything down.

634
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,362
But as soon as it starts,
all of that goes away.

635
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,948
I'm like, "When was I depressed?"

636
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,410
You're on your period.

637
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,706
Thank goodness. I thought…

638
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,758
You thought I was pregnant.

639
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,138
No, I'm not!

640
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,185
Thank goodness for that.

641
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:21,980
Come on!

642
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,036
Well…

643
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,164
I'm sorry.

644
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,332
I made a mistake.

645
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,340
Don't worry about it.

646
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,639
I'm really sorry.

647
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,172
When I met you again,

648
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:34,761
I regretted it.

649
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:37,764
"Crazy bastard."

650
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,141
"What are you thinking?"

651
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:48,149
"I think I ended things with her
in Sanpo pretty well."

652
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,986
"I'm sure I wasn't that awful to her."

653
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,114
"I should've left it at that."

654
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,210
Yeom Mi-jeong!

655
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:11,798
You startled me.

656
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,012
Just know this.

657
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,850
I liked you for real.

658
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:29,983
Later…

659
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,238
I have no idea
what kind of mess I might become.

660
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:39,117
I'll probably end up homeless.

661
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,623
I'll be grateful if I could
end things before then.

662
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,505
Anyway, I really liked you.

663
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,304
Thank you.

664
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,064
I really hate people.

665
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,861
I hate seeing them
moving around in front of me.

666
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:20,867
If my temper suddenly flares, I don't know
what kind of expression I might show you,

667
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:24,120
what I might do,
or what I might say to you.

668
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,206
I'm scared.

669
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,500
But…

670
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,296
remember this one thing.

671
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:42,347
Even if I end up becoming the asshole
to end all assholes later on,

672
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,892
remember I really liked you.

673
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,026
I want to record it.

674
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,488
Record it.

675
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:01,824
Do it.

676
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:11,167
Yeom Mi-jeong! I really liked you!

677
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,046
Yeom Mi-jeong.

678
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:29,143
After the ten sessions,
if I still have things to say,

679
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,812
we'll do another ten sessions.

680
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,565
And after we extend our sessions,

681
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,777
we'll end it there

682
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,032
if I have nothing more to say.

683
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,161
Let's…

684
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,707
end it then.

685
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:57,797
All right.

686
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:11,811
How's Chang-hee doing?

687
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,910
I finished repaying my loan yesterday.

688
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,249
You've worked hard.

689
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,630
I'll head down to see you next weekend.

690
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,716
You're busy, there's no need.

691
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:43,760
It's fine. Don't come.

692
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,472
Don't skip your meals.

693
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,393
Talk soon. Okay.

694
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:08,951
I'll be back.

695
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:05,049
Do you want to break me down?

696
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:09,637
You have to be with someone who's broken
to feel alive and needed,

697
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,473
but you must be bored to death
since I'm doing just fine.

698
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,350
-That's not true!
-Yes, it is!

699
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:18,437
I need to be sick and dying like Hyeok-su
for you to passionately care for me,

700
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:22,525
but I'm too healthy and working too hard,
so you're so bored.

701
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:24,068
Because I'm diligent and normal!

702
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,161
With the convenience store,

703
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:37,039
I just started feeling like I can get by.

704
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,959
I'm not crawling back into that hell
just for your enjoyment.

705
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:45,047
I'm not going stand being looked down on
and feeling like a piece of shit.

706
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,675
Nor am I going to be terminally ill.
Never!

707
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:51,596
I'm going to keep living a normal life.

708
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,348
So just leave.

709
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,988
If things get too tough for you,

710
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,157
come back.

711
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,326
If I'm still alone,

712
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,077
I'll be here for you.

713
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,747
And after a while,

714
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,250
if you want to leave again,

715
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:23,878
then leave again.

716
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,174
It's all right.

717
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:30,635
This time,

718
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:34,347
let's part ways
with blessings for each other.

719
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:37,892
What blessings? Do you go to church?

720
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,519
Hyeon-a.

721
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:43,940
Ji Hyeon-a.

722
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:47,944
It's all right.

723
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,947
I hold nothing against you.

724
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,909
I've always known
what kind of a person you are,

725
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:58,454
and I'm not mad that I didn't get things
the way that I wanted,

726
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:02,166
so you don't have to be sorry
that you couldn't keep up.

727
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,460
I mean it.

728
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:08,089
I really hold nothing against you.

729
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:09,966
Really.

730
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:12,134
I wish that you were happy.

731
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,097
Let's both

732
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:21,560
bless each other
without any hatred in our hearts…

733
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:25,398
and end things here.

734
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:49,231
Gu.

735
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:55,404
I don't think I was a one-won coin.

736
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,075
I think I've been that mountain all along.

737
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:02,411
I think I'll return to that mountain.

738
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,908
I like it when you shout, "Yeom Mi-jeong!"

739
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:42,076
Yeom Mi-jeong!

740
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:46,580
But I was determined
from the moment I met you.

741
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,125
And he asked me if he could see
the liberation notes.

742
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,085
Are we going to be authors, then?

743
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:56,715
Love is supposed to give you strength,
but will I be happy if we broke up?

744
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,926
You know the test is at our store, right?

745
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:01,470
I thought I had finally
made a breakthrough in life.

746
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:03,472
Spring must be on its way.

747
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:06,684
I'm sure he's pocketed
a lot of money all this time.

748
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:08,185
Let's end it with him.

749
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:10,980
"I'm definitely not happy."

750
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,274
"So please punish me just a little."

751
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:15,276
"Please."

752
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:22,491
