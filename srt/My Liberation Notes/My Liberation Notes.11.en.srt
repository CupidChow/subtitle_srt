1
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:02,896
SOY SAUCE

2
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,189
-It's okay.
-All right.

3
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,648
-Thank you.
-Take care.

4
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,945
SUPERMARKET

5
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,462
This car even rattles differently.

6
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,561
I've seen them on the road before,

7
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,397
but it's my first time meeting
someone who drives one.

8
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,025
-I'm honored.
-It's nothing.

9
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,820
-May I shake your hand?
-Right.

10
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,571
I'm his friend.

11
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,907
Right…

12
00:01:56,407 --> 00:02:00,620
It would be hard to park this kind of
big car in an apartment complex.

13
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,080
You don't live in one, right?

14
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:03,790
No…

15
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:07,210
I knew it. You can't own this kind
of car if you live in an apartment.

16
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,587
You've succeeded at such a young age.

17
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:15,218
Well, it's not my car.
It's my sister's boyfriend's.

18
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,470
I see.

19
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,182
Still, it's really cool, you know?

20
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,685
-It's amazing.
-How much does one of these cost?

21
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,270
-Well, I'm not sure exactly.
-Hi.

22
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,230
-But the price wouldn't matter…
-All right.

23
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,523
…to people who choose to drive them.

24
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:32,902
You're right. Those who can afford
this car wouldn't think about the price.

25
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,405
-Mom says to come home already.
-It must be expensive.

26
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,241
-When could we ever buy this kind of car?
-I know.

27
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,410
-I hope you have a good day.
-Yes.

28
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,495
-Anyway, this car's amazing.
-Thank you.

29
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,454
All right.

30
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,998
Gosh, there's a mark here.

31
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,500
She says she needs the soy sauce
to marinate the meat.

32
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,128
All right, well.

33
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,754
-Of course.
-All right.

34
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,808
Did somebody visit? What's that car?

35
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,863
It's my friend's.
I'm keeping it for him for a while.

36
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,868
That friend of yours
must not be Chang-hee, then.

37
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,787
It looks very expensive.

38
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,791
Of course. That car
costs hundreds of millions of won.

39
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,962
That friend had to go abroad…

40
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,884
He left it here since he had to
go abroad for a while. Yes.

41
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,183
Hey, Chang-hee.
What time are you leaving tomorrow?

42
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,231
What time?

43
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,193
Why do you ask? That's so random.

44
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,403
You'll drive the car, no?

45
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,156
Are you just going to leave it there
until he comes back?

46
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,699
So what time?

47
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,245
Why would I give you a ride
and ruin my day from the morning?

48
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,835
Don't drive someone else's car.

49
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,693
What did Mr. Gu use to do?

50
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,945
I don't know.

51
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,657
But I feel like
I have to keep it that way.

52
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,160
I have a feeling that he'll disappear
with the car as soon as I ask

53
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,079
"What did you use to do?"

54
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,417
You can't buy this kind of car
just because you have money.

55
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,169
The guy who drives this car

56
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,923
is working under your father?

57
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,842
At a sink factory?

58
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,512
That's why I'm saying
we should keep it from my dad.

59
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,307
He's working so hard teaching Gu.

60
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,891
If he finds out he owns this car,

61
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,686
he'll lose his motivation.

62
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,314
Yes. I understand.

63
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:21,321
Mi-jeong's really struck gold, hasn't she?

64
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,870
Don't feel small.

65
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,872
You're all right.

66
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,731
So, what time are you leaving tomorrow?

67
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,900
Don't even dream of it.

68
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,235
But it's her boyfriend's car.
Why can't she?

69
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,904
I'm not riding it.

70
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,073
Why not?

71
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,825
There'll be traffic.

72
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,788
We need to leave at 6:30
to avoid rush hour.

73
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,331
Can you leave by that time?

74
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,209
I can just sleep in the car.

75
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,354
Are you nervous?

76
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,987
Have some guts, okay?

77
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,448
Everything good in this world
could be yours.

78
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,284
Why can't you believe that?

79
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,997
The best man and all the money
in the world could be yours.

80
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,040
Shut up.

81
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,215
Lend me some money next time.

82
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:11,639
Actually, why would I borrow it?
Just give it to me.

83
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,190
How fast can it go?

84
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,984
Shall I step on it?

85
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,820
-Shall we take the highway, sir?
-Hey.

86
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,239
Why would you do that in a car like this?

87
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,409
You should go slow as if to tell everyone,

88
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,621
"I'm someone who drives a luxury car."

89
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,460
Go slow. Stop at all the signals.

90
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,503
Yes, sir.

91
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,051
I feel like this is too good for me.

92
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,512
I don't feel like I belong here.

93
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,640
This is way out of my league.

94
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,768
I can't even show off in it.

95
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,228
I feel the same.

96
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,982
I feel weirdly embarrassed
when I get in and out of this car.

97
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,194
Maybe I'm worried other people
will realize it's not mine.

98
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,820
Let's get used to it.

99
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,616
"I am worthy of good cars like this!"

100
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,993
"I'm worthy!"

101
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:30,468
CHOI JUN-HO

102
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,889
Where do you even get

103
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,724
those kinds of pants?

104
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:39,769
Wait…

105
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,106
Maybe I should ask when you got them.

106
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,868
I mean, it's been ages since I saw
a woman in trousers that are heavy

107
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,329
at the bottom.

108
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,919
Don't you feel stuffy

109
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,214
just looking at them?

110
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:09,966
It's suffocating.

111
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:21,435
Detail is important
in both fashion and design.

112
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,104
Detail…

113
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,483
Asshole…

114
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,736
Who uses shadows on fonts these days?

115
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,157
He should know the trends
in his field better.

116
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,013
Shall we go together?

117
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,777
You're wearing comfortable shoes.

118
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,239
I have my walking club today.

119
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,282
Really?

120
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,327
I'm thinking of doing a marathon club.

121
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,747
Do we have a marathon club?

122
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,165
I'm going to make one.

123
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,917
Do you want to join?

124
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,337
I don't think they'll let you.

125
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,507
There's even a liberation club.

126
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,968
Why not a marathon club?

127
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,723
I heard vigorous sports are not allowed

128
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,308
since you could get injured.

129
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,559
Really?

130
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,234
What do you do in the Liberation Club?

131
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,241
What are you being liberated from?

132
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,369
Work?

133
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,414
From people.

134
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,417
From tedious people.

135
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,790
I'm hungry.

136
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,044
My face is burning up.

137
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,425
I feel like I'll collapse.

138
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,851
What do you want to eat?

139
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,232
I want to drink alcohol.

140
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,074
That son of a bitch.

141
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,874
He treats being out of fashion
as if it makes you a peasant.

142
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,924
I guess it's natural
that the asshole I hate hates me.

143
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,218
But I probably hate him more.

144
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,096
I loathe him.

145
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:49,185
He may be somebody at work,
but he's a nobody outside.

146
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:55,608
My company once asked
for voluntary resignations to downsize.

147
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,153
Competent people who I wanted to stay
volunteered to go.

148
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,530
Since they're wanted everywhere.

149
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,450
But those I want to leave never do.

150
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,204
Since they have nowhere else to go.

151
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,040
And that's how that jerk is still here.

152
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,586
The weaker you are, the more evil you get.

153
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,714
That's why evil people…

154
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,800
have a pitiful side to them.

155
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,388
Invite him over, okay?

156
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,725
Bring him here.

157
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,063
Let's teach him a lesson in the field.

158
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,357
You'll win.

159
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,612
Of course I will.

160
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,585
I've never…

161
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,214
felt better after getting angry.

162
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:05,344
It would take me two to three days
to forget about it if I didn't get angry,

163
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,137
but if I get angry,

164
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,015
it lasts more than ten days.

165
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,197
In the evening,

166
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,992
the wind blows from this side.

167
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,918
I've never lived in a house

168
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,088
where the direction of the wind changes
and the moon is visible at night.

169
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,387
I thought such houses
only existed in fairy tales.

170
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,374
One day, the moonlight felt

171
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,626
a little odd.

172
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,921
I realized later that the street light

173
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,298
had gone out.

174
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,557
After the light was fixed,

175
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,727
it never felt the same again.

176
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,066
I think humans are only sane

177
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,777
when they're lonely.

178
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,240
So…

179
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,745
I think I'm saner at night.

180
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,597
When I was a child, I was asked to hand in
what we had prayed about at church.

181
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,224
Looking at what my friends wrote,

182
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,935
I thought, "Why would they pray for that?"

183
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,982
"Grades, the school they want
to get into, friends."

184
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,735
"They're seriously praying for that?"

185
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,779
"To God?"

186
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,989
"But it's God."

187
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,703
There was only one thing
I was curious about.

188
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:06,043
"What am I?"

189
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,593
"Why am I here?"

190
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,937
I didn't exist before 1991,

191
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,065
and I won't exist in 50 years,

192
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,236
but I feel like I existed before that
and will still exist after that.

193
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,405
The feeling that I'll exist forever.

194
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,119
I've been frustrated by that feeling,

195
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,787
and I've never, in my heart,

196
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,580
ever,

197
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,916
felt settled.

198
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,129
I feel uneasy in bed,

199
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,047
I feel uneasy around people.

200
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,300
"Why can't I

201
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,554
laugh happily like other people?"

202
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,807
"Why am I

203
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,101
sad all the time?"

204
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,313
"Why am I always nervous?"

205
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,607
"Why is

206
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,901
everything so boring?"

207
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,831
It feels like people are all scarecrows.

208
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,961
They don't really know what they are.
They're just acting as if they do.

209
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:36,216
In a way, people who say
they live healthily and happily

210
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,012
may be the people who decided
to put all these questions behind them.

211
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,933
People who have decided to lie and say,
"This is just how life is."

212
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,437
I'll never do that.

213
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,190
I don't care
about where I'll go after I die.

214
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,901
I want to see heaven while I'm alive.

215
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,681
Why do you have to
wash your hair at night? Damn it.

216
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,540
Here.

217
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,666
This guy.

218
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,795
Look at him. He's eating them.

219
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,215
This is the asshole I told you about.

220
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,842
He never finishes them.

221
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,135
He just eats half

222
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,638
and leaves them for other customers
to buy and file complaints.

223
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,434
I would be upset, too, if it was
already half-eaten when opened.

224
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,312
He's so stealthy. He's like a ghost.

225
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,981
-I'll report it, okay?
-He'll be released with a warning.

226
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,903
This isn't the first time.
He ate the same product last time as well.

227
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,114
Five times make you
a habitual offender, right?

228
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,992
You'll find more than enough
if we go over the footage.

229
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,243
Take a look.

230
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:54,414
Mr. Kim, what was the date when we got
the complaint about that chocolate?

231
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,999
The half-eaten chocolate.

232
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,505
Where are you?

233
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,173
I'm heading out now.

234
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:07,886
Hurry up, please rescue me.
My eyeballs are about to fall out.

235
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,806
She's in there.

236
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,849
She's just pretending that she's not.

237
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,977
Open the door. I know you're in there.

238
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,946
I wonder if her mother knows
what a nasty bitch her daughter is.

239
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:30,075
A bitch who'd just
date anyone and mooch off them.

240
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,578
Does she know
what kind of money that was to me?

241
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,332
Maybe I should take a crap
right here to teach her a lesson.

242
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,543
I mean--

243
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,087
-You…
-Take a crap. Go on.

244
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,132
I'll release the CCTV footage
and embarrass you.

245
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,883
Go ahead and take a crap!

246
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,385
Why you…

247
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,471
Get her! Someone get her!

248
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:55,725
That bitch! Somebody grab her!

249
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,436
My God. Hey, stop!

250
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,233
Just wait until I get my hands on her!

251
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,194
Hey, come back here!

252
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,780
That nasty…

253
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,369
Why do you want to get a table?

254
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,580
Let's just dance
to a couple songs and leave.

255
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,249
It's on me! So don't worry and let's go.

256
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,710
Get out already.

257
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,669
Hey…

258
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,133
Welcome, sir! You can exit the car.

259
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,092
Yes.

260
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,564
Excuse me, sir! I need the key.

261
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,919
I don't like it here.

262
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,004
What about there?

263
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,299
-That's a bit…
-Why? How much is it?

264
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,807
Just call a driver! I'll pay for it!

265
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,976
There's no way
I'll let anyone else drive it.

266
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,688
Hey, give a driver a chance
to drive a car like that.

267
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:26,900
We'll have this one.

268
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:27,817
Of course.

269
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:37,994
Don't worry. I'll even pay
for all the tips before we leave!

270
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,083
Are you going to die tomorrow?

271
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,977
Today,

272
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,980
I watched CCTV footage
until my eyes popped out.

273
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,108
to catch someone who had been
secretly eating a 1,000-won chocolate.

274
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,069
And now I drove
a 500 million-won car to come here

275
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,238
to drink a 700,000-won bottle of alcohol.

276
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,073
What do you think of that?

277
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,743
Do you think I should hand him
over to the police?

278
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,088
You really aren't listening to me today.

279
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,678
I'm only telling you.

280
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,181
Don't tell anyone.
I don't want to get murdered.

281
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,190
This is my account balance.

282
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,404
My account balance!

283
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,743
It's nine digits.
That means a hundred million won!

284
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,292
Where did you get this money?

285
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,420
Today, you're a guy who drives
a 500 million-won car.

286
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,589
I'm a woman who has
500 million won in her account.

287
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,506
Just enjoy.

288
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,486
Drink up!

289
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,140
Listen carefully.

290
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,477
If I die, I've been murdered.

291
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,898
No matter how much it looks
like a suicide, that won't be the case.

292
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,818
I will never commit suicide.

293
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,487
If I die,

294
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,532
I've been murdered
because of the 500 million won.

295
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,851
All that expensive alcohol…

296
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,728
Who are you, Jeong A-reum?

297
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,896
Saying "This is expensive" all the time.

298
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,983
So what? Do I have to
like everything if they're expensive?

299
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,446
You know I don't like loud places.

300
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,699
Have you ever seen me go to a club?

301
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,249
Just go to sleep, asshole.

302
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,210
Hyehwa and then Sanpo, please.

303
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,874
SANPO SINKS CLOSETS

304
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,297
What are you doing?

305
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,466
Nothing.

306
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,616
ADD COLOR, ADD SHADOW, UNDERLINE

307
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,284
ADD COLOR, MAKE IT BIGGER, SHADOW

308
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,830
Mi-jeong, are you
really going to change it like this?

309
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,127
I have to if he tells me to.
What choice do I have?

310
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,339
What you did is a hundred times
better than what he told you to do.

311
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,592
Everything he does is
just cheap and showy.

312
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,761
That's just the kind of man he is.

313
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:14,140
But your work has an elegance to it.

314
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:18,144
Your designs always
make me stop and look at them.

315
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,939
That's why I always get jealous
when I look at your work.

316
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,983
Are you really going to edit it?

317
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,491
I want to bring this
to the branding department as it is.

318
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:35,370
I want them to know
how that man is ruining all this work.

319
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,165
Are you worshiping me?

320
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,131
Ms. Yeom and I
will go to Gwangju next week

321
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,009
and take care of the researcher training.

322
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,723
All right, that's all for today.
Good work.

323
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,933
Thank you.

324
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,352
Good work.

325
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,396
Why don't we have lunch together?

326
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,480
What do you want?

327
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,775
How about dry bulgogi? It's been a while.

328
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,193
Sounds great.

329
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,320
Don't we have to queue at that place?

330
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,281
Please spare me.

331
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,575
I can't stand in line right now.
I'm too tired.

332
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,411
You seemed okay for a while.

333
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,162
This comes and goes in cycles.

334
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,498
Three days of the week are so tiring,

335
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,583
the other three
are just barely manageable,

336
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,336
and I don't even know
how the last day goes.

337
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:30,008
When I'm tired, just looking at people
queueing makes me angry.

338
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,426
It just pisses me off.

339
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,054
That's why I can't take buses.

340
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,099
The queues for the buses
going to Gyeonggi-do are so long

341
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,394
that they look like
really long strings of beads.

342
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:45,148
Just looking at it
drives my blood pressure up.

343
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,358
There are just too many people.

344
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,236
So it takes forever for my turn to come.

345
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,321
I can't get anything when I want them.

346
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,783
I have to wait for everything. For food,
to get back home, and even men.

347
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,997
It seems you're just angry, not tired.

348
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,252
What is it? What made you so angry?

349
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,550
I think I have an inkling.

350
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:21,434
He promised to treat me twice
but hasn't texted me even once.

351
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,561
So there is someone.

352
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,399
I'm sure he knows
I'm looking at my phone all day.

353
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:29,859
Does he?

354
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,403
How could he not?

355
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,989
When I'm emitting
this huge energy into the universe?

356
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,866
How could it not reach him?

357
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,203
I mean, it's already been three days
since he promised.

358
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:43,206
But he hasn't called or texted me.

359
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,086
I'm sorry.

360
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:51,089
Gosh. He must be psychic.

361
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,597
He messaged her.

362
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,184
Today?

363
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,770
Today is too sudden.

364
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,856
Put it off for a few days.
He's had you waiting this long.

365
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:13,402
Contacting a woman and asking
to meet on the same day isn't polite.

366
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,821
Play hard to get.

367
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,744
It's not interesting
if you say yes at once.

368
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,122
A guy gets anxious the most

369
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,916
when a girl plays hard to get.

370
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,668
That's when guys go crazy.

371
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,587
Just relax and put it off. It'll be fine.

372
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,552
Let's make him anxious, Ms. Yeom.

373
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,637
Try making a man wait for once.

374
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,848
Why do you always
have to be the one who waits?

375
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,408
So when is it going to be?

376
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,743
Tomorrow.

377
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,997
Some delay that is.

378
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,917
Yes. That's the charm of Ms. Yeom.

379
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,798
But is it a good thing

380
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,842
to make him anxious?

381
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,681
Why is it a good thing? He's anxious.

382
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,896
You get anxious, and it drives you crazy.

383
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,149
Isn't that a bad thing?
It's uncomfortable, isn't it?

384
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:38,404
When a man and a woman like each other,
shouldn't you give each other the fullest?

385
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,032
Why would you string it out
in small portions?

386
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:41,991
What is that?

387
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,452
You'll be murdered
if you feed someone like that.

388
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,079
So why do I have to give out
my affection like that?

389
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:51,042
What's good about not getting enough?
Shouldn't you give as much as you can?

390
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,628
Getting anxious and playing hard-to-get…

391
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:58,049
Aren't they all bad things?
Rather than good?

392
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,135
I mean,

393
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,680
it may not be good,

394
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,807
but that doesn't mean it's bad.

395
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,268
It doesn't necessarily mean

396
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,645
it's bad.

397
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,355
It's just dissatisfying.

398
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:17,485
Or insufficient, you could say.

399
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,289
She's meeting him today, isn't she?

400
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,708
Why had I always believed

401
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,169
that this was a good thing?

402
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,847
-Excuse me.
-Yes, sir.

403
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,684
-Can I park my car there?
-Yes, just leave your number there.

404
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,810
-My number?
-Yes.

405
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,551
Hi.

406
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,802
Hi.

407
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,430
Is it here?

408
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,806
No.

409
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,684
It's that one.

410
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:41,819
This place is very popular
with drinkers for its food,

411
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,904
so you usually have to
wait for two months,

412
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,199
but someone canceled
their reservation today, so…

413
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,909
I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue.

414
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,286
It's okay.

415
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,621
I'm glad we didn't have to wait.

416
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:01,088
I didn't even ask what you like
and just chose this place on my own.

417
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,716
I'm not picky at all.

418
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:08,846
Sometimes I want to be picky, but I can't.
Even intestines and chicken gizzards.

419
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,182
What am I saying?

420
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,851
-What's with me?
-May I take your order?

421
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,853
We'll take Course A.

422
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,313
-Course A it is.
-Yes.

423
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,439
For drinks…

424
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,317
I'll take so-maek.

425
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,069
Then, one soju and one beer, please.

426
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,363
One soju, one beer. Coming right up.

427
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,950
It sounds like English.

428
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,161
"So-maek."

429
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,835
You know how we
emphasize the "s" in "soju"?

430
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,837
So it sounds more like English. "So-maek."

431
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,339
Right.

432
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,181
Hello?

433
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,062
We need to park here.

434
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,897
Right. I'll move right away.

435
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,856
-Yes, thanks.
-Sure.

436
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,030
-I need to go move my car.
-All right.

437
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,865
-Okay.
-Take your time.

438
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,044
This street's one-way, too.

439
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,136
I've come too far.

440
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,356
PAID PARKING LOT

441
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,649
How long will you stay?

442
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,693
I'm not sure.

443
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,236
We close at 10 p.m.

444
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,282
-Well, I'll come back before that.
-Payment?

445
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,700
I'll pay now.

446
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,368
Until ten.

447
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,334
Hi, where are you?

448
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,461
I'm at home.

449
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,671
Right, did you drink?

450
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,090
No, but I'm going to right now.

451
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,468
Don't!

452
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,555
Come get my car.
I'll send you the address. It's not far.

453
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,372
I'm sorry.

454
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,917
It's okay.

455
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,085
I shouldn't have brought my car.

456
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,921
The restaurant called out of the blue.

457
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,010
The beer's warm now.
Shall I ask for a fresh bottle?

458
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:53,969
Excuse me.

459
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,012
No.

460
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,598
It's okay. Just catch your breath.

461
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:00,976
What?

462
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,730
Catch your breath, just for a minute.

463
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,389
You didn't have to run.

464
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,478
I parked too far away.

465
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,867
Now I can finally drink comfortably.

466
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,915
POWER OFF

467
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,843
What do you want for dinner?

468
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,678
It's too late to eat, isn't it?

469
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,222
Then, what?

470
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,183
I'm tired. I want to go home.

471
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,227
Is that so?

472
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,938
Why did I wait for you, then?

473
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,403
Shall we go to Paju this weekend?
To see the suspension bridge.

474
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,738
I have a study group.

475
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,239
All weekend?

476
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,284
I need to rest for a day.

477
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:44,913
All right.

478
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,999
That's it, then.

479
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:49,293
We're over as of today. Goodbye.

480
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,800
You study or meet your friends

481
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,136
four or five days a week.

482
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,557
But you ask me about who I meet
every time I meet someone. What is this?

483
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,435
We agreed to date
yet have rarely gone out on one.

484
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,356
We see each other every day at work.

485
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,108
Do we have to meet up outside too?

486
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,986
Is seeing each other enough?

487
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,489
I see everyone at work every day.

488
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,658
If I've seen someone at work
for ten years,

489
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,618
have I gone out with them for ten years?

490
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:24,787
It's over.

491
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,417
People say you're a player.

492
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,091
So I was just keeping
an eye on you for a while.

493
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,801
To see if it's true.

494
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,931
I've never taken a break from dating.

495
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,141
But I've never two-timed anyone.

496
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,727
Or jumped from one girl to another.

497
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,854
I told you that a few times.

498
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,734
Well, you can keep keeping an eye on me.

499
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,444
But I'm done.

500
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,868
This is what always happens.

501
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,997
"Do I owe her something?"

502
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,460
"Why does it feel like
I owe her something?"

503
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,674
I feel frustrated somehow.

504
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:19,633
Yes.

505
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,137
So I end up saying, "Let's break up."

506
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,723
And that's how it ends.

507
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,354
It really is over now.

508
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,701
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

509
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,536
-Have a good night.
-Thank you.

510
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,040
Hui-seon, I'll go pick up the car.

511
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,127
Hurry back. We need to go get
an electric toothbrush for Yu-Rim.

512
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,754
Let's go together now, then.
There are no customers, anyway.

513
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,006
-Shall we?
-Yes.

514
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:00,966
Thank you.

515
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,177
Let's go.

516
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,971
If it was around here,
he should've come to our place.

517
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,931
Why is he paying for drinks elsewhere?

518
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,059
The phone you called is turned off.

519
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:14,563
You'll be directed to voicemail
after the beep.

520
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,194
I…

521
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,282
I think I would be liberated
if I shaved my head.

522
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:33,040
To me, shaving my head means
that I become a mere animal.

523
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,583
A nameless animal.

524
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,503
I feel like it would be all right
to live like that.

525
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,174
It's not like I've achieved anything
by trying so hard.

526
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,219
I wish I hadn't been living like that.

527
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:50,516
It just feels like, if I shave my head,
my desire to look nice

528
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,017
and my desire for a man

529
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,311
would all go away.

530
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,397
So I've decided.

531
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,485
"This winter, I'll either love anyone
or shave off my hair."

532
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,278
"I'll do at least one of them."

533
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,364
"If I waver this time,

534
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,284
I will be suffering for
the rest of my life because of my hair."

535
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,461
Don't…

536
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:21,755
shave off your hair.

537
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,201
If he was going to eat here,
he should've come to our place.

538
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,744
You're dead.

539
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,706
Let's just go.
The supermarket will close soon.

540
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,418
I found you. You're dead.

541
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:50,969
What is this?

542
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,305
Get up.

543
00:48:58,894 --> 00:48:59,770
Leave.

544
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:17,871
Leave.

545
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,069
Who's he drinking with?

546
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:53,782
Who is it?

547
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,742
With his friend. Who else?

548
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,053
Don't shave your head.

549
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,353
I'll do it. I'll be that "anyone."

550
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,040
ARE YOU ALIVE?

551
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,755
The girls are going crazy.

552
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,509
It must be so easy
to get a date with that car.

553
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,239
Hi.

554
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,949
Yes, it's been a while.

555
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,450
Yes.

556
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,245
-I'll get going.
-What?

557
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,621
-Hey.
-Bye.

558
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:05,664
Bye.

559
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,177
You must manage this area as well.

560
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,638
I was recently assigned.

561
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:23,849
We have rotations.

562
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:30,522
Do you want a ride?

563
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,448
It's my friend's car.

564
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,450
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

565
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:48,582
It'll take a long time for you to get back
if you go all the way to my place.

566
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:51,793
I could never give you a ride
while we were dating.

567
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:52,711
Just get in.

568
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,730
You used to go on and on
about cars all the time.

569
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,648
You're finally driving one.

570
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,901
It's not even mine though.

571
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,112
Still…

572
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,449
Not everyone gets to drive
a car this nice.

573
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,954
Where have you gone with this car?

574
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,833
I visited my grandma's grave,

575
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,252
a reservoir in my town,

576
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,756
and Yeongjongdo
since the East Sea is too far away.

577
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:42,886
With who?

578
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,597
By myself.

579
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,937
You've only been to unusual places.

580
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,023
I thought you'd be
showing it off to everyone.

581
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:56,650
Me too.

582
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,235
I thought I would be like that too,
you know?

583
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,029
But I didn't.

584
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,239
I didn't know either,

585
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,118
but I become very gentle when I drive.

586
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:16,002
Oddly enough, I become gentle
as soon as I put my hands on the wheel.

587
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,172
When I was little,
I loved looking at atlases.

588
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:22,133
Oddly, I lost track of time
every time I looked at them.

589
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:26,179
I'd go to cities I'd never been to
in my head.

590
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:30,767
I would go to Chuncheon,
Gwangju, Busan, and even Ulleungdo Island.

591
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,937
It's just like then.

592
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:42,946
I guess I have been putting up
a façade with people.

593
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,658
Now that I'm alone,

594
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:49,911
I've become so calm and gentle.

595
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:55,125
What is that? "Being gentle alone"?

596
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,585
I don't know.

597
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,045
It's just

598
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,631
being gentle on your own.

599
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,019
ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?

600
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,274
I'll see you tomorrow.

601
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,050
Give it back.

602
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,845
I've asked around,
and you'll definitely lose if I sue you.

603
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,389
So just give it back
and stop wasting my time.

604
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:56,269
You snuck into the hospital
every night and coaxed a sick kid

605
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:59,481
into selling his house and sending you
the money. There are witnesses!

606
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,357
The nurses and caregivers all saw it!

607
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:05,070
And the hospital's CCTV
caught you sneaking in every night!

608
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:05,987
Give it back

609
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,989
before you go to jail!

610
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,366
I will if your son dies! Damn it.

611
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:18,500
Your kid is worried that I won't visit him
anymore if he doesn't give me money.

612
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,835
So I show him
the account balance every day.

613
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,548
He says he's so scared of dying,
but he doesn't want to die

614
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,092
holding his mother's hand.

615
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:33,473
The hand of a mother who's just crazy
about money even when her kid is dying…

616
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,183
Who would want to hold that?

617
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:39,270
I pity him so much that he only has
people like you around him.

618
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,773
I'm going to stay with him
until the end, so get lost!

619
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:48,363
How could you only care about money
when your kid is dying in fear?

620
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,489
I'll give it to you.

621
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,200
I'll give it to you
even if he tells me not to.

622
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,451
So just get lost!

623
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:57,914
I hated you from the start.
I should've broken you two up then.

624
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:03,503
It's come to this in the end!

625
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,388
I'm like a dog, you see.

626
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:18,351
If anyone treats me kindly,
I'm loyal to them forever.

627
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,562
I would give them everything.

628
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:24,858
I would have given you everything, too,
if you said at least one thing kind to me.

629
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,610
But you never did. Why?

630
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,737
Shouldn't I have scored
at least 10 points to you?

631
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:32,282
There must be something
about me worth that much.

632
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,451
If you gave me those 10 points,

633
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,619
I'd return the favor
for the rest of my life!

634
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,746
But how is it that you've never
even given me that?

635
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,457
Hey!

636
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,959
Even a single point is too much for you!

637
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:46,421
People like you
should disappear from the earth!

638
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:49,549
How could I accept a girl
who's been with so many different men

639
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,009
as my daughter-in-law?

640
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:54,304
Who knows how you'll end up
humiliating me?

641
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:06,232
WEST BUILDING

642
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,943
YEOM CHANG-HEE:
ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?

643
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:58,993
I AM

644
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:16,010
AND HE IS, TOO

645
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,518
You know,

646
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,438
he gave me as much as 60 points.

647
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,441
Sixty points.

648
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,320
I'll be honest.

649
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,282
Really honest.

650
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,701
I'm not sugarcoating it.

651
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:45,123
You score over 70 points.
At least 72 points.

652
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:46,916
So…

653
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,670
you should have
more confidence in yourself.

654
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:32,211
SANPO SINKS

655
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,685
Here's your iced Americano.

656
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:57,982
Call Baek now.

657
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,359
Call him.

658
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,487
It's not Mr. Baek.

659
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,073
It's Chairman Shin.

660
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,890
It's been a while.

661
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:32,934
It's good to see you.

662
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:33,893
Me too, sir.

663
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:42,860
I couldn't find you
so I thought Baek had really killed you.

664
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,363
But you seem to be doing well.

665
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,244
When I heard that you were well and alive,

666
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:54,330
I thought you'd be back soon.
But you haven't.

667
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,625
So I wondered if you found someone else.

668
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,462
That's why I had some of my people
watch you.

669
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,925
So you're working as a carpenter.

670
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:13,641
Why don't you come back?

671
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:21,983
I get that people want to steal from me.

672
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:26,362
It'd be the same even if I put
my family member in that spot.

673
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:30,491
If I can't do anything about that,
I want someone strong there at least.

674
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,826
Someone I can rely on.

675
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,038
Since Baek has taken that spot,

676
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,416
I hang my head in shame

677
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:40,585
everywhere I go.

678
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,048
Come back.

679
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:50,761
What is it?

680
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,972
Do you need more time?

681
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:58,895
Yes, sir.

682
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:02,982
But what is it

683
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:05,526
that you need to do here?

684
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,331
I worship you.

685
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:06,856
Mi-jeong's so lucky, Dad.
She's hit the jackpot.

686
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,191
Give me a name already, okay?

687
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:12,069
Unbelievable.
Someone joined the Liberation Club.

688
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,279
Welcome.

689
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,989
I'll give you a ride today.

690
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:16,657
Really, I want to give you a ride.

691
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,743
Where else are you going to kiss him?

692
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:22,872
Well, I was going to go home
then heard Chang-hee was here…

693
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,373
Should I give you a ride?

694
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:26,250
-It's a friend's.
-Which friend?

695
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,918
Which friend?

696
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:31,338
I get why he wants to stay here, though.

697
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,758
You just wait there for me,
you son of a bitch.

698
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:37,470
I told you, I don't care
what kind of life you've led.

699
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,473
Aren't you angry?

700
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:48,647
