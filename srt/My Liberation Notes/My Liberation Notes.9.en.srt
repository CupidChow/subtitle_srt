STAR CLASS
MOON CLASS

2
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,025
SANPO SINKS

3
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,489
Careful.

4
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,377
Yes, please put them from here to here.

5
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,420
Sure, got it.

6
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:14,342
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

7
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,637
SOMETHING GOOD

8
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,225
WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

9
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,911
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY.
IMMEDIATELY HE SPOKE TO THEM AND SAID,

10
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,746
TAKE COURAGE! IT IS I. DON’T BE AFRAID.
MARK 6:50

11
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,421
It's just outside of Seoul.

12
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,716
I feel better when I see this.

13
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,870
Here, drink this.

14
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,466
Doesn't my tan look bad?
As if I got it while working on a farm?

15
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,551
The one who works on a farm is pale.

16
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,096
I'm starting to peel.

17
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,725
You'd think coconut crabs would taste
sweet because they eat coconuts, right?

18
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,061
But they're not. Not at all.

19
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:52,273
SANPO KITCHEN SINKS, CLOSETS
CUSTOM-DESIGNED FURNITURES

20
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,342
I'm very happy, thanks to you.

21
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:27,350
I'd had it and thought
I couldn't work with him anymore.

22
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,852
And, again,

23
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,563
there was no way
I'd find someone he'd like.

24
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,985
He's a different level of grumpy.

25
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,405
He doesn't even say
what he wants properly.

26
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,407
He just yells
if he doesn't like something.

27
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:52,667
How do you two just know what the other
needs without saying a word?

28
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,547
He just looks around, and you just
know what he wants and give it to him.

29
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,135
I've lived with him for 40 years
and I still can't do that.

30
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,848
Maybe you were partners
in your past lives.

31
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:07,974
Such perfect teamwork.

32
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,357
I'm home.

33
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,359
Hey. You're back just in time.

34
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,070
-Sit. Eat before you wash up.
-Okay.

35
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,659
A new product came out. Try it.

36
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,360
It must be cooling down.

37
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:05,448
Even just a few days ago,
it was still so hot around this time.

38
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,660
I can tell the season is changing here.

39
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,704
But I can't tell in Seoul.

40
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,415
Hey, walk on this side.

41
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,923
There's something dead there.

42
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:23,966
What is it?

43
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,053
A bird?

44
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,224
I hope someone flips it over.

45
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:39,315
Why do animals die with their bellies up?

46
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,942
Like humans.

47
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,826
You see a dead animal every morning
in a neighborhood like this.

48
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,121
The head of a rat left behind by a weasel,

49
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,748
or a squirrel that drowned
in a water tank.

50
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,460
I used to see dead frogs most often
when I was little,

51
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,003
but we don't have paddies now.

52
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,299
Back when our house was
surrounded by paddies,

53
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,344
frogs used to cross the street
every night,

54
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:12,431
from this side to that side.

55
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,892
But if a car went by then…

56
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,771
you'd hear them burst.

57
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,192
In the dead of the night…

58
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,702
The next morning, you'd see

59
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,289
frog bits all over the ground
like confetti.

60
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,628
But I don't know why they'd always
cross the street at night.

61
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,134
Was the ground too hot
for them during the day?

62
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,565
I used to not talk unless someone made me.

63
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,526
"Would anyone want to hear
what I have to say?"

64
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,403
But now,

65
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,449
I just say whatever's in my head.

66
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,201
It just…

67
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,703
comes out.

68
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,123
And…

69
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,294
I have this feeling I've never had before.

70
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,466
Suddenly…

71
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,763
I feel lovable.

72
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,902
Who says something like that while eating?

73
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,860
Enjoy your lunch.

74
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,529
-Thanks.
-Well, then.

75
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,751
Is that why?

76
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,670
Yes.

77
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,673
You're so brave.

78
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:56,137
I wanted to tell him how I felt,
but I was still scared to do it.

79
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,265
So I had a backup plan
in case I got rejected.

80
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,642
And this was the result.

81
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,353
You seem better than I expected, though.

82
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,525
My face still gets red
when I think about it.

83
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,904
But I can get over it
by humming to myself.

84
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,824
You're amazing.

85
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,161
I haven't seen such a spirit in a while.

86
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,373
To be honest, I feel okay

87
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,335
because of his attitude, you know?

88
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:31,631
You know, you told me I'm the type
who cares about a guy's attitude.

89
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,466
So the reason it turned out that way--

90
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,885
Thanks for the food.

91
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,220
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

92
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,639
Coffee's on me.

93
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,977
I turned my phone off that day
because I was so embarrassed.

94
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,979
Why? In case he called you?

95
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,565
No. In case he didn't.

96
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,319
I thought it would be better not to know

97
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,781
whether he called me or not
than to know that he didn't.

98
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,240
But then…

99
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,577
"Right, I'm injured!"

100
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,081
"It's only right
that he should ask if I'm okay."

101
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,624
"I'm even his sister's friend."

102
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,918
"Of course,
he should ask if I'm all right."

103
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,503
So, I turned it back on.

104
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,923
Are you okay?

105
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,636
Have you seen a doctor?

106
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,637
CHO TAE-HUN

107
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,807
You must have turned your phone off.

108
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,770
Please send me a message. I'm worried.

109
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,819
Even when I was talking
to people at church today,

110
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,530
my heart was heavy all day long.

111
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,617
Did you order my jjamppong?

112
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,910
I did.

113
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,747
I've looked back on it.

114
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,208
I realized

115
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,627
I always had fun when you were around.

116
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,673
You were always smiling.

117
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,261
I felt very supported when you asked me
for the list of friends

118
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,138
who put me in that fight.

119
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,557
Yes.

120
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,476
It's fair to believe that I led you on.

121
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:08,978
I'm sorry.

122
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,149
I hope our relationship doesn't end here.

123
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,362
I'd like to treat you to a meal,
as I promised.

124
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,490
Whenever, wherever.

125
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,492
As soon as you can,

126
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,369
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

127
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,415
CHO TAE-HUN

128
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,169
He's sincere.

129
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,004
Yes, exactly.

130
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,590
Honestly, I was terrified.

131
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,301
I was terrified that he'd think,
"This girl's nuts."

132
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,636
"How dare she ask me out," and ignore me.

133
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:47,183
But he…
The way he put how he felt into words…

134
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,020
It's my first time feeling this grateful
after getting rejected.

135
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,813
I read it over and over.

136
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,608
-I've even memorized it.
-He said he went to church, right?

137
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,444
Yes, church.

138
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:07,495
To tell you the truth,
I did a lot of self-reflection.

139
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,581
To all the guys who asked me out
that I got so angry at…

140
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,335
There have been guys.
Please don't think there weren't any.

141
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,004
There's your world, and there's my world.

142
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,090
But in both worlds,
men and women are exactly the same.

143
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,676
Asking out, getting rejected,
crying, and laughing…

144
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,471
Well, anyway,

145
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,724
I repented my arrogance

146
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,310
and decided to take a leap of faith…

147
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,730
and I think I did well.

148
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,775
Even if you get rejected,
you can learn something

149
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,193
if it's by a gentleman.

150
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,819
I think

151
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:46,158
I saw how dignified a person can be.

152
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,581
But that doesn't mean

153
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,876
I'm holding out hope or anything.

154
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,462
I'm not, really.

155
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,090
It's just,

156
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,843
I learned something
about dealing with people,

157
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,681
so I think I'll be able
to love someone this winter.

158
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,185
I think you will.

159
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:17,856
Really.

160
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,280
GOURMET PORK CUTLET
DOUBLE CRISPY

161
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,241
From Friday onwards, A-reum's dad owns
Branch 2 in Baehyeon.

162
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,494
Will he be better or worse
than his daughter?

163
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,206
Don't bother hoping.
Have you still not given up?

164
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,044
If you think about it, it's simple.

165
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,172
It's her dad's store.
She'll visit often to make more money.

166
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,508
"Let's sell this and that. Don't do that."

167
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,052
She'll be doing everything.
Just forget it.

168
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,055
You just need to focus
on your own performance.

169
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,517
I thought I would be grateful
if only A-reum would disappear,

170
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,520
but I even have to
deal with her father now.

171
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,441
I had a dream a few nights ago.

172
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,027
I had leeches on the back of my hand,

173
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,238
and more appeared
until my whole hand was covered in them.

174
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,823
So I said,

175
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,702
"I have no blood, I'm a block of wood,"

176
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,079
and all of them just fell off,
totally powerless.

177
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,874
What a weird dream.

178
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,044
Don't you guys dream?

179
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,087
I have at least three dreams a night.

180
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,672
-Hey.
-What?

181
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,716
So this is where you guys were.

182
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,594
Have you been waiting long?

183
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,304
Not at all.

184
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,390
Table for two?

185
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,061
Can we go first?

186
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,314
Sure, go ahead.

187
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,650
All right. Thank you.

188
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,952
"I am

189
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,287
a block of wood."

190
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,420
-You guys wait here.
-Sure.

191
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,765
Seriously.

192
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,142
Why are the tables at that restaurant
all so small?

193
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,353
Once you put your phone and wallet on it,

194
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,188
there's no space left to put your cup.

195
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,525
And you have to eat
so carefully, like this.

196
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,360
Why do we have to eat like that?

197
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,823
What did you have, Chang-hee?

198
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,787
I asked what you ate.

199
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,788
Kimchi stew.

200
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,624
-At Mr. Park's place?
-Yes.

201
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,545
You should have told me if you were
going to eat kimchi stew there!

202
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,047
I'd have gone there, too.

203
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,718
It seems the queue there
wasn't too long today.

204
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,302
Seeing as you came back early.

205
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,349
What will you have tomorrow?

206
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,810
I don't know
what I'll want to eat tomorrow.

207
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,147
How about you eat the kimchi stew
there again tomorrow?

208
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,821
-Do you like me?
-What?

209
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,949
Why do you follow me around?

210
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,868
What?

211
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,870
When did I follow you around?

212
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,663
Are you a narcissist?

213
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,623
That's ridiculous.

214
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,167
It's ridiculous for me too.

215
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,047
I'm not even your boyfriend.
Why do I have to queue for you?

216
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,467
When did I ask you to queue for me?

217
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,470
I was just asking. I can't even do that?

218
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,473
Asking me if I could have
kimchi stew again tomorrow

219
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,392
sounds like you're asking me
if I could queue for you.

220
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,146
For office workers, a nice lunch
is the only thing we can enjoy.

221
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,148
Why do I have to
give that up just for you?

222
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,566
Are we that close?

223
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,947
Why don't you queue for me tomorrow, then?

224
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,159
I think I'll want to have
Pyongyang naengmyeon tomorrow.

225
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,620
Will you queue
at Yaksan Naengmyeon for me?

226
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,956
Why do you ask people

227
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,667
for something
you're not willing to do for them?

228
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,763
What's your problem?

229
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,223
I mean,

230
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:23,477
if you want to eat kimchi stew,
is asking that we go together

231
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,270
something to get this angry about?

232
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,316
I said, I don't know
what I'll want to have tomorrow.

233
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,255
Hey, stop! Pull over.

234
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,799
Damn it.

235
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:27,958
Damn it.

236
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,012
What's wrong?

237
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,014
It seems there was an accident.

238
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,277
It's really you.

239
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,410
What are you doing here?

240
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,611
Golf went strangely well for me today.

241
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,031
So I thought, "This must be my lucky day."

242
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,993
And it turns out it is!

243
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,998
You, Gu Ja-gyeong, hid so well
that no one knew if you were alive,

244
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,208
yet I bumped into you on the road.

245
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,966
What are you doing here? Are you putting
on a show? Acting like you're broken?

246
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,011
A show?

247
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,686
Why do I have to act like I'm broken?

248
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,528
Hey, what kind of guy calls someone
and asks if they're driving

249
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,946
when his girlfriend died?

250
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,281
Asking to stop the car.

251
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,033
Who does that?

252
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,202
I thought you were talking about my wife.

253
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,538
But it was your girl.

254
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,009
You must have been acting.

255
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,220
You wanted her dead, didn't you?

256
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:58,502
I heard you cried so hard
when your dog died.

257
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:02,089
That you went around
with your eyes all red.

258
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,968
But a person died. Your girl, at that.

259
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,937
How did you not cry at all?

260
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,648
How could a human be like that?

261
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,195
You have no idea
how frustrating she could be, do you?

262
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,573
Of course not. She's your little sister.

263
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,270
What a relief, right?

264
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,523
It would've been bad
if you guys got into a big accident.

265
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,823
Change the rope tomorrow.

266
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,577
What would you have done
if you weren't with Mr. Gu?

267
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,150
Sometimes…

268
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,653
he buys this one.

269
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,625
How old is he?

270
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,629
Where's he from?

271
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,851
She wouldn't stop asking,
so I just made things up.

272
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,728
"He's 38."

273
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,647
"He's from Seoul."

274
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,692
In case she asked your name,

275
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:13,822
"Gu Ja-cheol, Gu Ja-seung, Gu Ja-gyeong."

276
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,575
I tried to come up
with names that start with "Ja,"

277
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,077
but she didn't ask in the end.

278
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,126
Did I get "Ja" right?

279
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,422
It must be either "Bon" or "Ja," right?

280
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,436
Are you tired?

281
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,358
I walked 10km.

282
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,571
Why?

283
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,041
I didn't have my wallet on me.

284
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,467
Rest up, then.

285
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,280
I'm home.

286
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,366
Okay. Have you had dinner?

287
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,909
I ate.

288
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,535
Why are you coming from Gu's house?

289
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,419
Did he ask you to buy some liquor for him?

290
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,634
We just talked.

291
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,469
About what?

292
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,438
Why can't you tell me?

293
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,403
We're dating.

294
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,086
Oh, my God.

295
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,560
ALCOHOL STATION
GWANGHWAMUN 1ST ST.

296
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,024
There are so many things
about her that bother me.

297
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,194
Why did I have to blow up over food?
That's so lame.

298
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:02,490
Why is 80% of what you say
when we drink about Jeong A-reum?

299
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,826
It's not like you love her.

300
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,537
I want to stop talking about her, too.

301
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,165
But I have to stop seeing her to do that.

302
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,710
Don't worry.

303
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,754
You won't once you become a manager.

304
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,214
It's only a few days away.

305
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,092
You never know if I will.

306
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,637
At least one of you should get promoted.

307
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,057
Either you or A-reum.

308
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,187
On the day I don't have
to see her anymore,

309
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,354
don't stop me.

310
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,024
Don't stop me. I'll give my all.

311
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:41,613
I'll go at her so hard
that she'll have to change.

312
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,948
I'll join your battle.

313
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,658
I will build you a monument

314
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,535
in front of Dangmi Station.

315
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,790
Well, you can lash out at her
if you want to.

316
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,668
But, hey, Chang-hee.

317
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,753
You…

318
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:03,176
You need to think about why you hate
Jeong A-reum so much, at least once.

319
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:07,347
What, do I have to think to know that?
Don't you hate A-reum?

320
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,058
You don't just hate her.

321
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:14,813
You hate her so much.

322
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,524
She makes me hate her so much.

323
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,192
For us, it's just…

324
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:23,446
"God, she's crazy. What a bitch."
Nothing more, nothing less.

325
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,115
Try being seated next to that crazy lady

326
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,369
and listen to her yammer on all day.

327
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:33,414
A woman who has no humanity at all
but is just full of greed,

328
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,751
talking all day about stuff
that's not even interesting. You try it!

329
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,216
If Jeong A-reum wasn't rich…

330
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,303
would you have hated her that much?

331
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,433
If she was a normal woman
from a normal family,

332
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,061
would you still have hated her that much?

333
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,065
Just be honest.

334
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,068
Am I being insincere?

335
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,571
Hey, tell me. Am I the bad guy?
Am I the bad guy here?

336
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,116
Rich or not, she deserves to be hated!

337
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,492
I mean, what I'm saying is…

338
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,536
That's enough.

339
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,871
What I'm saying is,

340
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,332
you might be just as greedy as A-reum

341
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,043
but just pretending that you aren't.

342
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,005
You know? In this world,
there are greedy people everywhere.

343
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:25,133
Why do you hate Jeong A-reum so much?

344
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,636
Should I hate someone I don't know, then?
She's the one I know.

345
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,264
I mean, what I'm saying is,

346
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,100
don't deny your greed,

347
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,895
and just take what you want.

348
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,731
If you become rich?

349
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,484
You won't hate Jeong A-reum anymore.

350
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,197
If I get rich?

351
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,287
Why would I hate anyone?

352
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,581
When I have enough, why would I?

353
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,834
Why are you saying something so obvious?

354
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,756
If I get rich…

355
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,510
Well, I'll probably
hate her just a little.

356
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,779
I mean…

357
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,489
Did I say something wrong?

358
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,827
I need to tell him the truth, don't I?

359
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,162
We're friends.

360
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,315
Let's go!

361
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:20,790
I'm not even some hero
trying to save his country.

362
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,918
Why do I feel so ashamed?

363
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,176
SANPO KITCHEN SINKS, CLOSETS

364
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,518
Aren't you going to change the rope?

365
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,526
Oh, dear.

366
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,587
I might be living like this,

367
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,716
but there are plenty of people
in the sink business

368
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,094
who drive expensive cars and play golf.

369
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,599
I just made a mistake
standing surety for someone.

370
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:06,729
But thanks to this business,
I managed to pay off that debt

371
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:10,983
and hold onto my land and house.

372
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:23,371
If you do this work steadily,
you'll have a good life.

373
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,258
I'll go buy a new rope.

374
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,595
Everything…

375
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,184
looks bizarre when it's on the ground.

376
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:32,023
It's just a nail,

377
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,650
but why does it look
like a woman's dead body?

378
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,029
That's creepy.

379
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,865
Whose is it?

380
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,116
I don't know.

381
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,337
I went to the mall for a change,
but it only ruined my mood.

382
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,007
Are they that great?
Why are they laughing so loud?

383
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,301
I felt so small all by myself.

384
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,345
Go with me next time.

385
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:06,015
I just went to buy
a stick of lipstick, damn it.

386
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,326
Why do I

387
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:31,540
hate other women my age who shop
in groups at the mall so much?

388
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,377
Because they're there to spend money.

389
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,380
They must have husbands. And kids too.

390
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,840
In front of those women,

391
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:44,136
I want to make them feel small by buying
something too expensive for them.

392
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:49,183
I want to have a body that the sexiest,
coolest clothes would look good on.

393
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,938
I hate seeing a family of four even more
than those women who shop in groups.

394
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,815
Those perfect fortresses.

395
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,486
We also came from families, you know?

396
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,571
Hey, we never go anywhere as a family.

397
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,700
Why would we? Seeing each other at home
is already more than enough.

398
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,957
The family we'll have one day…

399
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,837
Will it be the same
as the family we came from?

400
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,719
It's all the same.

401
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:29,932
But you still want to do it.
Humans are so dumb.

402
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,229
-Hello.
-Hello.

403
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,440
There you go. Time to go home.

404
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,275
-Bye.
-Bye.

405
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,276
-Yu-rim!
-Let's go.

406
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,944
-Did you study hard?
-Yes.

407
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,738
-Goodbye.
-All right, goodbye.

408
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,823
-Should I carry your bag?
-It's okay.

409
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,200
Let's go home.
Auntie made deep-fried squid.

410
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,291
Your auntie

411
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,378
borrowed all the books you need
from the library.

412
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,507
Studying is hard, right?

413
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:10,556
Why do you always say "auntie did this,"
"auntie did that" when you talk to me?

414
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,688
Just in case

415
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,566
people think I'm your mom,

416
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,569
and that makes you upset.

417
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,202
Your mom's so much prettier than me,
you know?

418
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,765
Is it good?

419
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,604
I envy you. You have aunties,

420
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,731
who cook delicious meals for you.

421
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,274
My auntie was…

422
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,276
Go and sleep if you're drunk.

423
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,369
Aunties are all you've got.

424
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,956
Your aunties have decided
to give up on being women.

425
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,334
But your dad…

426
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,587
he's still a man.

427
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,969
I know everything, you punk.

428
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,642
Did that girl ask you for a Chanel?

429
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,644
You've never bought us lipstick.

430
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,941
I already saw that thing in your trunk.

431
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,198
Do you think something in a Chanel bag
has to be from Chanel?

432
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,075
It's a toolbox.

433
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,540
Cho Gyeong-seon,
go to your room and sleep,

434
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,084
He's definitely seeing someone.

435
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,879
Lately, he's been looking
at his phone all day.

436
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,505
He changes the pattern lock now.

437
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,883
Hey, you never used the pattern lock
before, right?

438
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,053
See? I'm right.

439
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,972
That punk's seeing someone.

440
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,683
Hey! Show me your phone, you bastard!

441
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,310
Gosh!

442
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,979
I told you not to swear at him.
He's a father.

443
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,987
What about me?

444
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:36,535
I'm an auntie.
And I'll be forty very soon!

445
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,669
YEOM GI-JEONG

446
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,463
THANK YOU. YOU'RE VERY CONSIDERATE.

447
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,344
ARE YOU OKAY?

448
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,429
DELETE

449
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,892
I'M FINE. THERE'S NO NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

450
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,438
I'M TOUCHED.
LET'S DRINK AGAIN SOMETIME.

451
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,777
DELETE FOR ME
THE MESSAGE WILL ONLY BE DELETED

452
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,195
FROM YOUR CHATROOM AND WILL STILL BE
VISIBLE TO YOUR FRIEND(S)

453
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,783
DELETE

454
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,684
I've seen a fake nail
on the window sill of a bus once,

455
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,060
and it felt so weird.

456
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,522
It's bizarre when you see a thing
somewhere it doesn't belong.

457
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,152
A bird lying on the ground,

458
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,446
a man hanging in a tree…

459
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,660
even a dog on a farm.

460
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,419
How come you didn't drink today?

461
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,764
3 MISSED CALLS

462
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,559
WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING AGAIN?
I HEARD YOU MET BAEK. WHAT HAPPENED?

463
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,289
Why won't you answer it?

464
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,791
I don't have to.

465
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,962
Are you tired today, too?

466
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,678
What is it?

467
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,931
You told them we were dating.

468
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,394
Yes.

469
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,773
Why did you do that?

470
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,275
You don't even know when I'll leave.

471
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,408
This could've passed
without anyone knowing.

472
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,082
It's not a big deal
for people to date and break up.

473
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,458
Why keep it a secret?

474
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,223
I'll leave after eating some.

475
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,352
So say what you want to say
if you have anything.

476
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,445
A long time ago…

477
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,287
I this saw on TV.

478
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:13,585
There's this famous cliff in the US
where people commit suicide.

479
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:18,882
And they interviewed people
who survived after jumping off that cliff.

480
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,802
They all said…

481
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,432
when you reach two-thirds of the way
down the cliff,

482
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,768
whatever made you want to kill yourself,

483
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,813
didn't feel like anything anymore.

484
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,066
Just a few seconds ago,

485
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,737
they thought dying was
the only way out and jumped.

486
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,740
But in just a few seconds,

487
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:45,742
that feeling

488
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,496
started to feel like nothing.

489
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,087
I thought it would be the same for her.

490
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,757
So I told her.

491
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,015
"To a person who feels like
living is so painful,

492
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,727
getting therapy

493
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,564
is reaching two-thirds
of your way down a cliff

494
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,696
without ending up killing yourself."

495
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,282
And…

496
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,247
that she should see a therapist.

497
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,042
I told her that.

498
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,085
But…

499
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,422
she just jumped and died.

500
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,063
Who did?

501
00:46:58,857 --> 00:46:59,942
The woman…

502
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,778
The woman I used to live with.

503
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,996
You told her that
because you wanted her dead, didn't you?

504
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,457
She was already vulnerable.

505
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,001
And you encouraged her, didn't you?

506
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,883
Yes. I was telling her to die.

507
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,684
It was so…

508
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,440
frustrating to see her suffer so much.

509
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,662
I'll stop if you tell me to.

510
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:56,999
The worshiping…

511
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,628
You can take it back.

512
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,145
When did I ever worship you?

513
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:14,326
You bastard. It's you that killed her,
but I can't sue you for it.

514
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:17,579
Saying you told someone
to die won't fly in court.

515
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,622
What do I do then?

516
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,750
I've got to kill you myself.

517
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,009
Come on. I didn't hide that hard.

518
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:32,969
Okay?

519
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:36,473
I waited with my door open,
but you never came.

520
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:41,311
You were so quiet
after taking all of my business.

521
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,066
You don't care about that at all.

522
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,426
Did you two have sweet dreams?

523
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,014
They should just announce it
at nine in the morning.

524
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,683
But at 5 p.m.?
Are they teasing us on purpose?

525
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,061
But if they did it in the morning,
it'd affect your work.

526
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,855
Are you saying I won't get it?

527
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,232
Whether you get it or not,
it will affect you.

528
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:16,406
Whatever the result is,
let's have a drink together tonight.

529
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,076
Yes, sir.

530
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,962
Do you have time this evening?

531
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,380
How about dinner together?

532
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,776
You said you were going to bed,
but you spent the night with that bastard?

533
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,321
I went to bed. Then I got a call
from him and went out to see him.

534
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,531
I already told you!

535
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,951
I'm asking why you had to go see
your ex-boyfriend for God's sake!

536
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,453
He said he was really sick.
How could I have not?

537
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:07,082
Why would you go just because
an ex tells you he's sick?

538
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,125
Yes, I would. Even if they're my ex.

539
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,628
Even if we broke up,
I'd go see you if you were sick.

540
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:15,507
Even if it was an ex I broke up
with ten years ago, I would go!

541
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,426
So?

542
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,429
You just nursed him all night?

543
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,348
You did nothing else all night? Fuck!

544
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:26,184
What else would I have done
with someone so sick?

545
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:30,605
Why are you breaking my stuff?
Go break your stuff, you bastard!

546
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:36,778
Damn you. I'll do it, too. Damn it.

547
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,072
You crazy bastard.

548
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,226
I was definitely fine.

549
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,688
Why do I feel different than yesterday?

550
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:14,774
You've had a drink.

551
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,402
I keep thinking about what he said.

552
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:21,489
That it felt like he lost
both of his arms when he lost his parents.

553
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,536
I feel bad since I feel like
I've abandoned a guy who wants to escape

554
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,164
from feeling weak.

555
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,544
I mean, I'm the one who got rejected.

556
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,213
But why does it feel like I abandoned him?

557
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,757
It's driving me crazy.

558
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,425
Hey, what is this?

559
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:43,845
I'm the one who got abandoned.
I'm the one who got rejected!

560
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:53,813
His place is just 500m from here.

561
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,155
Let's go.

562
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,782
Where?

563
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,367
-Home.
-Okay.

564
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,332
Slow down.

565
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,252
You don't need to use the bathroom?

566
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,425
"Let's run away."

567
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,469
Telling myself that,

568
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,639
I got on the train in a hurry.

569
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:33,937
Why do I feel sorry for you
when I should feel sorry for myself?

570
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,524
Tae-hun, be bold.

571
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,402
Be bold so I won't have to worry
about you.

572
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,196
Yeom Gi-jeong.
You're the one who got rejected.

573
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:46,032
Why are you feeling bad for him right now?

574
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:13,852
MY LIBERATION YEOM MI-JEONG

575
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,292
Was it a power cut?

576
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,097
I love this feeling.

577
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:18,351
Feeling spent
after I've emptied my bowels.

578
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:23,148
Feeling relieved that I made it
without soiling my underwear.

579
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,735
I downed two iced lattes

580
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,864
because I wanted
to have diarrhea so badly.

581
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,283
It didn't seem to work all day.

582
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,744
But I suddenly started to feel it
on my way back home.

583
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:41,624
I thought "I can hold it.
I can hold it until I get home."

584
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:46,212
And when I was almost there,
I saw my dad going into the bathroom,

585
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,968
I was like, "I can make it.
I can make it to Gu's place."

586
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,555
And lucky me. You even have a bidet!

587
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:59,559
My butt felt so good,
I felt like I was going to fly.

588
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,855
I use that old toilet you crouch over.

589
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,942
We have three people going to work
in the morning, but only one toilet.

590
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:14,949
My dream is to be like you.

591
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,703
Living alone, with a bidet.

592
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,543
Why do you look angry?

593
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,465
Right.

594
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,092
You must have been startled.

595
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,095
I'm sorry.

596
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,439
Neither of us

597
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:48,816
got promoted.

598
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:54,864
Not me or the woman I really hate.

599
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,493
And since we didn't get promoted,

600
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,496
we have to see each other
for another year.

601
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,751
They say like attracts like.

602
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:12,006
Why can't I get away from where I am?

603
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:17,804
I felt like I was stuck somewhere,

604
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,599
but after giving it my all,

605
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,727
I feel much better.

606
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:30,191
Though I failed to get promoted,

607
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:35,947
I survived another day
without soiling my underwear.

608
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:41,828
Bit…

609
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,914
talking to you in a low volume like this,

610
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,085
makes me feel as if we're very close.

611
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:56,175
They say like attracts like.

612
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:01,514
What do you think
we're meant to do together?

613
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:05,810
I said, get off!

614
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:23,828
The last train has left!

615
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,695
SAM-SIK:
I'M AT OIDO STATION, EXIT 1

616
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,406
SAM-SIK:
WHERE ARE YOU?

617
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,284
VILLAGE BUS STOP
SANPO

618
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:11,668
Hello?

619
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,046
He's not getting up!

620
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,507
Yes, can you come to the station?

621
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,889
AVAILABLE

622
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,227
Get up!

623
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:43,908
OIDO STATION

624
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,748
TAXI
AVAILABLE

625
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,875
I think he got wind of it.
He's not here, sir.

626
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:54,502
What?

627
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,760
God damn it.

628
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,309
What are you waiting for? Keep looking!

629
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,519
-Yes, sir!
-Yes.

630
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,234
Who tipped you off?

631
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:22,280
I mean, you got off
the train midway that day.

632
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,449
Who told you?

633
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:54,896
I didn't!

634
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,815
I know you ate it.
I heard rustling last night.

635
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,317
You always play dumb.

636
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,611
Go buy another one.

637
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:59,979
There are a lot of crazy jerks
who do bad things and blame you for it.

638
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,689
I don't owe you anything, do I?

639
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:04,901
It's just what you say when you want
to end it with a woman, isn't it?

640
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:07,194
I could picture his past at once.

641
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,905
A man who fell from the very top…

642
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,533
