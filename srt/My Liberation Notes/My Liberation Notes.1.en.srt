1
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,405
Your drink is ready.

2
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,244
Thank you. Come again.

3
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,247
So I joined the tango club,
and I was appalled.

4
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,875
You can hear people breathing up close.

5
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,835
Why do people breathe so loudly?

6
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,922
My boss put his hand on my shoulder,

7
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,590
and it was hot and sweaty.

8
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,468
In table tennis, there's sweat everywhere.

9
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,470
It just spatters everywhere.

10
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,430
When my boss got in the elevator with me,

11
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,557
I pulled back without even realizing it.

12
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,894
I can still feel all the moistness
I felt on that day.

13
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,898
Sweating with your colleagues
is not the way to go.

14
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,235
Musical and theater clubs are the best.

15
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,903
You can just enjoy the show.

16
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,697
The problem with those clubs
is the meet-up after.

17
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,741
How you feel about the show
should be up to you.

18
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,160
But they always
force their opinions on you.

19
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,871
If I say I enjoyed it,
they say it was boring.

20
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,206
It drives me crazy.

21
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:07,377
I mean, can't we separate the clubs
into older and younger groups?

22
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,462
Right? Can't someone suggest it?

23
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,548
Then the higher-ups will be upset.

24
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,465
You think?

25
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,217
What's it like in your clubs?

26
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,718
It's mostly people in their forties.

27
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,221
How about yours, Mi-jeong?

28
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,099
She's not a part of any, remember?

29
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,809
That's right, she doesn't do any.

30
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,060
Not even one?

31
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,563
Why? They cover all the costs.

32
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,439
Many sign up for two or three of them.

33
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,650
You know…

34
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,444
I'm just not interested.

35
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,572
Hey, you think we do it because we are?

36
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,365
You go to have fun!

37
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,659
And if you can get a date out of it,
even better.

38
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,955
It takes me three seconds
to realize there's no one there for me.

39
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,373
Nine times out of ten.

40
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,709
Most of the time, seriously.

41
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,628
But there's always that one chance

42
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,964
that you might meet someone.

43
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,759
That's why it's worth going to
ten different clubs.

44
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,512
Come with me today.

45
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,599
Just come, okay?

46
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,821
You can do it! Just one more!

47
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,656
Haven't you joined any clubs?

48
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,451
Why not? There are many good clubs.

49
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,369
I live quite far away.

50
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,746
Where do you live?

51
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,664
In Sanpo.

52
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,833
Is that by Yongin?

53
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,168
It's near Suwon.

54
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,671
Good luck, sir!

55
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,964
You got this, boss!

56
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,430
Nice!

57
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,692
Well done.

58
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,833
You can do it!

59
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,293
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

60
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,634
Looks like I'll be late today.

61
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,390
JUNE 21ST

62
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,307
Let's go!

63
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,228
Hey, I can drink more.
I'm taking a cab home today.

64
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,355
-Will Mi-jeong be late too?
-Yes.

65
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,029
I'll be late too.
Meet me at Gangnam Station at 12.

66
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,616
You got this!

67
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,519
Let's just talk about it face to face.

68
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,230
Our whole relationship
has been over texts.

69
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,524
Even all of our fights were through texts.

70
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,484
You want to break up through a text too?

71
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:23,031
At least when we break up, I want
to say it loudly right to your face.

72
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,699
I'll be waiting.

73
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,076
I said, I'll be waiting!

74
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,081
-Nice shot!
-Nice shot!

75
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,334
I'll be late too.

76
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,255
I'll see you then.

77
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,433
-You're so good at bowling.
-Are you sure you're not pro?

78
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,351
Gosh, you're so good at bowling.

79
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,770
You were incredible.

80
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,688
-You were amazing.
-You're really good.

81
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,939
You even got a strike.

82
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,691
How are you so cool?

83
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,110
-Everything you tossed out was a strike.
-No.

84
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,908
-I know, right?
-You're so good at it.

85
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,578
I can't get my form right.

86
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,666
Are you leaving? Stay a bit longer.

87
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,335
It's late.

88
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,797
I'll head out first.

89
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,423
You're leaving already?

90
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,509
I need to catch the last train.

91
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,094
She lives far away.

92
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,845
Where was it again?

93
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,263
You should move closer.

94
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,974
Doesn't our company offer
a housing subsidy?

95
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,351
It's only ten million won.

96
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,644
-That's it?
-Yes.

97
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,646
All right, cheers.

98
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:48,699
Where are you?

99
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,546
Hello.

100
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,964
You came pretty early.

101
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,091
It's been ages. Seeing anyone these days?

102
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,386
Another beer glass
and a pair of chopsticks, please.

103
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,345
Sure.

104
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,183
He asked where I lived.

105
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,770
I said I live in Gyeonggi-do,
so it didn't matter where we met in Seoul.

106
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,314
I told him to pick a place
that worked best for him.

107
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,649
I did say that.

108
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:27,029
But shouldn't he at least have asked
where in Gyeonggi-do I live in?

109
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,698
But he went, "Really?"

110
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,491
Then he said to meet in Samcheong.

111
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,951
Can you believe that?

112
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:35,872
Anyway, so I followed Route 1
all the way up,

113
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,457
crossing the Han River.

114
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,460
This guy clearly has no idea
what Gyeonggi-do even looks like.

115
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,420
I went all the way up there, but…

116
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,546
Jeez, I'm tearing up.

117
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,631
Hey, where can you buy a gun in Korea?

118
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,341
A slap in his face won't cut it.

119
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,510
I should just put three bullets in him.

120
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,183
Do you know what it's like for me
to go to Seoul on the weekend too?

121
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,602
How could they set me up
with someone like that?

122
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,937
Being divorced, I don't care about.

123
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,522
It's no big deal these days.

124
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,193
I would even be jealous. I might
even be okay if he's been married twice.

125
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,112
But come on, he has a kid!

126
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,075
Nothing's more precious to you
than your own kid.

127
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,370
But that kid means nothing to me
since it's not my kid.

128
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,081
We already have
such a huge thing dividing us.

129
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,709
A woman and a man
are trying to live together,

130
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,670
but if their priorities are different,
how could that ever work?

131
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,384
Hey.

132
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,763
His kid is an eighth-grader.
You know what they're like.

133
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:38,059
You can't tell if they are animals
or a malfunctioning cyborg…

134
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,820
A lot of people who already have kids
marry each other and live happily.

135
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,032
They recognize
the importance of each other's kids

136
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,284
and care for them…

137
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,892
Why should I not say anything?

138
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,481
Did you two fight?

139
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,697
How could you be
like this on her birthday?

140
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,246
Did your mom give you anything?

141
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,626
Come on, eat up.

142
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,964
Look at me.
Do I look like I haven't eaten yet?

143
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,845
What did your mom give you?

144
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,055
Didn't she give you anything?

145
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,098
She did.

146
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,642
Then why aren't you telling me
what she gave you?

147
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,271
I asked her for money.

148
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,615
Happy birthday.

149
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,534
They're earphones. Expensive ones.

150
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,412
Thank you.

151
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,956
Thanks for being born.

152
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,792
Thank you, truly.

153
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,006
Who do your Auntie Hui-seon
and I have but you?

154
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,509
When we're old and lonely,
I'm glad we'll have someone to call.

155
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,428
Hey, don't worry.

156
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:42,224
I won't bother you too much.
I'll try to kick the bucket in one go.

157
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,811
-I got it.
-I'm just relieved.

158
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,815
I'm glad to have you.
You're like insurance.

159
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:55,905
When you were born, you were so little.
I couldn't believe you were actually real.

160
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,241
When did you get this big?
When did you turn into a whole person?

161
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,080
By the way, do you usually speak
this quietly in a barbecue restaurant?

162
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,836
I've never seen people whispering
while drinking at a barbecue place.

163
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,591
-I feel terrible, I drank too much.
-Right.

164
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,426
Hey, it's late, let's go.

165
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,719
Yes, it's late.

166
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,623
Go.

167
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,007
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,094
Pick it up for her, will you?

169
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,846
A beer, please!

170
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,348
Where is he?

171
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,189
Thank you.

172
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,316
I may have gotten divorced…

173
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,113
but the best decision I ever made

174
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:20,906
was getting married.

175
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,704
How else would I have met
such a precious kid?

176
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,890
How do you know him?

177
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,434
From work.

178
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,728
Then you should've said hi sooner.

179
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,939
I just know his face.
We're not on the same team.

180
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,831
Jo Yu-rim!

181
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,709
Did you eat the seaweed soup
I made for you this morning?

182
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,712
You call that soup? It was so thick
that I couldn't get the ladle in.

183
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,841
What did Auntie Gyeong-seon get you?

184
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,387
That looks expensive.

185
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,556
Happy birthday to you

186
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,563
We're already here. Hurry up.

187
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,815
I'm on my way. I'll be there soon!

188
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,529
I can't believe him.

189
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,908
YEOM GI-JEONG

190
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,662
So you were messaging me
and that guy at the same time?

191
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,247
At one in the morning, at that!

192
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,792
You don't do that? Everyone texts
more than two people all the time.

193
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,503
Not when I'm texting my lover
at one in the morning.

194
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,839
I don't text my lover "I miss you too"
when it's meant for someone else

195
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,216
and then delete it.

196
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:07,179
I don't send a bunch of heart emojis
and LOLs to others while texting my lover.

197
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,474
Did I meet him in person
and flirt or something?

198
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,185
You know you have to
be more friendly in messages.

199
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,730
You can't tell if words are being said
with a smile or a serious look.

200
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,858
That's why I stick a LOL
at the end of everything.

201
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,026
Don't you do that?

202
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,030
Is that why you told him
you missed him, then?

203
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,490
To be friendly?

204
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,284
What's wrong with saying I miss him?

205
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:32,454
I miss BTS.
I miss my grandma. I miss my uncle.

206
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,831
I miss a lot of people.

207
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,459
Don't you miss anyone?
Don't you ever tell people you miss them?

208
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,837
Don't you know
"I miss you" means "I love you"?

209
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,381
Only to you.

210
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,924
It only means that to you!

211
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,551
Try asking people!

212
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,178
If a man and a woman say
they miss each other at night

213
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,680
means anything or not.

214
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,765
I told you to wait, please!

215
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,350
Sure, fine, let's ask.

216
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,435
Who should we ask?

217
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,270
-Go on, ask someone!
-Seriously.

218
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,858
You're worried about the cab fare
even in this situation, aren't you?

219
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,903
You asked to meet here
because of that too.

220
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,196
-Yes.
-Do you want to end things like that?

221
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,781
Yes, absolutely.

222
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,200
What's wrong with
meeting in the middle for once?

223
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,829
I went to your neighborhood
to see you every time.

224
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,748
Do you know how far it is from my home?

225
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:19,043
I had to spend another hour and a half
just to get home.

226
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,046
That's your problem.
Who told you to live so far away?

227
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,428
Then does he live in Seoul?

228
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,641
Let me ask you one thing.

229
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,770
Does he even know that you have a lover?

230
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,942
-He knows I have a boyfriend.
-Is a boyfriend not a lover?

231
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,989
Who uses the word "lover" these days?
It's so lame.

232
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,617
Even people born in the 70s
don't say that.

233
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,911
Ask around if people still use that word.

234
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,704
You know what?

235
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,707
You are unbearably old-fashioned. Really.

236
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,127
Disgustingly old-fashioned!

237
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,878
We're home.

238
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:08,837
We're home.

239
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,235
Keep it down!

240
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,046
Hey.

241
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,757
That guy was telling us off earlier,
wasn't he?

242
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,844
It was our mistake.

243
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,388
How were we to know?

244
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,062
Apologize and give him
a gift certificate for me.

245
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,897
I'll give it to you later.

246
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,485
That's too much.

247
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,485
-Where are you going?
-To get my hair done.

248
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,405
You say you're tired every morning
but you're going out again?

249
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,241
-You should rest on the weekend.
-As if anyone would let me.

250
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,954
I'll die if I work in the field
on a day like today.

251
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,502
Go and pretend you're helping at least.

252
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,006
Don't just sit around all day
until your dad tears into you.

253
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,343
Don't you feel bad
that your old man has been out

254
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,512
working under the sun all day?

255
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,933
I was going to go help him.

256
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,286
Hey, Dad.

257
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,960
I have something to tell you.

258
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,422
Just eat your food quietly.

259
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,311
I mean…

260
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,647
I'm not asking for help or anything.

261
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,859
I just want your permission.
An "okay" or something like that.

262
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,322
I'm…

263
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,283
thinking of buying a car.

264
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,127
It's an electric car.

265
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:08,131
Electric cars don't cost that much.
It's only 7,000 won to fully charge it.

266
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,175
They say 50,000 won is enough per month.

267
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,676
If it's 50,000 won a month,

268
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,304
that's a lot cheaper
than taking the bus or the train.

269
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,765
And second-hand cars
don't even cost that much.

270
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,810
Don't you remember
the last time you bought a car

271
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,312
and put yourself through hell?

272
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,189
Back then, I--

273
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,275
You couldn't even afford it,
but you bought it on an installment plan.

274
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,486
So I had no choice but to help you.

275
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,820
But you're at it again?

276
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,949
What I'm saying is
I didn't know any better then.

277
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,450
I do now.

278
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:38,954
My expenses, budget, my spending habits…
I know all that stuff now.

279
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,915
So I'm planning
to get a small electric car.

280
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,502
Don't just say no without considering it.

281
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,753
Just hear me out.

282
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,923
It's a car, it's not like
it's some luxury item.

283
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,093
And I'm not buying it
so I can show off to anyone.

284
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,845
I mean, how can I?
They don't even go fast.

285
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,847
Look.

286
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:02,102
If Mi-jeong, Gi-jeong, and I stay out late
and take a taxi home, that's 30,000 won.

287
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,104
With an electric car,
it'll cost 3,000 won,

288
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,897
but we're paying 30,000 won for it.

289
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,112
Dad, come on, I mean…

290
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,447
I'm not being unreasonable here.

291
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,074
If you think about it, I'm right.

292
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,951
An electric car is cheaper.

293
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,662
Don't just say no
because it's a car, please.

294
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,580
How much is it?

295
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,459
Like I said, it's a cheap one.

296
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:28,920
In installments again?

297
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,897
Dad.

298
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,400
I…

299
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,278
don't have a car

300
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,488
and I live in Gyeonggi-do.

301
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,870
How am I supposed to get married
let alone date anyone?

302
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:06,374
All of the magic happens inside a car,
but I don't have one, Dad!

303
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,959
Where can I kiss a girl?

304
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,722
Why are you being like this again?

305
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,891
Seriously…

306
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,603
I don't want to keep
any secrets from you, Dad.

307
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,231
I really don't want
to hide anything at all from you.

308
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,943
Honestly, I could buy a car secretly,
hide it anywhere I wanted

309
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,695
and act like I never bought one.

310
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,989
But I don't want to do that, okay?

311
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,575
I don't want to hide
anything at all from you.

312
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,118
I never have.

313
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,579
I wish you would.

314
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,666
Please hide it from me.

315
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,630
Come on.

316
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,444
That punk, I ought to…

317
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,197
I told him to keep his mouth shut
at the dinner table.

318
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,198
Goodness.

319
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,995
Tell him your dad will start
at seven tomorrow,

320
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,206
but he can come by nine.

321
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,166
Don't just tell him to come by nine.

322
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,169
Then he'll know what you mean
and come early.

323
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:38,425
Why do we have to walk
on eggshells around someone we hired.

324
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,597
That brat, one of these days…

325
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,688
I ought to just…

326
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,130
They said you can come by nine tomorrow.

327
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,042
I'm going to sue that salon.

328
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:09,891
On the street that the nun walks across

329
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:17,732
My old friend pretends
He doesn't even know me

330
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,026
-Like how they sell cigarettes
-Don't wash your hair.

331
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,402
Your curls will come undone.

332
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,281
-That's why I'm washing it.
-At a local pharmacy

333
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,785
-The world carries on peacefully
-What a waste of money.

334
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,788
It goes its own way

335
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,875
-Bustling down the street
-I'm currently working two jobs.

336
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,711
I'm a soccer coach at an elementary school

337
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,463
and I also run a coffee shop.

338
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,718
If I'm being honest, it's just one job.
The cafe went bankrupt.

339
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,888
On that roadside

340
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,932
-Where time breathes
-Actually…

341
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,892
what I love most is singing.

342
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,145
To be able to support myself
with my singing is my dream.

343
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:00,608
Without anybody knowing

344
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,904
I walked around crying

345
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,906
I like this kind of song.

346
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,409
I can do louder music too.

347
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:16,583
Looking down the street
From the second floor

348
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:23,882
It was a peaceful street, yeah

349
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,050
If you're done, bring the dishes.

350
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,928
-Looking down the street
-Looking down the street

351
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,891
-From the second floor
-From the second floor

352
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:38,229
-There was nothing but a thick fog
-There was nothing but a thick fog

353
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,188
Damn it!

354
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,900
This song's so old.
This is why you were rejected, dumbass.

355
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:42,901
Jeez.

356
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,574
Have you ever felt

357
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,577
an unbearable kind of humiliation?

358
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,749
As soon as we said goodbye
after the blind date,

359
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,417
she started sending a bunch of texts.

360
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,794
She said

361
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,213
I was an abandoned dog.

362
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,345
She said that if she took me home
and cleaned me up,

363
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,014
I'd just go back outside
and get covered in poop again.

364
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,395
She thought she was there alone
with her friend,

365
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,314
not knowing I was there.

366
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,778
She kept going about how upset she was
and then said "OMG!"

367
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,237
Then she left the room.

368
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,117
She could've
at least deleted her messages.

369
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,411
You should just leave too.

370
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,372
That's even more humiliating.

371
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,710
You idiot!

372
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,299
But I must endure this.

373
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,135
Deleting it
won't make me forget what happened.

374
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,596
I just have to bear it.

375
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,515
Here.

376
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,684
Delete it for me and leave the chatroom.

377
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,564
Du-hwan.

378
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,114
Thanks…

379
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,201
for one-upping me.

380
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,916
Ye-rin told me…

381
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,087
I was unbearably old-fashioned.

382
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,721
The abandoned dog wins.

383
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,101
Hey, someone please one-up me.

384
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,227
Mi-jeong.

385
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,939
You have to beat me, okay? Please.

386
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:54,365
She knows exactly what words
to use to hurt my feelings.

387
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,203
As an abandoned dog,

388
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,832
I don't think
being called old-fashioned is that bad.

389
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,711
That's because you just are
an old-fashioned person.

390
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,214
And I'm a person who may
or may not be, and that's why it hurts.

391
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,385
Do you know
what she said about Gyeonggi-do?

392
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,221
She said Gyeonggi-do's like an egg white.

393
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,266
An egg white that wraps around Seoul.

394
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:27,899
I told her I live in Sanpo many times,
but she had no idea where Sanpo was.

395
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:31,235
Or whether I take Line One or Line Four.

396
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,197
She said it was because
she would never live in Gyeonggi-do.

397
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,034
If you like someone,

398
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,704
the first thing you do is
look up where they live.

399
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,541
It doesn't have to be New York,

400
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,753
but if I had been born in Seoul…

401
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,928
Why did I have to be born
in an egg white, of all places?

402
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,726
If we had lived in Seoul,

403
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,354
would we have been any different?

404
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,774
We would have.

405
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,401
I agree with him.

406
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:37,677
SANPO SINKS

407
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,737
Will you stop it already?

408
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,780
You've been crying all night
since you got home last night.

409
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,991
And there you go again
as soon as you wake up.

410
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,327
I'm having a hard time, all right?

411
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,121
You think you're the only one?
What about her?

412
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,707
She's still young!

413
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,048
Fate is nothing more
than a person's outlook on life.

414
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,337
Hey.

415
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,005
Have you eaten?

416
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,990
SANPO
KITCHEN SINKS, CLOSETS

417
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,798
DANGMI STATION

418
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,248
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

419
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,008
JOY SUPPORT CENTER

420
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,217
WINNER JOY BASEBALL CLUB
JOY CARD HORSE RIDING CLUB

421
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,470
I heard you went to the bowling club.

422
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,138
How was it?

423
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,265
It was good, wasn't it?

424
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,810
People tend not to drop out
of that club once they join.

425
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,146
Members tend to be
quite satisfied with that club.

426
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,773
What do you say?

427
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,025
Would you like to join them
starting this month?

428
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,408
Or would you rather
try a few more before you decide?

429
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,496
Do I

430
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,332
have to join a club?

431
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,378
Well, it's not compulsory,

432
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,298
but work life isn't really
anything special, is it?

433
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,677
No matter what job it is,
after six months, it becomes mundane.

434
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,765
But it's a lot better
when you get along with others.

435
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,059
It also increases productivity.

436
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,570
Did you not join a club either?

437
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:09,990
No.

438
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,623
Are we under special care or something?

439
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:26,590
Can't they just leave
introverted people alone?

440
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,441
I have a daughter who's in fourth grade.

441
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,695
I have to go home early
and take care of her.

442
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,992
So I will join a club later

443
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,286
when things become more manageable.

444
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,422
Here you go.

445
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,007
AUTUMN TRIP

446
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,592
Okay. Thank you.

447
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,980
Everyone.

448
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:26,734
Assistant Manager Mr. Min suggested
we should go to Euljiro today!

449
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,029
I'm all for it!

450
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,698
Can I eat to my heart's content?

451
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,492
I'll just eat a little.

452
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,868
I love you.

453
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,953
Is everyone in?

454
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,830
-Yes!
-I'm in, too!

455
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:40,748
Yes!

456
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,509
Mi-jeong, I know you've read these.
Why aren't you replying?

457
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,140
HEHEHE

458
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,393
It's too far for me
to get back home from Euljiro.

459
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,359
How can you spend
every day of your youth going home?

460
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,535
This isn't right.

461
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,494
CHOI JUN-HO

462
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,496
No, that's not right.

463
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:27,836
That's not right.

464
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,299
Neither is this.

465
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,802
Up to here, the color's…

466
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,514
This needs to be lower, in bold,
and highlighted.

467
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,566
INCREASE THE FONT TO HERE

468
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,608
BRING IT DOWN FURTHER

469
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,653
KERNING
BOLD

470
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,904
TERRIBLE LAYOUT

471
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,656
MORE AESTHETICALLY PLEASING

472
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,824
PAY ATTENTION
TO THE COLOR COMBINATION

473
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,412
CHANGE THE COLOR

474
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,664
REDO ALL THE COLORS

475
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:46,415
If I imagine that I'm sitting here
working next to you,

476
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:50,044
even awful tasks like these
turn into something beautiful.

477
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,129
Work becomes bearable.

478
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:57,843
I'm playing a role
of a woman who is loved.

479
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,679
A woman who has everything she needs.

480
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,641
Right now, I love someone,

481
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,559
and that someone is supporting me.

482
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,022
So I want to imagine I'm at peace.

483
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:14,818
That I'm already enjoying the good times
that I'll be spending with you.

484
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,321
That's how I want to think of it.

485
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:22,409
Rather than going through exhausting,
difficult times without you,

486
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:27,748
isn't it more admirable that
I'm finding strength thinking of you?

487
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,675
I know a dried pollack place.

488
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,260
-Dried pollack?
-Sounds good to me.

489
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,513
I'm in a good mood. Let's go!

490
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,514
Great!

491
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,476
Try to find someone
to set up with Mi-jeong.

492
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,895
I don't really know anyone.

493
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:53,691
From a woman's perspective,
Mi-jeong is so pretty and kind.

494
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,734
I don't get
why she doesn't have a boyfriend.

495
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,946
Yes, she's pretty. Sure.

496
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,449
When you look at
each of her features individually, she is.

497
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:03,909
But?

498
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,954
As a whole, she's quite bland.

499
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,164
She doesn't have that something special.

500
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,305
If we had lived in Seoul,

501
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,809
would we have been different?

502
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,604
We would have.

503
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,443
No matter where I lived…

504
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,904
I think I would have been the same.

505
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,993
Regardless of where I lived,
my life would have been just like this.

506
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,506
I'd be living the same mundane life,

507
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,759
and no one would ever be interested in me.

508
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:08,390
I felt like if I lived like this
for too long, I'd shrivel up and die.

509
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,186
That's why I invented you.

510
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,189
You, who I'll meet someday.

511
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,818
To you, at least…

512
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,071
I wouldn't be that ordinary, right?

513
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,203
I don't know who you are.

514
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,041
I don't even know where you are.

515
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,377
And I've never met you.

516
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,424
Who…

517
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,098
are you?

518
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,159
This one's expired. Do you want it?

519
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:27,970
Do you want to eat Seoul?

520
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,305
I don't really like Seoul.

521
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,854
I can't even be bothered
to ask you what you mean.

522
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,409
Headquarters said they'll
empty the place on the 18th.

523
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,077
Keep the doors locked until then.

524
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,455
I don't know how to lock them.

525
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:00,586
I've operated this place 24/7
for ten years.

526
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,379
So I've never done it.

527
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,965
How did you go to the bathroom?

528
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,801
A bike lock.

529
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,263
I just wrapped one around
the handles and went.

530
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,269
Be sure to let me know
when you get married.

531
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,604
I'll give you

532
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,982
five hundred thousand won
to congratulate you.

533
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,778
I'm serious, let me know.

534
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,697
I mean it!

535
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,240
I will.

536
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,952
Just because I'm closing the store down,

537
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,496
it doesn't mean I'm closing the door
on our friendship.

538
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:41,960
What do you think?

539
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,463
Will you get married next year?

540
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,345
What is it?

541
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,899
What decides your fate?
She says it's your outlook on life.

542
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,359
Then what's my outlook?

543
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:09,488
I can be positive
about things occasionally.

544
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,906
Just one day, on my payday.

545
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,949
I'm not so bad that day.

546
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,662
You can afford to have a good outlook
if you have money.

547
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,748
The saying that love makes you kind
has some truth to it.

548
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,335
Whether it's money or a man,
if you have something,

549
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,796
you become positive, but…

550
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,590
do I have a man or any money?

551
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,508
I have neither.

552
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,928
So how am I supposed to be positive
and have a good outlook on things?

553
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,266
I thought I'd feel better
if I had my hair done,

554
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,976
but it just made me feel worse.

555
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:51,029
I can't drink anymore. I feel so terrible.

556
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,325
I feel even more terrible
because I don't like how I look today.

557
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,160
I just want to go home and lie down.

558
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:35,217
If you're more than five days late
on your credit loan payment,

559
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,886
your card gets suspended
and things become complicated.

560
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,681
This is why you shouldn't take out loans
to lend others money.

561
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,687
Do you know how much your loan balance is?

562
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:57,072
For 15.484 million won,

563
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,491
you need to pay
about 1.5 million won per month.

564
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,601
You'll be receiving a letter
at your home address soon.

565
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,202
The bank contacted me
because the loan payment is overdue.

566
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,454
Call and tell me what's happening.

567
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,001
UNREAD
1:06 P.M.

568
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,589
I'm home.

569
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,048
Hey, what about dinner?

570
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,508
I ate.

571
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,094
Close the door properly,
or mosquitoes will come in.

572
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,704
What's the occasion?
You never come here on the weekend.

573
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,081
I guess you don't have
anything better to do.

574
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,599
Hey. What about us?

575
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,658
Gwang-min's driving me crazy.

576
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,494
I'm seriously considering
quitting teaching.

577
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,537
How could a teacher badmouth his students?

578
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:10,914
You're an adult.

579
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:13,166
You badmouth your colleagues
every day too.

580
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:14,250
They're my colleagues.

581
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,796
My colleagues are kids, okay?

582
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:20,966
Who's that woman?
The one you're always badmouthing.

583
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:25,303
The one who has "nasty, nasty, nasty,"
written all over her face.

584
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,806
Gwang-min is that woman to me, all right?

585
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:31,893
Do you know how hard it is to be stuck in
a classroom with Gwang-min all day long?

586
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,103
Do you play favorites?

587
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,980
Yes, totally.

588
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,482
What about you? Don't you play favorites?

589
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,567
I never play favorites. I hate everyone.

590
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,237
There isn't a single person I like.

591
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,781
You can't keep being like that.

592
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,909
I mean, that's why you struggle every day
and keep getting older.

593
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,578
Jeez.

594
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,498
I guarantee you.

595
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:57,002
Gwang-min isn't the problem.
You're the problem.

596
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,130
I also have a guarantee of my own.

597
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:04,426
Your colleague who has "nasty,
nasty, nasty," written all over her face

598
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:07,053
is probably normal too, you know?

599
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,555
She's only like that to you.

600
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:10,849
Let's stop,

601
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,851
-or we'll develop feelings.
-For who?

602
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,692
Hey, give me another can.

603
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,497
Stop bringing it over.

604
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,082
We've had enough.

605
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,821
Stop that. Is it that funny
that I broke up with her?

606
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:11,159
Just because I'm single, doesn't mean
I'm going to hang out with you.

607
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:15,497
To be honest, we only became friends
because we lived in the countryside.

608
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,626
If we lived in the city,
I wouldn't have been friends with you.

609
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:23,630
There were less than 15 people our age
within a 10km radius,

610
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,299
so I had no choice
but to hang out with you.

611
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:29,052
That's the problem with the countryside.
Everyone ends up being friends.

612
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:32,388
When I tell people that the four of us
used to play together.

613
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,390
They think we got along really well.

614
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,560
But the truth is, there were
only four kids around here.

615
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:42,107
She had no one her age and played
with the village idiot, didn't she?

616
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,024
With Dumbo.

617
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,694
Don't call him Dumbo. He's over forty now.

618
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,947
Forty? Probably more like fifty.

619
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:54,327
In the countryside,
friends and family are the same.

620
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:57,789
Do you get to choose your family?
You're born, and they're your family.

621
00:56:57,872 --> 00:57:00,500
And they say
this kid living next door is your friend.

622
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,837
Even at school,
if you don't like the kid next to you,

623
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,673
you can just play with another kid.
But in this neighborhood?

624
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,800
You don't get to choose.
It drives me nuts.

625
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:13,596
Hey, I feel the same. I never became
friends with you because I liked you too.

626
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,936
I should have been born in the Joseon era.

627
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,942
"From this day forth,
this person is your spouse."

628
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,820
Then I'd say, "Yes, I promise to love him
with all my heart."

629
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,280
Even if I lived like that,

630
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,490
I think I would have been just fine.

631
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,412
This era where you have to choose
someone for yourself is way harder for me.

632
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:43,501
I get rejected every day
but I prefer being in the present.

633
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:46,421
If I were born in Joseon,
I'd definitely have been a peasant.

634
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,340
You're a peasant right now as well.

635
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,268
They say that
if the crickets are chirping,

636
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,478
it's 24 degrees Celcius out.

637
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,355
Apparently, they know

638
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,774
that winter's on its way.

639
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,987
That's why they're working
so hard to find a mate

640
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,156
so they don't have to
spend the winter alone.

641
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:20,121
Even those tiny little creatures
find love, you know?

642
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,164
But as humans,

643
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,291
shouldn't we be able to find love too?

644
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:27,045
Even they know what it's like
to have no partner in winter.

645
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,214
They're chirping away so desperately,

646
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:32,884
crying "winter's coming, it'll be cold,
don't leave me all alone."

647
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,802
We should do that too.

648
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:36,638
Okay?

649
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,890
What are you going on about?

650
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:43,144
Do humans have to do it
just because bugs and even cats do it?

651
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,731
Do we have to poop
on the street like dogs do?

652
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:50,151
Don't then, you bastard!
I'll kill you if you do, okay?

653
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,112
Hey, let's do it.

654
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,324
Let's do it, okay?

655
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,704
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to love just anyone.

656
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:04,832
Anyone? Really?

657
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,501
Yes, anyone.

658
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,336
Why can't I just love anyone?

659
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,838
I was picky and ended up like this.

660
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,967
I was so careful not to pick a loser,
I have no one.

661
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,762
I'm allowed to just love anyone.
I'm going to love just anyone.

662
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,432
Starting tomorrow,

663
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,519
why don't you two just disappear?

664
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:26,813
They're nuts.

665
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:36,781
-Thank you for the meal.
-Yes.

666
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,408
You worked hard. Go rest.

667
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:39,867
Yes, get some rest.

668
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,536
Good night.

669
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,080
And don't drink too much!

670
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,302
There's "anyone" over there.

671
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,138
Hey, run away!

672
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,931
Stay out of Yeom Gi-jeong's sight!

673
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:02,890
Get down!

674
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,645
-Get down!
-Have you lost it?

675
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,398
-Idiot.
-What are you doing? You're so loud.

676
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,566
You idiot.

677
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,152
Get down.

678
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:15,987
Come on, stop it.

679
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,157
You're nuts.

680
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,408
Why would you do that?

681
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:14,629
I was wondering if you could
receive a piece of mail for me.

682
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,928
I'm expecting something
I don't want my family to see.

683
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,076
I'm sorry. I didn't have time to ask you.

684
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:11,370
What did he use to do?

685
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,456
Maybe he's in hiding here.

686
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:16,709
-He bought alcohol again.
-He says I should move there.

687
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,754
I'm a woman who has a lot of charm.

688
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,339
You've got to be kidding me.

689
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:24,884
Is he on bad terms with his girlfriend?
Who has he been talking to for so long?

690
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,011
We're breaking up!
Just go out with her instead then!

691
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,513
Something I had to figure out

692
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,389
but couldn't bring myself to.

693
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,767
-What did Mr. Gu say to you?
-It's nothing.

694
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,019
What? Yeom Mi-jeong doesn't live here.

695
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:39,106
Don't tell me you went out with him.

696
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,525
I don't think I can do it.

697
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,777
I want to feel whole for once.

698
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,987
I'll pick it up later.

699
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,697
Why do you drink every day?

700
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:48,908
Should I give you something
to do other than drink?

701
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:57,583
