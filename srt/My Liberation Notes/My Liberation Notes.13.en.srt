1
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,835
It's such a shame about today, sir.

2
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,797
I swear I almost hit it.

3
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:33,968
Sir, why don't we go around
to check out the other side?

4
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:43,686
One of my managers got into some trouble
and has been arrested by the police.

5
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,148
For something personal.
It has nothing to do with the club.

6
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,650
But…

7
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,530
I think our chatrooms
have been exposed to the police.

8
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,199
So…

9
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,702
they must've figured out
how much we charge per table,

10
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:05,041
so we'll have to
declare our real income, sir.

11
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,378
Then…

12
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,381
we'll just have to raise the price.

13
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,467
Yes, sir.

14
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:58,678
-One, two, three! Rock, paper, scissors!
-One, two, three! Rock, paper, scissors!

15
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,471
-Yes!
-Yes.

16
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,431
-Hello?
-Damn it.

17
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,266
You can reserve a table now.

18
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,060
All right, I got it!

19
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,032
DAILY SALES REPORT

20
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,910
TOTAL REVENUE
UNREPORTED CASH INCOME

21
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,731
LEDGER

22
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,247
I'll make sure you have fun…

23
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,831
The hosts are coming in!

24
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,708
Go on in.

25
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,180
Well…

26
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,891
There are quite a few unpaid bills lately.

27
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,436
By the guests or by the managers?

28
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,397
Hey, man.

29
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,027
Bring me the ledger.

30
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,696
Hey, send the managers in.

31
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,655
Yes, sir.

32
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,535
You gambled with the boys, didn't you?

33
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,786
Hey…

34
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,204
Are you serious?

35
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,999
I quit gambling ages ago.

36
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,167
I really didn't do it.

37
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,070
When did you become a manager?

38
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,032
Three months ago, sir.

39
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,034
And you have this many unpaid bills?

40
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,036
What's this? 1,2 million won?

41
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,873
A customer changed her number
and ghosted us.

42
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,126
And the hosts don't know anything?

43
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,255
Even if we find them,
I doubt they have any money.

44
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,428
It's two women, who came in at times
with their salary.

45
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,265
They always paid
with several credit cards.

46
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,309
You put them on the tab

47
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,104
knowing they were going to ghost us?

48
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,109
Chun-ja…

49
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,028
Chun-ja!

50
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,663
-Did you call me, sir?
-Call Ssaebi over.

51
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,086
Ssaebi's gone to Busan today
to collect money, sir.

52
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,885
You took a picture of their IDs, right?

53
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,930
-Yes, sir.
-Follow me.

54
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,448
Damn it.

55
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,783
Are they coming or not?

56
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,993
-Pay up, come on.
-Just not my day.

57
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:51,911
Thank you.

58
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,921
Tell me everything you know about her.

59
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,347
Why does the boss

60
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,474
call you random names?

61
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,226
Like "Chun-ja" or "Mal-ja."

62
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,772
Well, I changed my name, you know.

63
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,776
And I don't think
he likes that name very much.

64
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,404
What's your new name?

65
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:28,739
Don't tell me…

66
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,577
"Bin"?

67
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,621
It doesn't have "bin" in it, does it?

68
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,794
Damn it.

69
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,421
Watch it, you bastard.

70
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,464
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,550
-Here.
-Hey, you know her?

72
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,388
Oh, this girl?

73
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,433
She slips into a really strong dialect
when she's drunk.

74
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,226
The one that came with that big girl?

75
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,815
Girls who are afraid of others finding out
always come with the same friends.

76
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,774
That's right.

77
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,319
They didn't look that close,

78
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,279
but they always came together.

79
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,282
Didn't she say she works
at a dermatology clinic?

80
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,036
-A cosmetics store.
-Right. Cosmetics.

81
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,120
Where?

82
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,081
It was an old neighborhood.

83
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,543
Right. A department store
in Myeong-dong, sir.

84
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,420
She said she worked there.

85
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:45,149
I'll show you how I became a manager
in just two weeks and the boss in a year.

86
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,567
Just watch.

87
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,288
There she is.

88
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,129
Can't you see her?
To your right, 1 o'clock.

89
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,560
You over there, who drank
at a host bar and ran off without paying!

90
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,904
You, I'm talking to you.

91
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,656
Hey.

92
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,498
Did you enjoy drinking
with those pretty men for free?

93
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,419
Look at me.

94
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,171
I said, look at me.

95
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,842
Give my money back, you bitch!

96
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,644
Please choose the service you require.

97
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,026
PLEASE ENTER YOUR PIN

98
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,070
INCORRECT PIN

99
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,158
Good night, sir.

100
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,524
WE PROVIDE THE BEST SERVICE

101
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,446
Are you hungry?

102
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,677
Your mom's here! Time to go home.

103
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,598
Where are your clothes?

104
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,356
You bastard! Are you serious?

105
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,775
How dare you bring our baby here?

106
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,527
Just leave with the baby.

107
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,736
You crazy bastard!

108
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,239
Let go! Let go of me, woman! Let go!

109
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,366
Come out, you bastard!

110
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,952
-What the hell's wrong with you, woman?
-What?

111
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,121
-Can't I drink in this kind of place?
-What makes you think you can?

112
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,587
Where did we put the jacket?

113
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,855
I'm the head of the household!

114
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,649
You don't even earn much!

115
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,568
What's wrong with you?

116
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,634
Here's your jacket. Let's get you home.

117
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,635
All right.

118
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,512
Oh, dear.

119
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,639
Oh, dear.

120
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,558
Come here. Good boy.

121
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,726
Oh, dear.

122
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,395
"Bye-bye, mister."

123
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,955
You should have dinner, sir.

124
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,583
You haven't eaten anything today.

125
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,346
If you eat at 4 a.m.,

126
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,265
is it dinner or breakfast?

127
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,562
I think it's dinner if you eat
before you go to bed,

128
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,231
and breakfast if you do after you wake up.

129
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,703
Did you eat yet?

130
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,167
The new cook's food is very good.

131
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,835
Why don't you try it?

132
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,269
Have you ever seen a baby?

133
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,819
A baby.

134
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,739
A baby…

135
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,704
Not in a while.

136
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,874
Why do you ask?

137
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,461
This one time,

138
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,464
a baby came to the club.

139
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,346
Some asshole brought his kid.

140
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,606
It must have felt as if a bird flew in.

141
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,084
Dig in.

142
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,350
She said you seemed
to like sweet potato stems.

143
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,560
So she sent some.

144
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,757
Good morning, sir.

145
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,803
Mi-jeong!

146
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,348
Yeom Mi-jeong!

147
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,608
Did you call me, sir?

148
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,113
Mi-jeong.

149
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:17,990
Yes, sir.

150
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,493
What do you want to do?

151
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,203
Sir?

152
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,833
I want to be in a really good mood,

153
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,460
but I have no idea what I should do.

154
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,838
So I'll let you do what you want to do.

155
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,631
What do you want?

156
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,848
Is there anything
you wish to happen today?

157
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,976
Is there anything like that?
Yeom Mi-jeong!

158
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,895
Go on, tell me.

159
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,815
I want to go home!

160
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,533
I want to go home

161
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,703
back to Naju, sir!

162
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,921
I'm going home!

163
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:56,672
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

164
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,417
I took a look at what you submitted
to apply for a permanent position.

165
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,212
But this Green Card booklet,

166
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,549
do you think it can be
included in your portfolio?

167
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,219
You can't honestly say
you did it on your own.

168
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,265
You can't take credit for it.
Don't you think?

169
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:55,230
I attached it because I was asked
to submit everything I've worked on here.

170
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,692
And since I also attached
the new design plan,

171
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,320
I think it shows quite clearly

172
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,780
how much
my work contributed to the design.

173
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,666
Then tell me. How much
did your work contribute to the design?

174
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,670
The least he could do is help.

175
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,299
He's terrified you might become
a permanent employee. Bastard.

176
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:25,177
He's afraid
that you might win the contest.

177
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,596
I'm jealous of your permanent position,

178
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,931
but to think you'll have to
keep seeing him…

179
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,020
So what will you do?
You'll have to see him every day.

180
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,857
Who do you think will last longer here?

181
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,653
You've gotten cocky,

182
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,073
Ms. Design Contest Winner.

183
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,869
We don't know that yet.

184
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,081
I'm sure you'll win.

185
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,041
Have you heard?

186
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,128
Mr. Choi is having an affair.

187
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,006
-Really?
-With a girl who works here.

188
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,971
Gosh…

189
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,516
God, I feel so cold and lonely.

190
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,684
Use the feelings you saved in summer.

191
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,521
Remember how we stored them up
when it was super hot?

192
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,564
Gosh, no.

193
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,316
I'll use them when it gets colder.

194
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,410
So-ra's grandma called earlier.

195
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,747
She wanted us to ask Mr. Gu
what she should do with the house.

196
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,586
He already paid rent for a year,

197
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:47,217
so she wants us to ask whether she should
leave it empty or if she can rent it out.

198
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:53,807
Why did he leave in such a hurry
without telling his landlady?

199
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,185
It seems he's changed his number.

200
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,354
But you're still in touch, right?

201
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,860
I don't know, either.

202
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,529
Why not?

203
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,281
Can't you reach him?

204
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,033
I don't try to.

205
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,413
When I get frustrated,

206
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,083
I go out for a walk at night thinking,

207
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,794
"I don't care if I die tonight."

208
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,505
I walk through a pitch-dark mountain.

209
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,436
What's the big deal
about some guy leaving?

210
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,065
He ran because he was
afraid of being happy.

211
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,123
Tonight, I have nothing to fear.

212
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,792
I'll become a warrior.

213
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,545
Bring it on, you damn mutt.

214
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,341
You ungrateful mongrel.

215
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,511
Do you know
how many sausages I've given you?

216
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,981
I want to bleed like a fountain.

217
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,718
When I wander around aimlessly,

218
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,263
I can catch the briefest glimpse.

219
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:25,393
"So that's what is in my head."

220
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,450
The feeling of being abandoned.

221
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,688
When they first told me it was cancer,

222
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:15,402
I thought, "Right, I haven't taken care
of my health. I should get it together."

223
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:20,198
And when I relapsed, my first thought was,
"Don't let Hyeon-a go."

224
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,034
"It's going to be tough this time.
I need her."

225
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,703
Even if I'm going to hell,

226
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,790
I don't think I'll be afraid
as long as you and Hyeon-a are there.

227
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,293
I guess I know
why people used to be buried alive.

228
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,547
Even emperors
who ruled over everything were afraid.

229
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,132
Let's all go together.

230
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,050
Why do I have to follow you there?

231
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,010
It's not like we dated.

232
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,887
The whole time I was with Hyeon-a,

233
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,265
it felt like I was
in a relationship with you, too.

234
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,767
When I hadn't even met you once.

235
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,311
She talked about you all the time.

236
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,314
Who likes hearing his girl
go on about some other guy?

237
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,610
Though she kept denying
that there was anything between you.

238
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:02,073
You might not feel anything for her,
but I'm sure she does.

239
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,075
Are you sure you're sick?

240
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,496
I'm excited, imagining us all
going to hell together.

241
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,541
I said I'm not going!
I'm not following you there.

242
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,710
-Are you nuts?
-I'm free to dream, aren't I?

243
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,628
I've got a great imagination.

244
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,173
We'd have fun together even in hell.

245
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,009
What a smooth talker.

246
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,554
Why do you drag me into this?
We're not that close.

247
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,681
Why do you think it's about us?

248
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,725
It's about you and Hyeon-a.

249
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,232
The medicine has improved,

250
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,568
so I haven't lost much hair.

251
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,696
Is your hair
your biggest concern right now?

252
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,783
What about you, then?

253
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,453
You're worried your dad will
scold you, in front of a cancer patient?

254
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,338
It's not that big a deal.

255
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,389
You're here?

256
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,975
Looks like you partied hard tonight, too.

257
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,359
See you tomorrow.

258
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,361
Thank you, get home safe.

259
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,909
Take the glitter off your face at least.

260
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,994
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

261
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,852
Get up already!

262
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,023
Aren't you going to work?

263
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,344
Why aren't you washing up?

264
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,459
What an idiot. Gosh.

265
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,128
Be quiet. I'm already annoyed.

266
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,464
When will you tell them?

267
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,758
-I will.
-When?

268
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,009
For God's sake…

269
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,184
-Mom, this brat quit his job!
-Hey!

270
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,525
SANPO SINKS

271
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,319
Damn it!

272
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,842
People are waiting.

273
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,470
Let's talk to him after we're done.

274
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,117
I don't know anymore.
I'll be dead meat later.

275
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,232
Whenever I wanted to quit,

276
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,944
I'd think,
"Maybe after the summer vacation."

277
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,406
"Maybe after Chuseok."

278
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,991
Then I'd think,

279
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,910
"I'll be lonely at the end of the year."

280
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,288
"And working isn't so bad in spring."

281
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,957
And another year would go by.

282
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,500
I mean,

283
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:09,589
I'm not like A-reum, a greedy workaholic
whose only goal is making money.

284
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,383
I think I've come

285
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,636
far enough.

286
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,598
This isn't the right path for me.

287
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,726
I don't have to force myself
to keep walking on it.

288
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,064
You don't need to explain yourself to me.

289
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,857
As if I don't understand.

290
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,574
To tell you the truth,

291
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,744
I don't have a specific goal in my life.

292
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,623
Money, women, honor… Nothing.

293
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,042
But…

294
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,127
do I…

295
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,672
have to have a goal?

296
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,675
Can't I just live my life without one?

297
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,680
I can't force myself to live
for something I don't really desire.

298
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,858
I wish I had an older brother.

299
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,362
Then I would be able to live as I wished.

300
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,907
He doesn't exist,

301
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,076
but I miss him.

302
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,344
Did someone die or something?

303
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,391
He's worked at that company
for eight years. That's enough.

304
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,018
It's hard to get a job somewhere else
after you turn 40.

305
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,312
The younger you are, the better.

306
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:52,108
Young people these days
move from one job to another really often.

307
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,989
Staying at the same job for long
isn't considered a virtue anymore.

308
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,576
How do you know what suits you better?
You have to try different workplaces.

309
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,713
So?

310
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,757
What's your plan?

311
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,432
I'm not going to do anything
for a little while.

312
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,144
How long is a little while?

313
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,110
Dad…

314
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:42,116
Can't you treat me
even half as well as you treated Gu?

315
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,952
You'd worry about Gu

316
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:49,415
if you hadn't seen him in a while.
"Is he sick? Did he eat?" But to me…

317
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,182
I know I'm not a perfect son or anything.

318
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,644
But I haven't done
anything I'm ashamed of.

319
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,605
There are so many bad people out there,

320
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,983
but I've never done anything
to be an embarrassment to you.

321
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:20,196
The thing I brought home the other day.
I said it was from the company,

322
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,865
but it was from the store owners
who heard I was quitting.

323
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:27,286
There are even people who promised
to gift me 500,000 won when I get married.

324
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,206
But do you think
they were all nice from the beginning?

325
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,333
No, I had to work really hard!

326
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,170
You work with machines.
You don't have to talk to anyone,

327
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,839
so you have no idea
what it's like to work with people.

328
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,052
But I still never lost my temper
or got myself into trouble.

329
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:46,138
They even gave me gifts.
That should be enough!

330
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,976
It's not like I'm going
to idle away for the rest of my life!

331
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,983
"You've worked really hard."

332
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,818
"Take a break."

333
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,404
Can't you just say that?

334
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,686
It's huge!

335
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,645
Look at this.

336
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,772
-Amazing!
-Check this one out!

337
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,815
-Mom.
-Dad,

338
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:43,858
-What?
-look at this.

339
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,569
What's that? Hey, wait. Stay there.

340
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,611
Oh, my God.

341
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,447
Hey, take a picture of us.

342
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,614
Mom, look.

343
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,575
Look this way.

344
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,828
One, two, three.

345
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,205
Let's take a group picture.

346
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,915
-Shall we?
-Yes.

347
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,251
One, two, three.

348
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,879
One more, smile!

349
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,092
Look.

350
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,263
-Sweet potatoes keep coming out.
-They grew so well.

351
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,182
That's odd.

352
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,767
It's right next to ours.
Why did theirs grow so poorly?

353
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,269
-Look at this.
-Gosh.

354
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,272
Just because you farmed for long
doesn't mean you're good at it.

355
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,566
You need to learn the know-how.

356
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,984
Exactly.

357
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:30,362
These days, it's easy to learn things

358
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,907
-Yes.
-Goodness, we'll be rich.

359
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,409
All right.

360
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,705
-Dad, this is seriously awesome.
-There's more here. Good.

361
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,665
-Take a picture.
-One, two, three.

362
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,210
These are seriously huge!

363
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,711
Don't!

364
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,264
How dare they…

365
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,977
Fine, let's do it.

366
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,370
Let's go!

367
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,182
Please, don't!

368
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,236
We almost caught up with them, Dad!

369
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,285
Yes, let's go.

370
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,079
Dad, step on it!

371
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,205
Step on it, Dad!

372
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:23,952
Dad…

373
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,372
-Christ…
-My goodness.

374
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,540
Be careful!

375
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,464
Gosh…

376
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,509
-Are you okay, Mom?
-You little…

377
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:39,510
Hey, what…

378
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,220
-You should have stopped him!
-Wait…

379
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,389
-"Step on it"? You idiot!
-Hang on.

380
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,099
Step on what?

381
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,684
-Wait, Mom.
-Step on what?

382
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,190
Are the sweet potatoes really
the priority right now?

383
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,862
God, I can't believe it.

384
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,615
-I can't believe it, you brat!
-Stop, Mom.

385
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:02,866
-It hurts.
-You!

386
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,626
For the love of God.

387
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:16,755
Poor me, I have to cook
even after crashing into a rice paddy.

388
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,610
Sell the field

389
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,904
whether or not
you hire someone for the factory.

390
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,907
Farming is too much.

391
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,868
Tending the crops that grow like crazy,

392
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,162
sowing and harvesting them…

393
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,247
God, I can't do it anymore.

394
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,794
You just eat, put down your spoon,

395
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,297
and go back out to the field
or the factory.

396
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,216
But I have to follow you around

397
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,095
coming in and out of the house
dozens of times to cook for you.

398
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:09,057
And it's not like I have any days off.

399
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,894
It's 365 days a year.

400
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,230
I had a day off
when we used to go to church.

401
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,193
But you couldn't even let me have that
and stopped going.

402
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,612
I'm going to start attending church again!

403
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,783
Goodness, what's wrong with me?

404
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,452
Why am I sweating so much?

405
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,376
Did you finish work?

406
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,463
Well, something suddenly came up.

407
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,549
I think I'll be a bit late today.

408
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,885
Then I'll go first and wait for you.

409
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:46,970
Well…

410
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,680
I think I'll be done quite late.

411
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,767
If it gets too late, I can just go home.

412
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,478
Don't worry about me
and focus on your work. Bye.

413
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:00,609
On days like this, just go home early!

414
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,279
You'll fall sick, dating that hard.

415
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,490
How can you go
and see him every single day?

416
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,408
It's close by, anyway.

417
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,012
I tried imagining it.

418
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,266
If I were your age

419
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,143
and my dad got a girlfriend…

420
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,647
I'd hate it too.

421
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,776
What would that lady have to do
for me to like her?

422
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,822
I'd hate it if she tried hard
to get close to me,

423
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,617
and I'd hate it if she treated me
like a thorn in her side, too.

424
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:54,329
I could reluctantly accept her

425
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,166
if she were a selfless, independent woman.

426
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,007
So today, I tried to look like
a selfless, independent woman,

427
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,508
chattering away by myself,

428
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:13,932
but all those words I said
to make you accept me

429
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,519
didn't seem to work at all.

430
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,939
So I'm a bit sad.

431
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,198
I'm going to start crying.

432
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:38,957
Hi. You're back late.

433
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,918
Where's your Auntie Hui-seon?

434
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,086
She went to the store.

435
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,338
And left you here alone?

436
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,216
What about your dad?

437
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,718
He says he'll be late.

438
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,975
Why are you here every day?

439
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,061
Do we owe you money or something?

440
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,382
I'm not leaving.

441
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,384
Not until I see Tae-hun.

442
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:51,780
Think carefully.
It's not easy to raise someone else's kid.

443
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:54,032
Even raising my own kids
drives me up the wall.

444
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,369
That's because they're your own kids.

445
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,830
Do you know how much
you can hate someone else's kid?

446
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,546
I didn't say we're getting married!
We're just dating!

447
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,548
Goodness me, just dating?

448
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,299
Once you get attached, that's it.

449
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,138
For God's sake.

450
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:19,099
I should have cut him off then and there.

451
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,269
He would've found someone else to marry.

452
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:27,232
Why did I feel sorry for him
when he looked so down?

453
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,401
Now I'm his personal cook.

454
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:41,121
I'll just stop by and take a look.

455
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,792
I'll be able to tell
if he's the one for you.

456
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,335
Forget it!

457
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:50,964
I can just walk past
and take a quick look.

458
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:52,215
Before it's too late.

459
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,968
Seriously!

460
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,856
-Yes,
-Thanks.

461
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:24,706
This place used to be really small.
It seems they've expanded it.

462
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,919
We used to come here a lot
when I was living with my aunt.

463
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,630
I think Gyeong-seon told me.

464
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:32,589
Really?

465
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,402
I heard the sujebi here is really good.

466
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,488
-Yes, it really is.
-I see.

467
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:59,616
I'm reminded of how
I used to have them when I was little.

468
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,369
Plus, octopus is pretty healthy, I hear.

469
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,411
Yes.

470
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:08,375
I still have the memories
of eating here when I was little.

471
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,418
-I see.
-Yes.

472
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,471
I ordered a seafood pancake for you, okay?

473
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,390
And I paid the bill.

474
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,226
Enjoy your meal.

475
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,811
Okay.

476
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,658
-The food's good here.
-I see.

477
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,035
Who…

478
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,580
Shall I order something else, too?

479
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,541
No, it's fine, thank you.

480
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,763
Who was that?

481
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,351
-My mom.
-What? Gosh, your mother?

482
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,769
No!

483
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,857
Damn it, she was supposed
to act like she didn't know me.

484
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:26,953
Hello.

485
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,790
Long time no see!
Did you go somewhere today?

486
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,627
Yes, to see someone.

487
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,129
I heard you're selling your field.

488
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:38,924
Yes. Gosh, I can't do it anymore.

489
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,134
Of course not, at your age.

490
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,178
You've got the factory
and the chores at home.

491
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:46,389
If you marry a workaholic,
it's the woman who suffers.

492
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,307
Exactly…

493
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,059
Hye-suk!

494
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,602
Did you find your dog?

495
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,187
-Sorry?
-Your family dog.

496
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,563
-Did you find it?
-What?

497
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,607
When have we ever had a dog?

498
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,858
What?

499
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,778
A while ago, I saw Mi-jeong
crying her eyes out,

500
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:02,781
and when I asked her what was wrong,
she said she lost her dog.

501
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,324
It was about a month ago.

502
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,378
-Three of these, please.
-Sure.

503
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,131
If it wasn't a dog, what was it? A goat?

504
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,847
Your percentage has gone up even more.

505
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:57,729
Yeom Mi-jeong is moving in
for the final blow.

506
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,398
VOTE

507
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,953
YEOM MI-JEONG:
WHERE ARE YOU?

508
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,334
YEOM MI-JEONG:
WHY ARE YOU TAKING SO LONG?

509
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,586
YEOM MI-JEONG:
I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG

510
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,883
YEOM MI-JEONG:
HURRY UP

511
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,301
YEOM MI-JEONG:
I MISS YOU!

512
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:30,929
YEOM MI-JEONG:
I MISS YOU!

513
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:45,944
Yeom Mi-jeong!

514
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,781
Ms. Contest Winner, are you heading home?

515
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,199
Are you bailing on us?

516
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:54,244
Let's party hard tonight.

517
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:57,163
You're the winner,
so you can party super-duper hard,

518
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,791
and I'm the runner-up, so just super hard.

519
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,835
What do you want to do?

520
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:07,048
Is there anything
you wish to happen today?

521
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:09,968
No.

522
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,681
-Why does she always turn us down?
-Why not?

523
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,808
Come to me.

524
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,812
I want you to come to me.

525
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:58,308
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

526
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:06,941
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

527
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,815
He's coming.

528
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,278
He came.

529
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,208
He is…

530
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,545
waiting for me.

531
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,176
Can I help you?

532
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,804
Right, well…

533
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:44,974
Is this…

534
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,686
Is this not Yeom Je-ho's house?

535
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,481
Yes, it is.

536
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,900
What brings you here?

537
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,990
Honey, come out here!

538
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,116
Someone's here!

539
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,484
You're here.

540
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,785
So he's Mr. Gu.

541
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,791
Gosh, I'm going to cry at this rate.
Goodness me.

542
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:42,800
Not long after you left,

543
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:46,387
she passed away.

544
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:49,557
That fall.

545
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:54,896
She went into the bedroom
to lie down for a bit

546
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,523
but didn't wake up again

547
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,067
and passed away.

548
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,282
Leaving the rice cooker on.

549
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,790
The rice is burning!

550
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,714
Gosh.

551
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,092
The rice is all burned.

552
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:28,763
Mom?

553
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,479
The rice is all burned.

554
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:41,526
Mom!

555
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,116
Mom…

556
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,579
Mom!

557
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:55,581
Mom!

558
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,543
Mom!

559
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:01,629
Mom!

560
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,131
Mom!

561
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:10,054
Dad!

562
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,274
Dad!

563
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:29,740
Dad!

564
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:45,024
Even when you don't know how you'll go on,

565
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,152
if you pull yourself together…

566
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:52,823
you can still find things
that are bearable.

567
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:00,081
The kids went through a lot.

568
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,585
The three of them

569
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,880
have all gone to live in Seoul.

570
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,546
YEOM MI-JEONG

571
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:01,809
Yeom Mi-jeong…

572
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,055
Do grownups get sad, too?

573
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,556
When their moms are gone.

574
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:43,684
I don't even care if we're family.
I won't see you again!

575
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:48,397
So now, she would be blameless
if she decided to move out.

576
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:51,525
Is this Yeom Mi-jeong?
This is Choi Jun-ho's wife.

577
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:54,695
I knew he was having an affair.
And with whom.

578
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,113
Hey. What are you doing?

579
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,074
Why are you ignoring me
after proposing to me?

580
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,326
Hyeon-a won't say yes, anyway.

581
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,368
Gu.

582
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:04,246
Where are you now? How are you doing?

583
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,875
How could she not know
the name of the person she dated?

584
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:10,252
I thought you'd be able to
if you really wanted to.

585
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:16,217
Why does it feel like it's like you?

586
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:22,473
