1
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,182
Mom…

2
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,732
They say you can't choose to die
peacefully in your sleep

3
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,400
no matter how rich you are.

4
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,613
And Hye-suk managed to do it.

5
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,741
It's because this family
has such good luck.

6
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:01,204
Mom, Dad, and even the daughter-in-law
all passed away in their sleep.

7
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,667
That's my dream, too, you know?

8
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,877
I feel so bad for my brother.

9
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,587
Je-ho!

10
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:13,424
-I'm so sorry.
-Mom.

11
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,677
Mom…

12
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,391
My poor brother.

13
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:33,736
CREMATORIUM

14
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,260
LATE KWAK HYE-SUK

15
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,728
When I end up lying there…

16
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,106
who do you think…

17
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,484
will be standing here?

18
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,657
Probably me.

19
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,370
Let's…

20
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,917
get married.

21
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,889
It seems like an artificial joint.
What do you want to do with it?

22
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,728
How does this work?

23
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,731
Well, if you want us to discard it,
we can.

24
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,195
Pack it up, please.

25
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,895
LATE KWAK HYE-SUK

26
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,957
Get some sleep, Dad.

27
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,469
LATE KWAK HYE-SUK

28
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:36,497
SANPO SINKS

29
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,474
I'll do some grocery shopping tomorrow.

30
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,144
Just have them delivered.

31
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,229
I did that, too.

32
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,471
It's gone bad.

33
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,545
I'm not having breakfast, don't bother.

34
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,761
I'm off.

35
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,680
Have a fried egg at least!

36
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,265
See you tonight.

37
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,309
Damn it.

38
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:10,169
SANPO CITY

39
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,177
The bus is here.

40
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,401
It's my treat today.

41
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,612
Why would you treat us? It's fine.

42
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,324
I should since you came all the way
to the funeral.

43
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,830
Mi-jeong, I didn't know you lived
that far away. It took forever.

44
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,749
It's 29 stops. I counted it myself.

45
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,293
How do you commute from there every day?

46
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,214
Where did you put your mom's urn?

47
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,591
At home.

48
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,139
Her urn is at your house?

49
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,017
Is that okay?

50
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,770
Why wouldn't it be?

51
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,856
Isn't it illegal?

52
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,482
No, it isn't.

53
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,817
I see.

54
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,694
I heard it was illegal to scatter them.

55
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,865
Aren't the urns also managed
in some system or something?

56
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,160
What do you think dying is?
It means you're out of the system.

57
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,081
Why not a columbarium?

58
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,086
How could we leave her somewhere else?

59
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,425
So it's okay to keep it at home.

60
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,761
Isn't it scary?

61
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,230
It still doesn't feel real, does it?

62
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,403
I still don't know what's going on.

63
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,948
The ambulance came that day

64
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,994
and said they don't move patients
who are in cardiac arrest.

65
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,540
We asked them desperately
to take her to the hospital,

66
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,834
but they said they couldn't.

67
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,965
Then the police came
to see my mom lying in the bedroom.

68
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,093
They asked weird things like,

69
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,096
"Did you have a fight?"
"How many insurance policies do you have?"

70
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,602
That's a really odd experience.

71
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,429
AUNTIE X

72
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,187
Hello?

73
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,023
Why didn't you pick up?
I've been calling you since before.

74
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,484
I was busy.

75
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,904
I fried some anchovies and shrimp.
Pick them up when you finish work.

76
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,989
Dad doesn't like dry dishes.

77
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:53,077
Hey, your father's a widower now.
Tell him to eat whatever's offered.

78
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,328
Just come and take them.

79
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,957
This damn…

80
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,647
Welcome.

81
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,693
I'll have 300g of beef for soup
and 2,4kg of pork ribs.

82
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,654
I see. 300g of beef for soup
and 2,4kg of pork ribs.

83
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,324
Actually, make it 3kg.

84
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,159
-3kg of pork ribs, right?
-Yes, please.

85
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,244
Coming right up.

86
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,136
Why didn't you just take a taxi?

87
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,391
We're home.

88
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,350
We're home.

89
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,248
Damn it.

90
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,861
Hey, Mom definitely died from overwork.

91
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,499
Why do I have to go all the way
to Wangsimni to pick up some food?

92
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,628
She doesn't even know what you like.
She just pretends to care.

93
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,422
I almost threw them out on my way home.

94
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,548
That's enough.

95
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,177
I know she doesn't care about you.
Why does she have to pretend she does?

96
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,683
She must be doing this
to get money from you.

97
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,020
If she even talks about it,
I'll go show her what's what.

98
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,524
-There's nothing stopping me now.
-Seriously…

99
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,152
Don't you know
who put Mom through all that?

100
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,281
Just let Dad eat!

101
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,412
Give me your seal later, Dad.

102
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,915
We'll go and bury it somewhere.

103
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,504
If you let your sister
have her way again, we're done.

104
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,341
I don't even care if we're family.
I won't see you again!

105
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,980
LATE KWAK HYE-SUK

106
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,551
Thank you.

107
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,595
-Thank you, boss.
-Goodbye.

108
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,346
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

109
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,723
I had a great time.

110
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,020
How's Gi-jeong doing?

111
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,898
I mean, she used to come every day.

112
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,483
I kind of miss her.

113
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,111
She goes straight home
after work these days.

114
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,948
Yes, she should.
Her father must be lonely by himself.

115
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,950
He's not alone.

116
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,578
I heard her brother quit his job
and stays at home.

117
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,333
Goodness, it's a pity
she passed away so soon.

118
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,752
You didn't even get to meet her.

119
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,378
I did.

120
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,177
The day she passed away.

121
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,095
In the afternoon.

122
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,848
She bought me lunch.

123
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:35,484
To think that someone I saw
in the afternoon passed in the evening…

124
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,159
She must have wanted
to meet her son-in-law before she left.

125
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,008
How could you say that in front of her?

126
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,016
So I looked at the envelope,

127
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,270
and it said "Park Jin-u."

128
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,400
So I was like, "What?" And I looked up.

129
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,444
And he said, "Ms. Yeom Gi-jeong
bad-mouthed me a lot, didn't she?"

130
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,077
All the people I've heard so much
about were gathered there,

131
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,372
so I kind of got excited
and put my foot in my mouth.

132
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,210
I was like,
"So this is what a funeral can be like."

133
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,503
I told you, right?

134
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:41,842
That the girl Gi-jeong said had "nasty"
written all over her face must be pretty.

135
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:46,471
I picked her out immediately among
all her colleagues. "It's her!"

136
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,473
So I asked Gi-jeong,

137
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:53,270
"The girl who has 'nasty' written
all over her face. That's her, right?"

138
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,396
And she said,

139
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,898
"Yes."

140
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:01,278
It came out that she lied, you know?

141
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,211
I was even more shocked
when your mom passed away

142
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,590
than when my mom passed away.

143
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,302
Maybe because
I didn't see it coming at all.

144
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,723
It's natural that you come and you go.

145
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:35,270
But I wish everyone could leave
at the right time.

146
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,024
When is the right time?

147
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,486
At 80 years old?

148
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,115
You'll feel different when you become 80.

149
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,911
My grandpa used to look
at old people and say

150
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,455
he didn't want to live that long.

151
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,332
He would only live till 80.

152
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,334
But when he turned 80,

153
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:01,505
I asked, "Grandpa, aren't you supposed
to pass away this year?"

154
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,506
Then he said,

155
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,092
"I don't think so."

156
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:11,973
Just like that,
he managed to live until he was 90.

157
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,060
And he still said it wasn't time yet.

158
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,896
What if we have a system

159
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:22,651
where all humans live up to 100?

160
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,862
And die when they turn 100?

161
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,074
Then I'll form a militia when I'm 99.

162
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,951
"Destroy the system!"

163
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,538
I'll run from the system
into the mountains.

164
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,716
There's no such thing as the right time.

165
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,512
But your mother chose a good day.

166
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,305
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

167
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,684
We got three days off thanks to your mom.

168
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,562
Gi-jeong and her boyfriend, too.

169
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,232
No matter how you look at it,

170
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,986
Gi-jeong's the luckiest one here, right?

171
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,362
Listen.

172
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,158
It would have been shameless
if she was looking for a guy to date

173
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,034
after her mother passed away.

174
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:17,539
But it's as if she knew
something like this was going to happen.

175
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,166
It was as if she was possessed.

176
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,667
Can you believe her?

177
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,130
Pretending to have lost
her memories after getting rejected.

178
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,634
She was so desperate.
She grabbed onto him in such a hurry.

179
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,264
And then her mom passed away.

180
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,436
So now,

181
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,858
she would be blameless
if she decided to move out.

182
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,485
I can feel it.

183
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,822
Gi-jeong will move out soon.

184
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,493
Seeing that her boyfriend has visited
for three days in a row,

185
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,246
I can tell.

186
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,289
Yes.

187
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,749
Right.

188
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,709
And Chang-hee also quit his job

189
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,879
-at the perfect time, right?
-Yes.

190
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,766
Seriously…

191
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,728
Isn't my sixth sense amazing?

192
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:28,193
That must have been
why I wanted to quit so badly.

193
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,490
But in retrospect,
I didn't want to quit that badly.

194
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,327
It just felt like the right time to quit.

195
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,332
I guess my soul just knew.

196
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,545
If I weren't unemployed,

197
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,632
who would take care of my dad?

198
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:58,515
After the three of us go to work,
and without Gu, he'd be all by himself.

199
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,939
The thought makes me tear up.

200
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,406
I was like this when I was younger, too.

201
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,826
When I was in high school,
my homeroom teacher said

202
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,787
we'd be in trouble if anyone skipped
the after-school classes.

203
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,665
I had never skipped them before,

204
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,543
but I really wanted to
go home that day for some reason.

205
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,755
It wasn't like I had anything to do
at home. I just wanted to go home.

206
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,132
So I did.

207
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,342
My grandma was alone at home.

208
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,429
When I said, "I'm home,"

209
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,140
her eyes were open,
but she wouldn't answer me.

210
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,392
Something felt off.

211
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,730
I felt like I had to
hold her hand so I did.

212
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,606
But soon,

213
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,651
I got the chills,

214
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,113
and thought, "She must be gone."

215
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,993
I suddenly got scared,
so I pulled my hand away.

216
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,662
Then I thought, "This isn't right."

217
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,374
So I held her hand tight again.

218
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,461
About five minutes later,

219
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,504
my dad came back.

220
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,757
"Where did you go, leaving Grandma alone?"

221
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:18,178
It was the first time in my life
telling Dad off like that.

222
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:22,682
He couldn't say a thing
and just listened to me.

223
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,727
And it kind of felt

224
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,812
cathartic.

225
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,943
If I hadn't skipped school that day,

226
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,821
my grandma would've passed away all alone.

227
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,743
Just like this, my soul knows
and my body just follows.

228
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,550
I never thought…

229
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,973
I would be waiting
for Gi-jeong to come home.

230
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,814
After spending the whole day
with my dad alone,

231
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,275
when Gi-jeong and Mi-jeong come home…

232
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,071
it feels

233
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:20,949
less lonely.

234
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,510
When you feel lonely,

235
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:46,015
I hope you remember that Oh Du-hwan
is also feeling lonely somewhere.

236
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,727
And this song is for us.

237
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,775
I didn't say

238
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,239
Or do anything

239
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:08,163
Just your name alone
Makes my heart ache

240
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:15,003
Why didn't I know
That you'd be leaving so far away

241
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:20,759
My love
I guess this is our goodbye

242
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:28,808
The times I've sulked at you
Without good reason

243
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:35,899
And the times I've been
Too harsh and negligent

244
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:42,614
I never got to tell you
How sorry I am

245
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:48,953
My love
I guess this is our goodbye

246
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:57,045
No matter how many times I tell myself

247
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:02,300
That it'd be okay
And that you'd understand

248
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:11,267
The memories that I cannot forget

249
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:17,565
-Come a step too late as regret
-It's cold. Let's go.

250
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:24,531
If only for a day
I could see you again

251
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:31,454
I would cry for hours on end
In your presence

252
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:38,545
Even the wind sounds
So quiet in the sky today

253
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:45,343
My love
I guess this is our goodbye

254
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,265
It still bothers me
that Mr. Gu didn't come.

255
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,060
Don't you have any way of contacting him?

256
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,229
They don't even know his name.

257
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,275
How could she not know
the name of the person she dated?

258
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,239
Good night.

259
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,365
Good night.

260
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,449
Bye.

261
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,576
Good night.

262
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:25,508
No matter how many times I tell myself

263
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:31,556
That it'd be okay
And that you'd understand

264
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:39,772
The memories that I cannot forget

265
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:45,820
Come a step too late as regret

266
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:53,036
If I get to see you once again

267
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:59,584
Through all my wishing

268
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:07,216
-I will thank you before it's too late
-Mom. It's snowing.

269
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,177
My love

270
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,513
I guess

271
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:19,020
This is our goodbye

272
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,564
LATE KWAK HYE-SUK

273
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,201
Hello, Joy Card Design Department.

274
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,831
Sure, one moment, please.

275
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,548
Hello, Joy Card Design Department.

276
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,636
Hello?

277
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,137
Is this Yeom Mi-jeong?

278
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,515
Yes, this is she.

279
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,227
This is Choi Jun-ho's wife.

280
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,780
It's not me.

281
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,494
He just saved her as my name.

282
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,000
What do you mean?

283
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,088
One moment.

284
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,688
YEOM MI-JEONG (TEMPORARY EMPLOYEE)

285
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:58,494
I'm saved as "Yeom Mi-jeong"
with "Temporary Employee" in brackets.

286
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,204
Hey.

287
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,789
What are you doing?

288
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,546
Would you like to see who it is?

289
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,805
Damn it.

290
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,224
YEOM MI-JEONG:
I MISS YOU!

291
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,350
LEAVE

292
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,019
Okay.

293
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,523
YEOM MI-JEONG:
WHAT'S GOING ON?

294
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,778
"SOTP" MESSAGING ME

295
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,073
STOP

296
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,826
DELETE OUR CHAT HISTORY

297
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,203
For God's sake.

298
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,000
YEOM MI-JEONG

299
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,021
Is he crazy?

300
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,024
He saved the girl he's having
an affair with as "Mi-jeong"?

301
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,361
Who on earth is the woman?

302
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,445
How would we know?

303
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,114
Does she even work here?

304
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,824
Of course, she does.

305
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,200
No wonder.

306
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,411
People kept whispering about Mi-jeong
at the funeral.

307
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,746
Really?

308
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,667
They said she was dating him
to get a permanent position.

309
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,544
Can't you sue him for that?

310
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,350
Are you busy? Can I stop by?

311
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,663
MR. GU

312
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,499
SEPTEMBER 19

313
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,763
MR. GU

314
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,681
CALL

315
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,021
The number you have called
is not in service.

316
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,815
Please check the number and try again.

317
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,720
My asshole team leader is
having an affair with some employee,

318
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,723
and he saved her number under my name.

319
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,016
No way.

320
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,853
Since everyone knows he hates me,

321
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,190
he must've thought
it'd be safe if he saved it under my name.

322
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,692
I knew he was having an affair.

323
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,986
And with whom.

324
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,322
Who is it?

325
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:28,287
A while back, I called the two of them
since they were late for a meeting.

326
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:32,583
And it was eerily identical
how both calls were so silent.

327
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,629
There wasn't any background noise,
as if they were in a vacuum.

328
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,881
For the two of them.

329
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,175
They were in a motel.

330
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,761
It became so obvious after that.

331
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,598
When I saw a shampoo in her bag,

332
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,685
I wondered why she would
carry shampoo around.

333
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,522
It was to avoid smelling the same
by using different shampoos.

334
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,862
When that asshole
would start ranting at me…

335
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,780
Is it that hard?

336
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:06,158
Font combination, color coordination,
color choice, is that so hard?

337
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,744
-I mean, is it hard?
-She would suddenly

338
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:13,040
align a stack of papers with a "tap"

339
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,750
in an elegant motion.

340
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,586
-Seriously…
-Then he would

341
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,339
stop ranting at me.

342
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,426
She was signaling him to stop.

343
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,138
Since then, whenever he started ranting,

344
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,390
I'd end up looking at her hands,

345
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,268
wondering when she'd give the signal.

346
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,856
At first, I was grateful
for her fingertips

347
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,275
fluttering like a butterfly.

348
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,610
But now,

349
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,239
when she starts putting papers together,

350
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,743
I want to break all of her fingers.

351
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,042
MS. YEOM, CAN WE TALK FOR A MOMENT?

352
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,210
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW

353
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,295
WE CAN TALK OVER THE PHONE

354
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:01,964
It's that bastard.

355
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,471
Don't respond.
He must be quaking in his boots.

356
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,599
Just ignore it. Don't even read them.

357
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:21,859
It's fine. It doesn't take that long
if I take the subway, anyway.

358
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,819
I have to drive you home today.

359
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,030
Besides, my sister
made some dishes for you.

360
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,907
I'll be there in 30 minutes,

361
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,617
so wait at my sister's place.

362
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,577
All right.

363
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,913
Thank you.

364
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,382
Hello.

365
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,427
-You're here.
-Hi.

366
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,265
Hi. Long time no see.

367
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,897
Wait here. The ribs are upstairs.

368
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,566
-Have a seat.
-You didn't have to make ribs.

369
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,568
Tae-hun even paid me to make them for you.

370
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,746
Want some cold beer?

371
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,248
I'll get it myself.

372
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,416
Sure.

373
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,982
I've been a bit busy these days.

374
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,942
You heard, right?

375
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,327
It's been a while since I drank beer.

376
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,959
I know

377
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,504
that it gets harder if I drink.

378
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:10,468
I know if I drink just a little like this,

379
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,636
it'll be harder on my way home.

380
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,182
I live quite far away, you see.

381
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,643
I know very well it'll be hard.

382
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,359
But I don't want to be strong.

383
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,364
I just want to be knocked out.

384
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,542
I get like this sometimes.

385
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,211
But…

386
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,506
I always feel okay again the next day.

387
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,224
Do grown-ups

388
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,267
get sad, too?

389
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,774
When their moms are gone.

390
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,547
Can't I be your mom?

391
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,218
I want to.

392
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,939
Can't I be your mom?

393
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,401
If you don't like it,
just give me the axe, all right?

394
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,875
Let's get married.

395
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,220
Let's get married.

396
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,185
Okay, let's.

397
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,150
Bye.

398
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,027
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

399
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,111
-I'm off.
-All right.

400
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,946
CHOI JUN-HO
DESIGN TEAM 3

401
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:35,964
Yeom Mi-jeong.

402
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,428
Just think of it as bad luck.

403
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,930
There's no misunderstanding.

404
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,474
Who on earth would think
you two are having an affair?

405
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,145
Do you know who it is?

406
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,022
The woman he's having an affair with.

407
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:56,944
Yes.

408
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,863
Who is it?

409
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,490
You can't do this to me.

410
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,620
I took care of you,
and this is how you repay me?

411
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,432
Still…

412
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:12,102
you shouldn't have
done that at the funeral.

413
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,898
Giggling and playing footsie
under the table!

414
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,067
That's not right.

415
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,335
I don't want

416
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,463
to have friends anymore.

417
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,216
I don't need them.

418
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:12,538
Why does it feel like that's you?

419
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:17,167
Something that feels so out of place

420
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,797
and is screaming, "I'm here."

421
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,486
Yeom Mi-jeong.

422
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,238
On Mr. Choi's desktop screen,

423
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,450
I saw messages
from someone set as my name.

424
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,954
The messages were obviously romantic.

425
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,290
I've never done
anything like that with Mr. Choi.

426
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,335
Then why would
Mr. Choi's wife have called me?

427
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,671
My wife says she's never called
the company.

428
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,300
She says she never called here
looking for Yeom Mi-jeong.

429
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,011
How would I know who did what?

430
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,225
It's too bad this kind of incident
occurred before your review

431
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,685
for a permanent position.

432
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,104
On top of that, the assault.

433
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,650
We can't let you guys work
in the same department.

434
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:37,683
Hello.

435
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:38,850
Hey.

436
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,938
I still can't believe it.

437
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:47,901
She came by here that very day.
How could she pass away just like that?

438
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:53,073
I saw Mi-jeong crying her eyes out
saying she'd lost her dog.

439
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,866
So I asked if she'd found it,

440
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:58,370
but she said she didn't have a dog,
so I asked, "Well, was it a goat then?"

441
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:00,205
That's what we talked about.

442
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,958
But that very day…

443
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:06,920
When was that?

444
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:09,673
That day, the day she passed.

445
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,049
No, I mean, Mi-jeong…

446
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,888
What about your dad?
Is he holding up alright?

447
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,224
Yes.

448
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,394
You take good care of him.

449
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,479
I will.

450
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,022
Goodbye.

451
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,910
How are Gi-jeong and Mi-jeong doing?

452
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,456
Gi-jeong cries every day,

453
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,750
and Mi-jeong's just the same, I guess.

454
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,002
Mi-jeong is someone

455
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,673
who can't cry
unless she plucks up the courage.

456
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,149
-Thank you, sir!
-Thank you, sir!

457
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,777
Sure. Don't forget to send me photos
to let me know you're home later.

458
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,694
-Okay!
-Okay!

459
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,070
All right, off you go.

460
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,447
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye!

461
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,534
Hey. You're back early.
Did you take the afternoon off?

462
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,244
Yes.

463
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,579
Out of the way!

464
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:46,478
SANPO SINKS

465
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,245
Where's Dad?

466
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,663
In the field.

467
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,060
Hey, what is this?

468
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,105
What do you mean?

469
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,107
Why did you take out a loan?

470
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,946
HANJO EMERGENCY FUND EASY LOAN
LOAN AMOUNT 2,000,000 WON

471
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,744
I beat someone up a bit.
It's for the settlement.

472
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,543
Who?

473
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,004
Just some crazy bitch.

474
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:42,636
But why did you need to get a loan?
You don't have two million won?

475
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,099
Show me your bankbook.

476
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,687
-Show me your bankbook now!
-Are you my mom?

477
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,407
You lent money to Chan-hyeok, didn't you?

478
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,708
You stupid brat!

479
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,627
Why the hell did you hit her?

480
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,963
Yeom Je-ho was ripped off
by his little sister.

481
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:21,091
But what kind of idiot
lends money to her boyfriend?

482
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,762
What's that bastard's number?

483
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,265
Give me that bastard's number!

484
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,060
Are you not going to tell me? Damn it.

485
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,938
He's not in Korea.

486
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,156
Why didn't you tell us?

487
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,867
Do you have no family? No mom, no dad?

488
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,995
I wouldn't have either.

489
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,580
She saw how I was treated after
my trouble with money.

490
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,832
Of course, she wouldn't.

491
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,584
I wouldn't, either.
I'd rather starve to death.

492
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,587
I'd rather be in jail
before letting any of you know.

493
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,465
When did we ever rely on our family?

494
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,296
Gosh, thank you!

495
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,033
Gu…

496
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,118
Where are you now?

497
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,829
How are you doing?

498
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,502
Gu…

499
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,299
My mom died.

500
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,273
Why are you ignoring me
after proposing to me?

501
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,901
You're not even answering my calls.

502
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,236
I've been busy.

503
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,869
Hey.

504
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,123
I'm not dead yet.

505
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:03,086
I knew it, you two.

506
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,965
Don't worry about it.
Hyeon-a won't say yes, anyway.

507
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,550
What if she does?

508
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:11,761
He says you won't say yes.

509
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,888
I will.

510
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:17,725
She said yes.

511
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,727
I need to make dinner.

512
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:22,439
Did you see the link I sent?

513
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,024
The columbarium.

514
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,570
I did some research,

515
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,615
and that's the best place. And it's clean.

516
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,910
Let's put your mom's urn there.

517
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:38,163
I want mine to be there, too.

518
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,958
I want to go wherever you put your mom.

519
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,043
You should stay with your mom.

520
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:47,005
My mom is going to live very long.

521
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,591
And I'm not expecting any visitors.

522
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:56,473
You'll come see me
if I'm placed next to your mom.

523
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,853
I'll reserve spots
for you and Hyeon-a, too.

524
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,814
So you're going to take us with you?

525
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,692
No, you guys take your time.

526
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,071
Let's stay together, even when we're dead.

527
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,073
So that we won't be bored.

528
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,830
What about Mi-jeong?

529
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:22,749
What about her?

530
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,877
Is she doing all right?

531
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:30,256
You should ask her yourself.
Aren't you closer to her than me?

532
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,598
Chang-hee.

533
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,226
I…

534
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,314
need people who are happy.

535
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:51,653
So, Chang-hee…

536
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,449
you have to be happy.

537
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,873
I carry on thanks to you.

538
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,202
Dad.

539
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,163
Don't worry.

540
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,373
We'll…

541
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,667
be even happier.

542
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:54,674
But…

543
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,136
for a family of four to be happy…

544
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,723
we need a car.

545
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,871
I think it's my first time
coming to the beach with Dad.

546
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,665
It's the first time we've come
to the beach as a family.

547
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,584
When it was just you and me,

548
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,961
I have memories of going places
with Mom and Dad.

549
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,672
But nothing after Mi-jeong was born.

550
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:41,095
It's because it was hard for all five
of us to go around on buses and trains.

551
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,265
That's not the reason.

552
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:48,394
It's because Auntie got into trouble then.
And ever since then, nothing.

553
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:53,024
The villain of our family is Auntie.

554
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,903
That sounds scary.
I'm going to be an aunt one day.

555
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:02,283
Hey, it's not possible for us
to become an aunt who robs her family.

556
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,160
Dad loved her, you know?

557
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:06,871
That's why he cared for her
and sold off his own land.

558
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,540
But this asshole doesn't love us
that much.

559
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,042
You have no idea.

560
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,753
I would give you everything
if I had anything.

561
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,171
I just can't because I don't.

562
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:18,800
Hey. Once we get married,
let's not bother each other over money.

563
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:21,052
Yes. Let's not ever do that.

564
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:22,679
Never mind.

565
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,514
Bother me.

566
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,059
On second thought,
I think I'd give you money, too.

567
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:30,645
But you need to know this.

568
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,189
We can do that because we love each other.

569
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,733
But do you think our children
will love us that much?

570
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,985
I don't think so, you know?
That's the problem.

571
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:42,949
Dad loved Aunt, but we didn't.
That's the problem.

572
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:47,412
That's why they say you can get away
with anything if you have love.

573
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,528
You still have

574
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,906
the three of us by your side, Dad.

575
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,620
Dad…

576
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,167
I love you.

577
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:21,130
I thought I was taking
care of them all this time.

578
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,343
I only realized after she passed away…

579
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,847
that Hye-suk and the kids

580
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:33,518
were the ones taking care of me.

581
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,665
YEOM MI-JEONG

582
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:07,677
You're…

583
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,471
doing well, right?

584
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,393
Yes, sir.

585
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:41,419
YEOM MI-JEONG

586
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,571
I'm not sad at all.

587
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,744
But why do I keep tearing up?

588
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,065
Hello?

589
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:31,487
Hello?

590
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,364
It's been a while.

591
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:37,785
It's Gu.

592
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,291
It has been a while.

593
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,837
How have you been?

594
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,133
Have you managed to liberate yourself?

595
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:54,844
Of course not.

596
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:02,435
Have you met someone who worships you?

597
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,564
Of course not.

598
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:11,527
Let's meet up.

599
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:14,864
I can't.

600
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:17,533
Why?

601
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:22,997
I've gained weight.

602
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:25,166
I need to lose some weight.

603
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:31,088
Lose some weight in an hour and meet me.

604
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:38,489
You haven't gained much.

605
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:52,378
What?

606
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,259
You've grown your hair.

607
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:05,307
Aren't I handsome?

608
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:11,772
And you've cut your hair.

609
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,024
Yes, a little.

610
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:18,445
You changed your number.

611
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:20,823
That was a bold move.

612
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,331
I was so angry waiting for you to call.

613
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,836
It's not like you don't know where I live.

614
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:36,338
I thought you'd be able to
if you really wanted to.

615
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,177
You never called my previous number.

616
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:43,262
Did you?

617
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,103
I missed you. So much.

618
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,609
It sounds real now that I've said it.

619
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,654
It feels like I really missed you so much.

620
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:09,914
I wanted to squeeze you
and swallow you down in one mouthful.

621
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:17,755
Aren't I good at worshiping now?

622
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,351
What is your name?

623
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,772
It's Gu Ja-gyeong.

624
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,225
Why didn't you call me sooner?

625
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:17,231
He'd never let me hit rock bottom.

626
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:18,857
Do you want a part-time job?

627
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,610
We agreed to get married
when she turns 20.

628
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:25,906
But when she's 20, I'll be 50. Damn it.

629
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,242
Didn't you say
it was over between you two?

630
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:30,494
I've always known
what kind of a person you are.

631
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:31,787
I'll be here for you.

632
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,873
-What?
-You son of a bitch!

633
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,375
When I met you again,

634
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:37,668
I regretted it.

635
01:11:37,751 --> 01:11:39,169
I do see

636
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:40,170
a doctor.

637
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,381
Just go.

638
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:44,049
I'll stay.

639
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:47,720
Remember this one thing.

640
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:54,226
