1
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,640
Mr. Joe is here.

2
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,880
Someone found your body?

3
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,160
Yes.

4
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Someone found my dead body.

5
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,680
But it still can't be fully identified yet,

6
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,960
if it's really Mr. Joe.

7
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,000
But from the clothes on him,

8
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,320
there's a high possibility.

9
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
No matter if it's me or not,

10
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,320
I'd like to go prove with my own eyes.

11
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Let's go.

12
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,400
I have my people checked. It's here.

13
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,560
But actually, you didn't have to come.

14
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,360
I don't want to bother you.

15
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,920
How?

16
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,800
This is important. I'd like to know the truth too.

17
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,640
Mmm.

18
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,760
But don't forget.

19
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,519
You now have nothing to do with the old Joe anymore.

20
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,640
You must let us bring you in.

21
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,400
Thanks.

22
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay?

23
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,960
I guess...

24
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,520
I don't know what to feel.

25
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,040
When I think about it,

26
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,560
I get scared...and sad...

27
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,560
and some other feelings.

28
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,440
Don't be scared.

29
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,560
You are all here because of Joe, right?

30
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,840
Yes.

31
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,720
Somewhat, Joe was our friend.

32
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,800
Please let us in to see.

33
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,360
It's not quite possible now.

34
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,520
Because Mr. Ming is having the men look at the DNA now.

35
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,960
We will examine the DNA from the tissue first.

36
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,840
And when the result is out...

37
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,120
I'll let you know.

38
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,760
Hey, what right do you have to manage this thing on your own?

39
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,880
We are going to see him too.

40
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,280
Right, Wut?

41
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,600
Seriously, if we get involved right now, we would be interfering.

42
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,120
And with those people's power...

43
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,360
this may be the quickest way.

44
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,120
Why did you fool me?

45
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
When did I fool you?

46
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,400
You made me believe that...

47
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,520
The new Joe is the old Joe.

48
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,520
But right now, I've found the old Joe.

49
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,880
How could you be sure that he's the old Joe?

50
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,200
How could it not be?

51
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,480
It's definitely him.

52
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,640
Sometimes, you can't see the truth with your eyes.

53
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,920
That's enough, Master.

54
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,800
I won't believe anything anymore.

55
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,840
That would be all.

56
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,960
Let them handle it.

57
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,520
How can you be sure that they're gonna be able to do it?

58
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,120
Sol, c'mon.

59
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,320
This kind of thing, no one is gonna joke about it.

60
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,880
Everyone wants the truth.

61
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,240
Especially...

62
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,400
Ming.

63
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Wut.

64
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Huh?

65
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
I've been wanting to ask you for a long time.

66
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,880
Why did you give Ming my home?

67
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,800
Since the accident happened,

68
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,720
I tried calling your relatives...

69
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,680
but when they knew about it,

70
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,200
everyone wanted your belongings.

71
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,600
Some wanted your house, some wanted your car.

72
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,160
When Ming found that out,

73
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,000
he took care of all your belongings.

74
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,600
Even though I didn't like that,

75
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,400
but it's better than all your belongings gone.

76
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,559
But I still don't understand...

77
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,440
why does Ming still keep my stuff?

78
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,520
If you ask me, I'd think...

79
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,960
I told you.

80
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,120
The reason he did all of that was...

81
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,080
because he felt guilty.

82
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,960
Right, Wut?

83
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Mmm, I guess.

84
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,480
Joe, go take a shower.

85
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
It's been a long ride, you must be tired.

86
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,560
Mmm, I'll go take a shower now.

87
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,040
What were you gonna say earlier?

88
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,800
I was just...

89
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,160
Do you really believe that?

90
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,800
Do you believe that Ming really loves Joe?

91
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,560
You know...

92
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,720
who made Joe like this...

93
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,840
Yes, I do.

94
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,920
But believe me, Sol.

95
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,680
Everything is not as easy as you'd like it to be.

96
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Mr. Ming.

97
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,880
Would you like to eat something?

98
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,960
The DNA result is out.

99
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,640
Would you like me to tell you...

100
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,520
or would you like to see it yourself?

101
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,800
Then I'll read it for you.

102
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,640
Why are you here?

103
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,240
I'd like to get in and see if it's really him.

104
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,040
If it's Wut or Sol, it's understandable.

105
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,320
But you...why are you involved in this?

106
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,800
Just let me in, Secretary Jim.

107
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,880
There's nothing to see.

108
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,920
A guy was dead for years.

109
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,960
There are only bones.

110
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,080
Please, I'm begging you.

111
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,240
Please let me in, Secretary Jim.

112
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,960
The DNA result is out.

113
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,120
Mr. Ming forbids anyone to get in.

114
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,080
No one can get in.

115
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,080
No, Secretary Jim.

116
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,320
I must know about this.

117
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Back off.

118
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,040
Lastly,

119
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,040
The old Joe...

120
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,480
is dead...

121
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,000
Joe.

122
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,280
Thanks a lot. I'm okay.

123
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,200
I'm sorry for making you worry last night.

124
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,040
If you can't handle it yet, don't fight it.

125
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
And other stuff,

126
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,520
Sol and I will handle it, alright?

127
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Alright.

128
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Thank you.

129
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,960
But I'm okay now.

130
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,600
Look on the bright side, I get to start a new life.

131
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,640
Without having anything stuck in my mind.

132
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,600
That's true, Joe.

133
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,600
Right now, the death certificate can be issued.

134
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,960
Your belongings will be with your relatives.

135
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,400
Even though how big they are, they won't be with him.

136
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,280
But for that matter, I still can't take all my stuff back anyway.

137
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,960
Don't you worry about that.

138
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,120
I'll buy those stuff first.

139
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,120
Hey, that's alright.

140
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,560
I'll buy those stuff first.

141
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,040
And you can pay me back later.

142
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,520
Last time, you had him help you.

143
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,200
So let me help you this time.

144
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Thanks.

145
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,040
But before that part...

146
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,480
The thing is...

147
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,359
Ming's going to organize your funeral here nearby.

148
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,240
Hey, why not in Bangkok?

149
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,240
Because it's the fastest way.

150
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,640
Pray and then comes the cremation.

151
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,080
What right does he have?

152
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,520
I won't let him do that.

153
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,520
C'mon, Joe died a long time ago.

154
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,200
The funeral takes place at this time is actually quite late.

155
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,240
The sooner it ends, the better.

156
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,000
And Joe...

157
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,520
it's your body, anyway.

158
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,760
I want to send you off for the last time.

159
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Me too.

160
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
I'm going with you.

161
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Don't, Joe.

162
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Trust me.

163
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,840
No one should ever have to go to his own funeral.

164
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,320
About other stuff, Sol and I will handle it.

165
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,480
Joe.

166
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,160
Joe, where are you?

167
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,080
Ming, let me go, please.

168
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,600
No, I wanna be with you, Joe.

169
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Let's start all over again.

170
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Ming, telling me now...it's too late.

171
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I promise you.

172
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
I won't let you be a replacement anymore.

173
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Joe.

174
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,040
You might think I'm crazy.

175
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,280
But deep down, I still have hope...

176
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,200
that my body is still out there...

177
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,200
in a coma or something somewhere.

178
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
And one day,

179
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,960
I'll get into the old body and be the same Joe.

180
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,920
You know, my parents passed away when I was little.

181
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,560
So I grew up alone.

182
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,960
And my dream was...

183
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,600
seeing lights on when I came home.

184
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,920
And the lovely smell of the food.

185
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,800
And someone...to say, "You're home?".

186
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,520
Thank you, Ming, for making my dream come true.

187
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,080
If you like it, make a copy of the key for me.

188
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,520
Ming, what do you mean?

189
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,760
Well, you were the one who invited me the other day, weren't you?

190
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,760
Ming, are you really moving in with me?

191
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,240
Seriously?

192
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,240
But on one condition,

193
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,280
Do you see me as a dog?

194
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,280
What dog could be so adorable like this?

195
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
I'm tired today.

196
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
So you can relax.

197
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,040
i'm hungry already.
Do you want to eat something?

198
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,080
Yeah, Of course.

199
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Let's go / Yes.

200
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,480
You choose something.

201
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,600
Oh, that's enough.

202
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Why?

203
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Why are you crying now?

204
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,800
Why the hell are you crying now?

205
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,520
Why? Why are you crying now?

206
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,880
Huh? Why? Why are you crying now?

207
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,160
Why are you crying now?

208
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,400
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe!

209
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,360
No! No! No! Joe!

210
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,680
Why the hell are you crying now?

211
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,280
Sol, let go.

212
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,560
Joe, I told you not to come, didn't I?

213
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,560
I swear...

214
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,720
I'll never forgive him, ever.

215
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,000
What the hell do you want?

216
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,840
I'd like to tell you all that...

217
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,080
from now on, about Joe's stuff...

218
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,120
I'll be the one who takes care of everything.

219
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
What do you mean?

220
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Everything. Ashes. Belongings.

221
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,920
But Joe's got his relatives.

222
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,720
I've had Secretary Jim cleared things up with them already.

223
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,120
Right now, all of Joe's belongings,

224
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,720
are mine legally.

225
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Huh?

226
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,040
And how are you gonna handle his ashes?

227
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,960
I'll have them scattered into the sea.

228
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,080
And all of his stuff, I'll burn them.

229
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,680
So there will be no memories left.

230
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,680
No, Ming.

231
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,360
Those stuff is Joe's memories.

232
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
Why not?

233
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,520
Those belongings are mine.

234
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,760
It's up to me what I wanna do with them.

235
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,720
You!

236
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,440
Hey, Sol!

237
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,040
Calm down.

238
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,520
What right do you have?

239
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,560
Because he's mine.

240
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,760
Mine, only.

241
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,040
Shit, this is getting too much.

242
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,000
No matter how big his family is, I don't give a shit this time.

243
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,199
Why are you guys still so calm?

244
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,800
Well...

245
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,960
I think that they...

246
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,760
may not be able to manage everything that fast.

247
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,199
Paperwork.

248
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,400
Ownership transfering.

249
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,679
Right, I agree with Wut.

250
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,120
This might be the trap he wants us to cut things off with my relatives.

251
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,000
I've been trying to call your relatives.

252
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,120
But no one has answered.

253
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,159
I think that family is stopping them from me.

254
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,840
It's alright.

255
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,480
I'll try to make it happen.

256
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,760
But in the meantime,

257
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,679
you must calm down and do not do anything.

258
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Okay?

259
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Alright.

260
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,760
Joe.

261
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
I knew that you're gonna be here.

262
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,960
Sol.

263
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,720
Don't stop me, Sol.

264
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Those stuff in my house is my memory.

265
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,720
Let me have something to keep to myself.

266
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,840
I'm not here to stop you.

267
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,640
I'm here to help you.

268
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,200
Today, I'm not gonna let you risk alone.

269
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
The key is still at the same place.

270
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,320
That's a relief.

271
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,040
I'll be your lookout.

272
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Joe.

273
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,720
What's up?

274
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,480
If there's anything, you must call me.

275
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Thanks.

276
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
Joe.

277
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,320
Are you back?

278
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,360
No.

279
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,240
The only one who knows where that pic is...

280
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,160
and how important the mugs are...

281
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,560
is you, isn't it?

282
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,520
Mr. Joe is dead.

283
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,760
You organized his funeral, did you forget?

284
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,560
That body might be yours.

285
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,360
But right now, you're here.

286
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,200
When I saw you very mad when your body was cremated,

287
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,760
I was more confident.

288
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,160
That means...

289
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,280
the reason you said you're gonna throw all my stuff away...

290
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,640
was the trap to get me here, right?

291
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,240
Why didn't you tell me that you're back?

292
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,840
You've been around me all along.

293
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,520
If I told you,

294
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,960
you would make me Tong's replacement
for the rest of my life.

295
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,280
I'm sorry.

296
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,920
But the one whom I miss is you.

297
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,960
These past three years,

298
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,960
I missed you everyday.

299
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
No, Ming.

300
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,040
Because if you really missed me,

301
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,040
you wouldn't think of Tong...when we did it...

302
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,200
when you locked me up...

303
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,520
when you made me die...

304
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,360
Wasn't that because you loved Tong?

305
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
No!

306
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:15,080
The one that I love is you, Joe.

307
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,920
Please give me a chance.

308
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,640
Let's start over.

309
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,480
I promise you that I won't ever make you sad.

310
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,520
Ming.

311
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
I'm not gonna let you hurt him anymore.

312
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,080
Ming.

313
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,160
Why, why is everything like this?

314
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,240
Joe, get yourself together.

315
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,360
He doesn't love you, he just feels guilty.

316
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,640
Guilty?

317
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,800
Yes.

318
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,200
A guy like him...when he lost something,
he just wanted to get that something back.

319
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,560
But when he got it back, he wouldn't take a good care of it.

320
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,440
Right.

321
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,560
Because if I didn't die,

322
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,680
all of my life, I would be Tong's
replacement to him forever.

323
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,240
Can you promise me?

324
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,320
That you won't go back to him.

325
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,280
Yes, I promise you.

326
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,920
Everything must not repeat itself.

327
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,160
Joe, wake up, Son.

328
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,880
Joe, wake up, wake up.

329
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Joe, Joe, wake up!

330
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,080
What's wrong?

331
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:21,160
I saw you come back last night
and all you did was staying in your room.

332
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,720
I'm alright, I'm just tired.

333
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,000
Right, Joe, you told me that you had
an important thing to do today.

334
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,760
Do you still have that?

335
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,520
Today?

336
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,600
Yeah.

337
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,560
Hey!

338
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,760
I got a press conference for the music video that I played.

339
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,440
Man... / Go change fast!

340
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,160
Mr. Joe, there's someone here to see you.

341
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,520
It's me, hello, Mrs. Ing.

342
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,520
Hello.

343
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,600
I came here to pick you up to the conference.

344
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,600
Let me see.

345
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,240
Alright, you're okay now.

346
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You don't have to be this close to check on him.

347
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,600
No.

348
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,320
This one is special.

349
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,360
Done. If you wanna fix anything, do it yourself.

350
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,600
What? What's wrong with him?

351
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,560
What are you looking at?

352
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,960
I'm just missing the old days,
you were the one taking care of me.

353
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,760
Right now, it's the opposite.

354
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,880
Even though, I'm in this body,
I'm still your big brother.

355
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,160
I know that.

356
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,000
No matter whose body you're in,

357
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,480
I still feel the same way about you.

358
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,800
How could the conversation go this way?

359
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,160
Joe. Sol. Stand by, please.

360
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,720
Alright.

361
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,720
Sol, you can go in first.

362
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,040
Joe, wait for the MC to call you.

363
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,040
Alright.

364
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,520
Sol, I've never been to the press conference before.

365
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,600
Then come with me.

366
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,480
Huh?

367
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,200
If you're ready, let's clap our hands!

368
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,200
Please welcome our star tonight, Sol!

369
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,600
He's so handsome.

370
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,280
Oh my gosh, who's coming in with Sol?

371
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,160
Oh..

372
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,440
This is my boyfriend.

373
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,600
Wait, wait, wait.

374
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,400
You mean your boyfriend in the music video, right?

375
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,440
Alright, let me ask Joe this question. / Yes?

376
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,200
Joe, how does it feel working with Sol for the first time?

377
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,800
Well, I was quite nervous.

378
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,560
I still am right now, actually.

379
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,400
Joe makes me think about my first love.

380
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,080
This music video is like a dream-come-true to me.

381
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,000
So that means...

382
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,760
we might see you both in a work together again, right?

383
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,240
Well, about that...

384
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,240
Oh, Ming!

385
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,560
You're here to surprise Sol as well?

386
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,800
Wow!

387
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,760
Oh, Er...

388
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,040
That means there will be another music video after this one for sure, right?

389
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,960
And Ming will play a third wheel in the next song?

390
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,160
Wow, wouldn't you guys wanna see that already?

391
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,160
We'll be waiting for the next work.

392
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,400
This is such a thing!

393
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,520
Wut, why is there an uninvited guest at my conference?

394
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,880
Well...

395
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,200
I was the one who invited him.

396
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,800
The other day, Ming reached out to me.

397
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,600
He said he wanted to join us.

398
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,120
So I had him have a grand opening.

399
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,200
And look at this, the hashtag of today's event is trending at No.1.

400
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,240
Anyway, we must thank Ming for this.

401
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,440
Hey, is this Joe?

402
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,480
I thought he's a star, who got him this look?

403
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,320
Don't forget to level up his payment.

404
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,040
Yes, sir.

405
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,400
Oh, no.

406
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,200
Am I the only one thinking about this?

407
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,120
The more I look, the more he looks like the old Joe.

408
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,440
Oh, I guess I'm lucky that I have the same name as him.

409
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,920
Everyone seems to like me because of the name.

410
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,960
It's good you think of it that way.

411
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,600
Focus on what you're doing. Don't ruin the old Joe's name.

412
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,600
Mr. Prach, I think we should go now.

413
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,280
The sponsors are waiting.

414
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,360
Alright, Ming, Sol. Let's go.

415
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,400
I'll introduce you guys to my friends.

416
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,240
This way, please.

417
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,320
Can I have a drink with you?

418
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,720
Joe, there are lots of press here.

419
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,040
I guess you don't want to be in a gossip.

420
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,040
A new star who's got no manners...

421
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,160
You still like to force people as always.

422
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,560
But you, you're more stubborn than before.

423
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,360
That's because I have my lesson learned.

424
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,920
Pour me some more.

425
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,200
Just like the night you did and then sneaked into the house.

426
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,760
Cheers to having you back.

427
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,960
I'm not coming back for you.

428
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,200
Don't worry, Not too long and then I'm out of this mess.

429
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,320
Do you think that this is gonna make you famous forever?

430
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,840
What?

431
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,400
I just played in Sol's music video.

432
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,560
And then I got more and more followers on Instagram.

433
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,280
You know, you're in the same agency.

434
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,640
So they're gonna push him first anyway.

435
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,080
Believe me.

436
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,800
Stay with me.

437
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,720
And I'll give you everything that you need.

438
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,200
Why the fuck are you messing with him?

439
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:03,720
Sol.

440
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,920
There are lots of press here, Sol.

441
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,760
Nevermind them. You think I don't have the guts?

442
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,880
Sol. Sol. Sol. Sol. Sol.

443
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,280
Hey, hey, hey.

444
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,120
Sol, Sol, Sol, no. Let go.

445
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,400
Sol.

446
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,160
Everyone, there's nothing to worry about.

447
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,400
This is just a part of the new music video.

448
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,320
Just to show you all how great it's going to get.

449
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,120
Anyway, please continue enjoying the party.

450
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:30,760
Sol.

451
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,880
Guys, let's do it.

452
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,200
Sol.

453
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,520
Joe, you come with me.

454
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,120
Yes, sir.

455
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,240
I have a high expectations for you.

456
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,240
You're still young. You got a good personality.

457
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,680
I've been in this business for long time, so let me get this straight.

458
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,040
Yes, sir.

459
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,840
There are lots of good looking girls and guys in this industry.

460
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,880
And do you wonder why many people
are still popular and many are not?

461
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,480
Why is that?

462
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,160
"Opportunity"

463
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,680
Some people got it but they didn't take it.

464
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,840
Some are worse.

465
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,720
All of their lives, they have never heard of this word.

466
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,320
Today, this opportunity is parked right in front of you.

467
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,280
If you don't take it, you're a fool.

468
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,960
Ming wants to give you a ride.

469
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,120
Don't let me down.

470
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,760
Ming, what exactly do you want from me?

471
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,320
I just want to give you a ride home.

472
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,720
It's alright, I can go home myself.

473
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:31,760
Joe.

474
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,920
They sent you to me once again.

475
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,600
Can you give me a chance to make it up to you?

476
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,280
They sent me to you?

477
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,720
You think that it's your chance?

478
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,280
Are you misunderstanding something?

479
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,520
This is my chance.

480
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,720
They sent me to fix what I'd done wrong.

481
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,920
And one of my mistakes...

482
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,480
was you, Ming.

483
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,640
Do you know that?

484
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,280
Get out of my life!

485
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,400
Because if you don't...

486
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,520
I will.

487
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,520
Joe...

488
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,080
Stop the car!

489
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,080
Stop the car!

490
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,720
I told you to stop the car!

491
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,560
Joe. / Get off me!

492
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,080
Joe.

493
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,000
I told you to stop the car!

494
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,320
No. / Let go off me!

495
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,640
You're not gonna stop the car?

496
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,040
Alright, then I'll get out myself.

497
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,160
Joe!

498
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:28,800
Let go!

499
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,640
Joe!

500
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,920
There's this one question that's been on my mind all this time.

501
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,320
If it was Tong,

502
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,760
you wouldn't do it in the back
because you would want to see his handsome face, right?

503
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,320
Joe.

504
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,240
Joe!

505
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,240
You got it all wrong!

506
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,880
The thing I love about Tong is...

507
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,520
his back in the movie,

508
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,200
which actually was your back.

509
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,920
Now, do you understand?

510
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,760
That my first and only love...

511
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,480
is you all along.

512
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,200
It's too late, Ming.

513
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,760
Do you not love me anymore?

514
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,000
Don't you want me to wait for you when you come home?

515
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,880
I loved you, Ming.

516
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,600
I'd loved you all along.

517
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,600
But my love for you...

518
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,680
has died along with the old Joe.

519
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,800
If you want to make it up to me,

520
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,040
you can just easily let me go.

521
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,800
I'm begging you.

522
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,240
You can't go anywhere.

523
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,080
You still have half a year of contract with me.

524
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,880
I know that you hate me now.

525
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,680
But I will spend the rest of the time...

526
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,880
making you love me again.
