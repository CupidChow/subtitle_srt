1
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,720
You may go now.

2
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,920
But earlier, you said...

3
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,919
I told you to leave.

4
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,600
I'm spending a night with him here tonight.

5
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,320
Yes, sir.

6
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I've never let anyone come into this house.

7
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
When I'm too drunk,

8
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,160
I would have Secretary Jim drop me off at my condo.

9
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,000
You know,

10
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,120
when you're gone, I couldn't do anything.

11
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,079
So, I let this house get so dirty.

12
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,360
And one day, I thought...

13
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,840
when you came back,

14
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,440
you would wanna see everything the same way as before.

15
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,880
Nothing could ever be the same.

16
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,279
Are you hungry? I'll make something for you to eat.

17
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,760
While you were away,

18
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,159
I practiced making this all the time.

19
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,960
But I couldn't make it as good as you did.

20
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,600
If you're gonna give me your all,

21
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,800
why wouldn't you use our couple mugs?

22
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,520
Oh, I forgot.

23
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,080
A guy like you wouldn't use broken stuff.

24
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,040
It's alright.

25
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,720
I still have our couple pyjamas that you bought me.

26
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,080
Let's wear them tonight.

27
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,280
Come here.

28
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Thank you for coming back.

29
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,240
If you really missed me,

30
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,240
why would you keep this Joe as your paramour?

31
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,360
Or you're just lonely?

32
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,360
So you wanted someone to keep you company?

33
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
Huh?

34
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,480
You know, these past three years,

35
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,000
each day passed in agony.

36
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Until that day, that I met you at the elevator.

37
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
Wait.

38
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Have we met before?

39
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,200
No matter how much you've changed,

40
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,560
I still have feelings for you.

41
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,520
That day, I didn't know who you were.

42
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,640
But I just felt...

43
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,600
that I couldn't let this one go, absolutely not.

44
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,120
And when did you start wondering that I was in this body?

45
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Since you disappeared,
no days went by that I could sleep well.

46
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,880
Every time I closed by eyes,

47
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,760
I would only think of the bad things I did to you.

48
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Until...that night, that we spent a night together.

49
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,680
That night was the first night
that I had a full good sleep until morning.

50
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,960
At least...

51
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,880
you got to wake up in your own body.

52
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,360
I'm gonna use this house...

53
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,600
to remind you of all your memories.

54
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,800
Especially, the feelings that you had for me.

55
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Hello.

56
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,960
Hello, Ming?

57
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,880
Are you busy? Why didn't you answer my calls at all?

58
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,360
Ming's not here.

59
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,080
Who are you?

60
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,960
I want to talk to Ming now!

61
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,360
I'm not your servant.

62
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
That'd be all.

63
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
Wait!

64
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Joe.

65
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,480
I've made you pan-fried eggs.

66
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,720
Tong called you earlier.

67
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,160
Oh.

68
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
I guess he called to borrow my money.

69
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,200
Your brother-in-law is rich, isn't he?

70
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,280
Why would he borrow your money?

71
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,040
He didn't believe me.

72
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,360
He got a loan to build a resort with a friend.

73
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,800
But there was problem with the title deed.

74
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,920
So he's in debts for hundreds of million Baht.

75
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,160
What? Hundreds of million Baht?

76
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,400
And why didn't he borrow the money from your sister?

77
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,240
Aren't they married?

78
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,520
My family is very conservative.

79
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,160
A daughter has no chance to have all the money.

80
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,640
Actually, if Tong had known this before,

81
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,800
he might not have asked her to marry him.

82
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,840
Ha! Then he deserved it. I hung up on him.

83
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,080
You did?

84
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
Why?

85
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,720
You're not happy about it?

86
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,520
If you're not,

87
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,680
put your phone away from me.

88
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,880
No.

89
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,400
I just think that if it were you in the past,

90
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,520
you wouldn't dare do something like that.

91
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,360
Well, that's all on you guys. You changed me.

92
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Then, let me make it up to you by taking you out?

93
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,200
I'm busy.

94
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,480
I got a stunt practice this afternoon.

95
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,080
I'll give you a ride then.

96
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,320
I have Secretary Jim prepared the car already.

97
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,720
Put in some sauce, it'll be tastier.

98
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,160
Would you like me to do a smiley face?

99
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,040
No. / How about a heart shape?

100
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,440
No, I'll do it.

101
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
Let me do that for you.

102
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,400
You want the yolk?

103
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,280
Thanks.

104
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,360
Joe.

105
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,280
I'll pick you up when you're done.

106
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,480
That's alright. I gotta go pick up my Mom.

107
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,960
Why are you taking such a good care of her?

108
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,440
She's not even your real mother.

109
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,640
I'm using her son's body.

110
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,720
And one more thing, she took care of me until I'm well now.

111
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,920
So she's just like my real mother.

112
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,120
I get it now.

113
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,920
If you see her as your mother,

114
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,640
I'll see her as my mother too.

115
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,400
That's up to you.

116
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,080
Do whatever you want.

117
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
Excuse me.

118
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,760
It's not even the time to finish yet.

119
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,200
And where is my Mom?

120
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,120
Eh? Your Mom didn't come here today.

121
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,680
What do you mean?

122
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,160
Someone called and canceled the appointment.

123
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,360
He said he would take your mother somewhere else.

124
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Mom! Mom!

125
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,680
Mom! Mom!

126
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,200
Oh, you're back.

127
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,000
The food's ready. Let's eat.

128
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,560
Where did he take you?

129
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,400
I took your Mom to my family's hospital.

130
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
There're good kidney doctors.

131
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,800
I think they should be able to cure your Mom nicely.

132
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,960
Thanks, but we also have our doctor.

133
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,800
But my doctor said,

134
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,000
the way they're curing her now isn't good.

135
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,320
If they keep doing it that way,

136
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,440
your Mom might have a heart disease.

137
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,240
Oh, that's why.

138
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,400
Lately, I feel very tired...

139
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,520
when finishing the dialysis session.

140
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,000
Mr. Ming, taste this first and see if you like it.

141
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,280
Er...Mom, I think Mr. Ming may have work to do.

142
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,760
Let's not disturb him.

143
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,120
I'm free all day today, Mom

144
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,040
And I'd like to taste your food too.

145
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,560
Oh, of course, please.

146
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,280
May I?

147
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,240
Oh, please.

148
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,400
I'll let you have it first.

149
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,800
Here.

150
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,760
Thank you.

151
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,600
Thank you very much for today.

152
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,640
Thank you.

153
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
I'll come over some other time.

154
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
I'm gonna get going now, Joe.

155
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,280
Let's go, let's get inside.

156
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,800
Come here, Mom.

157
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,760
Get inside.

158
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
What?

159
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,600
Mom.

160
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Huh?

161
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,960
What exactly happened today?

162
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,480
Well, he came to our place this morning.

163
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,440
I thought he was coming to see you.

164
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,040
But he came to get me to have my health checked.

165
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,280
And you went with him?

166
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,080
Why didn't you call me first?

167
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,320
Joe, I'm not a fool.

168
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,120
If he didn't want something,

169
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,400
why would he want to please an old lady like me?

170
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,160
From the way he looks at you, I knew right away.

171
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,360
Mom.

172
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,920
We both are not what you think we are.

173
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Oh, and then what are you two?

174
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,960
I...I don't know about that too.

175
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,200
Right, but I tested him today.

176
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,080
I was being pushy to him all day.

177
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,400
And he didn't complain at all.

178
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,360
He knew what to do and most importantly, he's handsome.

179
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,560
Mom!

180
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,200
C'mon, no matter what you decide,

181
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,440
you have my support.

182
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,640
Okay?

183
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,240
Alright?

184
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,520
Hello, what do you want?

185
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,640
Where are you taking my Mom this time?

186
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,640
No, I'm just worried about you.

187
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,640
Are you still up?

188
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,880
How do you know that?

189
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
I see that your lights are still on.

190
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,480
Huh, wait, where are you now?

191
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,280
I'm in front of your house.

192
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,480
In front of my house?

193
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,640
I forgot my condo key card.

194
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,240
And I can't reach Secretary Jim right now.

195
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,480
Then you go sleep at my place.

196
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
It's hard to find a ride at this time, Joe.

197
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,440
Can I spend a night with you?

198
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Leave!

199
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,560
Oh, no! Shit! Joe!

200
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,200
Hey, Ming, what's wrong?

201
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,400
Joe, stray dogs in the alley are barking at me.

202
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,360
I might get bitten.

203
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,760
Please let me in, please.

204
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
Joe, please.

205
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,800
Here, a shirt.

206
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,560
Thank you.

207
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,040
What are you doing? This is so not you.

208
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,240
What's it like to be me?

209
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,520
Well, all these times,

210
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,720
the one who would do anything to be together...

211
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,280
was me.

212
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,360
Joe.

213
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,680
I'm scared.

214
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,960
I'm scared that I might not see you again.

215
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,360
I'm scared that I might not hear your voice again.

216
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,520
I'm scared that you might disappear again.

217
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,560
Wait, Ming.

218
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,320
Keep it quiet. My Mom is in the next room.

219
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,640
You know...you can't stop me.

220
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,120
So?

221
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,000
Am I still as good as before?

222
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,640
Oh, stop talking.

223
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
What time is it?

224
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,720
It's almost 11 a.m.

225
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,320
My Mom will come and get me to eat.

226
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,000
You should leave before my Mom gets here.

227
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,960
Why? Can't I meet your Mom too?

228
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,720
Hey, you know...for my Mom...

229
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,000
if you wanna spend a night here,

230
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,880
you must marry me first...you know that?

231
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,200
I'm alright with that.

232
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,520
Oh, stop talking. Go!

233
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,680
Go take a shower, hurry! Get up!

234
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,360
Wait, five more minutes, please.

235
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,720
No, hurry up!

236
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,360
Five more minutes. / Get up, Ming!

237
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,480
Get up! Hurry! Go!

238
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,720
Get up! Go! Now!

239
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,800
Joe.

240
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,320
Yes, Mom.

241
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,080
Are you awake, guys?

242
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,960
Did you just say...guys?

243
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,320
Come on out, I've prepared a meal for both of you.

244
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,240
Thank you.

245
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,680
This looks delicious. May I?

246
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,760
Wow, this is amazing, Mom.

247
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,680
So how long have you been together?

248
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,880
Mom!

249
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
About 4-5 months already.

250
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,200
Oh, so it was when you started spending

251
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,040
a night somewhere else and told me you had a shooting.

252
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,640
Mom!

253
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,360
Why do you have to be shy?

254
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,840
You weren't shy when you lied.

255
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,720
Er...and does your family know about this?

256
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,440
Oh, I haven't told my Dad and Mom about this yet.

257
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,080
You haven't or you can't?

258
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,280
Mom!

259
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,960
If you're gonna be together, you can't run away from this.

260
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,400
Our family isn't wealthy.

261
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,560
So it's going to be difficult.

262
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,880
And you know, there are still so many other factors.

263
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,920
Mom, that's enough.

264
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,960
It's alright, Joe.

265
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
What your Mom said is right.

266
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,640
Actually, I've been thinking about it for a while now.

267
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,720
When everything is ready,

268
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,800
I promise you that I'm gonna tell them, definitely.

269
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,800
It's a relief to hear that.

270
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,960
While waiting for everything to get into its place,

271
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
I've prepared something for Joe too.

272
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,160
Are you not eating? It's good.

273
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Answer! Damn it!

274
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,000
Mr. Tong is not free. You can't get in.

275
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,200
He's not available right now.

276
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,200
Right now, he's not available.

277
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,960
It's alright. I'll handle this.

278
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,720
I need more time.

279
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,720
I'll return all of the money to you.

280
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,120
That's what you said last time.

281
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,400
How can I be sure that

282
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,200
you won't tell me this next time?

283
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
You have my word.

284
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,360
An actor's word, is that reliable?

285
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,680
Well, right now, my brother-in-law is kinda busy.

286
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,120
But once I can reach him,

287
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,960
the money won't be the problem.

288
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,040
I give you one week.

289
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,760
If you can't find me the money,

290
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,960
don't say I didn't warn you.

291
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,800
Be careful.

292
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,040
This is real life.

293
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,160
There won't be a stand-in

294
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,440
getting hurt for you like in movies.

295
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,320
I'd like us to have lunch together.

296
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,800
Is there anything?

297
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
No.

298
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,920
You go ahead and eat first.

299
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,520
I'm not hungry yet.

300
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,600
Do you know this place?

301
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,080
Yes, I do.

302
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,159
Whoever works in this industry must know this place.

303
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,360
This is the No.1 agency.

304
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,719
Even when Wut has a meeting here,

305
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,040
he must exchange his ID card.

306
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,200
You know,

307
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,800
that day that I didn't let you go to the conference...

308
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,480
it wasn't because of Tong.

309
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,680
But I didn't want you to play in the movie with Sol.

310
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Why would you bring this up again?

311
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,840
Well, that day, when I told you...

312
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,760
that I'd invest in so many movie and let you play the lead role,

313
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,640
I was being serious.

314
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,880
Sorry to keep you waiting.

315
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,000
Hello, Mr. Ming.

316
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,840
Hello, Mr. Wisit.

317
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,360
This is Joe.

318
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,760
The one I told you that he's going to play the lead role

319
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,960
in the movie we talked about.

320
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,040
Hello.

321
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,240
Right now, we're about to make a big movie.

322
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,480
At first, we were gonna have you play as a supporting character.

323
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,720
But Mr. Ming was interested in investing in the movie as well.

324
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,600
So we had to change the plan.

325
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,720
And who did you choose to be the lead role at first?

326
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,640
Oh, it was Tong.

327
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,840
But changing the lead could be very interesting.

328
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,080
Here's the script.

329
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,960
If you read it and you want to me to edit anything,

330
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,240
let me know.

331
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,920
Actually, I used to come and cast a role here once.

332
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,880
And I passed.

333
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,080
But in the end, the director chose his own kid anyway.

334
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,720
So even if Tong wasn't in this movie,

335
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,000
he would have other movies to play.

336
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,840
Joe.

337
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,120
Please let us return the chance that we stole from you.

338
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,240
Why don't you read this first?

339
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
And you can decide later.

340
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,960
Well, if you got the answer,

341
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,320
please call my secretary.

342
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Thank you very much, Mr. Wisit.

343
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,680
Mr. President!

344
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,240
What's the thing you had your people reach me?

345
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,000
Tong, I was about to have my secretary contact you.

346
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,720
Right now, we have another interesting project...

347
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,880
for you to play.

348
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,360
Tong, let's talk about it in the office.

349
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Alright, I'll be right behind you.

350
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,800
I'd like to talk to my brother-in-law first.

351
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,200
That's why you didn't answer any of my calls.

352
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,760
You've been busy.

353
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,320
We both have somewhere else to go.
Please excuse us.

354
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,960
The rumor about replacing me...

355
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,880
because you're gonna have someone new play instead,

356
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,400
that must be true.

357
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,560
I guess it is.

358
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
You're not helping me

359
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,560
but you're making a movie for my stand-in to play?

360
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,640
Tong, please show respect to Joe.

361
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,200
Right now, he's my boyfriend.

362
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,080
Okay, I'm sorry.

363
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,960
I didn't know that you two are a couple already.

364
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,520
If there's nothing else, excuse us.

365
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,520
Wait.

366
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,480
Tomorrow, there's a premiere of a movie that three of us played.

367
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,600
Why don't we all go?

368
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,200
Take it as my apology.

369
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,720
It's alright, we both...

370
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,360
Of course.

371
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,360
We'll go.

372
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
There you go.

373
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,560
Dress nicely.

374
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,960
See you there.

375
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
Why did you decide to come?

376
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,720
Well, he's your brother-in-law.

377
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,040
Although how much we want to avoid him,
we can't get away from him.

378
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,280
So I don't want to cause you any trouble.

379
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
You're so kind as before.

380
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,920
No.

381
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,680
Joe.

382
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,320
No matter whose body you're in,

383
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,560
you're still you.

384
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
But you aren't the same too, you know?

385
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,600
In the past, no matter how much anyone convince you,

386
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
or do anything,

387
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
you wouldn't get into the entertainment industry.

388
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,080
Look at you now.

389
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,520
The reason I became an actor was because of you.

390
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,160
How so?

391
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,400
At that time, I didn't know where you were.

392
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,320
So I thought I wanted to be seen

393
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,360
in the public eye as much as possible.

394
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,960
In case, one day you'd see me,

395
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,120
you'd feel something and come back to me.

396
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,640
So you traded your privacy for me?

397
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,960
But it's worth it.

398
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,720
Because the last movie that I played,

399
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,280
there are both of our names in it.

400
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,600
It's almost time.

401
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,880
Let's go.

402
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,080
Let's.

403
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,760
So are you excited to be here to see 9 Swords Part 2?

404
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,400
Of course!

405
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,440
And who are you here for, especially?

406
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,720
Tong! He was so good in the first movie.

407
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,080
Wow, then why don't we go see the movie now?

408
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,480
That back made me realize.

409
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,480
If I hadn't told you,

410
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,040
you wouldn't have known that it's my back.

411
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,600
But now, people will know whose back it is.

412
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,840
Ming, what are you doing?

413
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,280
Taking a photo of your name.

414
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,840
Ming, we're not allowed to take photos at the cinema.

415
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,120
Put it away. / It's alright, I'll pay for the fine.

416
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,680
Er...but I can't remember your new name.

417
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,960
How about this? let me know if it's there already.

418
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,080
Really?

419
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
My name's not there.

420
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,760
Tong.

421
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,000
Feedback? Oh, it's quite good.

422
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,160
Actually, I have to thank everyone so much

423
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,440
for making this project happen.

424
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,320
Because the first movie earned a lot of revenue.

425
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,800
Ming! Ming! Not here, Ming!

426
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,880
Ming! Calm down!

427
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,120
Ming! Ming!

428
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,920
And most importantly, I put so much effort into this movie.

429
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,320
Because I played all action scenes by myself.

430
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,000
Hey, Ming, come here, let's do the interview together.

431
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,680
Ming! Ming!

432
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,680
If you go now, your family will know about this.

433
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,280
Er..then let's continue.

434
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,960
Looks like Ming is not ready yet.

435
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,920
Next question, please.

436
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,440
So what's the most challenging scene?

437
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,920
Er..a challenging scene?

438
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,280
I guess that will have to be the scene

439
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,880
that I had to walk on the fire.

440
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,200
Ming.

441
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,640
How could he do this to you?

442
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,000
He still needed my money.

443
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,160
Hello.

444
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,920
So, you did that because I wouldn't lend you the money, right?

445
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,320
Wait, Ming.

446
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,280
Calm down, I have nothing to do with this.

447
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,520
If you're gonna blame someone, it must be Joe's agency.

448
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:33,120
They removed his name because they wanted to promote the movie.

449
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,400
But you could have said no, right?

450
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,480
Yeah.

451
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,720
You know that I'm the producer of this movie.

452
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,760
I can bring anyone's name back...

453
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,200
if I want to.

454
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,680
So what exactly do you want?

455
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,880
Tell me.

456
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,520
I just wanna let you know...

457
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,440
who your real family is.

458
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,080
Who is the one you're supposed to care for?

459
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,840
Tong, you, piece of shit.

460
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,240
Ming, Ming, Ming, Ming, that's enough.

461
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,960
That's enough, Ming.

462
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,480
Alright.

463
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,480
You wanna talk to me about the money, right?

464
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,160
But you gotta apologize to Joe in front of me.

465
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,560
Are you kidding me, Ming?'

466
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,760
What's wrong? Don't you want the money?

467
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,520
See you at the office tomorrow.

468
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,840
Sit down first, Ming.

469
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,360
Aren't you mad at all?

470
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,840
Of course, I am.

471
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,440
I'm so mad that I want to kill him, Ming.

472
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,240
Then why aren't you doing anything?

473
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,000
Because you're mad at him for me.

474
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,280
If it were you in the past,

475
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,280
you wouldn't side up with me like this, am I right?

476
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,280
Don't you worry.

477
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,520
Tomorrow, I'll make him bow and apologize to you.

478
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,160
Thanks, Ming.

479
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,800
That's enough.

480
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,400
Mr. Tong is on his way. Please wait for a moment.

481
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,600
Alright.

482
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,320
It's gonna be okay.

483
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,400
Thanks.

484
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,440
Ming, you know...

485
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,040
I don't like Tong for a long time.

486
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,600
Since before I knew you.

487
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,240
He's a liar.

488
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,960
He does everything for his own fame.

489
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I didn't see that in the past.

490
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,320
But since you were gone,

491
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,480
I've had my eyes opened.

492
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:31,680
And now, my feelings for him are not different from yours.

493
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,800
I promise you.

494
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,400
I'll never let him hurt you again.

495
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,720
Thanks.

496
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,520
Sorry to keep you waiting.

497
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,360
This way, please.

498
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,760
Mom!

499
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,320
Hello.

500
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,520
Tong, aren't we here for a business talk?

501
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,160
Why did you bring my Mom here?

502
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,400
Why? Can't I know what you're gonna talk about today?

503
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,800
Business stuff and personal stuff must be separated.

504
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,360
This is my rule.

505
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,080
And why did you have to have Tong apologize to him?

506
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,080
Is that business or personal?

507
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,520
Mom, you're not involved in this.

508
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,800
Who exactly in this room is not involved?

509
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,160
You know that best, Ming.

510
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,080
Mom, don't you mention him!

511
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,400
I didn't want to.

512
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,520
But if it weren't for him golddigging,

513
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,000
and you being so blind like this...

514
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,880
Mom!

515
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,080
Break up!

516
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,320
And come back to help Tong.

517
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,880
Or else this will reach Dad.

518
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,120
Or if you can't break up,

519
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,680
I will help you.

520
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,640
Don't you worry about that, ma'am.

521
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,960
I'm just a temporary Ming's bed mate.

522
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,040
We have a clear contract about that.

523
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,080
When the contract is over,

524
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:01,560
I guarantee you, I won't show up here ever again.

525
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,360
Joe.

526
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,120
Joe! Joe!

527
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,600
Joe, I'm sorry.

528
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,760
It's my fault, I didn't know that Tong's gonna use this trick.

529
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,640
That's enough, Ming.

530
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,080
No matter what, this must happen some day.

531
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,040
We can't run away from it.

532
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,720
I'm not thinking about running away.

533
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,480
Well, I can handle this.

534
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,360
Trust me.

535
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,160
What can you handle? What is it that you'll handle?

536
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,040
Didn't you see it earlier, Ming?

537
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,400
Ming, you could change your thoughts,

538
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,120
but you can't change your family's thoughts.

539
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,120
Of course, I can.

540
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,760
Give me some time.

541
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,760
I'll show you.

542
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,320
Ming, I'm tired already.

543
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,040
Please, I'm so tired of all of this mess.

544
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,200
Joe.

545
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,160
Let's call it off, please.

546
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,960
Let me go, Ming.

547
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,120
Let me get some rest.

548
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,280
Joe.

549
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,480
Joe!

550
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,560
It's good that he's gone.

551
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,680
You've gone too far this time.

552
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,960
Everyone has good intentions for you, Ming.

553
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,480
Since you've had him in your life,

554
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,280
you're obsessed with him.

555
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,480
Wake up.

556
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,880
Right now, I'm seeing everything the clearest in my life.

557
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,440
I'm still waiting for my same old lovely little brother to come back.

558
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,760
Oh, Joe.

559
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,880
Have you eaten?

560
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,120
What's wrong?

561
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,800
Everything is as you told me.

562
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,320
Even I know it, it still hurts.

563
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,040
I'm so sorry for disturbing you like this.

564
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,480
No, I must thank you.

565
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,640
If you didn't tell me this,

566
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,080
I wouldn't know that Ming was like this.

567
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,240
He's still young.

568
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,520
When the old Joe was missing,

569
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:01,160
I was so glad but I didn't think that he would find a new one.

570
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:05,160
If Dad finds out about this, it will be a problem.

571
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Don't worry, Mom.

572
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,680
Because from now on,

573
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,760
Ming will be able to think about it by himself.

574
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,720
Oh, Ming.

575
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,440
You've thought it through.

576
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,760
Then let's go. Let's talk in the meeting room.

577
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,760
Who said I was going to lend you the money?

578
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,400
Then why did you come here?

579
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,120
What is it? I'm busy.

580
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,680
I hope this is important.

581
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,720
Yes, it is.

582
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,800
Dad, right now, I'm dating a guy.

583
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,720
His name is Joe.
