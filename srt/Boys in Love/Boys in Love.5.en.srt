1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,410
You’re good-looking, Mr. Nut.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,310
People will keep coming in.

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,850
Thank you so much, Mr. Tan,

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,300
for keeping me company tonight.

5
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,840
It’s my pleasure.

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,800
- Don’t be nosy!
- Ouch!

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,850
Are you dating too?

8
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,300
Stay out of my business, stranger.

9
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,420
You can’t just leave me alone.

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,180
Fine. Go, all of you!

11
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,010
Good evening, ma’am.

12
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,510
Aren’t you meeting Per and Tar after?

13
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,240
I’ll walk you out.

14
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,550
I’m not meeting them.

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,200
Mr. Kimhan Panurak from Class 6/1,

16
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,710
please report to the Student Welfare Department.

17
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,390
Hello, Kim.

18
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,580
Mon’s mother.

19
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,390
Did I really pass?

20
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,390
- You did great.
- I pass!

21
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,870
After I met you, I realized…

22
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,100
I’m actually happy with the life I have now,

23
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,830
and I really like it.

24
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,910
I like it too.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,960
- Name.
- Hm?

26
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,400
Will you stop eating my yogurt?

27
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,579
I never ate your yogurt.

28
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:33,940
Maybe you ate it yourself and just forgot.

29
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,760
Are you crazy?

30
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,130
If I ate it, I’d remember.

31
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,400
You’re the crazy one. I didn’t touch your yogurt.

32
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,290
What are you talking about?

33
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,550
You always eat other people’s food.

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,740
- I do not!
- You totally do!

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,220
- How would you know?
- Who else would it be?

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,210
Ugh.

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,380
Hey, little bro, back me up here.

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,579
I swear I didn’t eat her yogurt.

39
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,800
I’m heading out now, Kaiju.

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,579
Keep the place in one piece.

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,560
You’re the only mature one around here.

42
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,370
Shane’s been leaving
for school super early lately.

43
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,870
Yeah, I bet he’s dating someone.

44
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,870
Don’t change the subject.

45
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,680
I didn’t eat it.

46
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,810
Sorry.

47
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,430
Took me a while.

48
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,210
Did you wait long?

49
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,490
Not really.

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,579
Actually, you showed up ahead of schedule.

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,420
You’re way too early.

52
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,579
Sorry about that.

53
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,120
Should we head out?

54
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,170
Yeah, let’s go.

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,500
Here, let me carry your bag.

56
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,850
It’s okay.

57
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,950
Let me.

58
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,470
Hey!

59
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,290
Kit!

60
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,730
Wait.

61
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,480
Kit!

62
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,360
Hey.

63
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,810
SECONDARY 6/WINNERS

64
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,670
I’m just here waiting for Shane.

65
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,200
He’s giving me a math tutoring session later.

66
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,190
Yeah, we have a tutoring session after this.

67
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,800
Why, Tar?

68
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,710
Can’t Kit just sit with us and listen in?

69
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,760
Of course.

70
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,710
Anyone is welcome to listen
to our group meeting.

71
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,800
Hey, guys! Wanna join us?

72
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,900
We’re having a group meeting.

73
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,540
Come on. Group meeting! Group meeting!

74
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,460
Let’s get to it.

75
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,290
You said it was urgent.

76
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,900
Yeah, I even skipped practice for this.

77
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,300
So, what’s up?

78
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,980
I called you all here to witness Kim’s villainy.

79
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:29,680
What?

80
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,910
What did I do?

81
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,430
Don’t play innocent, Kim.

82
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,670
What did you do to tick off the new teacher
from the Student Welfare Department

83
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,120
and get called there?

84
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,800
Did you annoy her

85
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,600
or maybe dress in a way that offended her?

86
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,760
Did you kick a ball at her car

87
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,990
or rant about the school online?

88
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,760
No!

89
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,000
I haven’t done anything like that.

90
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,580
Then why did she summon you?

91
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,770
Maybe it’s because she’s Mon’s mom.

92
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,890
What?!

93
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,210
KIMHAN PANURAK

94
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,190
So, you’re close friends with Mon, correct?

95
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,500
Uh…

96
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,580
You could say that, ma’am.

97
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,680
Your grades are average.

98
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,220
Your extracurriculars

99
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,380
aren’t particularly outstanding.

100
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,210
Your behavior isn’t notably good or bad.

101
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,150
So basically, the only thing

102
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,150
you’re known for is being lively.

103
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,350
Yes, ma’am.

104
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,640
If you ever have any problems,
feel free to come to me.

105
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,040
And if you have some free time,

106
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,280
stop by my house for a meal.

107
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,530
Really? I can do that?

108
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,590
You’re always welcome at my place.

109
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,100
This means my relationship
with Mon has leveled up.

110
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,790
Mrs. Paan invited me to her house.

111
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,010
That’s a clear sign she approves of me.

112
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,730
Approves, my ass!

113
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,600
She called you to the department

114
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,000
to let you know she’s keeping an eye on you.

115
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,580
She checked your grades,

116
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,700
your school activities, and your behavior

117
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,170
to see if you’re good enough for Mon.

118
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,570
Yeah? But she’s a teacher.

119
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,400
Maybe you’re reading too much into it.

120
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,230
Exactly.

121
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,660
You’re being too negative.

122
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,080
But I think it’s possible.

123
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,310
Just because she’s a teacher

124
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,250
doesn’t mean she’s not protective of her son.

125
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,900
Crap!

126
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,590
Does this mean my love life just hit a roadblock?

127
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,870
No one listens when I say it.

128
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,900
But everyone nods along when Per does.

129
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,840
Mon is the son of
the new Student Welfare teacher.

130
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,150
Did you know Mrs. Paan is Mon’s mom?

131
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,980
- Seriously?
- No way.

132
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,850
GUYS! MON’S MOM IS THE NEW
STUDENT WELFARE TEACHER!

133
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,300
Mom.

134
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,800
You can drop me off in front of the school today.

135
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,690
I’ll walk in by myself.

136
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,780
We can just go in together.

137
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,620
Why get off separately?

138
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,800
We already agreed

139
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,750
we wouldn’t show up at school together.

140
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,130
I only agreed to move here

141
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,040
because you promised we’d go separately.

142
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,370
Are you really that scared people will find out
you’re the Student Welfare teacher’s son?

143
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,600
Even if neither of us says anything,

144
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,200
people are going to figure it out.

145
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,500
It’s not like we can hide it.

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,140
And don’t blame me for transferring schools.

147
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,370
You seem happy here.

148
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,870
You even made a new close friend.

149
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,799
Boyfriend, Mom.

150
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,490
He’s my boyfriend, not just a close friend.

151
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:40,830
Alright.

152
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,770
HOPE YOU LIKE IT :)

153
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,900
Morning, Mr. Nut.

154
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,450
Morning.

155
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,940
Are you in love, Mr. Tan?

156
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,560
Excuse me?

157
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,350
Me? I love?

158
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,000
You changed your outfit

159
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,070
and styled your hair differently,
like you’re hoping someone will notice.

160
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,060
Well, I want to look good too.

161
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,500
Maybe someone will like me.

162
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,410
But you usually…

163
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,960
look good already.

164
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,460
That’s not true.

165
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,110
If I really looked good,

166
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,910
someone would like me.

167
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,410
But no one does.

168
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,970
How do you know that?

169
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,480
We’re all liked by someone.

170
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,600
Oops.

171
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,780
Okay.

172
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,600
I have a class to teach.

173
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,560
Oh.

174
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,000
I… grabbed the wrong stuff.

175
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,840
What are you looking at?

176
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,570
A cute person.

177
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,480
You should be looking at the question.

178
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,030
You’re here to solve math problems, not to draw.

179
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,500
We just finished midterms.

180
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,240
Why are we diving back into tutoring already?

181
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,000
Hey.

182
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,980
It’s time to start thinking about your future.

183
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,570
Anyway, when you’re choosing a university faculty,

184
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,770
let me know the GPA you’re aiming for.

185
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,290
I’ll plan a new tutoring schedule for you.

186
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,040
Not just math, but other subjects too.

187
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,370
You’re already planning for the future?

188
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,100
What’s with that smile?

189
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,380
Well…

190
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,060
You’re planning for the future,

191
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,940
does that mean we’re getting serious?

192
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,890
What are you talking about? I don’t get it.

193
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,210
What part don’t you get?

194
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,340
So, have you figured out...

195
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,540
what we are yet?

196
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
I think we should get going.

197
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,310
The morning assembly’s about to start.

198
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,520
Come on.

199
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,440
I’ve been attending schools
where my mom teaches since kindergarten.

200
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,660
I didn’t think much of it when I was younger.

201
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,860
But as I got older,

202
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,760
I started to feel like my close friends
didn’t really want to be close anymore.

203
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,810
They’d skip class without inviting me

204
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,190
because they were afraid I’d tell my mom.

205
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,460
At first, when I found out
she was transferring here,

206
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,300
I didn’t want to come.

207
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,970
But she convinced me anyway.

208
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,750
Good thing you did.

209
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,000
Otherwise, we never would’ve met.

210
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,400
That’s why I don’t want people to know

211
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,810
my mom’s the new Student Welfare teacher.

212
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,700
People will treat me differently.

213
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,880
Maybe even you.

214
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,500
Why would you think that?

215
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,330
I love you, Mon.

216
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,980
I don’t care whose son you are.

217
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,240
I’ll still be with you.

218
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,860
Nothing’s going to change how I feel.

219
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,250
Are you sure

220
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,260
things between us aren’t changing?

221
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,470
I’m sure.

222
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,850
Ask me a hundred times,

223
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,670
and I’ll give you the same answer.

224
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,500
Mon, are you the son of Mrs. Paan,

225
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,750
the deputy director of
the Student Welfare Department?

226
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,500
Kim!

227
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,880
Ouch!

228
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,050
Hey, wait up, Mon!

229
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:53,790
Mon!

230
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,830
Wait, so is it true?

231
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,200
Yes, ma’am. He’s Mrs. Paan’s son.

232
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:56,890
Mon.

233
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,640
Look how cute you are, Kaiju.

234
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,600
Smile.

235
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,100
I’m going to turn you into a cat influencer.

236
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,200
A funny-looking cat like Kaiju
being an influencer?

237
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,700
You’re dreaming.

238
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,660
Did you hear that?

239
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,780
Shane’s bullying you.

240
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,010
Bite him!

241
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:21,910
Bite!

242
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,160
Bite me, and you’ll end up
a stray cat living in a temple.

243
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,730
How cold of him.

244
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,570
You’re way too cute to be a temple cat.

245
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,100
Just pack your bag and come live with me instead.

246
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,240
Will you stop trying to steal my cat?

247
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,740
He’s staying here,

248
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,670
which means he likes it.

249
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:46,990
Shane.

250
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,190
Yeah?

251
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,300
You’ve been dodging my question all day.

252
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,060
Kaiju…

253
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,040
So, what are we?

254
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,670
Mom.

255
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,760
Dad.

256
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,650
Hello.

257
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,600
I’m Kit.

258
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,800
Shane, call Jin and Name here.

259
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,290
Tell them we have
something important to discuss.

260
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,900
Like I said,

261
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,010
my business isn’t doing so well.

262
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,859
I need money to keep it afloat.

263
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,410
And your mom needs some

264
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,160
to start her new life abroad.

265
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,819
So you’re selling this place

266
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,290
and leaving us to sleep on the streets?

267
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,940
Name, don’t.

268
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,360
We agreed that

269
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,850
we’d both take care of you equally.

270
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,630
What do you mean?

271
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,660
Who’s living with who?

272
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,890
I’m opening a restaurant in Germany.

273
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,900
So two of you will come with me.

274
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,250
This is the best solution.

275
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,180
Yeah, best for the two of you.

276
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,300
You made this decision together

277
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,300
without even asking us?

278
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,900
I’m not living with either of you.

279
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,020
I’m an adult now.

280
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Then what do you want us to do?

281
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,710
I told you, this is the best way.

282
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,050
That’s your problem, Dad.

283
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,400
Was it really that hard to ask what we think first?

284
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,960
Exactly.

285
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,550
Enough!

286
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,290
I’m your father!

287
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,050
Do I need your permission to do anything?

288
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,010
- But can’t you at least ask for our opinion?
- Stop it!

289
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,580
Hey.

290
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,330
Don’t raise your voice at the kids like that.

291
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,430
Why not?

292
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,500
The money they’re spending is mine.

293
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,010
Then maybe you should start
acting more responsible.

294
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,120
What kind of father are you?

295
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,920
Enough!

296
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,230
You’re giving me a headache.

297
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,540
Where is Kaiju?

298
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,600
Kaiju?

299
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,320
Kaiju!

300
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,030
Kaiju!

301
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,170
What’s going on, Shane?

302
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,320
- Kaiju.
- Kaiju.

303
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,030
Kaiju!

304
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,940
Kaiju!

305
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:51,860
Kaiju!

306
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,200
No one has seen him at all?

307
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:53,710
Kaiju.

308
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,450
He isn’t here.

309
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,080
Did someone leave the door open?

310
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,270
Check the bedrooms.

311
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,640
Kaiju.

312
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,450
Kaiju.

313
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,260
Did you steal my cat?

314
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,740
He followed me down here.

315
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,570
I guess he didn’t want me to leave.

316
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,170
Did you fight with your family?

317
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,250
Or…

318
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,870
is your mom upset because we—

319
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,880
It’s not that.

320
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,600
My mom and dad want to sell the condo

321
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,230
and have us live with them.

322
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,110
The two of us who choose to live with Mom

323
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,100
will have to move to Germany.

324
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,560
I still don’t know who I’m supposed to live with.

325
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,160
Where are Mom and Dad?

326
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,430
They went home.

327
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,670
And where are you going?

328
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,640
Pattaya.

329
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,820
Right now?

330
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,350
Mm.

331
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,010
I think Mom and Dad will fight to have you.

332
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,080
But neither of them wants me.

333
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,910
What is this?

334
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,900
Are you being dramatic and feeling unwanted?

335
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,020
Nope!

336
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,800
I’m so happy, actually.

337
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,740
I’m not going with either of them anyway.

338
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,040
I’m gonna live with a friend in Pattaya.

339
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,710
I own my life.

340
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,880
I’m not letting them decide for me.

341
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,320
Bye now. I’ll see you around.

342
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,850
HOW’S YOUR SITUATION AT HOME?

343
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,330
NOT SURE YET. I’LL THINK ABOUT IT TOMORROW.

344
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,240
Still up, Cheese?

345
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,600
Jin went out drinking with her friends.

346
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,300
As usual.

347
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,600
And now Name’s left the house.

348
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,600
What are we going to do?

349
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,830
There’s nothing we can do.

350
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,370
I brought you a glass of milk.

351
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,250
I’m not a kid anymore, Mom.

352
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:56,740
What?

353
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,930
Teenagers can’t drink milk now?

354
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,690
MON, ARE YOU MAD? WHY ARE YOU GHOSTING ME?

355
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,910
If you don’t want to ride
with me to school tomorrow,

356
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,370
you can take the bus.

357
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,700
But no taxis or ride-hailing.

358
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,800
Those are too expensive.

359
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:24,950
Doesn’t matter.

360
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,370
The whole school already knows anyway.

361
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,480
Suit yourself then.

362
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,510
Just don’t be late.

363
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,800
Gosh, look at you.

364
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,500
Did you drink or bathe in alcohol?

365
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
You still have the energy to party
in the middle of all this?

366
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,110
I drank to relieve stress.

367
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,670
What else do you want me to do?

368
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,080
Become a nun?

369
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,580
What are you stressed about?

370
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,260
Your life isn’t changing much.

371
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,400
Cheese and I are the ones who should be
freaking out about living with Mom.

372
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,030
Shane, where’s Cheese?

373
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,070
Isn’t she in her room?

374
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,900
No, she’s not.

375
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,700
Jin, come on.

376
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,740
Don’t mess around.

377
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:36,770
I’m not.

378
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,140
Cheese is missing.

379
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,530
SHANE

380
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,460
You realize what time it is?

381
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,420
Hey, my little sister is missing.

382
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,840
Can you think of anywhere she might be?

383
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,020
Like a friend’s place or a relative’s house.

384
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,900
I think she went looking for Name in Pattaya.

385
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,300
She mentioned him right before she disappeared.

386
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,650
Have you talked to Name?

387
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,580
I haven’t.

388
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,920
He’s not picking up my calls.

389
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,400
Alright. I’m on my way.

390
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,300
Any luck?

391
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,420
Can you reach your sister?

392
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,220
No.

393
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,430
She’s not answering my calls

394
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,500
or replying to my texts.

395
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,030
I didn’t know you had a driver’s license.

396
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,230
I don’t.

397
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,710
What?

398
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,290
Then how are we supposed to drive out of town?

399
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,090
Let Jin drive.

400
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,550
She has a license, right?

401
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,900
She’s still not sober.

402
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,500
So what do we do now?

403
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,540
I know someone with a license.

404
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,020
Hi. You’re listening to the 7 o’clock news.

405
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,190
Half an hour ago, a car ran off a bridge…

406
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,090
Damn it!

407
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,600
Will you stop talking about car accidents?

408
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,650
And you guys—seriously?

409
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,630
I’ve only had my license for two months,

410
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,100
and now I’m driving you all out of town?

411
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,150
Well, your friend is in need here.

412
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,120
We must help him find his sister.

413
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,450
I don’t think so, Tar.

414
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,200
You just want an excuse to go to Pattaya.

415
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,900
What?

416
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,290
I really want to help Shane look for his sister.

417
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,800
What’s her name again?

418
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,620
Shawn?

419
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,810
Cheese, you asshole!

420
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,530
Dammit, Jin.

421
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,300
Pick up the phone. It’s annoying.

422
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,450
CHEESE

423
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,270
Cheese.

424
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,970
Hello, Cheese. Where are you?

425
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,960
I took a van to Pattaya, but I couldn’t find Name.

426
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,500
I can’t reach him.

427
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,340
I don’t know where he is.

428
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,750
Stop looking for him.

429
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,210
Just tell me where you are.

430
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,400
Jin and I will come get you.

431
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:06,940
I don’t know.

432
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,440
I’m not sure.

433
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,820
Share your location.

434
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,600
Stay put. Don’t go anywhere.

435
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,910
Don’t talk to anyone.

436
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:13,860
Got it?

437
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,100
I have to hang up now. My battery’s almost dead

438
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:16,700
Huh?

439
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,850
How much do you have left?

440
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,750
7%. Gotta go.

441
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:24,920
What did she say?

442
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,470
She’s by herself.

443
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,880
She shared her location.

444
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,060
2,000 baht, please.

445
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,610
Thank you.

446
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,500
I’ll pay you back later.

447
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,170
Mm.

448
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,520
It’s time to go, Kim.

449
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,980
Shane’s sister is waiting for us.

450
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:50,490
Yeah.

451
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,170
Gosh, it’s Mon!

452
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,300
Can I go talk to him?

453
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,900
Does it have to be now?

454
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,610
Yes, I’ll be quick.

455
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:04,970
I don’t buy that.

456
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,870
You’ll take your sweet time.

457
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,740
Hey, Tar!

458
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:09,900
Hello, Mon.

459
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,510
Tar!

460
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,220
I’m sorry,

461
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,700
but we’re on our way to Pattaya.

462
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,750
I’ll have Kim call you back once we get there.

463
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:16,830
Bye.

464
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,640
Listen to that. Now Mon’s going
to be even more upset.

465
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,440
Oh, come on.

466
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,750
You can call him back once we’re in Pattaya.

467
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:23,760
Go already.

468
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,730
Starting the day with a pout, huh?

469
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,200
Careful, it might become a habit.

470
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:02,540
That pouty face might look cute now,
but it won’t when you’re older.

471
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,810
Just saying.

472
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,810
This is your fault, Mom.

473
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,440
What?

474
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,300
How is this my fault?

475
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,410
I know you asked Kim
to meet you at your department.

476
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,060
Why would you do that?

477
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,500
You’re being mean to my boyfriend.

478
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,310
I just wanted to get to know him,

479
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,060
and let him know who I am

480
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,700
and why I’m even at the school.

481
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,500
And really, the first time he came over,

482
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,220
you could’ve introduced me properly,

483
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,470
but you didn’t.

484
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,260
So tell me who’s being mean here?

485
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,790
Are you blaming me for this

486
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,900
because you don’t want to admit

487
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,310
it started with how you handled things?

488
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:53,580
I saw that Kim sent you messages last night,

489
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,770
but you didn’t reply.

490
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,900
If he’s upset and ignoring your calls today,

491
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,900
I wouldn’t be surprised.

492
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,500
Maybe he’s had enough of how mean you are.

493
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:27,900
Jeez!

494
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,760
Why are you here so early?

495
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:32,740
Well…

496
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,900
I guess I’m waiting for someone.

497
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,000
Yeah?

498
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,010
Right.

499
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,810
Good morning.

500
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,460
What is it?

501
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,320
The milk.

502
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,620
Isn’t it for me?

503
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,380
Doesn’t it come with a note too?

504
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,210
Thank you.

505
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,770
How about I pay for our lunch in return?

506
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,440
Sure.

507
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,170
- How did you get here?
- Cheese!

508
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:50,730
Cheese!

509
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:57,960
Gosh.

510
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,010
Where have you been?

511
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,950
Everyone was so worried.

512
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,980
Why did you follow me here?

513
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,710
Do you know that you shouldn’t do this?

514
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,800
How can you say that to her?

515
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,920
She’s worried about you.

516
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:14,960
Enough now.

517
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,100
The important thing is she’s safe.

518
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,540
Now you.

519
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,420
Don’t ever do this again.

520
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,320
Do you understand?

521
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,100
I just wanted us all to be together.

522
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:39,590
Oh, come on.

523
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,199
All of us are together right now.

524
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,370
Yes, we’re together.

525
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:49,650
All of us.

526
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,300
Don’t do that to us again. Got it?

527
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,600
Do you know I haven’t showered yet?

528
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,890
And I haven’t eaten yet.

529
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,040
Should we go eat? I’m hungry.

530
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:07,810
Mhm.

531
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,560
You did great, my friend.

532
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,500
This was all your hard work.

533
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,000
You handled your first long drive really well.

534
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,980
Even if you had to retake the driving test
ten times, you’d still pass.

535
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,260
One test is more than enough.

536
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,800
Now, where’s my phone?

537
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:29,690
Are you finally giving it back?

538
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,410
Jeez! Your phone!

539
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,240
It’s right here.

540
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:37,950
Here.

541
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,270
Mon.

542
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,540
I miss you.

543
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,270
Shane’s little sister left the house
and came to Pattaya,

544
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,410
so we came here to look for her.

545
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,420
I was the one driving everyone,

546
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,860
so I couldn’t pick up your call.

547
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,170
I’m sorry, Mon.

548
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,410
Please don’t be mad.

549
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,300
You didn’t do anything wrong.
Why would you apologize?

550
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,000
Because you’re upset.

551
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,460
I must’ve done something wrong.

552
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,240
You didn’t. I did.

553
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,860
I should be the one apologizing.

554
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,780
I was irritated

555
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,380
and ended up taking it out on everyone.

556
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,620
It was childish of me.

557
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,300
You have the right to be upset with me

558
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,770
for being moody and unreasonable.

559
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,030
No, Mon.

560
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,010
We don’t have to be so reasonable all the time.

561
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,590
Kim,

562
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,470
can I ask you something?

563
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,700
And please be honest.

564
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:09,520
Yes.

565
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,880
Do you think I’m mean?

566
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,300
No.

567
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,260
Why would I love you if you were?

568
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,400
Right?

569
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,180
So, have you decided

570
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,600
if you’re really going to live
with your mom abroad?

571
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,500
I’m not sure yet.

572
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,000
But you’ve always wanted to study abroad.

573
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,900
Living with your mom sounds like a good fit.

574
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,580
It does.

575
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,100
But who knows?

576
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,280
I’m not sure if I’m ready.

577
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,190
Shane.

578
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,060
I know shouldn’t do this.

579
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,800
And I don’t have the right

580
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,870
to decide anything for you.

581
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,820
But if I don’t say it now,

582
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,370
I’ll regret it for the rest of my life.

583
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,900
So just this once,

584
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,850
I’m going to be selfish.

585
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,620
Can you not go?

586
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,700
I don’t know what else to do.

587
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,300
We just started this.

588
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,700
I don’t want it to end like this.

589
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,010
I like you, Shane.

590
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:16,050
And I want to be your boyfriend.

591
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,220
Mm.

592
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,550
Same here.

593
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,910
I like you too.

594
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,200
And I want to…

595
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,700
be your boyfriend.

596
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,270
I wish you were here with me.

597
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,100
It’d be so nice to go to the beach together for once.

598
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,280
We’d be so lovey-dovey,

599
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,700
everyone else would choke on our sweetness.

600
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,210
Time to hang up, Mon.

601
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,800
We’re dragging him into the water.

602
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,500
Good.

603
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,200
We’ve been talking so long, my battery’s dying.

604
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,180
Have fun for me, guys.

605
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,300
Okay, bye-bye.

606
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,300
- Hey! Tar!
- Let’s go.

607
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,110
Your time with your boyfriend is up, buddy.

608
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,110
Time to hit the water.

609
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,710
(Though the trouble has been resolved,)

610
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,800
(we’re still in Pattaya next week.)

611
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,300
(Mon’s even joining us.)

612
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,490
We’d be so lovey-dovey,

613
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,890
everyone else would choke on our sweetness.

614
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,020
(It sounds fun already.)

615
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,150
It’s nice to see the students
spending time together like this, Mr. Nut.

616
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:31,200
(Let’s see which couple can make
the ocean water sweeter with their love.)
