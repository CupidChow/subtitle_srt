1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
Let’s go, Team Green!

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,170
It’s good that your boyfriend
cares about decorating the stands.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,290
But mine?

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,710
He’s all in on canceling Sports Day.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,480
From now on,

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,900
whatever you think, just say it.

7
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,630
You don’t have to
force yourself to think like me.

8
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,670
Okay then.

9
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,780
Thanks for making something
I always took for granted…

10
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,070
feel meaningful.

11
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:22,980
Thank you.

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,250
Then you’re not the only one
who should say thanks.

13
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,650
Ah…

14
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,060
You don’t know how to eat?

15
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,720
I want you to feed me.

16
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,440
Ah…

17
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,860
Feed me.

18
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,930
So proud of your Sports Day prize?

19
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,970
Why don’t you cuddle it tonight?

20
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,460
Why?

21
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,900
Are you jealous?

22
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,829
What kind of person gets
jealous over a box of wafer sticks?

23
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,190
A cute person.

24
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,190
Have you thought about
what to study in university?

25
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,190
It’s about time to enroll.

26
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,700
I like drawing cartoons.

27
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,300
So I guess I’ll go with
something related to that.

28
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,820
Do some research.

29
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,050
Check what they look for
besides drawing skills.

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,050
I’ll tutor you if I can.

31
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,260
Enough about me.

32
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,510
Isn’t your scholarship announcement
coming out tonight?

33
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,290
How do you know?

34
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,810
I saw the schedule on the board in your room.

35
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,240
Mm.

36
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,990
Are you excited?

37
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,390
Everyone else already got excited for me.

38
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,660
HOW IS IT?

39
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,660
HAS IT BEEN ANNOUNCED YET?

40
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,350
THE OTHER APPLICANTS
KNOW THE RESULT?

41
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,750
IT’S LATER THAN USUAL.

42
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,420
Traffic’s still bad.

43
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,210
I’ll get home really late at this rate.

44
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,300
Tan.

45
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,740
Tan.

46
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,340
Yeah?

47
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,130
What are you doing?

48
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,560
It’s Shane’s scholarship announcement today.

49
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,660
I’m worried about him.

50
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,060
He must be super nervous right now.

51
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,870
I need to support him, mentally.

52
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,030
Okay.

53
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,110
How about we grab
something to eat around here?

54
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,820
By the time I get home, all the
restaurants near me will be closed.

55
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,420
Why don’t you just stay over at my place?

56
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,420
It’s nearby.

57
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,810
You don’t have a parking spot.

58
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,210
I can’t stay over.

59
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,500
Why don’t you stay at my place instead?

60
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,180
I don’t want to bother your mom.

61
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,659
I’m still kind of awkward around her.

62
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,890
You staying over at mine is just easier.

63
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,550
So many problems.

64
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,820
Why don’t we just find
a new place and move in together?

65
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,810
That’d solve everything.

66
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,940
Well? What do you think?

67
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,500
It’s out!

68
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,120
Hold that thought.

69
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,060
I’m calling Shane.

70
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,820
Yes, sir.

71
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,870
I’ll check now.

72
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,080
It’s out?

73
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,040
Mm.

74
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,510
Can you give me a moment?

75
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,460
I want to look at it alone.

76
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,680
Sure.

77
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,860
I’ll wait downstairs.

78
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:54,760
Mhm.

79
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,540
How did it go?

80
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,340
I…

81
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,360
I didn’t get the scholarship.

82
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,810
Looks like I’ll be going to
the same university as you.

83
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,260
You don’t have to walk me home.

84
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,230
It’s late.

85
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,220
Yeah, it is late.

86
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,470
That’s why I need to take you home.

87
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,830
I’d always told myself

88
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,230
if I ever had someone,

89
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,280
I’d take the best care of them.

90
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,850
You talk like I’m your first partner.

91
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,740
You are.

92
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,300
You’re my first partner

93
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,700
and…

94
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,220
my first kiss.

95
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,120
It’s nice to share our firsts like this.

96
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,060
It feels really special.

97
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,190
Actually… you’re not my first partner.

98
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,490
But I’m your first kiss, right?

99
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,150
Do you want me to stay over?

100
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,550
You can go home.

101
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,880
Really, I’m okay.

102
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,720
Mhm.

103
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,850
I’m taking off then.

104
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,980
I’ll let you know when I get home.

105
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,860
Mm. Get home safe.

106
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:37,020
GO STUDY ABROAD!!

107
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,900
So... the results are out.

108
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,890
I didn’t get the scholarship.

109
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,860
Stop making those sad faces.

110
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,540
Let’s get back to normal.

111
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,340
Alright, back to normal?

112
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,030
Do you guys think Mon—

113
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,180
- Jeez!
- Seriously?

114
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,420
I swear I’m gonna smack you.

115
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,180
Mon this, Mon that, are you okay, dude?

116
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,820
Stop it already.

117
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,150
- I don’t like you.
- I don’t like you either.

118
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,380
Shane’s really something.

119
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,170
If I were him, I’d be crying for a whole week.

120
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,340
He worked hard for that scholarship for years,

121
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,050
and now it’s just over, just like that.

122
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Maybe Shane prepared himself for it.

123
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,800
That’s why he doesn’t seem so down.

124
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,560
It’s good that he got a chance to prepare.

125
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,710
When we’re prepared for disappointment,

126
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,930
it makes it easier
to deal with whatever happens.

127
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,260
Is something wrong, Kim?

128
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,730
No, nothing is wrong.

129
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,580
I’m just saying.

130
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,430
If you want to ask me something, just ask.

131
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,590
Then… can I ask you something?

132
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,970
Sure.

133
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,000
What was your ex like?

134
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,830
What exactly do you want to know?

135
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,220
Why did you guys break up?

136
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,080
We weren’t compatible.

137
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,560
Things were better
when we were just friends.

138
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,860
Really?

139
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,480
So you guys were friends first?

140
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,340
What was your ex like?

141
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,580
Taller or shorter than me?

142
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,740
Had lots of friends?

143
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,060
Popular at school?

144
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,400
Quiet? Funny?

145
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,730
And how spicy could your ex eat?

146
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,320
You’re taller.

147
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,590
My ex was pretty popular, though.

148
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,960
Lots of friends.

149
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,860
Quiet around people they weren’t close to,

150
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,420
but funny once you got to know them

151
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,520
And yeah, could handle spicy food.

152
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,600
Who’s more handsome, your ex or me?

153
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,610
Come on, tell me.

154
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,870
Who’s more handsome?

155
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,890
You’re more handsome.

156
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,610
Aw, Mon.

157
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
I knew it.

158
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,580
Because my ex was a girl.

159
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,770
What?!

160
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,860
Help me shoot.

161
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,380
THE 10 MOST POPULAR MAJORS IN 2025

162
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,500
What are you watching?

163
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,390
You’ve been watching it all day.

164
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,460
I’m done.

165
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,850
Come on. I’m really playing now.

166
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,800
Let’s go.

167
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,950
Tap the card.

168
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,850
Shoot!

169
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,850
It’s coming this way!

170
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,140
Right there!

171
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,870
It’s close.

172
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,700
It’s knocked down.

173
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,300
Keep it up!

174
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,440
- Do you think we’ll win?
- We’re almost there.

175
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,220
Shoot its eyes.

176
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,870
Yay!

177
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,710
This is so much fun.

178
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,180
You think I should major in game design?

179
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,060
Huh?

180
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,200
Which universities offer that?

181
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,710
What the hell?

182
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,119
Just because I have a camera doesn’t mean
I volunteered to be in charge of the yearbook.

183
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,670
You’re acting like
you’re making the whole book.

184
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,170
They just asked you to take photos.

185
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,859
Take photos and fill out
the student interest forms.

186
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,450
And what the hell
are you sitting there for, Kim?

187
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,030
You’re just crowding the space.

188
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,750
Shouldn’t you be with Mon right now?

189
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,520
Guys, I just found out Mon’s ex is a girl.

190
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,880
What’s strange about that?

191
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,540
I’m wondering if
Mon likes me the same way I like him.

192
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,810
What if he prefers girls?

193
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,830
What if he dumps me later?

194
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,380
Has he ever shown any
interest in girls while dating you?

195
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,150
It’s about to rain.

196
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,150
How about you take my umbrella?

197
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,780
What about you?

198
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,080
I’m good. You can take it.

199
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,580
Thanks.

200
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,770
Yes! Many times!

201
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,300
Kim.

202
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,370
This stuff happens.

203
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,300
People sometimes
don’t know what they really want.

204
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,780
They’re still figuring it out.

205
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,450
Maybe that’s what Mon’s going through.

206
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,910
No! I’m not letting him figure it out.

207
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,200
What if he figures out it’s not me?

208
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,840
Why would you say that?

209
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,790
And why did you slap me?

210
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,270
Look at your friend there.

211
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,860
There, there.

212
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,460
Then why are you laughing?

213
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,330
I’m not.

214
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,800
Aw, poor boy.

215
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,230
I’ve worked as a tutor before,

216
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,860
and I think I did a pretty good job.

217
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,180
It all comes down to
what you really want, Shane.

218
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,340
Stability? Good benefits?

219
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,570
Or giving back to society?

220
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,390
If that’s what you’re after,

221
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,590
being a teacher might be the right path.

222
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,430
It’s not that good, though.

223
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,870
The benefits mostly kick in
when you’re sick or retired.

224
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,480
But day-to-day life is hella tough.

225
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,080
One thing I like about it is

226
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,050
getting to watch your students grow.

227
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,540
That’s a pretty special experience.

228
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,260
Thank you, sir.

229
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,750
I think I’ll enroll in the Faculty of Education.

230
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,870
- What?
- What?

231
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,220
Slow down.

232
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,190
You don’t have to decide right now.

233
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,520
Thank you, sir.

234
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,510
We’ll be going now.

235
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,830
Come on.

236
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,800
What’s the matter?

237
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,090
Were you serious about
the Faculty of Education?

238
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,740
Do you think I’d make a good teacher?

239
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,220
You definitely would.

240
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,610
NEXT STOP: CHONG NONSI

241
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,700
NOW ARRIVING: CHONG NONSI

242
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,090
Come on, hurry up!

243
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,590
Think we’ll get seats? It’s packed.

244
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,600
Over here.

245
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,900
Two seats—perfect.

246
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,670
Nice. The aircon’s working.

247
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,830
So good.

248
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,150
Hey, did you turn in the assignment?

249
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,870
What assignment?

250
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,160
The one the instructor just gave us.

251
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,170
You’re acting like you already did it.

252
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,740
Excuse me.

253
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,760
Are you guys engineering students?

254
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,700
We are.

255
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,060
Is it hard to get in?

256
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,740
Pretty hard.

257
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,420
Are you interested?

258
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,770
Yes, I am.

259
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,900
What year are you in?

260
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,840
Grade 12.

261
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,750
I think a little to the left.

262
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,130
Your left or mine?

263
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,940
My left.

264
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,460
A bit to the right.

265
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,370
My right, yes.

266
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,160
Okay.

267
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,480
Still not quite right.

268
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,750
Left.

269
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,100
Move a bit right.

270
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,540
Look straight ahead.

271
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,460
I’m looking straight.

272
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,860
Can you make a better face?

273
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,840
Above his head and his hips…

274
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,050
I think this is it.

275
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,950
Yeah.

276
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,010
Got it!

277
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,850
Very nice.

278
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,610
That’s the exact same spot.

279
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,730
I don’t think so.

280
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,830
It’s the best angle here.

281
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,680
You’d better speed up.

282
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,900
There are eight classes,

283
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,860
and it’s already been two days.

284
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,260
You’ve only done half of one class.

285
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,380
Look at everyone still waiting.

286
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,940
Hey, I have to be precise.

287
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,800
This is my portfolio.

288
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,890
Can we start now?

289
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:15,870
Alright.

290
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,500
Done.

291
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,260
It’s great.

292
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,100
Very nice.

293
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,190
Per, I need to pee.

294
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,440
Seat the next one and wait for me.

295
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,620
I’ll be right back.

296
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,000
All good. Next.

297
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,100
Next, please.

298
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,120
It’s done.

299
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,650
Done.

300
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,110
What?

301
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,500
Did I close my eyes?

302
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,960
It’s done. Go.

303
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,100
Next.

304
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,160
Hurry up.

305
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,600
Done. Next.

306
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,020
Come on.

307
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,730
Good.

308
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,230
You got it.

309
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,470
Chop-chop, guys.

310
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,350
Hi, sit down. Quick.

311
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,030
Nice.

312
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,990
Great.

313
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,980
Next.

314
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,340
Line up, guys.

315
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,920
Got it.

316
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,860
Thank you.

317
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,470
Great.

318
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,020
Done.

319
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,870
Next one.

320
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,520
Done.

321
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:13,980
You look great.

322
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:14,900
Don’t worry.

323
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,520
Next.

324
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,620
Great. We got it.

325
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,350
Kim.

326
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,520
Mon.

327
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Wanna catch a movie?

328
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,010
Or we can do whatever you want.

329
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,610
I’m good with anything.

330
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
I’m meeting some friends for a meal.

331
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,160
I told you already.

332
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,960
Ah, right.

333
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,560
So…

334
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,900
what friends are they again?

335
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,900
Friends from my old school,
here to hang out in Bangkok.

336
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,900
Do you want me to come with you?

337
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,260
I can, if you want.

338
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,160
That’s alright.

339
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,540
I’ll just go with them.

340
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,590
I’m heading out now.

341
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,590
See you later.

342
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:42,930
Bye.

343
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,330
Hey, where is everybody?

344
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,850
Photoshoot’s done.

345
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,190
What?!

346
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,390
You already took everyone’s photos?

347
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,130
You rushed it, didn’t you?

348
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,130
What if we need to retake them?

349
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,270
Gosh! Let me see.

350
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,700
Hey, these actually look great.

351
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,700
Yeah.

352
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,850
It’s just you and me now.

353
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,100
We’ll take turns.

354
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,690
Go sit. I’ll shoot yours first.

355
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,590
Okay.

356
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,740
Done.

357
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,160
Hey, you didn’t even count!

358
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,650
Did you do that on purpose?

359
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,440
Let me see.

360
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,380
Aw, I look pretty good.

361
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,040
That’s what happens
when you’ve got a great model.

362
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,500
I gave you a great shot.
It’s your turn to do the same for me.

363
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,220
Sure.

364
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,900
I will do my best.

365
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,640
Go sit.

366
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,820
Handsome shot, huh?

367
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,660
I think you should… turn to the side a bit.

368
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,740
More.

369
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,820
More. A lot more.

370
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,560
More. Trust me.

371
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,350
Keep going.

372
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,780
Go on.

373
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,020
More.

374
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,520
Now turn your face too.

375
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,290
Yes.

376
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,770
Now, that’s handsome

377
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,720
Super handsome.

378
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,070
You’re totally messing with me.

379
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,560
Do it properly.

380
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:50,980
Tar, you asshole.

381
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,100
So hot.

382
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,280
What are you doing?

383
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,380
Don’t touch me.

384
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,440
Don’t touch me.

385
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,820
Leave me alone.

386
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,340
Is the Faculty of Science hard?

387
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,450
It’s actually not that hard.

388
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,780
It depends.

389
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,850
Do you like it?

390
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,160
If you do, you’ll probably enjoy it.

391
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,780
I like doing scientific experiments.

392
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,460
Great. There are tons of lab sessions.

393
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,140
It’ll be a good fit for you.

394
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:22,690
Shane.

395
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,170
Hey, Kit.

396
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,230
This is Jane.

397
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,550
She’s from the Faculty of Science.

398
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,980
Hi.

399
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,140
Hi, there.

400
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,910
So, how many more people
are you going to consult?

401
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,900
This is the last one.

402
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,680
She might be able to give me the answer.

403
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,940
So, did you prepare your questions?

404
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,910
I did.

405
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:43,750
Okay.

406
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,830
No need to rush.

407
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,530
If anything I say isn’t clear,
feel free to ask more.

408
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,860
Got it.

409
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,090
Let’s begin then.

410
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,440
What?

411
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,440
Shh!

412
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:36,830
The cards show that
you’ve just broken free from something

413
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,860
and you’re starting fresh.

414
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,180
That’s actually a good sign

415
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,520
but…

416
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,440
but there’s still a variable,
and new options coming your way.

417
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,310
Anyway, you’re someone
with a wide range of abilities.

418
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,500
It all depends on the path you choose.

419
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,730
Wow, that’s so accurate.

420
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,860
Okay, next question.

421
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,490
Is it okay if I enroll in
the Faculty of Education?

422
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,920
Interesting.

423
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,300
If you’re asking whether
it’s okay, the cards say yes.

424
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,520
But it feels like there’s still
something weighing on your mind.

425
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,870
You’re interested in other things too, right?

426
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,040
What if I study game design?

427
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,600
Great!

428
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,120
But it’s exhausting.

429
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,340
It doesn’t pay really well,

430
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:41,150
and you’d still have a lot to learn.

431
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,170
Are you sure this is okay?

432
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,740
Maybe we should just
talk to the student counselors.

433
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,490
Kit, don’t interrupt.

434
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,980
I need to focus.

435
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,370
What if I go to med school?

436
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,380
Do you want to be
an obstetrician or a surgeon?

437
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,450
Be more specific.

438
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,870
Do you want this one?

439
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,380
450 baht?

440
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,580
Okay, let’s go for it.

441
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,620
So, this one and this one.

442
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:26,900
Thank you.

443
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:27,440
Let’s go.

444
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,440
Insert your fingers and just throw it.

445
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
First finger, second finger.

446
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,480
What about the Faculty of Fisheries?

447
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,600
Is it a good choice?

448
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,660
Bad idea.

449
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,460
Don’t go for it.

450
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,650
Can you answer the phone for me?

451
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,340
Just do it. I’m having my fortune told here.

452
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,380
Hello, Shane.

453
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,780
Mon’s playing bowling with his ex.

454
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,780
He’s even teaching her how to play.

455
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,900
Do you think that’s normal?

456
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,320
It’s Kit here.

457
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,290
What?

458
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,110
Shane’s in the middle of something.

459
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,350
He told me to take your call.

460
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,700
Well then, Kit.

461
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,550
I followed him here not because
I thought he’d cheat or anything,

462
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,360
but when I found out he dated a girl before,

463
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,990
I started feeling like
maybe I don’t really know him.

464
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,780
So now I’m not sure how serious he is
or if I’m even good enough for him.

465
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,370
This is scary. I feel insecure.

466
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,880
Hello?

467
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:00,940
Hello?

468
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,500
Just keep on fighting, dude.

469
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,420
Hello? Wait!

470
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,140
What?

471
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,160
Fighting what?

472
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,900
Fighting who?

473
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:11,840
Ow!

474
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,230
Shit!

475
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,590
Did you follow me?

476
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,200
How long have you been standing here?

477
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,860
What did you hear?

478
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,370
Everything.

479
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,590
If you’re this worried, why didn’t you tell me?

480
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:42,740
I was afraid it’d sound silly.

481
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,850
So you decided to spy on me instead?

482
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,120
I’m sorry, Mon.

483
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,250
It’s not that I don’t trust you.

484
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,030
I’m just scared.

485
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,260
Scared I’ll only be your boyfriend
while you’re at an all-boys school.

486
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,550
Scared this is all happening
because you’re confused.

487
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,260
Don’t be afraid, Kim.

488
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:26,920
I’m sure I’m not confused.

489
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,219
Come.

490
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,280
Get inside together.

491
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,870
Come on.

492
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,180
Guys.

493
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,530
This is Kim,

494
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,870
my boyfriend.

495
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,610
Hi, Kim.

496
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,570
Mon, you can do it.

497
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,210
Score the same as them.

498
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,870
Yay!

499
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:37,470
Strike!

500
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,450
Well done!

501
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,220
Am I doing it right?

502
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,490
Strike! Strike!

503
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,660
Let me pick one for you this time.

504
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,330
This last card says
the career that suits you best is...

505
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,000
an actor!

506
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,670
Trust me, go into showbiz.

507
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,860
You’ve got that vibe.

508
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,500
You don’t even have to study. Just go for it.

509
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,190
You’ll be rich.

510
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,880
You’re right.

511
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,700
I hadn’t thought about that.

512
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,440
Jeez, enough already!

513
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,870
Shane.

514
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,220
What?

515
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:47,960
Come with me.

516
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,010
Where?

517
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,990
Just come.

518
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,520
- I know a modeling agency.
- Give me their contact.

519
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,900
What are you doing?

520
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,360
Just come with me.

521
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,500
What’s wrong with you?

522
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,950
I’m not done talking to her.

523
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,370
No, what’s wrong with you?

524
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,100
What are you even doing?

525
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,900
Tell me honestly.

526
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,700
You don’t have a backup plan
if you don’t get the scholarship, do you?

527
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,620
Shane.

528
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,260
Tell me.

529
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
What are you feeling right now?

530
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,750
What are you thinking?

531
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,410
Can you please tell me?

532
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,620
What are you scared of or worried about?

533
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,780
You don’t have to act tough.

534
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,330
You can tell me anything.

535
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,730
You can talk to me.

536
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,890
I’m so damn stupid.

537
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:33,130
I did prepare myself
in case I didn’t get the scholarship,

538
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,860
but now that I actually didn’t,

539
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,710
I honestly don’t know
what I want if not that scholarship.

540
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,580
And now there are only
a few months left until we have to apply.

541
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,600
It’s like all my goals just disappeared.

542
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,620
I don’t know what to do anymore.

543
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,300
I get it.

544
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,300
You’ve done great, Shane.

545
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,180
You gave it your best.

546
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,150
From now on,

547
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,090
let’s figure out what you really want together.

548
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,940
I will help you.

549
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,190
I will help you with everything.

550
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,020
Trust me.

551
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,020
We still have time.

552
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,590
It’s not like you just started
studying for university today.

553
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,510
Actually, it feels like
you’ve been preparing your whole life for it.

554
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,760
You’re going to get into a nice uni for sure.

555
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,980
You’re more reliable than I thought.

556
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,660
Of course.

557
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:19,620
I’m definitely better than you
at handling disappointment.

558
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,300
I like it here.

559
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,020
It’s spacious.

560
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,840
But you prefer a house, right?

561
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:18,580
I knew we’d like different things.

562
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,860
That’s why I asked
someone to be our decider.

563
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,100
Who?

564
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,520
Here she is.

565
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,190
Of course.

566
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:51,290
I’m definitely better than you
at handling disappointment.

567
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,480
But there’s one thing
I want to see if you’re better at than me.

568
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:57,820
What’s that?

569
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,060
Swimming!

570
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,110
Shane!

571
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,150
Don’t!

572
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:49,180
(In the next episode,
my friends and I visit a university open house.)

573
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,420
Are you ready, Mon?

574
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,870
(But it looks like there’s a problem.)

575
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,460
You said no matter what,
we’d talk things out honestly.

576
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:00,410
So, are you applying to an art college or not?

577
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,230
I’m not sure if I should go.

578
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:07,000
(Let’s see what paths we choose for our future.)

579
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,300
You did so well!
