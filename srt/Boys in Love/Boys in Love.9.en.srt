1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,250
Do you regret having me as your first kiss?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,770
Better you than some
random stranger at a party.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,420
Maybe I just wasn’t
good enough to earn the title.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,010
But you’re good enough for something else.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,880
At least for me.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,430
I’m heading home now.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,430
No one is home today.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,000
Don’t you want to keep me company?

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,250
Do you want me to stay?

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,010
Mhm.

11
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:47,310
KIT
Boo!

12
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,050
SPORTS DAY 2025

13
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,350
This year’s Sports Day
is going to be the most fun yet.

14
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,400
I think it’s the same every year.

15
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,829
It’s not.

16
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,720
I can feel this one’s going to be extra fun.

17
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,050
Why are you counting coins?

18
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:48,710
Hey, hey.

19
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,490
Can you give me a hand?

20
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:51,870
It’s falling off.

21
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,880
You’ve got it, Mr. Tan.

22
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,910
If you’re not helping, don’t talk.

23
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,910
Whoa.

24
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,590
Alright, Class 1 and Class 8
are on Team Green this year.

25
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,150
Here are your team shirts. Make sure to
grab one for each of your classmates.

26
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,510
Work together to assign your Sports Day duties and don’t forget to sign your name.

27
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,630
Now, come up and take your shirts.

28
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,810
Sir, do you know what team Class 4 is on?

29
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,820
- Team Red.
- Thank you.

30
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,850
Per, can you handle assigning
the athletes for this year’s sports?

31
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,020
Gosh, same job every year.

32
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,670
What?

33
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,950
Class 8, come up and grab your shirts!

34
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,130
Quick.

35
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,260
Bring some for your friends.

36
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,370
Okay, sir.

37
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,860
You’ve got a pretty decent build.

38
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,620
Well, obviously.

39
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,620
Hey, Kim.

40
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,710
What the heck?

41
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,120
Just take it.

42
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,810
Mon, where are you?

43
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,010
Inside the building.

44
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,460
I’m starting a petition to cancel Sports Day.

45
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,040
What?

46
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,150
You want to cancel Sports Day? Why?

47
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,890
I don’t see how anyone benefits from it.

48
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,760
It’s a hassle, wastes time, and wastes money.

49
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,190
Total nonsense.

50
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,850
I gotta go, Kim.

51
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,440
Let’s cancel Sports Day, everyone!

52
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,010
Register here!

53
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,030
Sign your name if you’re against it.

54
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,180
Please register.

55
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,320
If you don’t want Sports Day,
put your name down!

56
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,160
I’d like you all to share any

57
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,130
bad experiences you’ve had with Sports Day.

58
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,320
My whole class banned me

59
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,490
just because I couldn’t afford
to rent a costume for the parade.

60
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,270
I’m hot, so I got picked to be a cheerleader.

61
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,670
I had to practice like crazy.

62
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,670
I ended up breaking up
with my partner because of it.

63
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,850
They made me play football.

64
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,850
Guys, I hate football.

65
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,880
Worse, they stuck me in as the goalkeeper.

66
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,530
I let in 17 goals.

67
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,060
People still tease me about it to this day.

68
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,230
Students in 11th or 12th grade,
who are about to enter university,

69
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,909
should be spending
their time studying or relaxing,

70
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,360
not practicing cheer routines or decorating stands for some meaningless school event.

71
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,660
It just doesn’t make sense to me.

72
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,270
Mm. I agree.

73
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,970
What about you, Kim?

74
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,030
Anything to share?

75
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,360
Uh…

76
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,390
Well, I just don’t like Sports Day.

77
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,470
No, I mean, I actually hate it.

78
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,100
I don’t think it’s cool at all.

79
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,890
Wearing the same color shirts? It’s just silly.

80
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,659
Ridiculous, right?

81
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,740
Since we started the petition,

82
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,210
the hashtag #CancelSportsDay
has been used over ten thousand times.

83
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,320
And our page keeps gaining followers.

84
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,930
Why don’t we post something
to keep the trend alive?

85
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,360
Like, “Sports Day nowadays
is fake and superficial.”

86
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,260
Are you sure? Isn’t that a bit too harsh?

87
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,500
If anything, it’s too polite.

88
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,320
True. Post it now.

89
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,120
Sure.

90
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,460
You asked to see me.
What can I do for you, sir?

91
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,420
That ‘R’ in Grade 10 Math,
why haven’t you fixed it?

92
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,520
RESUBMIT

93
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,980
Whoa…

94
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,940
I don’t remember, sir.

95
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,320
You must fix that ‘R’ no matter what.

96
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,320
Otherwise, you won’t be able to graduate.

97
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,800
And your Grade 10 Math teacher
has already resigned.

98
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,270
Do you remember
which assignments you didn’t submit?

99
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,659
Sir, I honestly didn’t even know I got an ‘R.’

100
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,210
Here’s what we’ll do.

101
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,570
You’ll work on
the cheering stands to make up for it.

102
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,460
Me?

103
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,890
Per, I’m done.

104
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,520
No more running.

105
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,890
Just let me go.

106
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,290
I don’t want to run anymore.

107
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,630
No!

108
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,600
You can’t quit.

109
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,750
Your time’s still not good enough.

110
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,400
Why’d you put me in the race, huh?

111
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,260
I never wanted to run.

112
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,680
We’re short on members.

113
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,200
Each team needs four runners.

114
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,840
And why do I have to be one of them?

115
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,650
Because we couldn’t get
enough people to sign up.

116
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,169
Your name was the only one I could think of.

117
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,590
Look! What’s that?

118
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,270
Tar, you jackass.

119
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,090
Leave me alone.

120
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,780
Tar!

121
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,880
I’m not running.

122
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,260
You’re running now.

123
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,150
Yeah, running away from you!

124
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,850
Leave me alone!

125
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,420
Don’t touch me. I’m not running.

126
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,350
Ouch!

127
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,480
Hey, Per!

128
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,690
Your ankle’s swollen.

129
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,900
I think you should go to
the hospital for an X-ray.

130
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,280
See? This is because
you’re forcing me into sport.

131
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,710
Karma came back so fast, it’s like 5G!.

132
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,870
Should I call your family
to take you to the hospital?

133
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,840
What do you want to do?

134
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,000
No need, sir.

135
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,430
My friend will take me.

136
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,050
What? Me?

137
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,250
Yes, you must take me.

138
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,240
No way.

139
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,960
You’re responsible. You take me.

140
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,950
You caused this injury.

141
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,100
How are we even getting there?

142
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,790
Figure it out yourself.

143
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,800
Will you stay still?

144
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,800
I’m afraid you’ll fall.

145
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,770
You’re the one making me fall!

146
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:43,690
Hey!

147
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,520
Ouch!

148
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,260
Aren’t you an athlete?
Take better care of yourself.

149
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
This is on you.

150
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,150
Are you okay?

151
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,470
Ow! Sorry!

152
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,050
Get up.

153
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,060
Alright, be still.

154
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:57,530
Okay.

155
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,810
I’ll lead, you follow.

156
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,750
Okay.

157
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,650
What are you doing?

158
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,090
Ouch!

159
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,830
Ow!

160
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,080
Ow!

161
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,530
Jeez!

162
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,810
Just call an ambulance.

163
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,670
What the hell?

164
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,670
Why are you so into violence?

165
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,670
Damn it.

166
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,850
You’re heavy as hell.

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,730
If you’d done this from the beginning,
we’d be there by now.

168
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,340
Stop talking, jerk.

169
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,530
I don’t feel heavy at all.

170
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,450
I do!

171
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,450
Tar, you got this.

172
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,540
You can do this.

173
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,490
Go on, Tar!

174
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,860
Tar, you’re so strong.

175
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,370
Ugh.

176
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,850
Are you ever going to finish it in this lifetime?

177
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,510
You keep drawing and erasing.

178
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,020
When will it be done?

179
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,430
I don’t want to do this anymore.

180
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,130
I’m out of ideas.

181
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,630
Just keep going.

182
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,830
Didn’t Mr. Tan say it doesn’t
have to be perfect, just finished?

183
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,340
If you don’t fix that ‘R,’ you won’t graduate.

184
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,480
Yeah, I know that.

185
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,880
But my mind’s completely blank.

186
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,520
Whatever.

187
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,610
If you don’t finish,
I’m not talking to you tomorrow.

188
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,810
Hey!

189
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,350
What?

190
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,040
Just hurry up.

191
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,100
Come on.

192
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,660
Geez, you’re mean.

193
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,580
If I finish, can I get a reward?

194
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,280
Nope.

195
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,710
Come on.

196
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,920
You’re cruel.

197
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,990
Just speed it up.

198
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,360
I am.

199
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,770
Ugh, I’m tired.

200
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,390
Shane, have you seen Kit?

201
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,900
We planned to work on the stands today.

202
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,990
He still hasn’t turned in the draft.

203
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,640
But he said he already handed it in, sir.

204
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,840
I haven’t seen anything.

205
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,650
I’m here! I’m here!

206
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,860
I’m here. Hold on.

207
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,950
Here it is, sir, the design for the stands.

208
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,350
Wow.

209
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,530
This is impressive, Kit.

210
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,880
It’s beyond what I expected.

211
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,530
But… are you guys sure
you can build it yourselves?

212
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,360
The school doesn’t allow outsourcing.

213
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,070
We can, sir.

214
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,530
I’ve planned everything.

215
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,510
I’ll take charge of the stands.

216
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,400
I was right about you.

217
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,890
I could see your real talent.

218
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,770
You’re not a good-for-nothing
people say you are.

219
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,080
You’re my crown diamond.

220
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,430
Win first prize, guys!

221
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,260
Sure, sir.

222
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:09,910
I’ve got to go now.

223
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,270
The principal wants to see me.

224
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,250
Bye, guys. See you.

225
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,120
- Take care of each other.
- Yes, sir.

226
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,470
Win that first prize.

227
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,640
All right, guys.

228
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,390
Today, we start with
the structure and the papier-mâché

229
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,590
Who can handle the tail?

230
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,660
I can.

231
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,290
Great. You’re in charge of that part.

232
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,110
What about the head?

233
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,910
Okay.

234
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,130
And the rocks on both sides,
who’s taking that?

235
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,910
I’ll do it.

236
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,550
Okay, sure.

237
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,720
I’ll help you.

238
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,920
Let’s boost the energy a bit.

239
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,120
Come on.

240
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,200
Ready?

241
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,400
Three, two, one.

242
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,430
Let’s go, Team Green!

243
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,290
This is easy.

244
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,040
Be careful.

245
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,510
Oh, thanks.

246
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,880
Let’s do brown here.

247
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,300
Hey!

248
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,990
Yeah!

249
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,660
Continue working!

250
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,860
It’s prettier this way, huh?

251
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,620
You should get it too.

252
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,200
My turn.

253
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,600
Oh, it’s my hand.

254
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,220
Jeez, the glue.

255
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,890
CANCEL SPORTS DAY

256
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,040
CANCEL SPORTS DAY

257
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,090
SPORTS DAY IS FOR RICH KIDS
WE DON’T WANT SPORTS DAY

258
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,210
SPORTS DAY PROMOTES BEAUTY PRIVILEGE
NO SPORTS DAY
WE DON’T WANT SPORTS DAY

259
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,320
WE DON’T WANT SPORTS DAY

260
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,510
Hello.

261
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,370
Please inform all janitors
to remove every flyer.

262
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,370
Make sure none are left on any boards.

263
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,670
Thank you.

264
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,670
I don’t like Sports Day.

265
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,990
I don’t like Sports Day.

266
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,380
I don’t like Sports Day.

267
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,250
I don’t like Sports Day.

268
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,800
I don’t like Sports Day.

269
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,880
Is the vinyl banner done?

270
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,990
It’s done.

271
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,120
Hey, Kim.

272
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,670
Perfect timing.

273
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,460
We’re just discussing our top-secret plan.

274
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,230
There’s a plan?

275
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,800
On the day the principal
officially opens the event,

276
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,710
we’ll drop the anti-Sports Day banner
from the third floor.

277
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,050
On opening day?

278
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,900
Isn’t that too big of a deal?

279
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,900
Oh, we’re going big.

280
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,260
So this plan can’t reach the teachers.

281
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,510
Too late.

282
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,880
I heard everything.

283
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,319
And don’t bother with excuses.

284
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:28,910
Someone’s already confessed
that your club is behind this mess.

285
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,170
Sorry.

286
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,050
I just got accepted
through the university quota.

287
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,730
I don’t want my parents getting called in.

288
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,880
Mon, do you even realize what you’re doing?

289
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,870
You’re the son of a Student Welfare teacher.

290
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,670
Why are you stirring up
trouble about Sports Day?

291
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,210
I’m not stirring anything.

292
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,080
No one wants Sports Day anymore, Mom.

293
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,360
It’s nonsense.

294
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,160
If you don’t believe me,
just check the vote results online.

295
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,600
CANCEL SPORTS DAY – 82%
CONTINUE SPORTS DAY – 18%

296
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,410
Please. It’s your poll, your voters.

297
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,880
It doesn’t prove anything.

298
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,960
How do we even know
those votes are from real students?

299
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,320
May I ask you a serious question?

300
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,990
What’s the purpose of this activity?

301
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,330
Sports Day is held every year.

302
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,130
It’s tradition.

303
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,750
There’s never been a problem.

304
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,870
Has it really been no problem,
or have you just turned a blind eye?

305
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,450
Well, I think—

306
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,000
Save it, Mr. Nut.

307
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,790
I didn’t ask you here to share your opinion.

308
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,030
What? Then why did you call me here?

309
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,380
To yell at you.

310
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,310
Do you have any idea what damage
your club members have caused?

311
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,940
Or maybe… you’re in on it?

312
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,460
Mr. Nut had nothing to do with it.

313
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,460
My friends and I are the ones responsible.

314
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,280
But you’ve been using the club room.

315
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,150
You should’ve told me.

316
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,970
But you agree with me, don’t you?

317
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,510
That I have the right to voice
my opinion about this pointless Sports Day?

318
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,970
It’s not just voicing an opinion anymore.

319
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,110
You’re causing chaos and inciting others.

320
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,710
I have every right to punish all of you.

321
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,330
If we’re being punished
for speaking our minds,

322
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,400
then go ahead, ma’am.

323
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,380
You’re the one with power.

324
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,610
Mon!

325
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,260
Why don’t we do this?

326
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,310
Let’s hold a proper debate
and solve this peacefully.

327
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,610
If you believe lots of people
feel the same as you do,

328
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:53,100
then prove it that way.

329
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:00,230
Most students want Sports Day to happen.

330
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,780
If you’re so sure,

331
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,290
then let’s vote on debate day.

332
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,290
Let’s decide if we should still have it this year.

333
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,210
Fine.

334
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,150
We will see about that.

335
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,660
Is it okay?

336
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,810
Don’t drop it.

337
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,560
A little to the left.

338
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,970
Okay. You got it.

339
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,390
How’s the color?

340
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,100
We can add more vines.

341
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,500
Guys, Mr. Tan told me to bring some milk,

342
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,610
in case you guys are hungry.

343
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,910
Can I have one too?

344
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,010
Grab me one.

345
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,270
Kit is taking this seriously.

346
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,680
Right.

347
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,880
It’s the first time I’ve seen him this serious.

348
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,300
Tell me honestly.

349
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,150
Do you think he’s overdoing it?

350
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,000
Come on.

351
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,580
It’s good that your boyfriend
cares about decorating the stands.

352
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,130
But mine?

353
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,120
He’s all in on canceling Sports Day.

354
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,980
And right now,
it’s a full-on war between him and his mom.

355
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,150
So, what are you going to do?

356
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,400
What can I do?

357
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,310
In the end, you have to
support your partner, right?

358
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,220
How’s it going?

359
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,980
Are you tired?

360
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,310
Totally drained.

361
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,540
No more energy.

362
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,900
I need someone to cling to right now.

363
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,910
Then drink this.

364
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,600
An energy boost for you.

365
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,850
My hands are all messy.

366
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,380
Well?

367
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,620
More energized now?

368
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,250
Physically, yeah.

369
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,790
But I still need an emotional boost.

370
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,600
Can you help with that?

371
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,530
Fully charged now.

372
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,060
Hey, Kim.

373
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,450
I mixed the colors for you.

374
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,300
Use this.

375
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,040
Thanks.

376
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,270
No problem.

377
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,090
Right here, too.

378
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,320
Okay.

379
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,160
Done.

380
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,650
Anywhere else?

381
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,890
Here.

382
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:52,840
There?

383
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,200
Here?

384
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,630
Hey, not here.

385
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,490
Right there.

386
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,630
MRS. PAAN

387
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,070
Yes, ma’am?

388
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,710
Kim, could you come by for a quick chat?

389
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,760
Sure, ma’am.

390
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,170
There’s a debate this evening
about whether we should have Sports Day.

391
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,920
After that, we will vote on it.

392
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,350
Don’t forget to vote.

393
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,330
KIM

394
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,330
Swing by and make your voice heard.

395
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,650
Be sure to vote this evening.

396
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,480
Thank you.

397
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,850
DEBATE TOPIC: SPORTS DAY
IS STILL NECESSARY AND USEFUL

398
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,270
A mom and her son are fighting.

399
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,050
Does the whole school need to witness?

400
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,690
Don’t see it like that.

401
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,490
This isn’t just a family issue.

402
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,520
This is meant to tackle
the problem at a structural level.

403
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,200
No, it’s not.

404
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,890
I’m just fooling myself.

405
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,810
Now it feels like
it’s turning into something bigger.

406
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,410
I think it’s kind of fun.

407
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,080
What are you doing, Mom?

408
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,650
You said we would debate fairly.

409
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,580
Why did you drag Kim into this?

410
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,580
Why do you think I dragged him in?

411
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,900
Why don’t you think Kim volunteered himself?

412
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,410
That can’t be true.

413
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,410
Kim agrees we should cancel Sports Day.

414
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,670
Then why did I see him
helping his friends with the stands?

415
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,230
Kim loves being involved in activities.

416
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,180
Maybe he’s trying to
spare your feelings by hiding his true stance.

417
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,460
That’s why I told him
he should have his own standpoint

418
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,180
before he loses the chance.

419
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,030
Mon, I…

420
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,870
The proposer, please begin the debate.

421
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,020
Hi…

422
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,160
I’m Kimhan Panurak.

423
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,920
Today, I’m debating the topic of Sports Day...

424
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,360
Sports Day…

425
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:04,240
Sports Day is still necessary and useful.

426
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,990
That’s right, it’s still necessary.

427
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,400
Sports Day is a rec…

428
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,530
Rec...

429
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,910
Recreational.

430
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,290
Recre…

431
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,390
Recreational.

432
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,810
…a recreational activity

433
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:45,670
that brings students together.

434
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,880
It helps…

435
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:53,000
It helps develop skills and harmony.

436
00:28:53,210 --> 00:29:00,990
We will see structural integration and unison.

437
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,320
So, uh, so…

438
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:13,040
So, we must have
Sports Day to help students bond.

439
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,890
Right.

440
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,890
The opposition, please.

441
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,680
Hi, I’m Rawin Damrongtham from class 6/4,

442
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,080
and I’m the head of the opposition.

443
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,020
Well, the proposer seemed pretty nervous,

444
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,660
so nervous he almost read his script wrong.

445
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,310
Sure, Sports Day
might help some students bond,

446
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,850
but the harsh truth is, every time it happens,

447
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,130
there’s always
a group of students who struggle.

448
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:07,670
Whether it’s the financial burden, high expectations, or overwhelming extra duties.

449
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,110
Isn’t that right, guys?

450
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,070
Right!

451
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,480
I agree.

452
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,830
Humans are social animals.

453
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,760
We must learn to socialize in order to survive.

454
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,440
Other than Sports Day,

455
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,800
kids today can bond through many things.

456
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,650
We have endless learning resources

457
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,070
that teach us how to
adapt and understand others.

458
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,800
In the world beyond school…

459
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,520
we… can’t… work alone.

460
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,680
We have to learn how to cooperate,

461
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,470
and Sports Day… gives us
our first chance to practice that.

462
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,120
If it’s harmony we want, then let’s
focus only on relationship-building sports.

463
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,180
Cut the cheerleading,

464
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,090
the flashy stands, and the parades.

465
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:20,800
Why should we promote beauty privilege
and enforce the must-win mindset?

466
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,880
Exactly!

467
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,310
Mrs. Paan asked me to give you this.

468
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,580
Okay.

469
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:46,550
Look.

470
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,400
Your mom just sent her freshly written script.

471
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,480
Uh…

472
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,490
Come on. Read it.

473
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,300
Okay.

474
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,000
Actually, I do love Sports Day.

475
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,220
All this time, I just didn’t want to say it…

476
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,580
because I didn’t want to upset my boyfriend.

477
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Maybe it’s my fault

478
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:11,190
for not speaking up sooner.

479
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,480
I kept saying yes
until he got the wrong idea.

480
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,780
But I’m standing here now…

481
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,580
because Mrs. Paan said

482
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
she couldn’t find anyone else to debate,

483
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,470
and if I didn’t show up,
it would mean an automatic loss.

484
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,330
That could lead to
Sports Day being canceled.

485
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,700
I didn’t want that to happen.

486
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,950
I know Sports Day has its flaws.

487
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,630
But while I’m still somewhere
between a kid and a grown-up,

488
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,780
I just feel that…

489
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:18,790
I want to have fun

490
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,600
and make the most of every experience.

491
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,850
That’s all.

492
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,389
Woo-hoo.

493
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,469
Well said.

494
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,469
Kim!

495
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,670
Here’s your order, Mr. Customer.

496
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,940
I even added extra fishballs for you.

497
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,400
Feed me. I’m injured.

498
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,270
Your leg’s injured, not your arms.

499
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,330
Eat it yourself.

500
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,840
And who caused this injury, huh?

501
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,580
Stop exaggerating.

502
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,970
You just sprained your ankle, didn’t lose a leg.

503
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,070
Come on.

504
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,400
Tar.

505
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,570
Asshole!

506
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,880
Well, I’m hungry.

507
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,290
- Come on. I’m starving.
- Alright. Hold on.

508
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,910
I’m giving you two pieces here.

509
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,070
It has a hole in it.

510
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,380
- Good?
- Yeah.

511
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,210
Hey, do it nicely.

512
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,480
Vroom, vroom.

513
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:01,860
Stop playing.

514
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,190
Hey, don’t drop it.

515
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,510
Hey!

516
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,600
Wrong side.

517
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,320
- Quit messing around.
- Sorry.

518
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,320
Per, you’re doing great, kiddo.

519
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,950
Why is it salty?

520
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,610
THE OPPOSITION VS THE PROPOSER

521
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,940
The Opposition.

522
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,870
The Proposer.

523
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,160
The Proposer.

524
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,210
The Opposition.

525
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,560
The Proposer.

526
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,030
Mon.

527
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,300
I’m sorry.

528
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,890
Why didn’t you tell me?

529
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:18,790
Like I said,
I was scared to say I like Sports Day.

530
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,510
I was afraid you’d get mad.

531
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,480
Why didn’t you tell me you’d join the debate?

532
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,910
I called, but you didn’t pick up.

533
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,120
So I left you a message.

534
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,220
You didn’t see it?

535
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:41,480
MON, I HAVE TO JOIN THE DEBATE.
MRS. PAAN ASKED ME TO.

536
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,630
PLEASE DON’T BE MAD.
I’M SORRY.

537
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:57,870
Okay. I was wrong too.

538
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,390
I was too wrapped up in
my own thoughts to notice how you felt.

539
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,720
I’m sorry, Kim.

540
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,280
Mhm.

541
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,390
From now on,

542
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,660
whatever you think, just say it.

543
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,720
You don’t have to
force yourself to think like me.

544
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,870
Okay then.

545
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,530
So, does that mean
you’re not sulking anymore?

546
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,820
I wasn’t sulking.

547
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,380
The Proposer.

548
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,720
The Proposer.

549
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,870
It’s perfect.

550
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,450
And here’s the face of
someone very proud of his masterpiece.

551
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,890
Don’t tease me.

552
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:33,110
This is the first time I’ve ever felt like…

553
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,010
I actually accomplished something.

554
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,870
Can’t I take a second to feel proud of myself?

555
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,430
I’m not teasing.

556
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
I’m proud of you too.

557
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,400
Your boyfriend is lucky. You’re amazing.

558
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,090
Thank you.

559
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,410
For what?

560
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,160
I barely helped.

561
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,360
I messed up the colors

562
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,370
and butchered the paper-cutting.

563
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,460
You had to fix my mess.

564
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,360
Still, we did it together, didn’t we?

565
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,300
Then I thank you too.

566
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,600
Sports Day never meant anything to me.

567
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,510
I used to imagine myself
ten years from now, as a fully grown adult,

568
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,940
looking back on this activity

569
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,440
and wondering what I’d remember about it.

570
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,560
Probably nothing.

571
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,720
But now that’s changed.

572
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,080
If anyone asks about my Sports Day memory,

573
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,490
I’ll say that in my final year,

574
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,880
I got to build the stands with my boyfriend.

575
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:35,320
And it was fun and felt really good.

576
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,120
Not just good.

577
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,040
It’s freaking great.

578
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,490
That’s exactly why I’m thanking you.

579
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,730
Thanks for making something

580
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,470
I always took for granted…

581
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,700
feel meaningful.

582
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,220
Thank you.

583
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,420
Then you’re not the only one
who should say thanks.

584
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,370
THE OPPOSITION VS THE PROPOSER

585
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,040
The result is unanimous.

586
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,870
Sports Day is happening this year!

587
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,110
Yeah!

588
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:13,890
Nice!

589
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,000
I was thinking of ditching it
and going to the mall.

590
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,290
Glad I didn’t miss the chance.

591
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,600
Sports Day is
the perfect excuse to skip school.

592
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,380
Who would want to cancel it?

593
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,310
That’s exactly right, dude.

594
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,430
Let’s go.

595
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,370
Go.

596
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,540
Have you thought about
what to study in university?

597
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,060
It’s about time to enroll.

598
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,480
(In the next episode,)

599
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,280
(it’s time for Kit and me
to start thinking about our future.)

600
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,790
What?

601
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,950
(Meanwhile, Kim and Mon…)

602
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,100
You’re not my first boyfriend.

603
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,940
(…are dealing with the past.)

604
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:58,890
What’s he like?

605
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,010
Was he hotter than me?

606
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,590
(Keep on following our love stories.)
