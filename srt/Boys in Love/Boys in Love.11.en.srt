1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
It’s just you and me now. We’ll take turns.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,170
Done.

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,480
Are you messing with me?

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,220
Super handsome.

5
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,120
Tar, you asshole!

6
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,140
I’m scared I’ll only be your boyfriend
while you’re at an all-boys school.

7
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,370
Don’t be scared, Kim.

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,180
I’m sure I’m not confused.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,960
I didn’t get the scholarship.

10
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,990
You don’t have to act tough.

11
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,880
It’s like all my goals just disappeared.

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,530
You’ve done great, Shane.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,110
Let’s figure out what you really want together.

14
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,200
(As graduation draws near,)

15
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,430
(all I can feel is worry.)

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,380
(Not just about where to study next,)

17
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,570
(but about everything that comes after.)

18
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,310
(Graduating high school
isn’t the end of our teenage journey.)

19
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,530
(It’s just the beginning.)

20
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,370
(Who can say what the future holds?)

21
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,340
(Will I do well on university entrance exams?)

22
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,650
(Will I make it to university?)

23
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,750
(Will life get harder from here?)

24
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,570
I.PER MENTIONED YOU IN THEIR STORY

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,810
(Walking cool, like a boy band.)

26
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,680
(Well, it is what it is.)

27
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,820
(In this moment between the end
of high school and a blurry future,)

28
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,880
(we’re left with two choices:)

29
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,530
(To worry about what hasn’t happened yet,)

30
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,000
(or to enjoy the present.)

31
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,100
(I choose the latter.)

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,200
(I choose to make the most of
this final chapter of high school.)

33
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,300
(So that one day, when I look back,
I won’t be filled with regret.)

34
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,880
It’s the only thing we can do.

35
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,560
Take joy in today,

36
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,350
so we can have hope for tomorrow.

37
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,430
Wow.

38
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,620
Did you write that yourself?

39
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,280
Nope.

40
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,220
Someone submitted it for the yearbook.

41
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,920
Jeez!

42
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,640
The way you read it, I thought it was yours.

43
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,680
What?

44
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,490
Can’t I read it just because I like it?

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,170
Well, you acted all cool
like you were the one who wrote it.

46
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,500
Hey, you’re back.

47
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,670
How was the academic competition?

48
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,380
Did your students win?

49
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,430
They did.

50
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,490
I was worried at first,
especially without Shane.

51
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,280
But in the end, they pulled through.

52
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,100
So maybe it’s not just
the students who are competent.

53
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,370
It’s me. I’m the competent one.

54
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,840
Ah.

55
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,910
I bought it.

56
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,860
I knew you’d lead the students to victory.

57
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,970
Aw.

58
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,079
It’s not a big deal.

59
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,120
Even if it’s not, we can still make it special.

60
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,800
Where should we drink it?

61
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,630
We’re still at school.

62
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,830
Are you crazy?

63
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,820
I planned to celebrate with you at our place.

64
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,510
Ah.

65
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,840
Well…

66
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,870
The principal dropped by
to see you this evening.

67
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:48,980
What?

68
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,400
Why did he come?

69
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,860
I have no idea.

70
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,530
He just asked me to
tell you to meet him tomorrow.

71
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,020
Did I do something wrong?

72
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,580
Am I getting fired?

73
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,700
That’s ridiculous.

74
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,860
Why would you even think that?

75
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:04,870
Right.

76
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,330
I’ll start looking for a new job just in case.

77
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,010
He’s never asked to see me before.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,990
Eat more, Kale.

79
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,480
I made these with my best cooking skills.

80
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,110
Of course, Dad.

81
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,520
I put on a few kilos every time I come home.

82
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,900
That’s good. I still think you’re too skinny.

83
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,170
Right.

84
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,710
Oh, Kit.

85
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,180
I heard you’re planning to study Animation.

86
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,500
Have you thought it through?

87
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,400
Mm.

88
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,730
Why?

89
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,210
AN ART COLLEGE IN THE STATES?

90
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,070
I JUST NEED TO ATTEND TO
STRENGTHEN MY BASICS FIRST.
MHM. KALE SAID
IT’S NOT THAT HARD TO GET IN.

91
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,830
I JUST NEED TO ATTEND TO
STRENGTHEN MY BASICS FIRST.
MHM. KALE SAID
IT’S NOT THAT HARD TO GET IN.

92
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,650
THEN I’LL FIND A WAY INTO A UNI.

93
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:27,880
THAT’S GREAT.
IF IT’S REALLY WHAT YOU WANT,
YOU’LL PROBABLY HAVE
A BETTER SHOT THERE THAN HERE.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,340
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD APPLY?

95
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:52,690
YOU SHOULD. WHY NOT?

96
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,750
Guys, can you believe it?

97
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,430
This university offers
more than great academics.

98
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,600
Its cafeterias serve amazing food too.

99
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,370
Like fried chicken at the Faculty of Law,

100
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,540
fruit smoothies at Comm Arts,

101
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,670
and sushi at the Faculty of Medicine.

102
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,430
But right now, we’re headed to try

103
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,070
the spicy meatball salad
at the Faculty of Arts.

104
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,010
Are you ready, Mon?

105
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,370
Is something wrong?

106
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,280
Is it too hot?

107
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:04,350
Kim, aren’t we here to check out
the faculties we want to get into?

108
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,040
Well, we are.

109
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,440
We can walk around and think.

110
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,600
Compare which—

111
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,240
Which cafeteria has the best food?

112
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,040
That’s important too, isn’t it?

113
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,680
How can we be happy students
if our cafeteria serves bad food?

114
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,300
Right?

115
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,610
Hey!

116
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,710
That’s the legendary fruit uncle!

117
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,230
Uncle!

118
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,720
Uncle!

119
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,270
Uncle!

120
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,169
- A bag of watermelon, please.
- Of course, young man.

121
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,890
FACULTY OF ARCHITECTURE
ANIMATION MAJOR

122
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,860
This is my work from my second year here.

123
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,080
What?

124
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,600
Nothing.

125
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,540
If I could go back to
the first day of our tutoring sessions,

126
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,560
and the me today told the me back then that,

127
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,020
in less than a year,

128
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,060
you’d have a clearer goal than I do,

129
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,390
I wouldn’t have believed it.

130
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,660
Now I can picture myself
sitting in a movie theater,

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,260
watching a great animated film
and seeing your name in the end credits.

132
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,760
You mean we’re sitting
next to each other, right?

133
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,260
It’s actually nice here.

134
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,190
I think I’ll just study here.

135
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,640
Wait.

136
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,870
Are you applying to this uni?

137
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,010
Yeah.

138
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,120
Why?

139
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,570
Do you think I won’t pass the test?

140
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,650
It’s okay.

141
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,770
I will study really hard.

142
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,250
And if I don’t make it this year,

143
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,340
I’ll take the test again next year.

144
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,860
But…

145
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,040
at least consider applying to
the art college Kale suggested first.

146
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:58,870
Mhm.

147
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,650
Any major on your mind?

148
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,740
How should I know?

149
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,880
What?

150
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,310
You want to study Comm Arts,

151
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,310
but have no idea which major you’re leaning toward?

152
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,000
You don’t even know
what Comm Arts is about, do you?

153
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,020
Can you just stay out of my business?

154
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,450
Just go back to your
Faculty of Sports Science.

155
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,270
I don’t want to study
Sports Science anymore.

156
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,460
Why?

157
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,200
You want to study Comm Arts too?

158
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,160
Why?

159
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,180
Is your dad the founder of this faculty?

160
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,800
What makes you think
you can ban people from studying here?

161
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,430
I’m not banning people.

162
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,310
I’m banning you!

163
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,160
I want it first.

164
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,950
Why do you have to follow me?

165
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,310
I’m not following you.

166
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,930
Yes, you totally are!

167
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,230
I’m just going to check out the event inside.

168
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,220
Just don’t move.

169
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,290
There! I see you.

170
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,160
Wait until I go in first. Okay?

171
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,710
You’re ridiculous.

172
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,910
Oh? Want to race?

173
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,320

183
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,920
Three, two, one.

184
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,370
Very beautiful.

185
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,910
PERFORMING ARTS MAJOR

186
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,740
Hi! Welcome, everyone,
to our studio for filming shows.

187
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,880
Anyone here dream of
becoming a show host?

188
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,880
You? Come on, give it a try!

189
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,020
Anyone?

190
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,630
Looks like we’ve got our volunteers.

191
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,060
Hello.

192
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,760
As you can see here, we have two cameras.

193
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,650
You might wonder which camera to look at.

194
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,790
You should look at…

195
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,340
Hey.

196
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,430
Excuse me.

197
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,990
Are you thinking about studying Film?

198
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,850
Wanna check out my short film set?

199
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,730
Uh…

200
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,970
Would you like to be
an extra for my Directing class?

201
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,170
The person I had lined up bailed on me.

202
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,720
Tell you what—if you get into this uni,

203
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,210
I’ll help you with whatever you need.

204
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,910
Okay?

205
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,710
Act handsome.

206
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,630
Gaze at her with loving eyes.

207
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,150
You’re totally into her, okay?

208
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,420
Got it?

209
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,880
Come on!

210
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,890
Here he is. I found you a new extra.

211
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,850
A confused-looking boy, just like you wanted.

212
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,040
Let’s shoot before we lose the light.

213
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,020
Sorry, dude.

214
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,540
I already played that role myself.

215
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,530
You take care of him. I’m busy.

216
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,260
Damn you.

217
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,680
I went out and hunted him down for you.

218
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,370
- Hey, boy.
- Come on!

219
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,210
- Camera!
- I won’t bother you now.

220
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,010
And… action!

221
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,870
Good. Good. Like that.

222
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:05,860
Look at each other.

223
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,850
Take her hands gently. Move in closer.

224
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,400
Touch her hair.

225
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,690
Like that. Good.

226
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,270
Cut! Slate!

227
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,520
Slate! Slate! Where are you?

228
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,800
Sorry.

229
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,130
Alright.

230
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,400
Scene 5, Cut 3, Take 28.

231
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,490
Hey.

232
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,910
Wanna clap the slate?

233
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,310
Camera, close-up shot now!

234
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,250
Crouch down a bit.

235
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,880
Yeah. That’s right.

236
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,940
Scene 8, Cut 1, Take 3.

237
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,230
Step back.

238
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,490
Stand behind them.

239
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,330
Boy, write down the scene number as well.

240
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,150
What scene is it?

241
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,910
13.

242
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,310
Scene 13, Cut 1, Take 2.

243
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,410
Move on.

244
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,410
Scene 15, Cut 1, Take 1.

245
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,560
Cut!

246
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,560
Scene 16, Cut 1, Take 1.

247
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,670
Cut!

248
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,840
Let’s continue.

249
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,430
One more take.

250
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,690
Scene 17, Cut 1, Take 1.

251
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,460
Cut!

252
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,310
We got it. Cut!

253
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,160
Maybe I’m not built for this faculty.

254
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,060
COMM ARTS ALUMNI

255
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,819
Alright.

256
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,260
Mr. Tan is here. Let’s get started.

257
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,990
What’s going on here, sir?

258
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,349
I swear, on the honor of a math teacher,

259
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,790
I haven’t done anything wrong lately.

260
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,820
I called you in to ask just one thing…

261
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,130
What are you treating me to?

262
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,290
Sorry, sir?

263
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,740
To celebrate your promotion.

264
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,170
So, what are you buying me?

265
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,510
Pizza? BBQ Pork?

266
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,850
To celebrate my promotion?

267
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,510
Could you please clarify that, sir?

268
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,510
Please be serious, sir.

269
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,910
Okay then.

270
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,070
As you may already know,

271
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,520
Mr. Kamthorn, head of the Math Department,

272
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,400
is transferring to a new school next semester.

273
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,230
What does that mean?

274
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,890
It means it's time for you
to move out of the storage room.

275
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,990
Congratulations on your
new desk in the Math Department.

276
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,300
Really?

277
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,820
This feels like a dream.

278
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,820
I’ve waited two and a half years for this.

279
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,540
I thought I’d have to wait until my next life.

280
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,460
So…

281
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,890
who’s the new head of department?

282
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,360
Didn’t you get
what the principal just said, Mr. Tan?

283
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:04,640
The desk you’re getting is
the head of the Math Department’s desk.

284
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,490
What?!

285
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,190
Congratulations, Mr. Tan!

286
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,000
Everyone, please stop for a moment.

287
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:32,440
Why am I the new head of department, sir?

288
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,850
I-I mean, I’m still young.

289
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,970
Oh dear. I didn’t prepare a script for this part.

290
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:48,600
The principal believes you’re capable
and a representative of the new generation.

291
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,620
With these qualities, we believe
you can help move the school forward.

292
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,670
Plus, it’s great for PR.

293
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,550
Should we post that you’re the youngest department head in school history?

294
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:24,810
Thank you very much, sir, for considering me.

295
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,190
But I’m truly happy being a regular teacher.

296
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,750
I’m not ready for a promotion just yet.

297
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,850
Ah.

298
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,110
Well, if you insist.

299
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,300
Do I still get a desk in the math department?

300
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,360
When you’re ready, let me know.

301
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,270
So we can talk.

302
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,270
Do you want me to take the position?

303
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,250
Whether I do or don’t isn’t relevant.

304
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:43,550
I just don’t understand why
you turned down the opportunity.

305
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,100
I don’t know.

306
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,220
A promotion means more responsibility

307
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,310
and more stress.

308
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,880
Will I be happy?

309
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,590
Are you happy staying in this room?

310
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,690
Yeah, I am.

311
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,770
That’s because of me, not the room.

312
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,300
Right?

313
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,160
Mm.

314
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,150
You’re right.

315
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,450
But still...

316
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:51,210
Can’t I just be a regular teacher and
have a decent office at the same time?

317
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,700
Do I really have to accept the promotion,

318
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,870
take on more,

319
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,080
just to get out of this dump?

320
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,660
Don’t I have any other way?

321
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,390
I understand.

322
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,090
Come on down.

323
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,980
You’re dead.

324
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,160
So, how’s the US art college
application coming along?

325
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,240
I think Kale applied for me.

326
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,720
Do you have to take a test?

327
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,430
Not sure.

328
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,640
I heard it’s mostly
a portfolio submission and an interview.

329
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,770
When’s the interview?

330
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,120
Do you have to fly over there?

331
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,340
I don’t know.

332
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,080
Gosh!

333
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,190
I got killed.

334
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,270
Hey, Kim.

335
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,060
Are you done exploring?

336
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,050
Yeah. We went to every faculty.

337
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,420
That’s enough. It’s exhausting.

338
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,230
Want something to drink? I can get it for you.

339
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,130
It’s okay, you get yours.

340
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,960
Okay.

341
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Where are Per and Tar?

342
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,870
Per said he’s helping out on a short film.

343
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,540
Tar hasn’t replied to my messages yet.

344
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,130
But I think they’re together.

345
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,550
So, are they enrolling in Comm Arts together?

346
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,900
For Tar, yes.

347
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,810
But Per? I’m not sure.

348
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,240
He said he didn’t want to
study Sports Science, though.

349
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,650
Good. At least they’re clear.

350
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,220
One knows what he wants,

351
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,220
and the other knows what he doesn’t want.

352
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,570
I’m worried about Kim.

353
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,880
Even now, he still doesn’t know
what he wants to study.

354
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,290
You mean Kim?

355
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,470
That’s right.

356
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,680
I took him to every faculty today,

357
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,250
but… he didn’t seem to care.

358
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,470
Kim passed the direct entrance exam
for Engineering at a university in Chiang Mai.

359
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,640
He even said he wanted to go there.

360
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,880
He didn’t tell you?

361
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,360
No.

362
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,120
Here’s your drink.

363
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,370
What are you guys talking about?

364
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,450
Kit, I think I’ll go check out
some more faculties.

365
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,290
Should we head out before the event ends?

366
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,910
Aren’t you enrolling in the Faculty of Science?

367
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,120
Fine. I’m going too.

368
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,580
Do you think they’ll fight?

369
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,840
Let them fight.

370
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,060
Maybe it’ll help clear the air.

371
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,880
You mean them, right?

372
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,200
So, what are you going to do
about the art college application?

373
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,500
What-what do you mean?

374
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,740
Can you be serious for once?

375
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,280
You say “I don’t know” every time I ask.

376
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,570
Why?

377
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,050
Why do you have to be this serious?

378
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,990
Okay.

379
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,810
Kale sent me the application two days ago.

380
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,910
No test required.

381
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,720
Just submit my transcript
and do an online interview.

382
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,850
Why didn’t you tell me that earlier?

383
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,880
Why let me get all worked up first?

384
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,690
Because I still don’t know if I should go.

385
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,270
Why not decide after you get accepted?

386
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,920
What if I do get in?

387
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,170
It’s not that hard to get accepted.

388
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,270
Kale wants me to study there first

389
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:40,440
to build my portfolio
and then apply to bigger universities.

390
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,480
Don’t you want to go?

391
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,200
I do.

392
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,510
But…

393
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,230
I’m not sure if I should.

394
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,470
I’ve never been far from home.

395
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:10,930
I’ve never really accomplished anything.

396
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,660
My English isn’t good enough.

397
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,820
What if I don’t get into any university?

398
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,470
Will I be hanging there without purpose?

399
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:36,590
And what about us?

400
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,280
Don’t jump too far ahead.

401
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,720
When taking exams, you’re supposed
to tackle one problem at a time.

402
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,950
You can’t solve everything at once.

403
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:17,750
Right now, focus on the application first.

404
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,280
After that, we’ll take it as it comes.

405
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,350
Mm.

406
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,430
Why didn’t you tell me you got accepted?

407
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,530
You said we’d talk things out directly.

408
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,520
I didn’t know how to tell you

409
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,890
that we’d be studying at different universities, living in different towns.

410
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,750
You didn’t know how to tell me,

411
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,480
so you decided to lie?

412
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,700
I’m sorry.

413
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,320
Hey, you’re back early.

414
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,870
You said you’d be home late.

415
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,060
What’s wrong?

416
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,890
Kim got accepted into the Faculty of Engineering at a university in Chiang Mai.

417
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,290
But he didn’t tell me.

418
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,610
It feels like...

419
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,890
he’s planning a future

420
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,170
that doesn’t have to include me.

421
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,230
It’s okay, baby.

422
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,900
CTU COMM ARTS

423
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,550
I thought you left.

424
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,090
Why would I leave early?

425
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,030
It’s my faculty.

426
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,429
You’re the one who
should study somewhere else.

427
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,719
No.

428
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,570
I just helped the seniors with their short film.

429
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,100
And now, I know what I want.

430
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,480
I’m going to study here too.

431
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:56,179
They just used you for free, you know?

432
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,200
At least I figured out what I want.

433
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,410
You don’t even know
what you want from this faculty.

434
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,210
Was that too harsh?

435
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,870
No. You’re right.

436
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,090
Honestly, I want to study here

437
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,310
because a lot of famous people
graduated from this place.

438
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,280
So I thought, maybe if I study here too,

439
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,710
I’ll become famous someday.

440
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:49,860
Do you think it’s silly
to choose something for that reason?

441
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,050
No.

442
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,370
By your standards, I don’t think it’s silly.

443
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,010
Is that a compliment or an insult?

444
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,120
I believe you’ll be famous one day.

445
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,460
I don’t know why.

446
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,670
It’s just a gut feeling.

447
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,160
So... you’re really done with running?

448
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,750
Mm.

449
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,200
I started running when I was a kid
because I wasn’t good at school.

450
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,440
So I became a runner.

451
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,880
I was pretty good at it, so I stuck with it.

452
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,290
But now, I want to
choose something I truly like.

453
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,880
And you’ve found it.

454
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,250
Yeah.

455
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,960
Being a slate boy on set.

456
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,440
You’re not picking Comm Arts
just to hold a slate.

457
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,810
I know.

458
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,870
You’re the one who wrote
that article in the yearbook.

459
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,310
It was good.

460
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,610
Do you think like me?

461
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,000
I believe we just live our lives,

462
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,750
and the future will shape what’s right for us.

463
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,340
What are you even talking about?

464
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,410
being a writer, are you turning poetic?

465
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,170
Jerk!

466
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,640
Damn you.

467
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,730
I was right not to take
the department head position.

468
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,610
I’d have so many
extra responsibilities after teaching.

469
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,890
The life I want is one
with real work-life balance,

470
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,730
where I can eat at my favorite place
with my boyfriend and join an activity or two.

471
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,100
Hey, I’m thinking about taking yoga classes.

472
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,920
Yoga? You?

473
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,380
Mm. Most people with free time do yoga.

474
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:54,160
Hey, should I try rock climbing too?

475
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:59,450
Let’s just say, I’m not spending
most of my time working.

476
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,510
It’s good you think that way.

477
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,200
That means we’ll have more time together.

478
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,480
Seriously, though.

479
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,180
Being the head doesn’t guarantee success.

480
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,350
Sometimes, you just get more responsibility and still get ignored by your boss.

481
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,310
traps disguised as success.
High positions are just

482
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:25,100
Meanwhile, lower positions
let you live happier.

483
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:33,160
You actually want
the department head role, don’t you?

484
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:40,240
And now, you regret turning it down.

485
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,050
Ridiculous!

486
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,230
What are you talking about?

487
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,860
Yes.

488
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,700
At first, I thought I was right.

489
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,730
But it still bothers me until now.

490
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,570
The truth is, I was scared.

491
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:21,680
Scared I wouldn’t live up to
people’s expectations.

492
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:27,900
Scared that once I took the job,

493
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,260
I’d realize I didn’t deserve it.

494
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,880
Or…

495
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,880
maybe you’d find out that you’re doing great.

496
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,780
Don’t assume the future will be disappointing.

497
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,410
There must be a reason
the principal believes in you.

498
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:58,790
Now you just need to believe in yourself.

499
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
And if you ever need emotional support,

500
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,720
I’m always here.

501
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,850
Okay. I’ll call the principal now.

502
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,030
Should I call now or wait till tomorrow?

503
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,540
You can call him now. It’s just 7.

504
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,970
I’m pressing the call button now!

505
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,630
Mon.

506
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:14,040
I’m sorry for not telling you I got accepted.

507
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,540
I already knew my scores weren’t enough
to get into the same university as you.

508
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,440
Engineering there requires such a high score.

509
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,850
So when I got into
that university in Chiang Mai,

510
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,960
I felt like I didn’t have the right to turn it down.

511
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,500
If I hadn’t found out myself,

512
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,280
when were you planning to tell me?

513
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,440
To be honest, I don’t know.

514
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,880
I was scared to tell you.

515
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,170
I was afraid you’d break up with me.

516
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:03,880
So this whole time,

517
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,350
you’ve been carrying that fear?

518
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:14,520
I was scared you’d want to
end things because we’d be far apart.

519
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,190
Okay.

520
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,510
I know I shouldn’t have kept it from you.

521
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:37,340
So if you want to break up, I’ll accept it.

522
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,340
Why?

523
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,020
Do you think I’m that fickle?

524
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,730
It’s just distance.

525
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,780
You think that’s enough to make me give up?

526
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,340
Does that mean…

527
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,650
it’s not a problem

528
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,690
if we go to different universities?

529
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,480
If you’re okay with it, then I am too.

530
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,020
SCHOOL’S OUT COUNTDOWN

531
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,810
DON’T WANT TO LEAVE MY BUDS YET!
FINGERS CROSSED CU ACCEPTS ME!
SKIPPED CLASSES
AND STILL MADE IT TO GRADUATION!

532
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,490
THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY HIGH SCHOOL LIFE MEANINGFUL AND MEMORABLE.

533
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:54,070
Shane.

534
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:56,810
Hi.

535
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,140
The interview result is out?

536
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:00,990
It is.

537
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,270
Did you make it?

538
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,150
Holy shit!

539
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,770
You did.

540
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,850
You really did!

541
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:39,600
You did great.

542
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,070
You’re so great!

543
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,070
Thank you.

544
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,890
Well done.

545
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,330
You’re super awesome.

546
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:56,780
You’re so great!

547
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,470
(And the stories of my friends
and me have come to an end.)

548
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,890
Most long-distance relationships don’t last.

549
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,610
I won’t let go of your hand,
no matter how far apart we are.

550
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:20,180
I might give up on many things in life,
but I’ll never give up on you.

551
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:24,890
(Stick around and see how our love stories unfold.)
