1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,950
If I really looked good,
someone would like me.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,059
But no one does.

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,160
How do you know that?

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,280
Where have you been?

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,800
Do you know that you shouldn’t do this?

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,440
I just wanted us all to be together.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,440
We are together right now.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,150
Do you think I’m mean?

9
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,870
Why would I love you if you were?

10
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,260
I like you, Shane.

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,760
And I want to be your boyfriend.

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,220
I like you too.

13
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,640
(If I had to compare my nearly-finished

14
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,640
high school life to a time of day,

15
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,539
I’d say it’s like this golden hour.)

16
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,120
(It’s a sad moment
because time is slipping away,

17
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,330
but there’s no denying how beautiful it is.)

18
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,720
I like you, Shane.

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,050
And I want to be your boyfriend.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,900
Mm.

21
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,410
Me too.

22
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,870
I like you too.

23
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,730
And I want to…

24
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,180
be your boyfriend too.

25
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,100
But we can’t be together.

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,450
I’m about to move away.

27
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,060
In the end, we’ll be apart.

28
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,150
But it hasn’t even happened yet.

29
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,420
It’s not easy.

30
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,170
Being together only to be separated.

31
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,970
What if I followed you to Germany?

32
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,870
You wouldn’t be against

33
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,290
me studying abroad too, right?

34
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,540
Are you really going to study in Germany?

35
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,820
If that’s what it takes to make everything work.

36
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,440
If that day comes,

37
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,620
we could finally be together
without any worries, right?

38
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,620
Time to get in the water!

39
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,080
Shoes off!

40
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,880
What are you doing?

41
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,490
You’re so finished!

42
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,780
Ugh, you got water in my mouth!

43
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,740
(Looking back,

44
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,450
I realized I didn’t know what the future held

45
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,560
or how much time I had left to enjoy life like this.)

46
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,950
(Luckily, my friends didn’t let me
spend too long overthinking it.)

47
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,860
(Thanks to them, really.)

48
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,680
(I’m grateful to have them in my life.)

49
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,350
Thank you guys so much for today.

50
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,980
No problem.

51
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,700
Shane’s little sister is like my own little sister.

52
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,900
Earlier, you called her Shawn, though.

53
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,880
Hey, Kit.

54
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,330
Are you sure I can take the car?

55
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,330
Yes, I’m sure.

56
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,330
I’ll ask someone at home
to come get us tomorrow.

57
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,700
Okay. Let’s do that then.

58
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,940
Shane, look after your friends.

59
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,500
Mhm. You guys take care.

60
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,470
Let me know when you get home.

61
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,320
Mm.

62
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,580
Come on, let’s head home.

63
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,280
Bye-bye.

64
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,220
Thanks again, everyone.

65
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,150
See you.

66
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,280
You wicked thing!

67
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,180
So why aren’t we going home now?

68
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,570
The van service is still running.

69
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,360
It’s already late. Let’s not head back now.

70
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,530
It’s not safe.

71
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,320
But we get home
even later than this on school days.

72
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,780
Tar just wants to hang around.

73
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,960
He won’t go back no matter what you say,

74
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,280
so give it up.

75
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,560
You think you know everything, huh?

76
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,560
You live in my head now?

77
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,100
More like in your heart, jackass.

78
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,880
Ew! Stop it. I’m gonna puke.

79
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,280
Let’s find a place to crash.

80
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,280
It will get harder the later it gets.

81
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,750
No need.

82
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,810
I’ve already booked a place
my sister’s friend owns.

83
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,700
It’s not far. We can walk.

84
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,280
You’re seriously cool, my friend Kit.

85
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,280
How come we just became close, huh?

86
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,940
I’m cool, aren’t I?

87
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,510
Come on, let’s get to our place.

88
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,180
Wow!

89
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:42,650
WISH YOU WERE HERE WITH ME.

90
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
Hello, Mr. Nut.

91
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,400
Why did you lie to your mom,

92
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,200
saying it was a Literature Club outing

93
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,120
when you just wanted to travel with your friends?

94
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,210
I didn’t lie.

95
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,320
Traveling together counts as a bonding activity.

96
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,220
But don’t worry, sir.

97
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,040
You won’t have to take care of
the students all by yourself.

98
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,410
I got you some backup.

99
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,580
Backup?

100
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,100
There he is.

101
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,190
Right on time.

102
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,799
Hold on! Wait!

103
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,190
This way, sir.

104
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,360
I’m coming.

105
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,380
I’m coming. Wait up!

106
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,480
I’m here.

107
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,720
I’ll be helping you, Mr. Nut.

108
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,280
Think of it as payback for
helping me out during the school field trip.

109
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,340
Oh, I forgot.

110
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,420
I’ll just run back and put away the helmet.

111
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,060
Actually, we can just go.

112
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,840
Guys, get in the van.

113
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,950
Chop chop!

114
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,310
I’m hopping in too.

115
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,380
Thanks, Mon.

116
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,100
One more kid for me to take care of.

117
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,730
It’s like this every time.

118
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,320
They said it smelled like lime.

119
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,640
Hello, sir.

120
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,160
Hi, guys.

121
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,310
I missed you so bad, Mon.

122
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,790
We were apart for hours.

123
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,480
I missed you too.

124
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,350
Let’s take some photos and post them.

125
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,350
My boyfriend came
all the way to Pattaya to see me.

126
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,120
Wait, Kim.

127
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,820
No couple photos today.

128
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,250
Why not?

129
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,400
I told my mom I was coming here
with Literature Club friends, not to see you.

130
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,210
If she finds out, we’ll be in trouble.

131
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,180
So no couple photos.

132
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,940
Come on.

133
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,300
Even without the social media updates,

134
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,870
it’s still our trip, right?

135
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,430
Aren’t you happy?

136
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,440
I am.

137
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,220
Just having you here makes me really happy.

138
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,330
Kim and Mon must be thinking
they’re the only two people in the world.

139
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,070
Yeah, I guess so.

140
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,120
I’m kind of jealous of them, honestly.

141
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,640
Shane.

142
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,220
Since you’re leaving for Germany,

143
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,900
why not make this your farewell trip?

144
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,360
How do you know I’m going to Germany?

145
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,360
Ah, Mon told me.

146
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,300
I told Mon.

147
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,590
Everyone’s going to find out eventually,

148
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,750
so I just told people for you.

149
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,480
Good thing I convinced you all to stay.

150
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,740
Now we get to have this farewell trip together.

151
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,860
Let’s have the most fun on this trip. Yeah?

152
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:40,970
Right.

153
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,660
So, where do you guys want to go?

154
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,310
Koh Larn, sir.

155
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,640
Everyone, share your ideas

156
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,330
on where you’d like to visit.

157
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,640
Let’s brainstorm.

158
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,030
So where is it?

159
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,190
Koh Larn.

160
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,560
Right.

161
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,460
So, where does everyone want to go?

162
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,080
Koh Larn.

163
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,450
Aquarium?

164
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,560
Aquarium!

165
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:12,770
Mr. Nut?

166
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,100
Yes?

167
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,840
I think we should visit the aquarium.

168
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,540
Seems like that’s what everyone wants.

169
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,930
Aquarium, yeah?

170
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,110
Aquarium!

171
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,200
Aquarium!

172
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,340
Aquarium!

173
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,400
Aquarium!

174
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,480
Aquarium!

175
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,380
Aquarium!

176
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,960
Guys, don’t touch everything you see.

177
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,210
There are signs that say

178
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,710
what you can and can’t touch.

179
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,400
Show some maturity.

180
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,040
Whoa!

181
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,880
Mr. Nut.

182
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,060
That thing’s huge. Let’s go check it out!

183
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,740
♪ Feels like everything’s turned pink–it's true ♪

184
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,390

224
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,850
Guys, do you wanna take a group shot?

225
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:36,790
Sure.

226
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,530
Come on.

227
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,050
Gather up.

228
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,750
Say it together.

229
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,930
Aquarium!

230
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,080
Aquarium!

231
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,710
Aquarium!

232
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,110
Aquarium!

233
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,490
It’s nice seeing the students
spending time together like this.

234
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,890
I thought you said you hated
going on school trips with students.

235
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,390
Aquarium!

236
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,790
Yeah!

237
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:18,990
MRS. PAAN

238
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,630
Hello.

239
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,900
Mr. Nut, you need to bring
the students back immediately.

240
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,330
What’s the matter, ma’am?

241
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,540
You said it was a Literature Club outing.

242
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,800
So why are Kim and his friends there too?

243
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,450
But Kim is also a member of the club.

244
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,230
Mon didn’t say Kim would be there too.

245
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,630
I think there’s just been a misunderstanding...

246
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,690
I said, bring the students back right away.

247
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,040
I promised them

248
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,230
I’d look after them until the trip ends.

249
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,040
I’ll inform you as soon as

250
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,150
we return to school, ma’am.

251
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:57,810
Goodbye.

252
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,710
Mr. Nut—!

253
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,890
MRS. PAAN

254
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,320
Hello.

255
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,450
Mr. Tan,

256
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,860
may I speak with Mr. Nut, please?

257
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:23,910
Uh…

258
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,980
If Mr. Nut doesn’t take this call,

259
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,150
your evaluation this semester

260
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,880
will be in serious trouble, Mr. Tan.

261
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,930
Sorry, Mr. Nut.

262
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,330
Mrs. Paan wants to speak with you.

263
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,910
Sorry, guys.

264
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,730
We came all this way,

265
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,630
but we only got a little time to travel
before we have to head back.

266
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,850
It’s okay, Mon.

267
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,610
Going back early isn’t so bad.

268
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,830
Come on.

269
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,400
Don’t worry, Mon.

270
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,410
I will help talk to Mrs. Paan.

271
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,040
I was kind of expecting this.

272
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,330
It’s just how my mom is.

273
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,510
Are you coming back with us?

274
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,260
We’ve got some spots left in the van.

275
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,190
Okay, sir.

276
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,460
Let’s go.

277
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,870
Wait a minute!

278
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,230
Where are Per and Tar?

279
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,770
Weren’t they with you, Shane?

280
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,880
No, they weren’t.

281
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,880
I haven’t seen them for a while.

282
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,730
I thought they were with you.

283
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,970
They weren’t!

284
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,670
If we want to go, we go.

285
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,970
Let’s go to Koh Larn, baby!

286
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,570
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

287
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,030
Let’s go!

288
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,700
Go!

289
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,490
They’re not picking up, sir.

290
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,090
What do we do, Mr. Nut?

291
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,590
What if something happened to them?

292
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,910
What am I supposed to do?

293
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,290
Stay calm, Mr. Tan.

294
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,350
MRS. PAAN THE POWER-MAD

295
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,870
Yes, Mrs. Paan?

296
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,860
If Mon isn’t back within the hour,

297
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,350
I’ll seize the parcel storage room.

298
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,630
You can share your office with the janitor.

299
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,150
Shit.

300
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,370
Mr. Nut,

301
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,740
take the students back to school right now.

302
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,470
What about Per and Tar?

303
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,450
I’ll deal with them.

304
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,690
Just get Mon back.

305
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,490
Everyone, into the van!

306
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,460
Get in.

307
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,740
Don’t worry.

308
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,910
You’re finally back.

309
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,220
We need to talk.

310
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,630
Please don’t scold Mon, Mrs. Paan.

311
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,630
It’s not his fault.

312
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,600
I was the one who asked him to come see me.

313
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,180
This doesn’t concern you, Kim.

314
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,770
You may leave now. It’s late.

315
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,590
Go home.

316
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,590
All right, then.

317
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,350
Goodbye, ma’am.

318
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,510
Why did you lie to me?

319
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,330
Mon, don’t you walk away from me.

320
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,020
We need to talk this through.

321
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,940
Mon!

322
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,670
Mon!

323
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,920
We need to talk.

324
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,890
Mon, come out and talk to me.

325
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,020
Mon, open the door.

326
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,530
Don’t pull this on me.

327
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,370
Mon, open the door now.

328
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,330
Mon.

329
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,180
Mon!

330
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,950
Uh…

331
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,960
I was just about to leave, ma’am.

332
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,680
It’s true.

333
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,170
Goodbye, ma’am.

334
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,510
Please don’t be upset with Mon, Mrs. Paan.

335
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,190
He saw me enjoying the trip

336
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,750
and wanted to join too.

337
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,890
And I was the one who asked him to go,

338
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,470
so…

339
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,350
This isn’t your fault, Kim.

340
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,160
You should go home.

341
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,550
Good night, ma’am.

342
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,970
Finally ready to talk?

343
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,760
I’m sorry

344
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,270
for lying to you.

345
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,500
Why did you choose to lie?

346
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,740
Because I thought if you knew,

347
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,740
you wouldn’t let me go see Kim.

348
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,910
That’s just what you assumed.

349
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,540
Just admit it, Mom.

350
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,320
If you knew I was going to see Kim,

351
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,090
you wouldn’t be pleased.

352
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,270
You’d interrogate me

353
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,620
or find a way to stop me from going.

354
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,690
You don’t want me to be with him, do you?

355
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,890
It’s not that.

356
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,840
I just don’t want you to rush into anything.

357
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,320
You just knew Kim.

358
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,640
If one day he hurts you or lets you down,

359
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,010
have you even thought

360
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,400
about how you’ll deal with that?

361
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,220
In the end, I have to
take responsibility for my choices,

362
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,580
whether they turn out good or bad.

363
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,890
That’s easier said than done.

364
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,510
Reality hits harder than that.

365
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,320
I know you're worried,

366
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,060
but I’m strong enough to handle it.

367
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,520
I learned that from you.

368
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,720
You’re strong

369
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,170
and I’m strong too.

370
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,550
Just don’t lie to me again.

371
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,090
Whatever it is, say it.

372
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,650
Talk to me.

373
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,730
I will.

374
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,430
Next time I want to go
on a trip with my boyfriend,

375
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,250
I’ll tell you.

376
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,640
This is all your fault, Per.

377
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,420
You got carried away.

378
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,150
Look. It’s already dark now.

379
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,130
And my phone’s dead.

380
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,570
How are we supposed to
contact Kim and Shane?

381
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,730
So, it’s my fault again?

382
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,390
Weren’t you the one who wanted to go?

383
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,530
I just came along to keep you company.

384
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,490
Keep me company, huh?

385
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,620
You had way more fun than I did.

386
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,850
How many times
did you ride that banana boat?

387
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:48,850
Hi.

388
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,000
You two jackasses.

389
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,000
You’re finally back, huh?

390
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,870
You’re so getting it!

391
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,430
I told you so many times

392
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,930
I wanted to go to Koh Larn.

393
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,800
You just never listened.

394
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,880
Are you blaming this on me?

395
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,260
Don’t we have a school rule
about not hitting students?

396
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,630
We’re not at school now,

397
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,320
so rules don’t apply.

398
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,690
Yes, Mr. Nut.

399
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,990
I found Tar and Per.

400
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,170
Turns out Shane was right.

401
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,760
They went to Koh Larn.

402
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,540
We’re heading back to Bangkok now,

403
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,540
but it’s going to take a while.

404
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,600
Got it.

405
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,670
Travel safe.

406
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,510
I’ll be waiting for you in the storage room.

407
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,430
It’s okay.

408
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,410
You can go home first, Mr. Nut.

409
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,610
No.

410
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,080
We’re a team.

411
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,080
We went together, so we go home together.

412
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,440
I mean,

413
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,040
we leave for home at the same time.

414
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,890
Okay then.

415
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,570
See you soon.

416
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,490
Sure.

417
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,240
I TOLD MOM I WAS SORRY.

418
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,410
WILL YOU TALK TO ME NOW?

419
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,730
I TOLD MOM I WAS SORRY.
WILL YOU TALK TO ME NOW?

420
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,810
GOOD WORK!

421
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:57,030
GOOD WORK!

422
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:02,700
GOOD WORK!

423
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,660
Are you absolutely sure, sweetheart?

424
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,030
Why do you suddenly want to study abroad?

425
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,970
Don’t tell me you watched

426
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,330
some movie and got inspired.

427
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,870
I’m sure.

428
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,150
I wouldn’t be standing here
talking to you if I weren’t.

429
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,880
You told me to think about my future,

430
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,290
so here I am, thinking.

431
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,240
Do you even speak German?

432
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,160
The study part is hard enough as it is,

433
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,380
and you don’t even know
the basics of the language.

434
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,450
Why don’t you give it some more thought?

435
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,500
You can take a gap year

436
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,500
and spend time thinking.

437
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,880
We’re not pressuring you.

438
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,650
But I don’t have time.

439
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,610
Shane is leaving for Germany soon.

440
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,670
So that’s what this is about.
You just want to follow Shane?

441
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,710
Then I’d say we’re right not to let you go.

442
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,920
You just want to follow your friend there.

443
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,090
Shane isn’t just a friend.

444
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,720
He is more than that.

445
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,370
Shane, dear.

446
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,740
Have you made up your mind

447
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,260
about moving to Germany with me?

448
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,830
As for Cheese,

449
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,470
your dad will never let her live with me.

450
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,990
But that’s all right.

451
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,910
Having just you come with me
is more than enough.

452
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,230
Jin and Name are already grown.

453
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,490
Cheese can stay with her father.

454
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,870
I love you the most anyway.

455
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,150
You love me too, don’t you?

456
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,470
Is it because we don’t see each other often

457
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,430
that you love me less?

458
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,890
I love you just the same.

459
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,220
Not less.

460
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,340
But if you could stop fighting with Dad,

461
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,790
I’d be really grateful.

462
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:07,610
Your dad and I are just too different.

463
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:10,140
That’s why we fight, as you’ve seen.

464
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,880
But you’re like me.

465
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,420
You know how to take care of yourself,

466
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,170
and you’re always ambitious about your future.

467
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,350
Studying abroad has

468
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,250
always been your dream, hasn’t it?

469
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,510
CAN YOU COME TALK TO ME?

470
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,030
CAN YOU COME TALK TO ME?
I’LL BE QUICK.

471
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,890
But if you stay here,

472
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,720
you’ll wear yourself out.

473
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,310
You have to take care of yourself,

474
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,890
your older siblings, and your little sister.

475
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:57,370
If you come with me, I’ll take care of you.

476
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,890
And you can finally
focus on chasing your dream.

477
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,050
KIT

478
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:30,350
KIT

479
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,409
KIT

480
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,600
Come with me, Shane.

481
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,260
Let’s chase your dream together.

482
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,560
Can you not go, Shane?

483
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,070
We just started this.

484
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,750
I don’t want it to end like this.

485
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,260
I like you, Shane.

486
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,860
And I want to be… your boyfriend.

487
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,850
I’m not going, Mom.

488
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,630
- Shane, but I—
- I already have responsibilities.

489
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,410
I have a cat to look after.

490
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,230
Aw, Kaiju.

491
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,750
We were too loud, huh?

492
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,570
What happened?

493
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,200
Why did Dad look so mad?

494
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,220
Of course, he’s mad.

495
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,520
I told him to leave.

496
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,230
I said if he sold this condo,

497
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,870
I’d make all of us change our last name.

498
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,840
So, bottom line,

499
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,470
the four of us are staying put.

500
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,570
Okay?

501
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,800
I’ve got a meeting soon,

502
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,090
so no loud noises,

503
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,950
or I’m giving everyone noogies.

504
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,310
Name, don’t steal my snack.

505
00:36:59,330 --> 00:36:59,950
Give it back.

506
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,610
Can’t I just have a little taste?

507
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,710
I told you, no loud noises!

508
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,610
- Please.
- No.

509
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,770
No!

510
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,200
Will you stop stealing her snacks?

511
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,700
I don’t have anything.

512
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,920
Then buy your own.

513
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,500
Can I just have some for now?

514
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,510
(Hello, Shane.)

515
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,710
Sorry, I was talking to my mom.

516
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,880
Can we meet?

517
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,680
- I have something to tell you.
- I have something to tell you.

518
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,590
You go first.

519
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,140
I’ve decided not to move to Germany.

520
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,320
Hey!

521
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,860
Seriously?

522
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:27,750
Yeah.

523
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,190
I talked to my mom.

524
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,730
Told her I’m staying here.

525
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,380
I’m not going anywhere.

526
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,710
Good.

527
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,360
That’s great.

528
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,470
So, what did you want to tell me?

529
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,850
You seemed really excited just now.

530
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,420
Ah…

531
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,970
Nothing.

532
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,000
I wanted to say that,

533
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,820
on second thought,

534
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,840
I don’t want to go to Germany anymore.

535
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,390
You changed your mind pretty fast.

536
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,490
I thought you’d already
started planning for schools there.

537
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,980
Plans change with my heart.

538
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,830
Wherever my heart is, that’s where I’ll be.

539
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,730
I didn’t just come to talk about my family plans.

540
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,450
I also came to give you
the answer you’ve been asking for.

541
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,330
Well…

542
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,070
I…

543
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,060
I’m actually okay with it.

544
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,780
Okay?

545
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,030
With what?

546
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,590
What thing?

547
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,880
That thing.

548
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,880
What thing?

549
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,310
That thing!

550
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,870
What thing?

551
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,570
Okay!

552
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,370
I’ll be your boyfriend.

553
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,740
From now on, we’re boyfriends.

554
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,090
Is that clear enough?

555
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,490
Crystal clear, boyfriend.

556
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,630
You already knew that.

557
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,990
Why’d you keep pushing?

558
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,790
Because I wanted to hear it straight from you.

559
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,770
Kit.

560
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Yes, Dad?

561
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,450
I think I judged you too quickly.

562
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,010
I felt like…

563
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,430
I wasn’t being a good dad.

564
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:16,220
So, if you really want to study in Germany,

565
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:17,990
I’ll support—

566
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,840
Ah!

567
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,600
I’ve changed my mind.

568
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,900
I’m not going anymore.

569
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,070
What?

570
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,900
Come again?

571
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,050
I’m not going anymore, Dad.

572
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,550
Thank you.

573
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:55,900
Exams are over!

574
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,200
(Time flies, the first semester’s almost up.)

575
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,640
(Next up, Kit and I are going
on a double date with Kim and Mon.)

576
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,690
This party is straight out of a Hollywood movie!

577
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,610
(Let’s see which couple turns out to be sweeter.)

578
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,730
See? Nobody’s paying attention to us.

579
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,330
(Or maybe… a surprise is headed your way.)
