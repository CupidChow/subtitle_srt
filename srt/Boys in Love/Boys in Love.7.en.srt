1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
Let’s go to Koh Larn, baby!

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,800
Mr. Nut, I found Tar and Per.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,900
Travel safe.

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,970
I’ll be waiting for you in the storage room.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,620
I just don’t want you to rush into anything.

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,220
But I’m strong enough.

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,980
You’re strong

8
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,770
and I’m strong too.

9
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,810
I TOLD MOM I WAS SORRY.

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,910
GOOD WORK!

11
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,270
I’ll be your boyfriend.

12
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,100
From now on, we’re boyfriends.

13
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,520
Is that clear enough?

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,230
Crystal clear, boyfriend.

15
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,880
Why are you calling me now?

16
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,070
I just wanted to be
the first person to talk to you.

17
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,570
I was worried
someone else might beat me to it.

18
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,530
At 4 a.m.?

19
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,910
Who would be talking to me at this hour?

20
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,780
Well…

21
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,360
Kaiju might.

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,590
He could’ve gotten to you first.

23
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,880
Are you seriously jealous of a cat?

24
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,900
But I’m happy now.

25
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,080
Good luck with studying.

26
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,730
I’m going back to sleep.

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,870
Bye.

28
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,960
I’m here, I’m here!

29
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,100
Did you wait long?

30
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,600
If you want to go to school with me, don’t be late.

31
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,430
Come on.

32
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,890
Are you wearing perfume?

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,010
Mm.

34
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,840
I wanted to smell nice.

35
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,070
You never know, maybe it’ll earn me a hug.

36
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,190
Who would even hug you?

37
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,330
Oops.

38
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Look who’s hugging me right now.

39
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,050
Are you blushing?

40
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,079
I’m not blushing.

41
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,910
I can totally see that you are.

42
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,340
I’m not.

43
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,690
Let me go first.

44
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,630
Hey.

45
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,860
What?

46
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,090
What are you doing?

47
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,850
I came first.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,350
FIVE DAYS BEFORE SCHOOL BREAK

49
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,570
Kim.

50
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,830
Here, Mon.

51
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,530
My math lecture notes for you.

52
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,659
This looks like Shane’s handwriting.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,640
Well…

54
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,510
It’s technically Shane’s lecture,

55
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,600
but I added some of my own notes too.

56
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,710
MON, KEEP FIGHTING.

57
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,880
MON IS BRILLIANT.

58
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,780
Thanks, Kim.

59
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,060
Hey, how about we…

60
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,570
go on a date after finals?

61
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,490
Of course.

62
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,630
What?

63
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,370
You’re ditching our hangout plan

64
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,860
to go on a date with your boyfriend?

65
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,280
When did we even make a hangout plan?

66
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:23,700
Hello?

67
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,570
It’s always been our thing.

68
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,750
We always hang out after exams.

69
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,070
We’ve never actually planned it, though.

70
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,270
But we do it every year!

71
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:33,880
Right?

72
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,409
What kind of people are you guys?

73
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,570
Just because you’re dating now,

74
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,950
you’re bailing on your friends?

75
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,510
This is our last year together!

76
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,510
I never said I was bailing on you.

77
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,880
Good man, Shane.

78
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,880
See, Kim?

79
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,870
You should be more like Shane.

80
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,740
He’s dating someone too,

81
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,390
but he still picks his friends.

82
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,240
Unlike you!

83
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,440
Fine.

84
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,680
Let’s talk about this again after finals.

85
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,370
Talk about it again after finals?

86
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,290
Seriously?

87
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,910
You’re always like this.

88
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,000
Right, Per?

89
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,890
What about you?

90
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,110
Are you abandoning me too?

91
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,690
Huh?

92
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,440
What?

93
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,120
Why are you wearing earphones?

94
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,270
Listen to me.

95
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,650
No one’s listening to me.

96
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,130
Shane.

97
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,860
I want to go play laser tag.

98
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,590
Should we go after finals?

99
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,750
I’ve already got plans with my friends.

100
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,890
We hang out every year.

101
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,620
If I skip, they’ll sulk.

102
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,480
Where are you guys going?

103
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,560
Just a simple hangout and food, I think.

104
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,490
Nothing fancy.

105
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,150
Can I come with you then?

106
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,010
Do you really want to?

107
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,250
Can I, though?

108
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:07,870
Never mind.

109
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,880
Let’s talk about it after finals.

110
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,860
I’m hungry.

111
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,730
What a classic excuse.

112
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,200
Seriously. I’m starving.

113
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,400
You just ate.

114
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,190
Which of the following

115
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,860
is correct regarding ‘Demand’?

116
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:32,720
B.

117
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,270
Wrong!

118
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,140
It's C.

119
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,120
Let’s switch to a new subject.

120
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,270
Bring it on. I’m ready.

121
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,880
KIM, KEEP FIGHTING :)

122
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,510
Just study.

123
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,150
I’ve got a job to do.

124
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,370
What job?

125
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,130
Guarding someone cute while he studies.

126
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,520
It’s serious business.

127
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,570
What if someone stole you away?

128
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,570
Just study, will you?

129
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,890
Was that too cheesy?

130
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,680
I’ve got a job too.

131
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,770
Yeah? What job?

132
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,750
Tutoring someone even cuter.

133
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,679
What are you staring at?

134
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,919
The question.

135
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,299
Four million, my ass. Look closely!

136
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,830
Let’s move on to the next one.

137
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,460
If you get it right, you’ll be rewarded.

138
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,770
Two million.

139
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,150
Bingo.

140
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,830
You think I’m comfortable sitting like this?

141
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,760
Don’t.

142
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,740
You’re on the wrong page.

143
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:53,880
Here, look at this one with me.

144
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,210
So, what’s the answer?

145
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,730
Let’s skip it for now.

146
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,950
ONE DAY BEFORE SCHOOL BREAK

147
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,890
Exams are over!

148
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,510
Woo-hoo!

149
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,420
Yeah!

150
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Dramatic, just how you wanted.

151
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,220
Now clean up, jackass.

152
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,750
So, have you decided

153
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,370
who you’re going with this evening?

154
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,650
You can just say it

155
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,170
if you want to ditch your friends
and go with your boyfriend.

156
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,980
Who said I was ditching you?

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,730
What?

158
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,030
So you’re ditching your boyfriend
to come with us, then?

159
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,720
No.

160
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,080
I’m not ditching anyone.

161
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,080
We can all go together.

162
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,610
What?

163
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,870
It can be a double date.

164
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Mon and me, you and Kit.

165
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,930
What about Per and me?

166
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,960
If you two want to date too,

167
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,030
you can date each other.

168
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,250
- Huh?
- What?

169
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,640
Kit’s not going.

170
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,550
I didn’t even ask him.

171
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,780
Of course, he is.

172
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,690
See? I already asked him.

173
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,370
You didn’t think of telling me first?

174
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,540
Let’s just go.

175
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,310
Kit and Mon are waiting at the gate.

176
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,450
Come on.

177
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:12,860
Let’s move.

178
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,310
You invited people without even telling me.

179
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,360
Just come on.

180
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,600
Quit whining.

181
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,820
So much for a hangout with friends.

182
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,240
Do you think we should really be here?

183
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,290
Hey, look at this.

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,670
Yes!

185
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,320
Hey!

186
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,870
Hey, I got one.

187
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,380
Gosh! You’re awesome.

188
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,430
Can I have it?

189
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,550
Hey. Give it back.

190
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,210
It’s mine. I wanted it first.

191
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,110
You didn’t even play.

192
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,030
I want one.

193
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,110
Look at them. Everyone has one.

194
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,050
Ready?

195
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,920
Kids these days...

196
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,900
What’s up?

197
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,780
Nothing.

198
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,660
Mr. Nut,

199
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,850
do you ever feel like we’re unlucky

200
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,850
not to be kids in this generation?

201
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,630
Why would I think that?

202
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,850
Think about it.

203
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,520
No corporal punishment.

204
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,670
No school uniforms.

205
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,080
The world’s more open.

206
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,270
Society has advanced.

207
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,450
They have so many choices.

208
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,550
They can be whoever they want,

209
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,650
do whatever they want,

210
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,480
and even love whoever they want.

211
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,020
Kids today don’t have to

212
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,840
live in fear like we did.

213
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,910
It makes sense that

214
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,330
the newer generation has it better.

215
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,090
But I think being a teenager

216
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,090
in any era has its own charm.

217
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,850
Mr. Tan, do you regret your teenage years?

218
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,690
What are you talking about?

219
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,870
I’m just…

220
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,550
You’re right.

221
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,700
My teenage years were meaningless.

222
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,430
I guess I’m just jealous of the students.

223
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,200
They get to celebrate after exams,

224
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,690
while teachers like us
are stuck grading their papers.

225
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,210
Then, how about we

226
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,550
celebrate after we finish grading?

227
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,560
Can we even celebrate?

228
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,320
We’ve got a mountain of work.

229
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,260
School breaks are heaven for students,

230
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,840
but hell for teachers like us.

231
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,170
Where should we go?

232
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,900
Then…

233
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,450
I’ll book us a table somewhere.

234
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,220

235
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,210

Are you guys hungry?

245
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,720
Kit and I can go get us
a spot at the hot pot place.

246
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,400
We can just all go together.

247
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,190
But there’s always a long wait,

248
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,740
and we can’t reserve online.

249
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,310
Kit and I will go line up first.

250
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,660
Come on, Kit.

251
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,830
Grab your bag.

252
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,240
They just want some sweet, alone time.

253
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,790
Or maybe they’re tired of your voice.

254
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,720
Rude, asshole.

255
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,120
I’m the main vocalist, you know.

256
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,080
I sing really well.

262

MRS. PAAN

263
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,850
Is something wrong?

264
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,560
No, Mon.

265
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,370
I’ll be right back.

266
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,290
Yes, Mrs. Paan?

267
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,680
When is Mon coming home?

268
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,440
Uh… don’t worry, ma’am.

269
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,470
We’re just hanging out

270
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,710
at the mall with some friends.

271
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,280
I asked when you’re bringing Mon home.

272
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,150
10 PM.

273
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,690
And you’re not drinking

274
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,050
or doing anything risky, right?

275
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,470
Of course not, ma’am.

276
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,369
I’ll take the best care of Mon.

277
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,920
Then 10 PM it is.

278
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,109
I expect Mon home safe and sound.

279
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,550
Can we make it 11 PM instead?

280
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,880
Okay, 10 PM it is.

281
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,070
Shane and Kit already got us
a table at the hot pot place.

282
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,550
Let’s go, I’m starving.

283
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,540
Come on.

284
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,960
Go.

285
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,880
What did my mom call you about this time?

286
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,190
She just wanted to know
what time you’ll be home.

287
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,270
Come on, we still have time to have fun.

288
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,350
Right?

289
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,870
Right? Right? Right?

290
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,640
Is that right?

291
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,280
Let’s go.

292
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,720
Hot pot’s waiting.

293
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,590
Come on.

294
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,770
Whoa!

295
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,760
Kim!

296
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,520
Leave some for the rest of us!

297
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,880
Just order more.

298
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,880
No need to make a fuss.

299
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,200
It’s a buffet.

300
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,830
Here, eat up.

301
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,210
Drink? Let me feed you.

302
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,110
Good?

303
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,860
I want that.

304
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,230
Here.

305
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,550
It’s okay, you can have it.

306
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,050
Just eat. I peeled it for you.

307
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,740
I’m gonna use the bathroom.

308
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,840
That serves you right!

309
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,760
You said you were going to the bathroom.

310
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,660
Avoiding the uncomfortable.

311
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,470
Who’s uncomfortable?

312
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,890
Kit, whatever it is, just say it.

313
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,930
Why didn’t you eat
the shrimp I peeled for you?

314
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,680
Seriously?

315
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,580
You’re upset about that?

316
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,890
Why can’t I hold your hand
in front of your friends?

317
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,850
I can’t put my arm around you
or walk hand in hand.

318
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,410
If you’re not uncomfortable, then what is it?

319
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,860
If I were uncomfortable,

320
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,870
I wouldn’t have brought you here

321
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:01,670
to hang out with my friends.

322
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,450
If Kim hadn’t invited me,

323
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,950
would you have even thought to bring me?

324
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,910
I’m leaving.

325
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,600
Kit, don’t be like this.

326
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,220
If you leave, I won’t be chasing after you.

327
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,420
I don’t expect you to.

328
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,490
Where’s Kit?

329
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,210
He left.

330
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,490
What?

331
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,880
Why?

332
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,070
He was doing a great job peeling shrimp for us.

333
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,590
How about you do it yourself?

334
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,690
For the salad, I’ll go with the Insalata.

335
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,280
For the pizza, can I have the Burrata one?

336
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,860
And for the grill,

337
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,190
I’ll take the mixed grill, please.

338
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,400
Mr. Tan, are you ready to order?

339
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,220
I’ll have this one. 280 baht.

340
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:39,750
Yes, sir.

341
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,590
That’s all.

342
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,880
It’s a school break celebration.

343
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,790
Should we get some wine?

344
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,540
Do you have any recommendations?

345
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,710
Just a moment, please.

346
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,820
This one’s our current best seller.

347
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,300
It pairs perfectly with the dishes you ordered.

348
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,040
Easy to drink.

349
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,680
Just 6,000 baht.

350
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,170
All right, then.

351
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,290
Hold on.

352
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Maybe not right now.

353
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,310
Mr. Nut, we need to talk.

354
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,890
About what?

355
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,310
This place is expensive.

356
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,790
Don’t worry.

357
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,810
I planned to treat you.

358
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,130
Why would you do that?

359
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,870
Well...

360
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,250
It’s just a meal.

361
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,640
We could’ve gone somewhere
more affordable and split the bill.

362
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,220
But it’s our first date.

363
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,880
I wanted to impress you.

364
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,440
Impress me with all this pricey food?

365
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,050
Wait.

366
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,880
Did you just say date?

367
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,390
Yes, I did.

368
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,130
Why?

369
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,400
Because I like you.

370
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,150
That’s crazy.

371
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,860
Don’t be ridiculous.

372
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,530
Are you sure you like me?

373
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,530
Why would you ask that?

374
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,960
How am I supposed to believe that?

375
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,520
You’re hot and handsome.

376
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,650
Why would you like me?

377
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,990
It’d make more sense if I liked you.

378
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,620
I don’t have anything good going for me.

379
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,760
I’m almost 30.

380
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:13,050
No one’s ever liked me. Not even once.

381
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,240
That’s not true.

382
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,130
What?

383
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,720
I don’t believe someone

384
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,020
as lovely as you has never been liked.

385
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,480
But the real issue is, you don’t like yourself.

386
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,290
I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

387
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,350
Thank you so much, Mr. Tan,

388
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,020
for keeping me company tonight.

389
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,630
Mr. Nut.

390
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,370
Mr. Nut!

391
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,570
Wait.

392
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,510
I’m sorry.

393
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,110
I just wasn’t sure if I was right for you.

394
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,100
You’re right.

395
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,990
The issue is that I don’t like myself enough.

396
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,400
But I’m really glad to know you like me too.

397
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,550
Can we please get back to our date?

398
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,850
Some things in life just

399
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,390
don’t come back once they pass.

400
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,560
Just kidding.

401
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,190
I’m glad you gave me a chance.

402
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,140
Let’s go back inside.

403
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,870
But you don’t have to pay for me.

404
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,810
I mean,

405
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,200
I’ll cover the food,

406
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,880
and you take care of the wine.

407
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,950
Okay.

408
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,660
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

409
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,020
Where should we go next?

410
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,030
Right.

411
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,240
What else is there to do?

412
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,030
Should we just head home, Mon?

413
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,720
What’s the rush?

414
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,360
It’s only 8 PM.

415
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,330
It’s school break.

416
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,590
No school.

417
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,590
We should go have some fun.

418
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,600
Doing what?

419
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,360
There’s a party tonight at Earth’s house.

420
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,310
He said we could come.

421
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,070
Who’s Earth?

422
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,110
Earth!

423
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,800
A senior from our school.

424
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,880
Oh, the football player?

425
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,110
No, that’s Oat.

426
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,320
Earth’s the one whose dad’s a film director.

427
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,790
Earth made an award-winning short film.

428
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:02,270
He’s throwing a party tonight.

429
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,330
Want to go?

430
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,530
But we don’t even know him.

431
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,280
Can we just show up?

432
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,960
But I know him.

433
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,070
When I asked, he said,

434
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,640
“Tar, come by!”

435
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,910
“Bring as many friends as you want.”

436
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,890
It’s a college party.

437
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,450
It’s gonna be fun.

438
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,130
Maybe...

439
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:26,080
there’s little alcohol for us to taste.

440
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,340
If there’s alcohol, Mon’s not going.

441
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,340
Let’s go. It sounds fun.

442
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,810
Mon!

443
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,270
Kim, we’re in 12th grade.

444
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,880
I’ve never been to a party, not once.

445
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,660
Can’t we go just this once?

446
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,950
Please? I really want to.

447
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,440
Okay.

448
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,800
I’m going.

449
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,310
Per’s going.

450
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,650
Mon’s going.

451
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,530
If you don’t want to, that’s your call.

452
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,590
If Mon’s going, then I’m going too.

453
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,010
Yeah!

454
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,870
But it’s okay if you don’t want to.

455
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,470
You probably won’t enjoy it anyway. I get it.

456
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,160
There’s no reason for me not to go.

457
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,970
I’m free tonight.

458
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,440
I don’t have to spend time with anyone.

459
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,130
I can go wherever I want.

460
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,790
Are we going?

461
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,410
What are we waiting for?

462
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,490
Yes, sir!

463
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,550
We’re going.

464
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,020
Let’s go.

465
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,740
Whoa!

466
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:36,000
This party looks straight out
of a Hollywood movie.

467
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,820
Are you looking for the host?

468
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,030
No, I’m looking for drinks.

469
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,300
I’m trying to figure out
where everyone’s getting theirs.

470
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,840
Shouldn’t we find this Earth guy first?

471
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,300
Why bother?

472
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,750
We find the alcohol first.

473
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,450
We haven’t even finished high school.

474
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,530
We shouldn’t be drinking.

475
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,990
Shane, yell at him.

476
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,990
Why would I?

477
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,300
I kinda want to try it too.

478
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,160
Let’s check over there.

479
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,920
Right.

480
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,580
Don’t even think about it.

481
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,420
You’re staying here with me.

482
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,500
If they want to drink, let them.

483
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,850
But you and I are not drinking.

484
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,710
I just want to have fun.

485
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,880
We can have fun without drinking.

486
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:28,700
Really?

487
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,090
I’ll prove to you that

488
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,090
we can have fun without drinking.

489
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,200
Come.

490
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,060
Where?

491
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,220
To where the fun is.

492
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,820
Per, should we go check upstairs?

493
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,600
Sure.

494
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:44,429
TAR DRAGGED ME TO
HIS SENIOR FRIEND’S PARTY.

495
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,489
MHM.

496
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,830
Yo, guys!

497
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,070
More beers over here.

498
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,210
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

499
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,800
GOT THE GUTS TO DRINK IT? LOL!

500
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,330
YOU DON’T USUALLY
HAVE THE GUTS TO DO ANYTHING.

501
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,330
Ugh, there’s no alcohol up here.

502
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,290
How is that even possible?

503
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,030
Everyone looks totally wasted.

504
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,630
Why are you so desperate to get drunk?

505
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,010
I just want to try something new.

506
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,320
If not now, then when?

507
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,870
Don’t you want to try it too?

508
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,950
I already have.

509
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:11,720
Really?

510
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,680
My dad let me try some back in 10th grade.

511
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,200
What? You’ve got a head start on me?

512
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,200
It’s not a race.

513
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,330
You’ll get your turn eventually.

514
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,690
No need to rush.

515
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,990
If I knew there’d be no drinks,

516
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,080
I wouldn’t have bothered coming.

517
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,040
Let’s go! Game time.

518
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,620
Wait.

519
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,720
Let’s go.

520
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,960
Our beer’s here!

521
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,140
You guys ready?

522
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,050
Pass the cups! Pass the cups!

523
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,670
Come on, come on.

524
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,210
Pass me your cup.

525
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,690
Who are you guys?

526
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,540
Never mind. Just drink!

527
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,970
Gimme your cup.

528
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,620
Quick!

529
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,250
That’s awesome.

530
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,690
Truth or dare!

531
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,460
Come on!

532
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,550
Hello.

533
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,810
(Why do you have to be so mad?)

534
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,920
(Come here and talk to me.)

535
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,430
Are you drunk?

536
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,300
(Drunk, my ass!)

537
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,630
(Get over here.)

538
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,040
(If you don’t come right now,

539
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,580
don’t ever talk to me again.)

540
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,400
Share your location.

541
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:17,870
Hey, Kit.

542
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,990
What brings you here?

543
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,680
Hi, Earth.

544
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,890
My friend invited me.

545
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:25,990
His name’s Tar.

546
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,270
Tar who?

547
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,480
Shane.

548
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,370
Are you alright?

549
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,880
How many bottles have you had?

550
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,990
Just one.

551
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,820
One, and you’re this drunk?

552
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,630
Do you feel sick?

553
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,640
Aren’t you mad at me anymore?

554
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,220
Still mad, but I’m worried about you.

555
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,750
You asked me here to talk,

556
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,110
are you even able to talk?

557
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,060
Honestly, today…

558
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,850
it’s not that I disliked what you did.

559
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,470
I just…

560
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,610
didn’t know how to act.

561
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I’ve never been in a relationship before.

562
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,850
I don’t know how to act right.

563
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,320
When people see us together,

564
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,300
I’m worried about…

565
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,440
what they might think.

566
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,240
Will they be okay

567
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,430
if you and I…

568
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,900
love each other?

569
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,090
I’m sorry for caring so much

570
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,690
about what people think

571
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,510
that I forgot about your feelings.

572
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,090
Unless we cause them trouble,

573
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,440
people won’t pay much attention to us.

574
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,270
Is it really that simple?

575
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,020
See?

576
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,150
We’re holding hands,

577
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,790
and no one’s looking.

578
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,610
So if I just fall asleep right here,

579
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,090
no one will care, right?

580
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,190
Right.

581
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,620
But you’re not really asleep, are you?

582
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,880
Hey!

583
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,730
What are you doing?

584
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,130
See? No one’s paying attention to us.

585
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,050
Believe me now?

586
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:23,880
0% ALCOHOL

587
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,270
Why did you wake me up so early?

588
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,270
Today’s the first day of the second semester.

589
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,370
Gosh, you’re right!

590
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,200
If I want to be an honorable student,

591
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,620
I need more achievements.

592
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,040
I’ll help you come up with ideas.

593
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:54,880
Thanks, Mon.

594
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,010
You’re so sweet.

595
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,910
You’re sweet too, Kim.

596
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,640
So, no one’s home today?

597
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,010
Can I sleep over to keep you company?

598
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,180
You can wear this.

599
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,000
No, it’s too hot.

600
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,280
I told you to wear it.
