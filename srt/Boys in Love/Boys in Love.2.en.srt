1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,510
I didn’t win a single round of any game.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,600
Take it easy.

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,990
Keep practicing, and you will win eventually.

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:06,970
That sounds familiar.

5
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,780
It’s what you told me.

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,810
I happened to find
the book you were looking for.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,380
Happened to?

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:16,730
Ouch!

9
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,360
How about I treat you to a meal in return?

10
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,090
Sound good?

11
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:19,910
Yes.

12
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,330
Why’s he treating only you?

13
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,240
See you tomorrow.

14
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,590
See you tomorrow.

15
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,050

Hi, there.

23
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,660
You hungry?

24
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,130
Hello. Sorry, I overslept.

25
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,270
Shane.

26
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,780
Shane!

27
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,079
Can you cover the electric bill?

28
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,920
I’ll pay you back at the end of the month.

29
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,160
Thank you.

30
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,710
Yes, I’m on my way!

31
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,980
Shane, are you done?

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,250
Shane!

33
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,680
I’m about to explode here!

34
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,400
I can’t hold it.

35
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,410
ARE YOU UP?

36
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,390
Your alarm’s blasting this loud,

37
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,380
how are you still asleep?

38
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,110
Kit, wake up.

39
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,400
Don’t you have plans with Shane this morning?

40
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,620
You’re going to be late.

41
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,670
Here. It’s done.

42
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,010
PAY THE INTERNET BILL TOO.
YOU’LL GET IT ALL BACK BY THE END OF THE MONTH.

43
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,180
Is that your cat?

44
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,170
No.

45
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,220
My little sister got it from
the neighbor who moved out.

46
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,210
Now it’s my burden.

47
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,670
It’s pretty cute.

48
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,870
Pretty smart, too.

49
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,320
It adjusted super fast

50
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,130
and always comes when I call.

51
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,500
You know, it somehow knows when I wake up.

52
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,770
It shows up right after I wake up
and starts being all clingy.

53
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,660
But it’s not your cat, huh?

54
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
It can’t be mine.

55
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,340
I’m still trying to find it a new home.

56
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,860
Where were you playing?

57
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,250
You look messy.

58
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,130
Where are you going?

59
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,600
HAS ANYONE ADOPTED THE CAT YET?

60
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,090
SOMEBODY HAS. SORRY.

61
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,340
Are you clean yet?

62
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,680
Maybe it’s not very cute.

63
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,770
I’ve had my post up for days,

64
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,280
but no one’s reached out yet.

65
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,310
Oh, yeah?

66
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,850
Can I adopt it then?

67
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,950
I’ve been wanting a cat.

68
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,740
Are you sure you can handle a pet?

69
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,220
There’s no way I’d let my cat live with you.

70
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:16,800
What are you laughing at?

71
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,280
Nothing.

72
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:19,900
So, what’s the result?

73
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,470
How many problems did I get right?

74
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,070
You got three out of ten.

75
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,290
Yes!

76
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,410
That’s a new high.

77
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,780
That’s not even half.

78
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,010
Why are you so happy?

79
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,310
At least it’s progress.

80
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,440
I usually don’t get any problems right.

81
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,659
It’s what happens when you have a great tutor.

82
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,810
Anyway,

83
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,650
let’s go over the ones you got wrong.

84
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,800
You need to switch the sides before solving it.

85
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,930
I’ve told you many times.

86
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,270
Which sign should you do first?

87
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,160
The division sign?

88
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,700
What’s the result of this divided by this?

89
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,390
16?

90
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,650
After we’re done dividing, what comes next?

91
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,910
The multiplication sign?

92
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,590
Correct.

93
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,810
So, what’s the result of this multiplication?

94
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,130
I don’t know.

95
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,180
It times one. How do you not know that?

96
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,410
I honestly don’t.

97
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,600
What times what again?

98
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,020
We already got 16, and then 16 times 1.

99
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,100
Five.

100
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,680
Five?

101
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,960
The main reason I’m not canceling the policy

102
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,960
and want to move it forward is that

103
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,250
I don’t see it as just about clothes.

104
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:54,800
It’s really about giving you
the opportunity to discover yourselves,

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,300
express who you truly are,

106
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,670
and, most importantly, find happiness.

107
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,170
STUDENT CLUB LISTINGS

108
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,850
Mon.

109
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,990
Hey, Kim.

110
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,550
Checking out the clubs?

111
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,780
Mm.

112
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,000
There are so many here.

113
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,130
Some are kind of weird.

114
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,200
Like this one. What even is it?

115
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,280
HAPPY VIBES HAPPY LIFE CLUB

116
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,120
This one?

117
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,980
It’s for students who just want to
chill and earn easy credits.

118
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,480
But we’ll never be fast enough to get in.

119
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,870
The second registration opens, it’s full.

120
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,710
People say you even have to
bribe the teachers to get in.

121
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:40,620
Seriously?

122
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,500
That actually happens?

123
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,559
Mm.

124
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,210
Well, it is ‘school’ after all.

125
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,900
So, which club are you applying to, Kim?

126
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,720
Ah! I'm joining the Spooky...

127
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,450
SPOOKY STORIES CLUB

128
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,100
I mean… the Literature Club.

129
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,180
Yeah, the Literature Club.

130
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,340
Same here.

131
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,730
I thought I’d have to apply alone.

132
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,010
I’ll see you there then.

133
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,370
Yes.

134
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,960
See you.

135
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,660
Bye.

136
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,570
Aw.

137
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,000
He’s so damn cute.

138
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,500
All right, students. It’s now your club period.

139
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,110
Today is your first session,

140
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,180
and you’ll need to apply
to the club that interests you.

141
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,720
Please note that each club has limited spots.

142
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,570
Be active.

143
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,940
If you're too slow to register,
you’ll have to find another club to join.

144
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,520
Shane.

145
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,090
Shane.

146
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,400
Wanna play football?

147
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,600
No. I don’t know how.

148
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,970
Aren’t you in a hurry to register for a club?

149
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,760
Why should I be?

150
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:16,920
I’ve still got plenty of time.

151
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,700
Which club are you joining?

152
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,170
Let me guess, the Math Club?

153
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,110
You think you know me that well?

154
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,200
You’re just predictable.

155
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,970
Actually, I kind of want to try
something different,

156
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,120
since it’s my last year here.

157
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,040
But I still haven’t figured out which club to join.

158
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,130
Then let’s go exploring.

159
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,840
Come on. I’ll help you find the perfect club.

160
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,910
Where are we going?

161
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,830
- Just follow me.
- Where are we going?

162
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,530
PHOTO CLUB

163
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,480
How about…

164
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,610
CLASSICAL MUSIC CLUB

165
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,500
What about that?

166
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,930
CROSSWORD CLUB

167
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,230
What the heck?

168
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,880
Go for easier words.

169
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,690
Yeah!

170
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,120
How did he come up with that?

171
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,170
It’s awesome.

172
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,260
Do it.

173
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,200
Do it.

174
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,100
Do it.

175
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,960
Do it.

176
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,000
That club?

177
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,370
DIY CLUB

178
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,180
This one, then.

179
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,650
SEPAK TAKRAW CLUB

180
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,560
That one?

181
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,370
Look.

182
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,730
SWIMMING CLUB

183
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,440
This one.

184
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,240
This is a great idea, Shane.

185
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,200
A great student like you
should exercise to stay healthy.

186
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,190
I don’t know how to swim, so I want to learn.

187
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,870
Besides swim trunks,

188
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,390
what else should I bring, sir?

189
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,050
Nothing, because you’re not getting
in the water anyway.

190
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,420
Excuse me?

191
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,500
The school pool is reserved
for the swim team only.

192
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,310
As for the rest of you,
you’ll be practicing swimming on land.

193
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,790
On land?

194
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,350
Yes.

195
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,900
Alright, everyone.

196
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,590
Stretch your arms.

197
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,680
Stretch, stretch.

198
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,880
You’re doing it differently
from the others again.

199
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,610
That?
COFFEE CLUB

200
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,090
What about this?

201
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,720
That one.

202
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,370
TABLE TENNIS CLUB

203
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,830
Well, then.

204
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,190
This one.

205
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,150
I’d like to join this club

206
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,550
because I want to develop
my strategic thinking skills

207
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,030
and apply them to everyday life.

208
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,280
GO CLUB

209
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,300
Well, I think…
GO CLUB

210
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,460
Great. Just a whole lineup of stupid clubs.

211
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,960
Chill out, Shane.

212
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,270
There are still tons of clubs.

213
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,860
You’ll find something that fits.

214
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,740
Just stop.

215
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,520
I already feel a lot stupider.

216
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,990
I’m going back to the Math Club.

217
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,710
You’re blowing this way out of proportion.

218
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,520
No, I’m not.

219
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,240
Will you chill?

220
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,740
They’re just clubs.

221
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,140
It’s a free period for students
to do something fun together.

222
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,010
Why are you so serious?

223
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,050
Maybe try laughing for once.

224
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,080
I don’t want to laugh.

225
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,610
If I’m going to waste time on something,

226
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,080
I at least want to know what I’m getting out of it.

227
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,200
Why would I waste my time on nonsense?

228
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,850
Do you have to be so intense about everything?

229
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,490
Are you even okay living like this?

230
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,600
I’m done talking to you.

231
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,900
Someone like you wouldn’t understand anyway.

232
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,360
Hey!

233
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,350
What’s that supposed to mean?

234
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,900
You’re rich.

235
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,010
You’ve got your parents backing you.

236
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,320
You can screw around

237
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,700
and still have someone to fall back on.

238
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,460
I don’t have that luxury,

239
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,720
and I don’t want it either.

240
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:21,930
Okay!

241
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,980
Are you mad now?

242
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,740
You asked me, and I gave you the truth.

243
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,960
Don’t get all offended.

244
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,450
Go back to your precious Math Club.

245
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,420
I’ll go to mine.

246
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,220
You have a club already?

247
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,770
What club?

248
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,770
Happy Vibes Happy Life.

249
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,440
Of course!

250
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,880
Why am I not surprised?

251
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,410
CHINNAPAT METHAPAN CLASS 6/1

252
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,900
I thought you’d run off to some other club.

253
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,930
MATH CLUB

254
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,060
I’m kidding.

255
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,380
I know you wouldn’t survive in any of those.

256
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,700
No, I mean,

257
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,700
you would never join a different club.

258
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,460
This one suits you best.

259
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,020
Anyway, these are the latest math
midterm problems from a university exam.

260
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,400
I got them from a friend
who teaches there for you guys to practice.

261
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,670
Give them a shot.

262
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,610
LITERATURE CLUB

263
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,060
So this is our first day.

264
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,120
Why don’t we start by

265
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,100
sharing one of your favorite books?

266
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,730
Let’s begin with Mon.

267
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,150
I have too many favorites.

268
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,680
It’s hard to choose.

269
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,100
Just name the first one that comes to mind.

270
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,540
Well, then I’ll go with…

271
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,740
Hamlet by William Shakespeare.

272
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,140
It’s about the struggle for the crown
among highborn people.

273
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,600
They battle to outwit one another.

274
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,790
After reading that,

275
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,700
I moved on to The Merchant of Venice,

276
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,650
King Lear, and Twelfth Night.

277
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,690
I've been a Shakespeare fan ever since.

278
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,950
I’ve only read Romeo and Juliet.

279
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,890
Really? I’ve read that too.

280
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,070
Have you read A Midsummer Night's Dream?

281
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,470
Not yet, sir.

282
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,710
I haven’t been able to find a copy.

283
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,230
I’ll lend you mine.

284
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,650
You can’t skip that one.

285
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,830
All right, next.

286
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,410
My favorite has to be To Kill a Mockingbird.

287
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,180
The Catcher in the Rye.

288
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,940
I can’t pick just one.

289
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,900
Can I go with my favorite author instead?

290
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,920
No author in the world can write a tragedy

291
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,800
that expresses the beauty of humanity

292
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,510
better than Albert Camus.

293
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,319
Mother by Maxim Gorky.

294
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,609
It was translated by Jit Phumisak,

295
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,680
the Arts student from CU
who’s brutally thrown off the stage.

296
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,869
War and Peace.

297
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,400
I haven’t finished it, but I like it so far.

298
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,390
Am I the only one here who reads sci-fi?

299
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,400
I honestly can’t choose between

300
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,130
The Time Machine by H.G. Wells

301
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,640
and Dune by Frank Herbert.

302
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,450
But since Dune is trending now,

303
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,319
I’ll go with The Time Machine.

304
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,270
Nah, the best sci-fi is definitely Foundation.

305
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,280
I don’t think so.

306
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,000
Out of all Isaac Asimov’s works,

307
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,400
I love The End of Eternity the most.

308
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,110
All right, all right.

309
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,010
Save the debate for later.

310
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,700
Kim, you’re the last one.

311
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,380
Tell us one of your favorite books.

312
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:52,970
Doraemon!

313
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,880
Doraemon?

314
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,470
Did he really say Doraemon?

315
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:09,990
Ahem.

316
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,400
Kim, why don’t you tell us

317
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,050
why you like Doraemon?

318
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,520
Uh…

319
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,700
Because it’s fun.

320
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:33,300
My favorite chapter is the one
where Doraemon goes back to the future,

321
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,380
but Nobita drinks the lying potion

322
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,910
and says Doraemon will never return.

323
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,670
In the end, it turns out to be a lie,

324
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,840
and Doraemon does come back to Nobita.

325
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,890
That chapter taught me that

326
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,690
just because something feels impossible

327
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,920
doesn’t mean it won’t happen.

328
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,830
Did you know that the ending only happened

329
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,370
because the publisher forced
the author to continue the story

330
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,580
after it was supposed to end?

331
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,250
The best one is when
they time travel to the Stone Age.

332
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,210
Hey, don’t count the special chapters!

333
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,680
I like the one with magic.

334
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,560
I think it’s fun.

335
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,860
Have you seen the one with dinosaurs?

336
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,980
I love that one!

337
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,010
Aren’t you in a hurry to apply to a club?

338
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:02,900
Nah.

339
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,250
They’ll save me a spot anyway.

340
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,380
What about you?

341
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,260
I created a chat group
for people joining the same club.

342
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,740
We’re only eight members so far,

343
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,060
and the club allows 50,

344
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,700
so there are plenty of spots left.

345
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
What club are we talking about?

346
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,620
Films for Social Change Club.

347
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,720
Damn. That sounds unrealistic.

348
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,270
Per, do you think our friend is in love?

349
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,550
Do you really need to ask?

350
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,680
He’s been courting Mon nonstop.

351
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,030
I’m not talking about Kim.

352
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:36,950
I’m talking about Shane.

353
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,790
What?

354
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,590
Shane has a crush?

355
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,270
Yeah.

356
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,800
He’s always hanging out with
Kit from Class Losers.

357
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,800
He’s just tutoring him.

358
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,770
Oh, come on. Can't you see it?

359
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,110
Sometimes, I’m so sick of talking to you.

360
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,240
He tutors Kit in the morning, during lunch,

361
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,860
and after school at his house.

362
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,510
Have you ever seen Shane
spend so much time with anyone else?

363
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,480
Hey! Are you even listening?

364
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,240
Didn’t you just say you’re sick of talking to me?

365
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,800
I used to think you and Kim would be taken first,

366
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,300
and that’s fine because
Shane’d stay single, just like me.

367
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,300
But if Shane’s dating someone,

368
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,690
I’ll be left all alone.

369
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,900
No. I won’t leave you alone.

370
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,500
I’m not stupid enough to believe that.

371
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,420
It’s cold, you jackass.

372
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,150
Who said it’s hot, dumbass?

373
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,900
It was fun today.

374
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:49,800
Mm.

375
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,410
I’ve got to head out now.

376
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,470
I have cram school pretty soon.

377
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,920
I’ll see you later.

378
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,810
I’m not in the mood for a tutoring session today.

379
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,060
Are you still mad at me
for what happened at school?

380
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,150
Do I even have the right to be mad?

381
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,170
Why are you asking that?

382
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,710
Anger is one of the fundamental emotions

383
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,070
that help humans feel safe...

384
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,500
Okay.

385
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,760
I said something bad to you.

386
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,100
It’s fine if you’re angry with me.

387
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,450
So?

388
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,450
Now that you know I’m mad,

389
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,500
are you going to make it up to me?

390
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,150
Hey,

391
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,800
what do you think I’m doing?

392
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,070
Fine.

393
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,660
What should I do to show you I’m sorry?

394
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,270
Do this dance.

395
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,540
No way!

396
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,400
Then leave.

397
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,240
Damn it. Will you stop being so ridiculous?

398
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,540
Right.

399
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,050
So, apologizing to me is ridiculous to you?

400
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,970
Then explain how this stupid dance

401
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,980
has anything to do with me apologizing.

402
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,980
Will you stop being
so academic for five minutes?

403
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,470
Are you dancing or not?

404
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,780
Damn you.

405
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,350
You’re still here?

406
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,740
Don’t laugh.

407
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,430
I tried my best.

408
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,830
It’s all I’ve got.

409
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,730
Will you stop being mad now?

410
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,430
No.

411
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,920
I haven’t seen it with my own eyes.

412
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,910
Can you show me the dance again?

413
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,430
That’s too much.

414
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,060
Fine, I’m kidding.

415
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,960
Back on good terms?

416
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,600
Please.

417
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,210
Friends again.

418
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,460
Come on.

419
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,780
We’re cool now.

420
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,100
Are we cool?

421
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,770
- Yeah.
- Promise?

422
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,530
Yeah.

423
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,290
Really?

424
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,350
Whoa!

425
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,080
Yes!

426
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,010
I’m making progress again.

427
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,990
Just one more point.

428
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,590
You’re getting a bit too excited.

429
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,780
A smartass like you wouldn’t understand.

430
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,770
I usually get zero points,

431
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,830
but now I’m getting four.

432
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,000
Wouldn’t you be happy if you were me?

433
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,040
Kit…

434
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,980
I’m really sorry

435
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,590
for saying those things to you.

436
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,650
Why apologize?

437
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,770
Didn’t we already make up?

438
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,260
I haven’t told you the full truth.

439
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,090
At that moment, I was angry with myself.

440
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,460
I don’t like that I’m always
so serious about everything.

441
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,920
It’s like I’m stuck in a loop,

442
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,670
but I don’t know how to get out,

443
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,990
so I took it out on you.

444
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,220
Deep down,

445
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,410
I feel envious of you.

446
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,450
Envious of me?

447
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,740
Why would someone
as smart as you be envious of me?

448
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,160
Maybe because you can find happiness so easily,

449
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,740
which is something I struggle with.

450
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,780
Every time I start to enjoy myself,

451
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,210
there’s this voice whispering,

452
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,240
“This isn’t for you.”

453
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,790
“Go back to stressing over math.”

454
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,000
And I end up right back where I started,

455
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,300
doing math problems.

456
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,320
When I think one’s too easy,

457
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,280
I just move on to a harder one,

458
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,920
and I don’t even know why I’m doing it.

459
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,140
You can just ignore that voice.

460
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,200
Shout back,

461
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,300
“Leave me alone!”

462
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,160
“Let me have some fun sometimes!”

463
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:40,870
It’s too late.

464
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,870
I’m back in the Math Club.

465
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,920
I guess I’ll be stuck there for the year.

466
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,100
And it’s my last year.

467
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,700
That doesn’t have to be the end of it.

468
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,850
You know that...

469
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,300
there’s so much fun stuff
for us to do outside of school, right?

470
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,470
Come on.

471
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,900
Come with me.

472
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:11,660
Let’s go.

473
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,300
Where are we going?

474
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,180
Just trust me.

475
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,250
Let’s go.

476
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,960
What did you drag me here for?

477
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,670
To have fun.

478
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:35,920
Come on.

479
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,050
Hello.

480
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:37,860
Hello.

481
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,240
Hello.

482
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,100
Hey, Kit.

483
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,530
- Hi.
- Hi.

484
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,720
I brought a friend to join us today.

485
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,860
No problem.

486
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,970
We’ll be waiting for you inside.

487
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,640
Got it.

488
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,600
I know them from online games.

489
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,130
They’re all chill.

490
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,300
Don’t worry, they’re good people.

491
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,860
Here, let me help you with this.

492
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,100
Why do I have to wear this?

493
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,100
And what’s with all these lights?

494
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,030
Just go with it.

495
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,400
You’ll see.

496
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,140
Hey.

497
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,100
A gun?

498
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,960
Yeah, but it won’t hurt.

499
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,560
You actually look kind of cool.

500
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:35,980
This way.

501
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,890
Get down!

502
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,400
Damn it, Shane.

503
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,370
You’re supposed to shoot the other team.

504
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,910
Why are you firing at your own teammate?

505
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,070
The other team, huh?

506
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,190
Shane, don’t!

507
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,190
Where do you think you’re going?

508
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,720
What are you doing in my room?

509
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,300
Get up. You’re taking up my space.

510
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,170
I can’t.

511
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,970
I don’t have the energy.

512
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,900
I’m hurting.

513
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,300
He just rushed off to cram school.

514
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,590
Why are you even whining?

515
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,200
Per, that’s my towel.

516
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,270
Can I borrow it?

517
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,700
You’re supposed to ask before using it.

518
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,590
Yeah, yeah.

519
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,680
The thing is, Mon must’ve figured out by now

520
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,210
that I’m just superficial and shallow.

521
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,680
Mon reads Shakespeare’s works,

522
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,230
but I read Doraemon.

523
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,780
He must realize that we’re not compatible.

524
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,170
Love really does make people dumber.

525
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,200
I don’t think you can say that.

526
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,210
Our friend here was already pretty dumb.

527
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,570
MON

528
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,560
Kim, it’s your call.

529
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,930
I’m not talking to anyone.

530
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:57,930
But Mon is calling.

531
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:11,910
Hello, Mon.

532
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,990
Kim, I’ve reached the chapter
with the lying potion.

533
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,220
It’s really good, just like you said.

534
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,450
Actually, it’s probably because
you already analyzed it.

535
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,720
If I had read it on my own,

536
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,580
I don’t think I’d have seen it that deeply.

537
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:25,870
Wait.

538
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,500
Aren’t you mad at me, Mon?

539
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,390
Huh?

540
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,140
Why would I be mad?

541
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:34,830
Well, you didn’t talk to me at the club.

542
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,920
Are you crazy?

543
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,970
Okay, I’ll be honest.

544
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,330
I’d never read Doraemon before.

545
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,860
What?

546
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,400
Don’t tease me.

547
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,620
At first, I thought it was just some old comic

548
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,870
that was popular back in our parents’ time,

549
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,360
so I didn’t bother with it.

550
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,200
But when I saw everyone at the club had read it,

551
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,930
I felt kind of weird for not knowing it.

552
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah, weird.

553
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,410
It’s super popular,

554
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,490
and there’s an animated series too.

555
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,240
Didn’t you watch TV growing up?

556
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,020
Sorry.

557
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,980
People have their own tastes.

558
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,150
Right?

559
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,560
I was just embarrassed.

560
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,500
I felt like if I stayed,
I wouldn’t know what to say to you.

561
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,100
That’s why I rushed out
to buy the books and start reading.

562
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,330
So…

563
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,929
you’re not mad at me?

564
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,139
I really don’t know why you thought I was.

565
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,290
Right.

566
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,699
How delusional of me.

567
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,239
Anyway, thanks for

568
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,270
recommending such a great series.

569
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,489
If I’d never read it,

570
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,389
that would’ve been a real loss.

571
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,600
I’ll finish it soon so we can talk more about it.

572
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:51,520
Yes.

573
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,000
Looks like you’re having fun.

574
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,160
Here.

575
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,870
Regain your energy.

576
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,270
You’ve been shooting nonstop.

577
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,160
Thanks.

578
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,150
Can you pull this for me?

579
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,900
Next time, try not to shoot your teammates.

580
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,410
I know, I’m sorry.

581
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,650
Anyway, I’m just glad you liked it.

582
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,550
You said you wouldn’t.

583
00:35:58,930 --> 00:35:59,880
You mean the laser tag game?

584
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:00,770
I meant me.

585
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,060
What are you even talking about?

586
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,250
Hey, it’s me.

587
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,020
Don’t shoot.

588
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,410
Shane.

589
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:49,300
What?

590
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,770
About what happened at school...

591
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,230
I wasn’t really mad at you.

592
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,810
I was mad at myself

593
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,200
for being someone useless in your eyes.

594
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,170
I wanted you to see me
as someone better than that.

595
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,100
I don’t even know why.

596
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:33,750
Oh,

597
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,770
you're still here?

598
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:38,850
Yes.

599
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,140
I’m prepping lessons for tomorrow.

600
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,660
They’re called headphones.

601
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,150
Use them, so you don’t disturb other people.

602
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:12,580
(Next week, my friends and I
are going on a school field trip.)

603
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,470
(Kim’s planning to confess his feelings to Mon.)

604
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,750
I like you, Mon.

605
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,170
With that doll?

606
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,600
(As for me…)

607
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,210
(I have no idea)

608
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,600
(what’s going on between Kit and me.)

609
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,000
(Stick around and see what happens.)
