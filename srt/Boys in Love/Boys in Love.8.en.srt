1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,910
There’s a party tonight at Earth’s house.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,290
I just want to have fun.

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,430
I’ll prove to you that…

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,010
we can have fun without drinking.

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,630
Truth or dare!

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,930
I’m sorry…

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,100
for caring so much about what people think

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,560
Why can’t I hold your hands
in front of your friend?

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,660
that I forgot about your feelings.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,830
Nobody pays that much attention to us.

11
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,180
Truth or dare?!

12
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,330
Let’s go!

13
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,500
Who’s gonna get it?

14
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,960
It’s you, for sure.

15
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,800
Is it you?

16
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,180
No, it’s you.

17
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,960
Yeah!

18
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,570
So, what’s it gonna be?

19
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,520
Truth.

20
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,910
Let me think.

21
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,360
Let’s do this, an easy one.

22
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,890
Have you ever kissed anyone, bro?

23
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,360
I’ll just drink.

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,280
Oh, come on.

25
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,780
Hey, why don’t you answer that?

26
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
Embarrassed about kissing someone?

27
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,750
Nosy.

28
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,370
What?

29
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,730
What are you yelling at me for?

30
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,190
Hey, hey.

31
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,880
Chill out. No fighting.

32
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,450
Let’s get back to the game.

33
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,710
THIS IS KIT.

34
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,980
I’M TAKING SHANE HOME.

35
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,130
ME TOO.

36
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,490
I HAVE TO SEND MON HOME.

37
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,630
Everybody left.

38
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,940
Should we leave?

39
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,670
Yeah!

40
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,710
YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.

41
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,790
TAR AND I WILL LEAVE LATER.

42
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,670
It’s you.

43
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,670
What will you choose?

44
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,520
Come on, Mon. Quick.

45
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,390
We didn’t really have to hurry back.

46
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,550
We did.

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,610
I promised your mom

48
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,240
I’d get you home before 10.

49
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,520
You realize you care more
about my mom than you do me?

50
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,220
It’s not like that.

51
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,140
I just want her to know

52
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,310
I can take care of you...

53
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,630
because I really want to.

54
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,620
Okay?

55
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,550
Okay. Fine.

56
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,760
Come on.

57
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,210
Cheers.

58
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,790
Bottoms up, alright?

59
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,250
Gosh, I missed you all.

60
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,170
It’s been a while.

61
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,900
I’m sorry, Mrs. Paan.

62
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,900
We got a bit lost. That’s why we’re late.

63
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,709
Mom, what are you doing?

64
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,250
Hey.

65
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,600
You went out celebrating with your friends,

66
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,800
so I brought mine to celebrate too.

67
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,560
Why are you back so early?

68
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,000
You told me yourself

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,110
to bring Mon back before 10.

70
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,170
Fair enough.

71
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,840
I told you not to listen to her.

72
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,480
I knew she just wanted to mess with you.

73
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,280
Still, this is good.

74
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,940
It proves you keep your word

75
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,520
and that you can be trusted.

76
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,840
Thanks for taking care of Mon.

77
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,390
Yes, Mrs. Paan.

78
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,730
Outside of school, you can call me mom.

79
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,430
Yes, Mom!

80
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,090
Now that I get a good look,
your friends are all gorgeous, just like you.

81
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,850
Good evening. I’m Kim.

82
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,160
Hi there, dear.

83
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,810
It’s his turn.

84
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,880
Yeah!

85
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,850
Whoa!

86
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,890
Yeah!

87
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,640
I’m up for it!

88
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,970
So, truth or dare?

89
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,780
Dare.

90
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,400
Bring it on. I’m afraid of nothing.

91
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,640
Alright then...

92
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,520
kiss the person sitting opposite you.

93
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,510
Jeez!

94
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,320
Well, make a move, bro.

95
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,530
Do you have the guts?

96
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,230
If you don’t, just drink.

97
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,520
All of it.

98
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,060
Come on.

99
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,840
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.

100
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,350
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.

101
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,720
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.

102
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,310
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.

103
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,830
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.

104
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,470
Alright, I’ll kiss him.

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,690
That’s my boy!

106
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,710
Come on.

107
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,790
I’m taking my friend home. It’s late.

108
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,760
Hey, what are you doing?

109
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,690
- Time to go.
- Hey!

110
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,190
Move!

111
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,520
- I’m not leaving.
- Time to go.

112
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,240
What are you doing?

113
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:09,880
Quick.

114
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,900
I’m not leaving. I want to stay.

115
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,170
- Just move.
- Let go of me.

116
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,820
- Time to go.
- What’s wrong with you?

117
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,110
Per, will you let me go?

118
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,160
Per, dammit!

119
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,560
I was having fun, you jerk!

120
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,840
Fun, my ass.

121
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,870
They dared you to kiss a stranger.

122
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,870
Exactly!

123
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,650
I was about to get my first kiss.

124
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,760
My first kiss!

125
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,640
Kim and Shane are dating someone.

126
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,640
You have someone to talk to.

127
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,210
I’m the only one in the group who’s single.

128
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,810
And just when I was finally about to kiss someone,

129
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,520
you had to ruin it.

130
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,480
You, total cockblock!

131
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,510
So you’re just willing to kiss anyone?

132
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,030
Yes! I just want to kiss someone.

133
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,020
It doesn't matter who.

134
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,830
I’VE LEFT FOR HOME.
LOCK THE DOOR WHEN YOU LEAVE.
SEE YOU NEXT SEMESTER.

135
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,700
SECOND SEMESTER

136
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,440
Get up.

137
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,510
Five more minutes.

138
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,120
Nope. Get up now.

139
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,900
Three minutes.

140
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,900
Up!

141
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,060
Hey, Kit.

142
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,520
We’re going to be late.

143
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,290
Get up.

144
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,730
WELCOME TO THE SECOND SEMESTER

145
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,390
Let’s play football, man.

146
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,520
(Yo, what’s up?)

147
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,970
(The second semester’s here.)

148
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,470
(Welcome you all
back to Phadungpatsuksa School.)

149
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,590
So, have you figured out what X equals
from this morning’s problem?

150
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,130
I taught you three times.

151
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,400
Did you even listen?

152
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,310
I did.

153
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
Do I get a reward if I can answer it?

154
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,950
Guys, Mrs. Paan’s birthday
is coming up in two days.

155
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,030
So, I’m inviting you all to

156
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,750
pitch in for a birthday gift for her.

157
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:33,600
I truly believe students do better
when they have great teachers,

158
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,200
Mrs. Paan, for example.

159
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,730
MODEL STUDENTS 2025

160
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,130
Sir, this is a project I initiated.

161
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:08,200
We plan to select and celebrate ten well-behaved, high-achieving students

162
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,370
to help promote the quality of our teaching.

163
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,390
Their involvement will boost
the school’s reputation and image.

164
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,880
I think it’s a good idea.

165
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,000
Our school page followers are growing,

166
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,930
and with their contribution, our school
will become even more well-known.

167
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,290
What do you all think?

168
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,750
Sounds good, right?

169
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,710
Very good.

170
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,080
Could this cause students to feel pressured
to constantly compare themselves?

171
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,640
Also, what criteria will we use for selection?

172
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,290
It’s quite subjective.

173
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,530
I agree with Mr. Nut, sir.

174
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,240
However…

175
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,910
it’s not like this project is bad.

176
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:59,360
Model students could actually
inspire others to do good things too.

177
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,880
Okay.

178
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,620
There may be pros and cons,

179
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,870
but it won’t hurt to give it a try.

180
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,490
Right, sir?

181
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,870
That’s right.

182
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,490
I think we should go for it.

183
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,900
Mrs. Paan, please arrange
the judging panel for this project.

184
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,710
I already have
a few people in mind for the role.

185
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,380
No.

186
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,880
I told you I wouldn’t
get involved in this project.

187
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,090
I said I disagreed.

188
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,370
Did it even cross your mind to
take my side back there in the meeting room?

189
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,010
Oh, come on.

190
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,210
Don’t be mad.

191
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,080
You know Mrs. Paan’s going to find a way to make this project happen no matter what.

192
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,690
If we’re part of it,

193
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,870
at least we can keep her from doing whatever she wants.

194
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,860
Oh, really?

195
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,800
Or is it just that you want to kiss up to her?

196
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,600
What?

197
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,080
Of course, not.

198
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,950
Okay.

199
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,680
I’ve been stuck in this
storage room for two years.

200
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,530
I want a new office.

201
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,310
Then do it on your own.

202
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,580
Why drag me into it?

203
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,580
I’ve never worked with Mrs. Paan.

204
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,580
If something goes wrong…

205
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,580
it’d be nice to have you by my side.

206
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,650
Please help me, Mr. Nut.

207
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,220
Please?

208
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,630
Don’t make that face. I’m not falling for it.

209
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,380
Really?

210
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,350
Are you not falling for it?

211
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,260
You’re not helping me?

212
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,910
Come on, help me.

213
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,970
Mr. Handsome, please help me.

214
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,770
Are you really saying no?

215
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,550
Okay, okay.

216
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,650
Fine.

217
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,630
Since when did you
master the puppy-eye trick?

218
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,290
Hm?

219
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,680
Well…

220
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,320
probably since I got a boyfriend.

221
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,630
I’ll think of it as helping you,
not helping Mrs. Paan.

222
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,340
Thank you.

223
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,440
Don’t thank me just yet.

224
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,690
Because tonight, I’m collecting my reward.

225
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,240
SECONDARY 6 / WINNERS

226
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,250
Guys, Mrs. Paan said

227
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,100
the school is selecting model students.

228
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,110
We’re supposed to send at least
one representative from each class.

229
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,480
Who should we nominate?

230
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,670
Me! I volunteer.

231
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,550
Put my name down!

232
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,910
Per, can we nominate you?

233
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,110
No.

234
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,080
I barely have time after running practice.

235
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,770
Me! I’m free. Put my name.

236
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,340
Alright, Shane, we’ll send you.

237
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,340
Fill out the application form
and hand it to Mrs. Paan.

238
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,020
Thank you.

239
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,420
CALLING TAR

240
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,430
CALLING TAR

241
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,240
So you’re just willing to kiss anyone?

242
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,470
Yes! I just want to kiss someone.

243
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:03,880
WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME YOU CHANGED THE LOCK…

244
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,569
And he looked so serious.

245
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,970
I almost softened for him.

246
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,619
Oh my gosh.

247
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,480
Where have you been?

248
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,200
I lost my national ID card,

249
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,280
so I got it replaced this morning.

250
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,280
Per, did you and Tar really kiss?

251
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,370
I confirm, it really happened.

252
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,130
- Seriously?
- Yes!

253
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,620
I pretended to whine, “I don’t want to leave!”

254
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,710
“I want to kiss that guy first.”

255
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,560
So he goes, “Can anyone be your first kiss?”

256
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,390
He was literally like this!

257
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,020
I said, “Yes, anyone!”

258
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,490
Then he grabbed me.

259
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,210
And he went…

260
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,970
Hey, stop. Enough.

261
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,760
Who would’ve thought
I’d lose my first kiss to him?

262
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,360
Didn’t you get goosebumps?

263
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,020
I did. I still do now.

264
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,260
Move.

265
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,130
I thought he’d kiss me too.

266
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,130
I’m getting chills.

267
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,730
- Hi, Kim.
- Hi, Mrs. Paan.

268
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,630
Are those heavy? Let me help you.

269
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,020
Not this. Take these two instead.

270
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,270
Thanks a lot.

271
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,740
I’ll lead you to your office.

272
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,350
Sure.

273
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,890
Thanks. So, what can I do for you?

274
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,890
Have you seen my
model student application?

275
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,240
Yes, I have.

276
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,290
Thanks for taking an interest in the project.

277
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,940
So, how are my chances?

278
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,010
I’ll be honest…

279
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,920
Not qualified?

280
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,520
Mm.

281
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,950
Your mom said I don’t have enough qualities.

282
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,650
If I really want to be a model student,

283
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,650
I need more achievements.

284
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,150
Just drop it, Kim.

285
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,510
This model student thing is just nonsense.

286
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,430
You don’t need to be upset about it.

287
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,550
I’m not upset, Mon.

288
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,670
I still have a chance.

289
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,890
There’s one week left until the selection.

290
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,550
I still have time to accomplish something.

291
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,560
What do you think I should do
to catch the judges’ attention?

292
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,710
Are you serious?

293
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,440
Should I get active with Go Green?

294
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,780
Encourage people to
save the planet by using paper straws?

295
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,480
Or... should I push for students
to wear proper uniforms again?

296
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,090
Or… you can just do nothing.

297
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,970
Come on, Mon.

298
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,480
Help me think.

299
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,270
I don’t find it important, Kim.

300
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,270
I know you want to please my mom,

301
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,270
but you don’t have to go that far.

302
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,170
I just feel like I’m about to graduate,

303
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,850
so I should reach a point where I’m accepted.

304
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,880
Why do you feel you’re not accepted?

305
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,170
People like me because I’m funny

306
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,470
and fun to be around.

307
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,910
But I’m kind of seen as the class clown.

308
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,330
I mean…

309
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,470
I’m okay with that to some extent,

310
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,480
but whenever there’s a group assignment,

311
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,480
I’m always their last choice.

312
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,850
Sometimes, I even wonder if…

313
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,790
people see me as unreliable.

314
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,670
So I think if I become a model student,

315
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,610
people might see other sides of me,

316
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,950
not just the silly one.

317
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,540
Okay, I will help you think.

318
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,480
Thank you, Mon.

319
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,100
What if I start a waste-sorting campaign?

320
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,340
And maybe a study group
to help the juniors with homework?

321
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,680
That actually sounds great.

322
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,680
Why don’t we do both?

323
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,000
- Really?
- Mhm.

324
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,550
I’ll help you.

325
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,810
You’re so cute.

326
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,040
You’ve got this. I believe in you.

327
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,860
So, no one’s home?

328
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,640
Name went to see his friend in Pattaya.

329
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,800
Jin’s having dinner
with her colleagues from her internship.

330
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,570
And Cheese is away at Girl Scout camp.

331
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,780
With everyone gone,

332
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,120
your house is really quiet.

333
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,090
Quiet is good.

334
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,090
It’s usually a zoo in here.

335
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,310
Aren’t you lonely being home alone?

336
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,570
How could I be? I’ve got Kaiju with me.

337
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,470
Right?

338
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,090
I think it’s time for you to go.

339
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,580
I’m going to shower and head to bed.

340
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,510
I need to wake up early to study.

341
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,790
How can I leave?

342
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,440
If I do, you’ll be all alone.

343
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,660
Can I…

344
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,970
crash here to keep you company?

345
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,050
Why?

346
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,410
Isn’t it nice having me around?

347
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,810
Ah… I guess it is.

348
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,840
Maybe it is.

349
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,340
Nice.

350
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,230
Why are you shirtless?

351
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,770
Aren’t you cold?

352
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,430
I don’t have a shirt.

353
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,690
Why didn’t you say so?

354
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,220
I could’ve gotten one for you.

355
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,720
Wear this.

356
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,710
He looks just like you.

357
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,230
Very funny.

358
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,410
He really does.

359
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,000
Come on, put it on.

360
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,560
I get hot easily.

361
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,850
Since when? I didn’t know that.

362
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,200
No. I’m sleepy.

363
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,360
I’m going to sleep now.

364
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,460
I told you to wear it.

365
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,670
Kaiju is meowing. He’s probably hungry.

366
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,090
I’m gonna go feed him.

367
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,120
I’m going home.

368
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,130
What? I thought you were staying over.

369
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,030
Just realized I’ve got something to do
with my mom early in the morning.

370
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,550
You should get to bed.

371
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,410
I’ll see you at school tomorrow.

372
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,880
I’m off now.

373
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,830
Bye, Kaiju.

374
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,900
See you.

375
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,480
Hello! Welcome to
Five-Minute Knowledge with Mr. Kim.

376
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,260
Today, you’re going to learn something
you should know today, not tomorrow.

377
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,780
MR. KIM IS HERE.

378
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,860
MR. KIM IS HERE.

379
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,040
Keep sharing.

380
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,690
Have you seen Kim’s video?

381
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,980
Welcome to
Five-Minute Knowledge with Mr. Kim.

382
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,570
Mr. Kim!

383
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,010
RUSSIA IS THE LARGEST
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

384
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,880
THE CLOSEST PLANET
TO EARTH IS MERCURY.

385
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,970
Welcome to the Thai Language class.

386
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,800
Today, let’s talk about one of the most commonly mistransliterated words.

387
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,800
I’m talking about the word ‘carrot.’

388
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,600
People often use the wrong
consonant for the final “t” sound.

389
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,430
The correct one is Tor Tao.

390
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,240
Also, don’t forget to double
the Ro Ruea to match the double “r” in “carr.”

391
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:40,150
Pronunciation tip—say “care” like in the sentence, “Mon, I care about you.”

392
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,450
Easy to remember, right?

393
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,510
From now on,
we better check with Teacher Kim first.

394
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,840
5 TIPS TO HELP YOU READ FASTER

395
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,680
Which one do you want, this or this?

396
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,320
Are you seriously mad at me?

397
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,710
I’m not mad.

398
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,440
I just don’t want to talk to you.

399
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,850
Don’t be such a pain.

400
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,350
If you’re not talking to me,
then who are you gonna talk to?

401
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,960
You have that many friends?

402
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,170
I’m the only friend you’ve got.

403
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,260
Unless you want to
start chatting with the grass.

404
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,860
Are you seriously walking away?

405
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,730
Asshole, are you running?

406
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,030
Hey, Per, don’t run away from me.

407
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,230
Stop running.

408
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,790
Stop!

409
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,600
Will you stop?

410
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,310
You think we’re in
some kind of Indian movie or what?

411
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,860
Per, stop running away from me!

412
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,840
Why would you tell people about that?

413
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,700
About what?

414
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,000
Don’t play dumb, jackass.

415
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,270
Why couldn’t I tell people?

416
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,250
It’s the truth.

417
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,860
You did kiss me.

418
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,400
If I hadn’t kissed you that night,

419
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,870
would you have stopped acting so silly?

420
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,310
Fine. It was drunk.

421
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,680
I’ll be honest here.

422
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,970
I don’t like myself when I’m drunk.

423
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,690
I’m never drinking again.

424
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:17,980
Good.

425
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,820
I will remember that and keep my eye on you.

426
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,250
Honestly, I thought
you were mad at me over it.

427
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,290
No, I wasn’t.

428
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,070
You didn’t reply to my messages.

429
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,570
And you changed your
doorknob without telling me.

430
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,230
I was busy—duh.

431
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:58,600
I just got back to Bangkok today.

432
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,660
I lost my ID card, so I had to
go to the district office to get a new one.

433
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,570
Here. The new key, your spare.

434
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,150
You’re crazy if you think I was mad.

435
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,270
Do you regret having me as your first kiss?

436
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,410
No.

437
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,410
It’s good.

438
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,470
Better you than some
random stranger at a party.

439
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,290
Shit!

440
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,610
MR. TAN

441
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,230
(Shane, stop by the Student Welfare Department in the morning.)

442
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,190
What’s the matter, sir?

443
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,350
(You’ve been selected
as one of the model students.)

444
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,889
(You need to meet with Mrs. Paan.)

445
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,870
(Don’t be late.)

446
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,440
MODEL STUDENTS

447
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,140
It’s okay, Kim.

448
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,570
You did your best.

449
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,410
Mm.

450
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Maybe it just wasn’t
good enough to earn the title.

451
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,050
But you’re good enough for something else.

452
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,150
At least for me.

453
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,730
How lovely you are.

454
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,060
Whose boyfriend is this?

455
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,390
Feeling better now?

456
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,740
Mhm.

457
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,390
After that kind of consolation,
how could I not?

458
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,220
Right?

459
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:24,520
As Mr. Tan mentioned, the selected model students will serve as school ambassadors.

460
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:27,300
So, you’ll be asked to sign a consent form

461
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:33,870
allowing us to share your image, behavior records, and academic performance.

462
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,130
Most importantly,

463
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:40,430
you must not engage in anything
that could damage the school’s reputation.

464
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,670
If there are no questions,
please go ahead and sign.

465
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,570
What is it, Shane?

466
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,750
I’m not suited to be a model student, ma’am.

467
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,920
I’m sorry.

468
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,920
Please excuse me.

469
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,920
Shane. Shane.

470
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,370
Shane. Shane.

471
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,350
Shane!

472
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,450
What’s the matter?

473
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,130
Like I said, sir.

474
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,100
I don’t think I deserve
to be called a model student.

475
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,860
I’m not sure if I’m good enough for it.

476
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,730
There might be someone
more suitable for the title than me.

477
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,130
I think you’re overthinking this, Shane.

478
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:45,660
The Model Student title
goes to someone well-behaved,

479
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,860
academically strong, and with a clear vision.

480
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,120
You have all of that, Shane.

481
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,850
I’m not that good, sir.

482
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,680
I’ve done bad things.

483
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,410
Like what?

484
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,610
Last semester, I drank.

485
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,530
I lied.

486
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,530
I said hurtful things to people.

487
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,790
And Kit and I…

488
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,890
We almost—

489
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,770
Okay, okay!

490
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:19,300
Shane, stop right there.

491
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,830
I don’t need to hear every detail.

492
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,610
Shane, I think I get you.

493
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:40,200
Listen. No one in this world is flawless.

494
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:46,230
Being a model student doesn’t mean
you have to be perfect at everything.

495
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,050
It just means you’re good enough.

496
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,560
Shane.

497
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,540
I’ll be honest with you.

498
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,250
If you’re not fit for the title, then who is?

499
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,410
You might slip up sometimes,

500
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,850
but at the end of the day,

501
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,440
you’re a good student

502
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,190
Okay.

503
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,190
Will you go back to get the title now?

504
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:35,900
Hm?

505
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,900
Yes, sir.

506
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,690
Wow.

507
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,430
Didn’t know you had such a serious side.

508
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,700
Guess you don’t know
your boyfriend well enough.

509
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,580
Guys, on the count of three, smile.

510
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,870
One, two, three.

511
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,060
One more.

512
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,250
One, two, three.

513
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:35,320
MR. CHINNAPAT METHAPAN
MODEL STUDENT

514
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,000
Congratulations.

515
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,640
A smart student like you deserves it.

516
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,780
It’s just a certificate.

517
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,610
Can’t really use it for anything.

518
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
It’d be nice if I could trade it for cash.

519
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:11,650
You said you didn’t want it,
but you have it on your wall.

520
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,520
How tight-lipped are you, really?

521
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,480
I’m heading home now.

522
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,270
I’ll call you once I get there.

523
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:32,630
Wait.

524
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,330
No one is home today.

525
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,040
Don’t you want to keep me company?

526
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,410
Do you want me to stay?

527
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,050
Mhm.

528
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:50,650
(We’re taking you to the school’s
Sports Day in the next episode.)

529
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,410
Mon, where are you?

530
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,890
Starting a petition to cancel Sports Day.

531
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:55,640
What?!

532
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:59,860
(Who would've thought
this event could start a fight?)

533
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:06,470
(I’m not sure if our final
Sports Day will be sweet or bitter.)

534
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,660
I think it’ll be fun.

535
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,240
(See you then.)
