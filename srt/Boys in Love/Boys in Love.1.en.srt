1
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,080
Yo, what’s up?

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,180
First of all, welcome, everyone,

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,140
to the new semester.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,320
As you can see…

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,780
(They say high school)

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,620
(is the most fun part of life,)

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,520
(especially in an era when
everything’s changing for the better.)

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,630
PRINCIPAL CHANCHANA GIVES EVERYONE FREEDOM.
NO UNIFORM. LESS HOMEWORK. MORE FREE PERIODS.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,530
(Everyone is free...)
PRINCIPAL CHANCHANA GIVES EVERYONE FREEDOM.
NO UNIFORM. LESS HOMEWORK. MORE FREE PERIODS.

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,550
(to chase whatever makes them happy.)

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,710
(I mean... everyone else.)

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,510
(Not me.)

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,050
(Nothing about my high school life is exciting.)

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,360
(As far as I’m concerned, my duty is to study.)

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,400
(So I must perform my duty well.)

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,050
(That’s all.)

17
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,010
You’re a kid with a mind of your own.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,090
You don’t follow the mainstream.

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,539
I’m so proud of you.

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,660
I’m just too lazy to pick out clothes.

21
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,090
This no-uniform policy is total nonsense.

22
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,120
I don’t get why people can be so shallow.

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,590
(This is Mr. Tan, my math teacher from Grade 10.)

24
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,010
(We’re close)

25
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,670
(since he’s the one who always
chaperones me to academic competitions.)

26
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:28,770
(To be honest, he’s taught me a lot.)

27
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,260
(But one thing I’ll never forget is that…)

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,370
(I’m never going to grow up to be as fussy as he is.)

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,900
In the end,

30
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,580
no matter how much freedom
you have with your clothes,

31
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,670
you’ll all still grow up to be useless cogs

32
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,180
in a country that’s not developing anytime soon.

33
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,420
So, what did you want to talk to me about?

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,710
Right. I’ve got a tutoring gig for you.

35
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:49,990
It’s for a student here at school.

36
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,800
The job only runs until the midterms.

37
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,100
The goal is to help him pass the exams.

38
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,400
They’re offering 30,000 baht, Shane.

39
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,500
30,000?

40
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,720
Mm-hmm. 30,000.

41
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,169
KORAWIT JIRAWARAPONG

42
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,450
SECONDARY 6 / LOSERS

43
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,300
Just one more round.

44
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,950
One more.

45
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,680
The green light.

46
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,350
Green light.

47
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,380
Excuse me, do you know where Kit is?

48
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,120
Kit, you asshole!

49
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,600
Someone’s looking for you!

50
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,300
Kit?

51
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:54,829
Kit.

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,910
Kit, you asshole!

53
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,100
Where the hell are you?

54
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,490
Kit’s not here.

55
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,829
You are Kit.

56
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,450
Mr. Tan sent me. I’m your tutor.

57
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,760
Ah.

58
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,220
He said we’re starting today.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,100
See you after school.

60
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,950
Give me your phone.

61
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,230
Text me when your class ends.

62
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,570
SECONDARY 6 / WINNERS

63
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,060
- I haven’t done it.
- Me either.

64
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,790
Why didn’t you do it?

65
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,580
Because I thought I’d copy yours.

66
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,880
I thought I’d copy yours too.

67
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:13,800
Shane!

68
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,540
Come on. Take your seat.

69
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,470
Here.

70
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,100
Where have you been?

71
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,769
Can I copy your homework?

72
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,090
The homework is to write an essay

73
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,650
about what you learned during the school break.

74
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,150
Oh, come on. I’ll reword it.

75
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,410
Per hasn’t done it either.

76
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,730
I was planning to copy yours.

77
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,230
Same here, dude!

78
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,230
Just start writing already.
(These two are Per and Tar,)

79
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:34,540
(members of my friend group.)

80
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,270
(I’m not sure I’d call them good friends.)

81
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,650
(They can be pretty annoying sometimes.)

82
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,750
(But like they say,)

83
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,590
(we don’t always get to choose our friends.)

84
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,420
You do it.

85
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,220
I don’t know how to do it.

86
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,909
- I don’t either.
- All right, stop fighting.

87
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,500
Just copy mine.

88
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,270
Thank you, buddy.

89
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,140
Don’t.

90
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,600
Let me see.

91
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,240
What about you?

92
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,230
Aren’t you copying my homework too?

93
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,180
(This is Kim, the fourth in my friend group.)

94
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,950
(One look at his sad puppy face)

95
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,000
(and I already know. He confessed
to someone and got rejected.)

96
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,240
My 12th grade life is over.

97
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,380
Don’t tell me you’re…

98
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,230
I’m heartbroken, man.

99
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,380
(Here we go. Just as I thought.)

100
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,220
Holy crap, are you heartbroken?

101
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,820
Your first heartbreak, huh?

102
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,020
For this semester.

103
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,700
If we’re counting all the semesters…

104
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,880
It’s heartbreak number 100.

105
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,240
Fine!

106
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,910
I’m not falling for anyone ever again!

107
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,630
Hey.

108
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,800
Who’s that?

109
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,580
A new student, I think.

110
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,260
Heard there’s a transfer this year.

111
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,000
Now I know why

112
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,650
I’ve been heartbroken all this time.

113
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,730
Don’t tell me…

114
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,900
Because true love is right in front of me.

115
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,950
Jeez.

116
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,520
(So, this is what my high school life looks like.)

117
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,110
(And this semester)

118
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,190
(marks the beginning of my final year.)

119
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,370
Where are you going?

120
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,220
- Stop!
- Oops.

121
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,380
Oh, boy!

122
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,040
Do you know where the literature section is?

123
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,940
I’m looking for Wuthering Heights.

124
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,210
Been looking for a while but haven’t found it.

125
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,830
Uh…

126
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,120
What did you say?

127
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,510
Ah! I think it’s right here.

128
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,720
Let me help you look.

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,530
What’s your name?

130
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,700
I’m Mon, just transferred here.

131
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,480
I’m in class 4.

132
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,260
I’m Kim.

133
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,880
Class 1.

134
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,169
What are we looking for again?

135
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,260
Wuthering Heights.

136
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,580
Right!

137
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,929
I think it’s down here somewhere.

138
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,730
Are you sure it’s here?

139
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,660
Absolutely.

140
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,040
If the librarian didn’t move it, it must be here.

141
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,370
Seriously, right here.

142
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,420
It’s true.

143
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,180
I’m sure.

144
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,380
Hey, watch out!

145
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,020
I think they’re all gone.

146
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,500
Yeah, right.

147
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,530
I’m sorry.

148
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,020
Let’s keep looking.

149
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,080
I have cram school soon.

150
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,110
We can continue the search again later.

151
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,030
Mm.

152
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:57,860
Goodbye then.

153
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,290
Oh, man!

154
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,650
How cute.

155
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,570
PHADUNGPATSUKSA SCHOOL
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL WITH NO UNIFORM POLICY

156
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,560
Hello.

157
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,110
I’m Nut.

158
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,480
It’s my first-day teaching.

159
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,550
Okay, I guess everyone’s here.

160
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,210
How’s everyone doing?

161
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,510
It’s the first day of school.

162
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,510
If you have anything to say, feel free to speak up.

163
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,540
Please.

164
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,540
May I, Mr. Principal?

165
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,470
I think the no-uniform policy

166
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,070
is going to be a problem, sir.

167
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,380
The school is in chaos,

168
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,700
and the students are becoming unruly.

169
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,300
I think we should go back to wearing the uniform.

170
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,690
I agree, sir.

171
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,770
I agree with that.

172
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,120
But I think…

173
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,930
we should push forward with this policy.

174
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,740
It’s just clothes.

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,200
Why do we need to make a big deal out of it?

176
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,420
I don’t think it’s just about clothes.

177
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,150
This is a chance for the children

178
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,700
to discover themselves.

179
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:46,400
It’s true that we can teach them
knowledge, skills, and social values.

180
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,080
But pride and happiness?

181
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,010
We can’t teach those.

182
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,990
They have to find that on their own.

183
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,640
I believe this policy is useful.

184
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,190
It opens doors for students to learn,

185
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,400
experiment,

186
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,980
and figure out who they really are.

187
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,670
We’ve already come this far,

188
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,560
so shouldn’t we tackle the problems step by step

189
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,680
instead of canceling the policy?

190
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:27,920
Woo-hoo!

191
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,290
Bravo.

192
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,210
Great.

193
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,920
Well said.

194
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,670
I almost cried hearing that.

195
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,050
Can I use your words for an interview?

196
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,150
I think people will resonate with it.

197
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,200
Maybe we should post it on the school page?

198
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,270
But, of course, I’ll take the credit.

199
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,300
It’s just perfect.

200
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,720
How did you come up with that?

201
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,650
What’s your name again?

202
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,520
I’m Nut, sir.

203
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,250
Welcome to my school.

204
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,140
Yo!

205
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,160
Excellent!

206
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,460
Shane, isn’t it?

207
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,220
Yes, ma’am.

208
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,180
Hello.

209
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:22,960
Hello.

210
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,710
Please come in.

211
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,470
Thank you.

212
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,100
You can leave your shoes here.

213
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,540
Yes, ma’am.

214
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,160
So, you’re the one

215
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,060
Mr. Tan sent to be Kit’s tutor?

216
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,360
Yes, sir.

217
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,640
My name is Shane.

218
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,540
Hello.

219
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,270
Hi.

220
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,880
Kit, your friend’s here, dear.

221
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,320
We’re heading out to run some errands.

222
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,770
- Sure.
- Don’t be stubborn, okay?

223
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,770
Make yourself at home.

224
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,600
Yes, ma’am.

225
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,450
You’ve got this, son.

226
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,470
He’s in your hands now.

227
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,360
Hey. Have a seat.

228
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:46,950
Make yourself comfortable.

229
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,200
What are you looking at?

230
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:19,550
Nothing.

231
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,060
Okay, based on my calculations,

232
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,530
if you want your GPA to reach 2.0,

233
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,650
you’ll need more than half of
the total accumulated points.

234
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,160
But if you’re aiming for 60% on the exams,

235
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,500
you’ll need to collect all the accumulated points.

236
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,490
If you can manage that in the midterms,

237
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,120
the finals shouldn’t be a problem.

238
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,030
Mm.

239
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,320
Let’s start with a pretest

240
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,470
so I can gauge your level.

241
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,900
We’ll begin with Sets.

242
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,620
Turn to page—

243
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,290
You want the Pizza Lover or the Pizza Deluxe?

244
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,020
What?

245
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,410
Sets.

246
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,820
As in pizza sets.

247
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,450
Thin crust or pan pizza?

248
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,500
Do you like pineapples on pizza?

249
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,220
I’m ordering Hawaiian.

250
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,230
So, what set do you want?

251
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,350
Anything.

252
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,390
They don’t have “anything” on the menu.

253
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,210
Pepperoni.

254
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,860
Excellent.

255
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,920
Alright, I’m ready.

256
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,740
Okay.

257
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,320
There are 10 problems,
and you have 10 minutes to solve them.

258
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,530
When you do it, you must—

259
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,040
Hey!

260
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,330
Are you thirsty?

261
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,470
I’m gonna get you something to drink.

262
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,400
Hold on.

263
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,720
What do you want?

264
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,990
I’ve got regular and no-sugar soft drinks,

265
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,240
root beer, and some juices.

266
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,210
Orange, apple, and tomato.

267
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,070
Tomato juice.

268
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,410
Seriously? That stuff tastes awful.

269
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,500
I don’t get why

270
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,610
people make juice out of tomatoes.

271
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,859
Anyway, let’s get started.

272
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,890
Let’s solve the problems together.

273
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:10,930
Good.

274
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,670
Oh, wait.

275
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,720
Just one sec.

276
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,310
Wait here.

277
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,099
Hold on. I’ll be right back.

278
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:18,710
Just wait.

279
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,440
It’s the model figure I ordered yesterday.

280
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,960
Can you film me while I unbox it?

281
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,430
Here.

282
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,220
You have long eyelashes.

283
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,000
What’s my eyelashes got to do with this?

284
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,490
They're cute.

285
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,850
Don’t talk nonsense.

286
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,290
Back to the lesson.

287
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,230
Hey, the pizza’s here.

288
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,790
Want some more oregano?

289
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,800
I’ve got some in the kitchen.

290
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:53,950
It’s fine.

291
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,160
Let’s hurry up and eat,

292
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,320
then get back to the session.

293
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,500
Come on, I’m ready.

294
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,870
No other random things to do?

295
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,450
No.

296
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,680
But can I use the bathroom first,

297
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,040
so we can study for a longer stretch?

298
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,090
Be right back.

299
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,970
I MIGHT NOT BE SLENDER,

300
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,330
BUT WHEN YOU KISS ME,
YOUR HEAVY DAY WILL BE LIGHTER.

301
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:19,670
Hey.

302
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,220
I was heading to the bathroom,

303
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,070
but my friend sent me a cat video.

304
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:25,720
Look.

305
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,170
Want to see?

306
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,730
Okay, okay.

307
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,800
Let’s get back to the lesson.

308
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,070
If you don’t want to study, then don’t.

309
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,780
I don’t want to waste my time on you either.

310
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,200
Hey!

311
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,660
Are you mad at me?

312
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,060
No, I guess not.

313
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,470
This is your office, Mr. Tan?

314
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,500
Only temporarily.

315
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,310
Every table in the math department is occupied,

316
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,550
so I’m here for now until a spot opens up.

317
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,800
I’ve been waiting for two years though.

318
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,280
I see.

319
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,400
This is how it works at this school.

320
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,020
The students can ask for anything.

321
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,110
Don’t want to wear the uniform?

322
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,190
Fine, wear whatever you want.

323
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,900
Don’t want to cut your hair?

324
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,910
Fine, grow it as long as you like.

325
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,000
But when a teacher needs a table,

326
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,700
he has to wait two years,
and even then, he still doesn’t have one.

327
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,010
But that doesn’t mean

328
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,050
I want to sit with other teachers.

329
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,400
I’m actually comfortable here.

330
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,220
It feels like I have a private room,

331
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,770
which is the only good thing about this place.

332
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
The foreign language department is just as full,

333
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,150
so they’ve suggested I use this room as my office.

334
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,680
Nothing good left now.

335
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,350
Do you even know how to uncuff?

336
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,050
Why don’t you do it yourself if you’re so smart?

337
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,690
Just hurry up.

338
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,600
Can’t you see I’m working on it?

339
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,000
Turn it anticlockwise.

340
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,790
Do you even have eyes? I’m doing it.

341
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,710
No, you’re not.

342
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,230
Why don’t you do it yourself, genius?

343
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:19,870
Fine, fine.

344
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,200
- Just help me first.
- Damn it.

345
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,950
What’s going on now?

346
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,330
Old drama.

347
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,830
Name stole her snack, so she handcuffed him.

348
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,900
And where’d she even get handcuffs?

349
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,100
They’re his.

350
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,060
Could’ve hidden your couple’s plaything better

351
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,040
Don’t say that out loud.

352
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,080
Just hurry.

353
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,900
All right, they’re off.

354
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,680
Yes.

355
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,490
Gosh, that hurt.

356
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,520
Hey, don’t!

357
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,520
Name!

358
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,620
And whose cat is this?

359
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,320
It’s a stray!

360
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,840
I already named it. It's called Kaiju now.

361
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,810
Whoa, it already has a name?

362
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,660
Liar, liar, house on fire.

363
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,080
This fat cat can’t be a stray.

364
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,950
Your house and my house are the same house.

365
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,320
Our parents bought this place before they split

366
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,850
and dumped us here to fend for ourselves.

367
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,450
Why is she so dramatic?

368
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,470
It’s the neighbor’s cat.

369
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:34,820
Come here.

370
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,220
They were moving abroad,

371
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,510
so they asked Cheese if she wanted to adopt it.

372
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,080
- Right?
- No.

373
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,100
No pet adoption.

374
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,230
Give it back.

375
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,240
To who?

376
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,650
The owner already flew out.

377
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,820
You’re staying here, aren’t you?

378
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,420
I’ll post online and find it a new home.

379
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,100
I got handcuffed again.

380
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,630
Ugh! What a pain.

381
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,150
Taking care of a cat is easier than
taking care of a brother like you.

382
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,320
Hey!

383
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,740
Jin, come back and uncuff me!

384
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,700
You cuffed yourself, genius. Uncuff yourself.

385
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,510
I can’t! Look at me!

386
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,770
NETSAT TEST PREP – MATHEMATICS

387
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,230
Yes, Mr. Tan?

388
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,000
How’s it going, Shane?

389
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,430
How did the tutoring session go?

390
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,210
Kit didn’t give a rat’s ass, sir.

391
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:56,880
I can’t do it.

392
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,100
Take it easy, Shane.

393
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,270
His parents literally begged me for help.

394
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,800
They’re not asking for much—

395
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,600
just that he passes his exams this semester.

396
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,470
They’re worried he won’t get into any university.

397
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,530
Please, help them out.

398
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,370
It’s not my responsibility.

399
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,250
Do it for the paycheck, if nothing else.

400
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,140
You’re saving up to study abroad, right?

401
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,210
30,000’s nothing to sneeze at.

402
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,280
Besides, you’re a fighter, Shane.

403
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,340
You’re not one to give up that easily, are you?

404
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:47,250
GO STUDY ABROAD!!

405
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,210
Hey, Shane.

406
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,070
Why are you so early?

407
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,260
Where are your parents?

408
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,600
Mom has an appointment with a patient.

409
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,310
Dad’s got a show to shoot.

410
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,960
We’ve got the house to ourselves.

411
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,220
No prying eyes.

412
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,250
Want to play a video game?

413
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,900
Which hand do you use?

414
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,290
Lefty or righty?

415
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:19,860
Righty.

416
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:21,800
Okay.

417
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,060
Sit down.

418
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,610
Hey!

419
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,370
What?

420
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,150
Hey!

421
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,380
What the heck are you doing?

422
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,370
This is to teach you discipline.

423
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,810
If you even think about breaking my command…

424
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,100
Jeez!

425
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,040
Do you really have to do this?

426
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,910
Yes, I do. For someone like you.

427
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,810
Let’s get started.

428
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,280
Come on.

429
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,200
Grab your pen.

430
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,360
Wrong page.

431
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,070
Turn to the next one.

432
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,450
Gosh! I can’t do this anymore.

433
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,200
I’m tired.

434
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,310
I don’t have the energy.

435
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,700
Can we take a break?

436
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,140
You’re tired already?

437
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,530
Try to push yourself.

438
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,840
If you don’t, you’ll never improve.

439
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:20,650
Keep going!

440
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,400
It’s just studying.
Do you have to be so damn serious?

441
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,380
If you can’t take studying seriously,

442
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,230
what the hell are you going to do in life?

443
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,450
Don’t you think you’re being too serious?

444
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,790
What kind of person are you, really?

445
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,450
No wonder…

446
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,130
They canceled the uniform,
but you’re still wearing it.

447
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,820
What I wear doesn’t concern this.

448
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,780
You even know how to spell the word ‘fun’?

449
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,730
I do.

450
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,640
Then spell it out.

451
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,160
Will you quit goofing off?

452
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,990
How old do you think you are, eight?

453
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,330
Junior high students can solve these problems.

454
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,930
But you’re still getting them wrong.

455
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,030
You’re not just dumb,
you’re a complete slacker too, asshole.

456
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,100
Can I step out for some fresh air?

457
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,500
I’m stressed out.

458
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,440
Ever since I started high school,

459
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,560
I haven’t been able to do math problems.

460
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,250
The more I do, the more I get wrong.

461
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,810
You’re smart. It’s easy for you.

462
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,620
But for someone dumb like me—

463
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,730
You’re not dumb.

464
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,200
If you really think it through,

465
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,600
you’ll see you do understand the equations.

466
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,050
You just slip up on the steps.

467
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,320
Take this one.

468
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,220
You moved the constant
but forgot to change the sign.

469
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,360
And here, you forgot the brackets.

470
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,520
When you’re solving equations, don’t rush.

471
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:42,950
Take it slow.

472
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,910
Keep practicing,

473
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,130
and you’ll eventually get the hang of it.

474
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,360
Thanks a lot.

475
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:18,490
Hey!

476
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,530
What the hell is this?

477
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,980
Payback for handcuffing me.

478
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,570
Enjoy the view from my room for now.

479
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,400
I’ll send the maid to unlock you in ten minutes.

480
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,370
I’m heading out.

481
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:27,420
Bye.

482
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,050
Kit!

483
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,260
You asshole!

484
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,380
Kit!

485
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,530
Come back and unlock the door!

486
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,370
Kit!

487
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,260
Damn.

488
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,160
Why exactly do we have to help you find a book?

489
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,850
Aren’t you my friend?

490
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,350
Since you got here,

491
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,500
I haven’t even seen you touch a single book.

492
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,760
Are you sure it’s here?

493
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,040
I’m sure.

494
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,810
I asked the librarian.

495
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,800
She said it should be in this section.

496
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,100
But all the books here are super old.

497
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,640
The spines are done for.

498
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,060
You do realize that

499
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,300
even if you find him the book,

500
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,130
it doesn’t mean he’ll like you, right?

501
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,480
It’s better than doing nothing.

502
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:29,700
Is it this one?

503
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,900
Let me see.

504
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,850
That’s it!

505
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,920
Holy shit, we actually found it.

506
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,460
My chances are looking good this time!

507
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,540
Enjoy the view from my room for now.

508
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:08,580
Kit!

509
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,990
You asshole!

510
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,900
Come back and unlock the door!

511
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,770
I’M EIGHT YEARS OLD.

512
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,450
A CERTIFIED DUMBASS.

513
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,650
SUBJECT: HOW TO ENJOY LIFE 101

514
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,850
GOT A PROBLEM? COME SEE ME.

515
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,420
You even know how to spell the word ‘fun’?

516
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,340
Your card has been topped up.

517
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,410
Yeah!

518
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,660
We won!

519
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,720
Here. Let me try.

520
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,800
Hey!

521
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,380
Yes!

522
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,010
I got it.

523
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,890
It’s not that hard.

524
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:41,850
Hey.

525
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,100
How is it?

526
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:45,860
Cute, huh?

527
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,960
Come on. Are you still mad at me?

528
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:52,980
No.

529
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,540
Fine.

530
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,850
Let’s go grab something sweet.

531
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,600
My treat.

532
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,170
So, what’s wrong exactly?

533
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,310
It’s like you said.

534
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,230
I don’t know how to spell the word ‘fun’.

535
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,070
What’s gotten into you?

536
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,210
I didn’t win a single round of any game.

537
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,210
Don’t rush it.

538
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,660
Take it easy.

539
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,710
Keep practicing,

540
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,000
and you will win eventually.

541
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,450
That sounds familiar.

542
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,900
What you just said.

543
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,300
It’s what you told me.

544
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,500
What?

545
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,120
You’ve got something on your lips.

546
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:00,880
Let me wipe it off.

547
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,810
You’re such a messy eater.

548
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,160
I’m a messy eater—so what?

549
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,310
Nothing.

550
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,340
Come on, Kim.

551
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,070
Are you sure his cram school is here?

552
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,520
Yes.

553
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,130
I did some digging on his Instagram.

554
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,020
But I want both.

555
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,340
You can only pick one.

556
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,570
So, let’s go eat—

557
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,060
Mon!

558
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,090
Hey, Kim.

559
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:03,760
What brings you here?

560
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,210
I happened to find the book you were looking for.

561
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,500
Happened to?

562
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,000
Ouch!

563
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,050
You guys go ahead.

564
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,790
I’ll be right behind you.

565
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,630
See you there.

566
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,000
Thank you, Kim.

567
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,040
How about…

568
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,400
I treat you to a meal as thanks?

569
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,140
Sound good?

570
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,220
Yes.

571
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,900
What should we eat? Should we do it today?

572
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,680
I already have plans with my friends today.

573
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,090
Let’s do it some other time…

574
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,260
when it’s just the two of us.

575
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,260
My friends are waiting.

576
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,320
I’ve got to go now.

577
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:46,420
Yes.

578
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,310
What the heck, Kim?

579
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,700
I was the one who found that book.

580
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,270
Why’s he treating only you?

581
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,410
Say that again

582
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,650
Who found the book?

583
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,690
Oops, my stomach’s growling.

584
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:09,870
I’m hungry.

585
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,190
Let’s grab something to eat.

586
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,230
Kim.

587
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,470
Hey! Wait for me.

588
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,210
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

589
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,370
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

590
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,460
Why are you smiling?

591
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,420
Huh?

592
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,900
What are you smiling at?

593
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,940
Why are you so happy?

594
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:39,650
Hm?

595
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,550
Hm?

596
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,220
Why are you happy?

597
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,150
You’re grinning from ear to ear.

598
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,580
You’re very happy, yeah?

599
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,100
Order whatever you want.

600
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,310
It’s on me.

601
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:46,780
I’ll freaking order everything.

602
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:48,760
Go ahead.

603
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:49,780
Watch me.

604
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,230
Can I have this, please?

605
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:01,930
(Looks like this new semester
has more in store than before.)

606
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,410
Mon.

607
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,720
Checking out the clubs?

608
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,680
(Kim's new love is blooming,)

609
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,810
(but who knows if it’ll end
the same way as the others.)

610
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,430
(On my end,)

611
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:11,840
(Kit is pushing me into brand new experiences.)

612
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,340
Can you show me this dance?

613
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:14,890
No way!

614
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,590
What did you drag me here for?

615
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,910
To have fun.

616
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,000
(And now, I’m starting to…)

617
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,500
(feel something for him.)

618
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,800
(See you again next week.)
