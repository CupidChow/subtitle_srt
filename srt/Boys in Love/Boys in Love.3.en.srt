1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,760
What about you, Kim?

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,930
Share with us one of your favorite books.

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:03,950
Doraemon!

4
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,890
I’d never read Doraemon before.

5
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,290
What?

6
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,180
I’ll finish it soon, so we can talk more about it.

7
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:12,900
I’m really sorry

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,620
for saying those things to you.

9
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,290
Why apologize?

10
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,490
Deep down, I feel envious of you.

11
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,930
Why would someone
as smart as you be envious of me?

12
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,440
Maybe because you can find happiness so easily.

13
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:24,830
Shane…

14
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,060
I wanted you to see me
as someone better than that.

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,660
I don’t even know why.

16
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,600
I wanted you to see me
as someone better than that.

17
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,539
I don’t even know why.

18
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:35,850
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE LASER TAG…

19
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,090
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,810
Hey.

21
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,800
Do you really have to rearrange
your stuff at midnight?

22
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,800
Why are you sleeping in my room, Name?

23
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,160
My aircon’s busted.

24
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
Fine, I’ll crash in Jin’s room.

25
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,450
GONE TO BED?

26
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,200
Kit.

27
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,300
Why are you still up?

28
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,270
Don’t you have a school field trip early tomorrow?

29
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,070
Your dad mentioned it.

30
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,900
I do, but…

31
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,550
just let me finish this problem first,

32
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,570
then I’ll go to bed.

33
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,590
I never thought I’d see this in my life.

34
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,770
Shane must be a very good tutor.

35
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,510
Don’t stay up too late, alright?

36
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,730
GONE TO BED?

37
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,570
Damn it! What the heck is this?

38
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:03,890
GONE TO BED?

39
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,800
Pichet, okay.

40
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,900
Apirat.

41
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,990
Thada, hi.

42
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,750
- I’m Thakorn, sir.
- Thakorn.

43
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,100
Isn’t everyone here already?

44
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,040
The other buses have already left.

45
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,210
All the students are here.

46
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,000
Just one person left...

47
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,000
I’m here! Wait!

48
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:31,930
Don’t leave yet!

49
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,300
Are all the students accounted for, Mr. Nut?

50
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes, everyone’s here already.

51
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,140
Ah.

52
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,940
Did you bring the school camera, Mr. Tan?

53
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,700
That’s been my job every year.

54
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,280
Of course, I didn’t forget…

55
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,810
It’s in the office.

56
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,690
Gosh!

57
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,830
Did you stay up all night or something?

58
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,100
Don’t bother me.

59
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,570
I’m trying to get some sleep here.

60
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,930
Gosh, I just hate people in love.

61
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,700
What?

62
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,580
What are you talking about?

63
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,750
Who’s in love? I’m not!

64
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,770
Why are you getting all worked up?

65
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,000
I was talking about Kim.

66
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,690
Would you be my boyfriend?

67
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,070
(Would you be my boyfriend?)

68
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,020
Be my boyfriend?

69
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:40,210
I love you, Mon. Please be my boyfriend.

70
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,670
(I love you, Mon. Please be my boyfriend.)

71
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,710
He said he’s confessing to Mon today.

72
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,070
I like you.

73
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,230
Will you be my boyfriend?

74
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,909
Using that doll?

75
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:53,770
That’s so lame.

76
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,909
I was the one who suggested it to him.

77
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,780
Are you messing with him, Tar?

78
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,340
Mmm.

79
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,410
Kim…

80
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,120
Hey!

81
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,580
He’s happy.

82
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,880
Don’t ruin it for him.

83
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,540
Who’s happy?

84
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,400
Shane just said…

85
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,810
your way of confessing is so classic.

86
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,310
Right, Per?

87
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,690
Yeah?

88
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,560
All right, everyone.

89
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,680
The bus will be leaving soon.

90
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,410
Finally, everyone is here.

91
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,350
Please don’t walk around while the bus is moving.

92
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,169
Also, don’t talk too loud.

93
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,120
Got it?

94
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,799
Yes, sir!

95
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,470
Hey, Kit.

96
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,950
What are you doing here?

97
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,030
Didn’t the Class 8 bus already leave?

98
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,490
I missed it, sir.

99
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,310
Kids these days…

100
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,550
You’ve got to be more responsible.

101
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,820
Ahem.

102
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:55,700
Go find yourself a seat.

103
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,410
All right, guys.

104
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,420
We’ll stop at the science museum first.

105
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,270
And in the afternoon, we will hit Dream World!

106
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,930
Yeah!

107
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,120
This is your exercise sheet.

108
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,630
Complete every page and turn it in before 1 p.m.

109
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:46,990
Take one.

110
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,520
Hey!

111
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,980
You’re here for knowledge, not for playing!

112
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,400
Don’t knock things over.

113
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,100
Gosh!

114
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,830
Who on earth littered here?

115
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,880
Hey, come back and clean this up.

116
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,860
I’ll check the CCTV and find out who did this.

117
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,210
Once I know, you’ll have to face me back at school.

118
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,440
I’ll have the principal deduct your scores.

119
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,720
Not just that, you’ll be expelled.

120
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,660
And on top of that,

121
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,820
you’ll be banned from
ever returning to this school!

122
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,270
Come back here!

123
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,040
Ready?

124
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,710
Ready.

125
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,210
Stop! I can’t anymore.

126
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,210
I like you, Mon.

127
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,660
(I like you, Mon.)

128
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,280
I…

129
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,070
like you, Mon.

130
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,660
(I… like you, Mon)

131
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,050
Should I change it to,

132
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,140
“I like you so much, kiss kiss”?

133
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,340
Shane,

134
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,710
which one do you think is cuter?

135
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,920
You should be excited about me,

136
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,490
the one making the confession,

137
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,250
not excited about that thing.

138
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,560
Kim,

139
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,710
just throw that doll away.

140
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,920
It’s not romantic at all.

141
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,010
It’s just funny.

142
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,200
Tar was messing with you.

143
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,100
Tar, that jerk.

144
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,620
I knew he didn’t mean well.

145
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,150
Then, Shane,

146
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,750
help me think of a way

147
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,340
to confess to Mon that will impress him,

148
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,900
something that won’t
make me look like a fool.

149
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,520
I’ll be honest here, Kim.

150
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,420
No matter how you do it,

151
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,790
you’ll still look like a fool.

152
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,800
What do you mean?

153
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,980
Love confessions are just silly.

154
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,510
Kim,

155
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,970
how many times have you been heartbroken?

156
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,030
How many times have you been made fun of?

157
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,660
Don’t you ever learn?

158
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,510
But the past is the past.

159
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,700
Right now, I like Mon.

160
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,980
And I like him a lot.

161
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,370
What else should I do
besides telling him that?

162
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,430
Nothing.

163
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,200
Don’t do anything.

164
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,030
Listen.

165
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,650
There are two types of flu.

166
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,630
If it’s influenza,

167
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,580
go to the hospital and get help.

168
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,580
If it’s just a common cold,

169
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,250
rest up and you’ll feel better soon.

170
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,460
Are you comparing love to catching the flu?

171
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,960
If you can get over the flu,

172
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,550
you can get over a crush too.

173
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,810
Trust me.

174
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,460
One day, you’ll thank me
for putting some sense into your head.

175
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,920
Are you okay?

176
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,660
You can argue if you think I’m wrong.

177
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,630
How can I argue with you, Shane?

178
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,000
Don’t act like you’ve ever lost an argument.

179
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,640
What’s up, Kim?

180
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,060
Did you give Mon the doll yet?

181
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,430
I know that you two were just messing with me!

182
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:51,900
Kim.

183
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,910
Why are you guys here?

184
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,510
I thought you might be hungry

185
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,980
since you didn’t eat much this morning.

186
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,300
Here, it might help you feel better.

187
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,600
What?

188
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,500
Can I get one too?

189
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,870
Are you feeling better now?

190
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,200
Tar and I came to apologize.

191
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,150
Hello, Mon.

192
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,310
Where are you, Kim?

193
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,700
I saved you a seat in the stargazing dome.

194
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,460
There are some spots left for this round.

195
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,140
Would you like to join me?

196
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,380
If you would, you need to hurry.

197
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,710
The show starts in ten minutes.

198
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,910
Okay, okay.

199
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,620
I’ll be right there.

200
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,380
Mon asked me to watch a show
at the dome with him.

201
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:27,960
See?

202
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,030
Mon seems okay with you.

203
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,510
What are you so afraid of?

204
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,010
Because I don’t know.

205
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,450
I don’t know if he has feelings for me

206
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,810
or if he’s just being nice.

207
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,580
I don’t know...

208
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,400
if he’s always just thought of me as a friend.

209
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,100
What if I confess

210
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,150
and he doesn’t feel the same way?

211
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,150
At least you tried.

212
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,180
He will like you, for sure.

213
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,220
It’s okay, man.

214
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:07,800
Do you need some help?

215
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,329
No.

216
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,020
I want to do it myself.

217
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,630
Been working on it all night anyway.

218
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,339
You won’t be able to.

219
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,290
Let me help.

220
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,000
I said I want to do it myself.

221
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:22,810
Stay out of it.

222
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,520
Let me see.

223
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,830
It’s asking which choice is wrong.

224
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,800
That means you need to
find these three values first.

225
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,220
First, how do you find the average?

226
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,020
You add up all the numbers
and divide by how many there are.

227
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,210
Very good.

228
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,210
But you need to rearrange the numbers first.

229
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,760
The given problem doesn’t
arrange them for you.

230
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,160
Do this until it becomes a habit.

231
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,910
After rearranging, add everything up

232
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,020
and divide by the number, which is five.

233
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,350
So, what’s the total added value?

234
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,220
31.

235
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,670
31 divided by 5 equals 6.2.

236
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,160
That’s the average.

237
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,460
Now, the median.

238
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,880
What is it?

239
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,700
The middle number.

240
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,060
So, what's the middle number
after rearranging the set?

241
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,760
4.

242
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,450
What’s the mode?

243
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,350
The number that occurs most often.

244
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,710
Which is 4.

245
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,700
Yes.

246
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,200
That’s it.

247
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,110
Why wasn’t it this easy when I did it myself?

248
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,580
Because you’re impatient.

249
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,510
You said you’ve been working on this all night.

250
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,850
That’s dangerous, you know?

251
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,160
There’s a time limit during exams.

252
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,690
Keep in mind that you should skip the problems
you can’t solve and move on to the next ones.

253
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,530
If you stubbornly focus on the same problem,

254
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,100
you’ll get stuck and won’t make any progress.

255
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,870
So, when is our next tutoring session?

256
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,740
How about this evening?

257
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,170
Let’s postpone it.

258
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,710
Tar said you had something to tell me today.

259
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,320
Huh?

260
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,610
He told you that?

261
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,700
Mhm.

262
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,330
I ran into him at school this morning.

263
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,170
Tar, you asshole.

264
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,640
So…

265
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,060
Do you have something to tell me, Kim?

266
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,070
I don’t.

267
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,620
He was just making stuff up.

268
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:50,740
Mm.

269
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,960
Look at the camera.

270
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,200
One, two, three.

271
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,330
Can I get some mini hearts?

272
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,720
One, two.

273
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,510
Now give me a thumbs up.

274
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,290
One, two, three.

275
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,350
Mr. Tan.

276
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,590
Why don’t you use the school camera too?

277
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
We can include the photos in our report.

278
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,790
Sure.

279
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,200
Let me go grab it real quick.

280
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,800
Guys, just hang on a second.

281
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,480
Just a moment.

282
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,710
Nice weather today, huh?

283
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,620
I’ll be right back.

284
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,320
Of course.

285
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,500
Just a moment, guys.

286
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,500
Where’s the camera?

287
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,140
Gosh.

288
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,080
I left it right here.

289
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,150
Trash...

290
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,040
I picked up some trash here.

291
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,120
But the camera was still here.

292
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,190
Where did it go?

293
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,200
Where did the camera go?

294
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,960
What’s wrong?

295
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,850
The camera!

296
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,700
What should I do?

297
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,900
What should I do?

298
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,150
So, you lost the camera?

299
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:54,820
Yes.

300
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,700
How about this?

301
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,600
We will use our phone cameras for now.

302
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,270
Then we’ll look again later.

303
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,270
I’m sure it’s nearby.

304
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,470
We will help each other look. We will find it.

305
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,840
Trust me.

306
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,100
Try to stay calm.

307
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,180
Let’s go. Everyone is waiting.

308
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,950
Don’t lose track of time, okay, guys?

309
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,670
Yes, sir.

310
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,100
Do we already have a new member in our group?

311
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,480
You guys go ahead.

312
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,450
I’ll catch up with you later.

313
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,490
Hey, where are you going?

314
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,300
What?

315
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,450
Don’t mind him.

316
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,550
Let’s go.

317
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,310
Let’s go!

318
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,280
Speed it up, please.

319
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,490
Can we go fast and furious, Mon?

320
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,080
Turn right over here, sir.

321
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,820
Right here?

322
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,330
Hello.

323
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,490
Whoever screams has to buy ice cream.

324
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,640
Bring it on.

325
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:36,510
Ready?

326
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,650
Argh!

327
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,020
Just relax.

328
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,340
No! It’s not scary at all!

329
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,980
So, you're not going to tell him anymore?

330
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,180
No.

331
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,450
I’d rather not.

332
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,010
It’s better this way.

333
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:37,580
Kim.

334
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,330
Thank you, Mon.

335
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,120
Wanna go on the Hurricane?

336
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
No way.

337
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:46,910
No more rides for me.

338
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,390
I need solid ground under my feet.

339
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:51,830
Okay.

340
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,830
If you want to play, I’ll go with you.

341
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,600
Really?

342
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,100
Kim, we’ve been looking for you.

343
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,610
We found your doll.

344
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,200
Here.

345
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,490
(I like you, Mon.)

346
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,830
(I like you, Mon.)

347
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,880
(I like you, Mon.)

348
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,570
- (I like you, Mon.)
- Shut up!

349
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,080
Here you are.

350
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,400
Come on out.

351
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,050
So, do you have anything to say to me?

352
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:23,300
Actually, I planned to
confess my feelings to you today.

353
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,700
But…

354
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,720
I was scared.

355
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,220
Every time I’ve confessed in the past,

356
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,730
it’s turned out badly.

357
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,080
I don’t want to look like a fool again.

358
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,340
Never mind me, Mon.

359
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,050
If you don’t feel the same way,

360
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:57,910
that’s totally fine.

361
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,100
You finally said it.

362
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,070
I thought you’d never get it out.

363
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:15,400
Huh?

364
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,950
I like you too, Kim.

365
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,430
What did you just say?

366
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,050
Do I really need to repeat it?

367
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,010
Not really.

368
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,590
(I like you, Mon.)

369
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,400
(I like you, Mon.)

370
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:51,700
Do you like it?

371
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,790
(I like you, Mon.)

372
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,130
Can’t we just talk this out nicely?

373
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,590
Why are you avoiding me?

374
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,260
You’re so smart about everything.

375
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,240
But when it comes to this, you’re just dumb.

376
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,380
Do I really need to spell it out for you?

377
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:42,930
Kit!

378
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,450
I paid extra for a pass just to talk to you here.

379
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,870
Get up and talk to me.

380
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,570
Ouch.

381
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,000
Kit.

382
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:29,890
Kit!

383
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,800
What now?

384
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,550
You’ve been avoiding me since the museum,

385
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:40,630
and now here.

386
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,720
Will you stop acting like nothing happened?

387
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,760
Who exactly is acting like nothing happened?

388
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,520
Is it me, or is it you?

389
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,000
I…

390
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,600
I don’t want you as my tutor anymore.

391
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:06,690
Alright?

392
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,250
MON AND I ARE NOW BOYFIES!

393
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,850
FUJI XT1 / 30,500 BAHT

394
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,570
Are you stressed about the camera?

395
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,160
Of course, I’m stressed.

396
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,110
Even resale prices are
higher than my entire salary.

397
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,300
You can pay in installments.

398
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:15,740
Installments?

399
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,440
I can handle installments

400
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,870
only if it’s 30 baht a month.

401
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,450
I’ll help you pay.

402
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:22,890
Don’t joke about this.

403
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,200
I’m not joking.

404
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,560
I’m serious.

405
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,000
You lost the camera because

406
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,130
you were busy looking after the students.

407
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,660
We’re on the same team.

408
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,160
We came on the same bus.

409
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,300
We should share the responsibility.

410
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,220
Don’t carry it all alone, Mr. Tan.

411
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,330
Mr. Tan.

412
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,400
- We have something for you, sir.
- It’s a gift.

413
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,320
It’s a gift.

414
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,320
It’s the school camera.

415
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,910
Where’s the camera?

416
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,210
He’s looking so hard.

417
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,160
He can’t find it. Aw, where is it?

418
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,490
Now you see why

419
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,310
I don’t like going on school field trips?

420
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,420
The students seem to love you, though.

421
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,920
Is this what you call love?

422
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,160
Yes.

423
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,400
Otherwise, they wouldn’t dare tease you like this.

424
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,900
We’re just kidding, Mr. Tan.

425
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,630
We love you!

426
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,930
We love you.

427
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,050
We love you, sir.

428
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,540
So, Shane didn’t come by to tutor you today?

429
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,860
No, he didn’t.

430
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:50,900
When is he coming again, then?

431
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,310
Head to the middle now.

432
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,330
Don’t you see what’s happening here?

433
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,910
Gosh!

434
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,690
WHAT HAPPENED, SHANE?

435
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,010
KIT’S DAD CALLED.

436
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,170
SAID YOU WOULDN’T BE TUTORING KIT ANYMORE.

437
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,890
DO I NEED TO FIND YOUR REPLACEMENT?

438
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,400
Will you stop acting like nothing happened?

439
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,130
Who exactly is acting like nothing happened?

440
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,700
Is it me, or is it you?

441
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:48,210
You know that there’s so much fun stuff
for us to do outside of school, right?

442
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:49,910
Come on.

443
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,710
I won!

444
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,170
Yeah!

445
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,560
I wanted you to see me
as someone better than that.

446
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,410
I don’t even know why.

447
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,100
Friends again?

448
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,020
Yeah.

449
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:23,900
Name.

450
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:24,990
Close the door.

451
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:28,790
Taxi!

452
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,200
Shit.

453
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,850
Damn it.

454
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,670
Good evening, sir.

455
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,000
Is Kit home?

456
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,010
He went out, son.

457
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,280
You just missed him.

458
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,810
KIT

459
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,860
Hello, where are you?

460
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,760
I’m at your condo.

461
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:08,920
What?

462
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,780
Should I go up now?

463
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,910
What are you doing there?

464
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,170
What?

465
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,700
Never mind.

466
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,410
Stay where you are. I’ll be right there.

467
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,470
Will you excuse me, sir?

468
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,220
Goodbye.

469
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,900
Where are you going now?

470
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,840
I waited in your lobby for so long,

471
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,800
but you didn’t show up.

472
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:03,450
Well…

473
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,160
I want you back as my tutor.

474
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,600
But…

475
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,010
I need to ask if you’re willing to—

476
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,660
I want to continue tutoring you.

477
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,660
But…

478
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,570
I still need to talk to you

479
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:53,650
about that thing

480
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,000
you’re acting like didn’t happen

481
00:38:58,910 --> 00:38:59,720
when the truth is…

482
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,780
I don’t know.

483
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,970
I’m not sure what I’m feeling right now.

484
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,030
If you ask me now,

485
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:27,910
all I can say is

486
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,980
I still want to be your tutor, Kit.

487
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,560
So, about what happened that night,

488
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,660
can you please not ask me what it is yet?

489
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,720
Okay.

490
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,110
For the problems we can’t solve,

491
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,160
we should skip and move on to the next ones.

492
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,980
Otherwise, we’ll just get stuck

493
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,100
and won’t make any progress.

494
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,180
Whoa!

495
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,270
Look at that.

496
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,430
It’s so beautiful over there.

497
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:48,600
Beautiful, huh?

498
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,200
Should we check it out in here?

499
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,360
I can see it clearly.

500
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:56,750
Is it nice?

501
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:57,590
Take a look.

502
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:58,610
Where?

503
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,080
Can you see?

504
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,320
Where is it, Mon?

505
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,620
I can’t see it.

506
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,900
It’s still there.

507
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,800
Here. Let me help.

508
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,310
There it is.

509
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:13,920
Beautiful?

510
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,330
You wanna look again?

511
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,210
Sure.

512
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,560
Hey, it’s there.

513
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,610
Wow, it’s so beautiful.

514
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,630
Mon, look.

515
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:27,890
It’s gorgeous.

516
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,000
What are you looking at?

517
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,270
I asked you here to see the stars.

518
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,710
Maybe give them some attention?

519
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,960
Well, you’re more interesting than the stars.

520
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,000
You’re exaggerating.

521
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,070
You know I’m telling the truth.

522
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:38,850
Aw!

523
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,740
Who left you here, baby?

524
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:41,580
Hm?

525
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,180
Look how cute you are!

526
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,090
Whose cat is this?

527
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,410
Do you have a home yet?

528
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:48,880
Wanna live with me?

529
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,850
My cat.

530
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:54,940
It has a home.

531
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,070
Kaiju.

532
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,290
Kaiju.

533
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,510
Stop it.

534
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,190
(I still can’t say exactly)

535
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,050
(what it is between Kit and me,)

536
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,170
(but…)

537
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:13,600
(everything feels happy.)

538
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,160
(Kim and Mon feel the same, too.)

539
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,190
Have fun studying for the exams.

540
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:24,370
If you miss me, just call.

541
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,230
Can I get my reward?

542
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,680
(Next week, come back for more of our stories.)
