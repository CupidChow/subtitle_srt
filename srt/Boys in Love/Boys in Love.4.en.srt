1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,470
We’re on the same team.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,980
We should share the responsibility.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,010
Don’t carry it all alone, Mr. Tan.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,170
If you don’t feel the same way,

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,500
that’s totally fine.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,960
I like you too, Kim.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,440
About what happened that night,

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,700
can you please not ask me what it is yet?

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,480
For the problems we can’t solve,

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,140
we should skip and move on to the next ones.

11
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,800
Otherwise, we’ll just get stuck

12
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,180
and won’t make any progress.

13
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,400
Wait.

14
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,550
FRIDAY

15
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,210
What’s up, guys?
FRIDAY

16
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:14,370
FRIDAY

17
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,150
Jetana, did you just go indoor bouldering?

18
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,470
I saw your photos on social media.

19
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,100
Hey, by the way,

20
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,450
I'm following all of you,

21
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,980
so make sure to follow me back, okay?

22
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,760
Listen up.

23
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,310
Midterms are coming up next week,

24
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,180
so put all the fun on pause

25
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,310
and focus on studying, alright?

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,720
Good. This is good.

27
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:40,570
This group is lovely.

28
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,460
Take some pics and post them too.

29
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,670
You’ve scored higher than ever before.

30
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,290
I’m good, aren’t I?

31
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,800
Mm. Very good.

32
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,770
Can I get my reward?

33
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,000
What reward?

34
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,390
I meant to say your tutor is very good.

35
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,160
Then maybe…

36
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,170
the tutor wants a reward?

37
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,860
Let’s get to class.

38
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,510
Tell me you’re joking.

39
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,500
Why?

40
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,410
I want to study in the same class
as my boyfriend.

41
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,880
But switching your program just to be with me,

42
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,880
that’s a bit much.

43
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,870
It won’t make any difference.

44
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,400
I don’t understand anything
in my Math-Science program anyway.

45
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,580
But we’re in 12th grade now.

46
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,110
It’s our final year.

47
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,909
Why change now?

48
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,420
We can talk about it later.

49
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,940
So, where are we going this weekend?

50
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,350
I was thinking of studying for the exams.

51
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,150
Sounds good.

52
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,250
Where are you studying?

53
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,100
I’ll join you.

54
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,250
No.

55
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,800
I won’t be able to focus if you’re there.

56
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,100
Just for this exam period,
can we keep a little distance?

57
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,800
Are you serious?

58
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,110
It’s only for a few days.

59
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,000
Don’t make that face.

60
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,290
Smile.

61
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,280
It’s just for a few days.

62
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,300
We’ll see each other after that.

63
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,160
Okay?

64
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,350
Fine.

65
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,260
May I come in, sir?

66
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,800
Here are the workbooks you asked me to collect.

67
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,690
Mm.

68
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,730
You can leave them here.

69
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,730
So, what’s going on, Shane?

70
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,600
I heard you’re…

71
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,170
dating someone.

72
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,120
What are you talking about, sir?

73
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,360
Your friend told me.

74
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,650
And you’re acting like someone in love.

75
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,890
You’re making stuff up.

76
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,830
I should get going.

77
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,670
Hey, I’m not judging.

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,040
It’s normal for people to be in love.

79
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,700
Whoever wants to date, go for it.

80
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,340
I’m just happy for everyone.

81
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,810
SATURDAY

82
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,470
Tar!

83
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,080
Tar, open the door.

84
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,400
Are you up?

85
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,210
Tar!

86
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,570
Tar, are you up yet?

87
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,000
What are you doing at my place?

88
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,800
I’m here to study.

89
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,300
We must take the midterm exams seriously.

90
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,430
Per is on his way here, too.

91
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,060
What?

92
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,400
You invited someone else over
without even telling me?

93
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:54,590
Someone else?

94
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,050
He’s our friend.

95
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,490
Why aren’t you studying with your boyfriend?

96
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,300
He said he wanted to study alone.

97
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,270
He said…

98
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,000
he couldn’t focus with me around.

99
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,220
Fine. That’s good.

100
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,790
This way, I’ll be able to focus too.

101
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,300
You just walked in without knocking?

102
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,600
Did you seriously just let yourself in?

103
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,250
You didn’t lock the door.

104
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,960
Locking or not isn’t the point.

105
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,870
I’m asking why you didn’t knock.

106
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,260
Why making a fuss?

107
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,410
Seriously, guys.

108
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,860
Without Shane,
this whole study session is pointless.

109
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,330
Hey, what is this?

110
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,850
How did I end up being the only one
studying when I didn’t even want to?

111
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,270
Are we supposed to study?

112
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,130
Hey.

113
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,500
Look.

114
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,500
Mon doesn’t care about me.

115
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,410
He doesn’t watch my Stories

116
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,070
or like any of my posts.

117
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,040
I even shared a sad song,

118
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,120
yet he doesn’t bother with it.

119
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,330
It’s like I don’t exist to him.

120
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,780
Then why not go see him at his place?

121
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,560
You sent him home before, didn’t you?

122
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,300
Don’t think that’s a good idea.

123
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,360
Mon, it’s me!

124
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,170
I brought you some snacks.

125
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,460
Okay.

126
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,660
Thank you.

127
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,950
Can I use the bathroom?

128
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,960
Please, please, please.

129
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:13,960
Please, Mon.

130
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,810
I’m closing the gate.

131
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,030
Come on. Please. Pretty, please.

132
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,810
Please.

133
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,500
I’ll be quick.

134
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,570
Please.

135
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,000
Please, Mon.

136
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,130
HOW’S IT GOING, KIM?

137
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,290
I’M IN MON’S HOUSE NOW.

138
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:49,570
GREAT. HOPE HIS PARENTS KICK YOU OUT!!!

139
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,250
I ASKED. HE SAID HIS MOM’S NOT HOME.
SHE’LL BE BACK LATE.

140
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,790
What are you doing?

141
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,410
Well…

142
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,800
I just brought you some food.

143
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,930
Thought you might be hungry.

144
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,650
Are you leaving then?

145
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,530
Okay, fine.

146
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,470
I admit food was just an excuse to see you.

147
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,220
I missed you.

148
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,180
I wanted to see your face, even for a bit.

149
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,400
You did.

150
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,340
Will you leave now?

151
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,000
Come on, Mon.

152
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,260
You don’t want to spend time with me at all.

153
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,100
Mon, please don’t push me away.

154
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,010
I promise I won’t disturb you.

155
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,130
I don’t believe that.

156
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,550
I won’t, seriously.

157
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,560
Have I ever disturbed you before?

158
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,510
Come on.

159
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,110
I didn’t know I was such a disturbance.

160
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,170
It’s just…

161
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,210
when we’re together,

162
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,270
you always steal my attention.

163
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,660
It’s not wrong.

164
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,470
It’s just who you are.

165
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,500
But exams are coming,

166
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,510
and I really need to focus on my studies.

167
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,730
Okay.

168
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,600
Today, I won’t ask for any attention.

169
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,540
Your books come first.

170
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,400
I’ll be second, or tenth, even.

171
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,510
I’ll sit still, be quiet, be invisible.

172
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:42,960
Just…

173
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,230
let me stay.

174
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,530
Please, please.

175
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,610
Please.

176
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,530
Please.

177
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,920
Please, Mon.

178
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,860
Please.

179
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,830
Please.

180
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,910
Okay.

181
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,940
But you have to promise not to distract me.

182
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,490
I promise.

183
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,250
Okay.

184
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,700
Keep your word too.

185
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,970
Can you sit somewhere else?

186
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,450
Okay. Fine.

187
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,400
Can’t I just sit here?

188
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,200
I can’t focus.

189
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,660
Gosh, he’s so cute.

190
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,500
Whose boyfriend is this?

191
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,250
Hi, Mr. Tan.

192
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,140
You came to school on the weekend?

193
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,550
Just here to proofread my exam papers.

194
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,580
What about you, Mr. Nut?

195
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,240
Didn’t expect to see you here.

196
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,000
I’m here to tally up
the students’ accumulated scores.

197
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,350
Why?

198
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,260
Don’t I look like the type of works weekends?

199
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,710
Only single people work on weekends.

200
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,700
I don’t think Kim’s coming back.

201
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,450
TAR, I CAN’T GO TO YOU ANYMORE.

202
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,160
I’M WITH KIT.

203
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,400
I think Kit and Shane are secretly dating.

204
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,830
So what if they are?

205
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,230
Nothing.

206
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,050
But if it’s just you and me left in the group…

207
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,080
No way!

208
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,410
I’m getting the chills.

209
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,520
I don’t wanna be left with you. No!

210
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,820
What’s wrong with being left with me?

211
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,560
It means our group’s fallen apart.

212
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,500
Come to think of it, we’re not that close.

213
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,280
I didn’t even mean to befriend you at first.

214
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,710
Kim brought you in.

215
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,200
Without those two, we’re basically strangers.

216
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,600
Gosh!

217
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,620
Who are you?

218
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,940
What are you doing in my room, sir?

219
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,770
Who are you?

220
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,030
Let me ask you something.

221
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,120
Have you ever been tired of being yourself?

222
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,760
Got anything to eat?

223
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,490
I’m starving.

224
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,369
PER, WHERE ARE YOU?

225
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,849
I AM AT SIAM.

226
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,730
I GOT YOU SOME SNACK.

227
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,410
FREE TO COME GET IT?

228
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,470
- Don’t be nosy!
- Ouch!

229
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:25,280
Hey, are you dating too?

230
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,099
Well?

231
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,520
Will you go get it?

232
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
I mean the snack.

233
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,500
Who are you, sir?

234
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,340
Stay out of my business, stranger.

235
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,150
Hey. You can’t just leave me alone.

236
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,710
Fine. Go, all of you!

237
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,670
No, Mon!

238
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,500
I’m not distracting you.

239
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,530
I didn’t do anything.

240
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,890
Shane, you haven’t met
Kit’s older siblings, have you?

241
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,660
This is Kard.

242
00:18:59,050 --> 00:18:59,860
He plays badminton,

243
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,910
about to join the national team.

244
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,350
Mom, please.

245
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,600
Just let her brag.

246
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,400
Better you than me.

247
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,640
And this is the wicked one.

248
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,570
Kan, the eldest brother.

249
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,800
He’s a designer.

250
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,720
He either locks himself in the studio

251
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,800
or flies off to fashion weeks.

252
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,670
But we’re all gathered here today for Kale,

253
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,400
Kit’s older sister.

254
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,050
She just flew back from L.A.

255
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,820
Their dad’s picking her up from the airport now.

256
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,000
Is someone talking about me?

257
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,450
- I missed you.
- Missed you too.

258
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,180
You haven’t changed a bit.

259
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,630
Of course.

260
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,490
What’s up, Kit?

261
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,070
Aren’t you going to hug me?

262
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,890
Come on. Don’t be so cold.

263
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,760
This is Kale, a Hollywood cinematographer.

264
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,110
Oh, please.

265
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,360
I work for a small company.

266
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,750
You’re making it sound too fancy.

267
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,320
Are you Kit’s friend?

268
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,120
Yes.

269
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,350
Hi, Kale.

270
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,200
What film are you shooting?

271
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,710
A bunch.

272
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,400
Yes?

273
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,150
You’re here already?

274
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,710
Yes, I’ll be right down.

275
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,530
Sure.

276
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,300
You’re not heading out soon?

277
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,390
Please, I’m all alone.

278
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,750
I’ve got no one waiting for me,

279
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,510
so I don’t exactly have plans.

280
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,820
I’m grabbing dinner and maybe a drink after.

281
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,000
Would you like to come?

282
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,470
Come on.

283
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,600
I don’t want to be the third wheel.

284
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,610
I’ll get going then.

285
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,640
Have you waited for long?

286
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:04,940
Here.

287
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,910
Let’s see how many you got right.

288
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,190
Kit, come downstairs. Kale got you a gift.

289
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,500
I’ll be right back.

290
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,360
Come on.

291
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,100
Let’s start our session.

292
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,150
You can open your gift first.

293
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,030
It can wait.

294
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,110
I’ll open it later.

295
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,970
Your family is cool.

296
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,270
You think?

297
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:01,510
Yes.

298
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,600
Unlike mine.

299
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,210
Why?

300
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,450
What’s wrong with your family?

301
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,170
Tell me about them.

302
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,200
If you…

303
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,090
don’t mind sharing.

304
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,250
I don’t mind.

305
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,570
My dad was in real estate.

306
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,110
My mom was an actress,

307
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,210
not very famous though.

308
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,370
She quit acting when she married him.

309
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,300
That sounds nice.

310
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,560
It was, I guess.

311
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,180
Otherwise, they wouldn’t have had four kids.

312
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,150
But a year after my youngest sister was born,

313
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,100
my dad went bankrupt.

314
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,850
Like, completely bankrupt.

315
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,200
Everything just fell apart.

316
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,070
My mom was miserable.

317
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,270
I don’t know who fell out of love with who first.

318
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,750
In the end, they split and started new families.

319
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,900
So it’s just us siblings now,
looking after each other.

320
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,740
That’s why…

321
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,210
I only see your siblings when I visit.

322
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,200
Never seen your parents around.

323
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,340
They come to visit sometimes.

324
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,550
Just not together.

325
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,960
If they run into each other, they fight.

326
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,330
Are you okay?

327
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:54,700
I’m okay.

328
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,390
I don’t see it as a flaw in my life.

329
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,960
Actually, I think it worked out

330
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,040
pretty well for everyone.

331
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,250
But sometimes…

332
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,030
I wish I had what you have.

333
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,260
Everyone under one roof,

334
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,270
a dad who's a famous chef,

335
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,850
a mom who's a doctor,

336
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,660
and siblings who are all successful.

337
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:28,070
I don’t really have role models.

338
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,520
I don’t think you need them.

339
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,590
You’ll succeed on your own anyway.

340
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,950
Sometimes it’s better to live in a normal family

341
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,380
and be the star

342
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,900
than live in a house full of overachievers

343
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,100
and feel like the loser.

344
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,010
Are you saying you’re a loser?

345
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,550
No.

346
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,100
I’m just painting a clear picture for you.

347
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,600
You’re not a loser, Kit.

348
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,300
Okay,

349
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,920
you might not be the academic type,

350
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,630
but I think you’ve got hidden talents.

351
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,200
Like what?

352
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,780
Drawing cartoons.

353
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,810
That’s it?

354
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,420
Anyone can do that.

355
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,260
Not true.

356
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,360
If you don’t believe me, look at this.

357
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,470
Did you make it bad on purpose

358
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,880
to make me feel better?

359
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,130
Hey. I did my best.

360
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,610
Let me see.

361
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,860
It’s not that bad.

362
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,120
Jeez.

363
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,370
Here.

364
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,360
Let me show you.

365
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:28,890
Be still.

366
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,400
Draw Kaiju.

367
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,060
Hey, my cat’s not that fat.

368
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,160
You feed him nonstop.

369
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,420
Of course, he’s fat.

370
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,560
He looks just like you.

371
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,300
What’s that supposed to mean?

372
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,340
Cute.

373
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:51,710
Look.

374
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,870
Nice save.

375
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,610
What is this now?

376
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,040
This is a cat.

377
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,820
And this is a dog.

378
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,510
Say that again.

379
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,110
Whoa!

380
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,770
Look. This looks yummy.

381
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:23,780
What do you think?

382
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,120
Does it look good?

383
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,120
It does.

384
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,560
Hey, don’t you want a bowl?

385
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,110
Hm?

386
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:31,780
We can just eat from this.

387
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,360
So we have less washing to do.

388
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,040
Can you feed me?

389
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,480
Sure thing.

390
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,390
Yum.

391
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,080
Be careful.

392
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:44,870
Do you want some too?

393
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,550
Ah…

394
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,400
Is it good?

395
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,040
It is.

396
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,180
Can I get one more?

397
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,510
You mean…

398
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,350
one more kiss?

399
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,350
No. I mean the noodles.

400
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,070
Sure.

401
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,040
So, one more, huh?

402
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,360
Are you sure?

403
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,900
- Yeah.
- All right.

404
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,560
What are you guys doing?

405
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,500
Who is this?

406
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,250
This is Kim, Mom.

407
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,850
Ah, Kim.

408
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,440
The one you told me about?

409
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,310
Good evening, ma’am.

410
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,300
So what are you guys eating?

411
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,360
Would you like some, ma’am?

412
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,550
Kim, don’t.

413
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,400
Are you here to study?

414
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,770
Yes, I came to study with Mon.

415
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,950
But we’re done, and he’s about to leave.

416
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,170
Aren’t you meeting Per and Tar after?

417
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,400
Huh?

418
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,100
You should go see your friends.

419
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,680
I’ll walk you out.

420
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,060
I’m not meeting them.

421
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,110
I’ll walk you out. It’s fine.

422
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,390
I don’t have plans with them.

423
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,270
I’m sorry.

424
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,930
I didn’t think Mom would come home so soon.

425
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,570
That’s all right.

426
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,600
What did you tell her about me?

427
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,780
She said that just now.

428
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,400
It’s a secret.

429
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,560
What?

430
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,710
Tell me. I want to know.

431
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,210
Can’t you spill just a little?

432
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,810
Please.

433
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,100
It’s time to leave.

434
00:31:58,770 --> 00:31:59,400
Fine.

435
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,000
I’ll see you later then.

436
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,100
Have fun studying for the exams.

437
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,850
If you miss me, just call.

438
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,300
If you miss me…

439
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,290
don’t call.

440
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,460
What? Mon!

441
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,500
I’ll be leaving for real now.

442
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,500
Okay.

443
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,680
Bye-bye.

444
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,590
What are you doing?

445
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,240
I want to look at you for as long as I can.

446
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,910
If you fall, I will just hit you.

447
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,800
I won’t fall.

448
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,400
Ouch!

449
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,600
Are you hurt?

450
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:40,410
Are you alright?

451
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,930
I am.

452
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,580
Seeing you this worried

453
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,400
makes the pain go away.

454
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,590
Just leave already.

455
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,380
I’ll be going then.

456
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,790
Go.

457
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,200
- I’m going.
- Go.

458
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,600
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

459
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:00,750
Don’t fall again.

460
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,690
I won’t.

461
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,110
Ow!

462
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,590
I’m gonna hit you.

463
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,080
Bye-bye.

464
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,860
Bye-bye.

465
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,360
Shit.

466
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,790
I’m sorry for following you.

467
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,659
When you asked earlier,

468
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,199
I was too quick to say no.

469
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:53,210
But then I thought about it...

470
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,510
and realized I was kind of lonely.

471
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,310
So…

472
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,170
Did you have a fight with…

473
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,400
your boyfriend?

474
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,570
He’s not my boyfriend.

475
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,200
We’re in the talking stage.

476
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,000
Ah.

477
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,500
But we won’t be talking anymore.

478
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,800
Why not?

479
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,870
I asked him to be my boyfriend just now.

480
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,870
He turned me down.

481
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,770
Someone like you got rejected?

482
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,990
I’m sorry.

483
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,330
I mean, I just didn’t expect that.

484
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,700
I get rejected every time.

485
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,000
I’ve lost count.

486
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,020
No way!

487
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,780
Are you kidding me?

488
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,510
I’m sorry.

489
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,210
Don’t be sad, though.

490
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,150
You’re good-looking, Mr. Nut.

491
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,990
People will keep coming in.

492
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,200
They keep coming…

493
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,570
and leaving the same way.

494
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,640
It’s exhausting, you know?

495
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,600
I’m starting to think that

496
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,270
if no one came into my life to begin with,

497
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,440
maybe I wouldn’t feel this lonely.

498
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:46,600
Anyway,

499
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,870
thank you so much, Mr. Tan,

500
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,910
for keeping me company tonight.

501
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,600
It’s my pleasure.

502
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,330
MIDTERM EXAM DAY

503
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:55,510
Give it here.

504
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,770
MRS. PRANGTHIP DAMRONGTHAM
DEPUTY DIRECTOR, STUDENT WELFARE DEPARTMENT

505
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,800
Exams are over!

506
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,640
Don’t.

507
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,950
You’re adding more work for the janitor.

508
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,900
And with only four sheets,

509
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,310
it’s not even that dramatic.

510
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,410
Well, the exams are over
and I feel like celebrating.

511
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,290
From now on,

512
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,580
nothing’s getting between Mon and me.

513
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,440
I’m so happy.

514
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,360
Mr. Kimhan Panurak from Class 6/1,

515
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,600
please report to
the Student Welfare Department.

516
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,410
What did you do?

517
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,000
And since when do we have
a Student Welfare Department?

518
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,500
I heard there’s a new teacher in charge there.

519
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,980
But I didn’t do anything wrong.

520
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,680
Maybe she called the wrong name.

521
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,320
Right?

522
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,440
Right.

523
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,640
It must be a mistake.

524
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:09,990
Attention please.

525
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,920
Mr. Kimhan Panurak from Class 6/1,

526
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,360
please report to
the Student Welfare Department.

527
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,500
I don’t think it’s a mistake.

528
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:28,770
All done.

529
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,550
Hello, Kim.

530
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:49,640
Hello,

531
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,700
Mon’s mother.

532
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,330
You can just call me Mrs. Prang.

533
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,850
MRS. PRANGTHIP DAMRONGTHAM
DEPUTY DIRECTOR, STUDENT WELFARE DEPARTMENT

534
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,010
Shoot the closer ones.

535
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,360
Yes.

536
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,040
Shoot again.

537
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,070
Good.

538
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,760
The one at the back.

539
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,890
Yeah!

540
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,400
Isn’t it too early to celebrate?

541
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,000
The exam results aren’t out yet.

542
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,860
Well, I did my best.

543
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,310
I don’t need to worry about the results.

544
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,300
I was planning on saying that to you.

545
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,900
How dare you say it first?

546
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,200
Yeah?

547
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,730
I thought I was entitled to say that.

548
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:48,820
Let’s continue.

549
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,730
Oh, hold on.

550
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,610
KIT’S MOM

551
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,430
Yes, ma’am?

552
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,470
Hello, Shane.

553
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,900
Mr. Tan called and told me the result.

554
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,200
Kit scored 11 out of 20.

555
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,750
It’s the first time he’s passed the halfway mark.

556
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:07,400
Really?

557
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:08,550
Really.

558
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,640
I thank you so much.

559
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:12,120
Of course.

560
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:16,460
What was that?

561
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,720
Mr. Tan revealed the result.

562
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,800
You got 11.

563
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,380
For real?

564
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,320
- I passed?
- Yes.

565
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,340
Hey!

566
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,550
I passed!

567
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:33,750
You did great.

568
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,980
I passed!

569
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,120
Woo-hoo.

570
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,040
Yes!

571
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,620
Well done.

572
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,830
I did it!

573
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,130
Thank you so much.

574
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,260
All I did was tutor you.

575
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,400
Without you, I wouldn’t have made it.

576
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,490
I must thank you too.

577
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:20,960
For what?

578
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,260
All this time,

579
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,650
I’ve lived my life with one eye on the goal,

580
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,810
thinking I deserved to be happy
only after I reached it.

581
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,900
But after I met you,

582
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,560
I realized…

583
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,100
I’m actually happy with the life I have now,

584
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,100
and I really like it.

585
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,420
I like it too.

00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,890
HONJOK: THE ART OF LIVING ALONE
BY FRANCIE HEALEY, CRYSTAL TAI

587
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,380
I’m spending the night here.

588
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,340
Did you do something to upset
the new student welfare teacher?

589
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:08,350
She’s Mon’s mom.

590
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,400
What?!

591
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,920
(Looks like Kim’s love just hit an obstacle.)

592
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,380
I don’t care who your mother is.

593
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:16,240
I’m not going anywhere.

594
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,310
(And Kit won’t let me avoid defining
our relationship anymore.)

595
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:23,500
So, have you figured out what we are yet?

596
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,210
(Stick around for more.)
