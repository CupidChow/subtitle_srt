(Episode 13)

3
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,870
Congratulations.

4
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,030
You're one step closer to your dream.

5
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,140
Thank you.

6
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,560
As long as you want to fly,

7
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:00,890
I…

8
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,800
and the company

9
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,310
can give you the wings at any time.

10
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,780
Today,

11
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,110
you finally fulfilled your wish.

12
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,610
But I have a wish

13
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,170
that hasn't been fulfilled yet.

14
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,829
Unfulfilled wish?

15
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,640
Is he going to confess his love?

16
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:38,960
Tian.

17
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,380
Was I expecting him

18
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,460
to say he loves me?

19
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,750
You like roses?

20
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,470
All girls like roses.

21
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:07,910
Hello.

22
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,220
This is the bouquet from this gentleman.

23
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,030
Baby's breath?

24
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,770
For me?

25
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:15,830
What?

26
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,810
Tian, you don't like baby's breath?

27
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,800
Well, it's a kind of filler flower.

28
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:22,930
Yes.

29
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,250
I just think that your taste

30
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,210
has always been so unique.

31
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,560
Tian.

32
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,350
Do you know

33
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,600
what baby's breath symbolizes?

34
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:39,790
For you,

35
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,340
I'm willing to play a supporting role.

36
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,590

Tian.

106
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,730
You made this yourself?

107
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,110
It's not an expensive gift,

108
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,420
but it has zero sugar, zero fat, and lots of thick fiber.

109
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,409
It's healthy.

110
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,380
Try it.

111
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,540
How does it taste?

112
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,660
It tastes of happiness.

113
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,810
Eat more.

114
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,590
The color.

115
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,220
The fragrance.

116
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,790
The shape.

117
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,970
It's perfect in color, smell and taste.

118
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,600
It's a delicacy

119
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,860
that makes all other delicacies

120
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,430
pale in comparison.

121
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,880
It's been half an hour.

122
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,300
You called me here

123
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,530
just to let me hear you praise this box of cookies?

124
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,680
What else could it be?

125
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,880
Tian made this for me herself.

126
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
As my good friend,

127
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,020
you have to witness such a memorable event

128
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,080
with your own eyes.

129
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,200
You can only look at it.

130
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,380
You're not allowed to eat it.

131
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,940
A suggestion for you.

132
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,090
I suggest you make this box of cookies into specimens

133
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,020
and display them

134
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,350
in an exhibition.

135
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,830
Good idea.

136
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,190
Just a box of cookies is enough made you a fool.

137
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,450
It's so embarrassing.

138
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,230
You're so mean.

139
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,100
I bet Miss Shan

140
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,190
found it unpleasant to talk with you.

141
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,980
She said she was busy with work

142
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,780
and didn't have time to check her phone.

143
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,030
You believe that?

144
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,190
Of course.

145
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,190
Listen,

146
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,740
don't blame me for not warning you.

147
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,840
It's very hard to sustain a long-distance relationship.

148
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,500
You're not Miss Tian's official boyfriend yet.

149
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,500
Aren't you afraid that she'll meet

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,010
a handsome

151
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,450
and talented man during the training?

152
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
After all, they have more in common.

153
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,840
I've single-handedly raised

154
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,510
Tian's standards for men.

155
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,890
Now,

156
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,760
Tian and I are on the same wavelength.

157
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,730
Do you understand what that means?

158
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,600
It means two parallel lines

159
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,570
gradually

160
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,640
converge.

161
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,100
But have you ever thought

162
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,669
that after the two parallel lines

163
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,090
converge,

164
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,309
they'll get further and further apart?

165
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:44,980
Assistant Tang.

166
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:45,880
Mr. Liu,

167
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,560
I have something urgent to report to you.

168
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,490
Assistant Tang.

169
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,540
Calm down.

170
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,520
You've been working with me for so long.

171
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,850
You should've learned composure from me.

172
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,310
I just got the news.

173
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,130
Mr. Luo Ci

174
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,950
is the special tutor of this toy design training.

175
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:00,980
What?

176
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,460
It turns out

177
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,370
that you are not only mean,

178
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,670
-but also… -A prophet?

179
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,290
Shut up.

180
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,780
Can you give this book to me?

181
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:17,980
(Six Records of a Floating Life)
Can you give this book to me?

182
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,520
(Six Records of a Floating Life)

183
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,300
Wake up!

184
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,140
Wake up!

185
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:42,890
Wake up!

186
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,760
Wake up!

187
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,940
Strange.

188
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,610
I haven't had a nightmare about that car crash in a while.

189
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,660
How is that possible?

190
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,420
We grew up together.

191
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,860
We've been fast friends.

192
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,270
I must have got drunk and heard it wrong.

193
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,960
You'll have to work out for three months

194
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,860
to burn the calories you take in in a few days.

195
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,150
It's just breaking up with a boy.

196
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,610
Do you have to keep eating?

197
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,680
Keep your hands off me.

198
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,140
I'm doing this for your good.

199
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,940
I'm going to the gym.

200
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,850
I'll go with you.

201
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,320
No need.

202
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,470
I…

203
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,770
A girl friend of mine will go with me.

204
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,300
We don't want you to join us.

205
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,970
When did you get this girl friend?

206
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,500
I thought I was the only one

207
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,460
who worked out in the gym with you.

208
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:58,920
Mr. Liu.

209
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,690
Are you really okay?

210
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:02,930
Yeah.

211
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,710
I didn't sleep well last night.

212
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,260
I turned the air conditioner too low and caught a cold.

213
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,690
I'm not going to the company today.

214
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,090
Send the documents I need

215
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,210
to deal with to my house.

216
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:13,670
Mr. Liu,

217
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,190
did you not sleep well

218
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,640
because Luo Ci is Miss Tian's tutor

219
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,240
during the training abroad?

220
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,890
Do you lack work to keep you occupied?

221
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,910
I'll go get myself occupied immediately.

222
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,470
My irascible boss.

223
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,900
He sounded so annoyed on the phone.

224
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,630
If we meet, he'll definitely take it all out on me.

225
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,860
Morning, Assistant Tang.

226
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,100
Morning, Assistant Tian.

227
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,560
You came at the right time.

228
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,520
Mr. Liu.

229
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,140
You're sick.

230
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,520
Don't care so much about how you look.

231
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,340
Why are you here?

232
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,920
Where is Assistant Tang?

233
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,830
Assistant Tang said you caught a cold.

234
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,660
I'm here to check on you

235
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,190
and send you the documents.

236
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,120
Wait for me.

237
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,290
I need to wash up.

238
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,780
Actually, I think you now have

239
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,560
a kind of

240
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,060
dispirited charm.

241
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,660
Really?

242
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,510
Of course.

243
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,470
I'm just kidding.

244
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,970
You're sick.

245
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,260
Don't make a fuss because of me.

246
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,870
Within several minutes,

247
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,470
you managed to make yourself so neat and clean.

248
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,280
I don't need to get all dressed up.

249
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,210
Even if I'm sick,

250
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,630
I have a kind of unaffected charm.

251
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,710
Yes, Mr. Liu.

252
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,120
Your charm has always been unaffected.

253
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,900
Here. Take the medicine.

254
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,220
Tian.

255
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,620
You've accepted

256
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,020
my bouquet and necklace.

257
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,080
I've eaten the cute cookies you made.

258
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,280
But you are still calling me Mr. Liu.

259
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,850
Then what else should I call you?

260
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,870
I'm used to it.

261
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,490
You can call me dear.

262
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,350
Or...

263
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,970
Honey.

264
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,900
No way. You're giving me goosebumps.

265
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,860
Fine.

266
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,370
Take the medicine first.

267
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,450
It's too hot. I don't want it.

268
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,980
I'll add some lukewarm water to it for you.

269
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,820
It's too cold. I don't want it.

270
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,150
Will you take it or not?

271
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,680
I'm sick,

272
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,120
but my girlfriend yelled at me

273
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,120
and called me Mr. Liu.

274
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,890
I'm too sad to take the medicine.

275
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,790
Let me kindly remind you of this.

276
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,230
You're still on probation.

277
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,410
It just means that I'm your future boyfriend.

278
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:04,410
Okay.

279
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,100
In the future,

280
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,580
I'll call you Xilai.

281
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,160
But

282
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,940
I still need to call you Mr. Liu in the company.

283
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,950
Since Mr…

284
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,010
Since you've taken your medicine,

285
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,250
I'll go back to the office.

286
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,780
I'll leave you to your work.

287
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,450
Tian,

288
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,010
I haven't eaten anything yet.

289
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,820
You want me to work now?

290
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,750
So cruel.

291
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,500
He's whining.

292
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,790
So cute.

293
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:55,760
Okay.

294
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,980
I'll make breakfast for you.

295
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,040
Xilai,

296
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,530
this is your healthy breakfast.

297
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,080
Sit down and eat with me.

298
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,760
I wish

299
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,450
time can stop at this moment.

300
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,350
You don't have to go abroad.

301
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,660
Don't run too fast.

302
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,990
It's bad for your knees.

303
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,070
Drink more water.

304
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,330
Don't get dehydrated.

305
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,580
Why did you follow me here again?

306
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,720
Are you that free?

307
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,859
Given that you just broke up and are heartbroken,

308
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,119
I won't argue with you.

309
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,040
Tell me.

310
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,920
Do you want to go shopping or go to an art exhibition?

311
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,410
I'm all yours.

312
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,780
I'm not heartbroken.

313
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:14,880
It's just that you…

314
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,780
I'm done running.

315
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,380
I'm going back to the studio.

316
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,570
It isn't me who broke your heart.

317
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,640
Why are you avoiding me?

318
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,230
Do you still feel uncomfortable?

319
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,660
But the fever has been brought down.

320
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,230
That doesn't mean I've fully recovered.

321
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,740
Neither does it mean that you can walk away.

322
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,450
It definitely doesn't mean you can leave me alone!

323
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,930
-It… -Fine.

324
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,280
I'll stay.

325
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:52,720
Well,

326
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,890
what can I do for you?

327
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,790
Can you chat with me?

328
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,400
You want to chat?

329
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,340
You should be familiar with this.

330
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,210
This is the new AI toy

331
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,760
developed by our company.

332
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,500
It can talk with you anytime

333
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,140
and sing with you as well.

334
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,140
Do you want to try?

335
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,370
Miss Qian, do you want to chat?

336
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,710
You can chat with the new AI robot

337
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,140
developed by my company.

338
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,460
It can chat with you anytime.

339
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,360
Karma prevails.

340
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,340
No one is an exception.

341
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,660
Everything is fate.

342
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,760
There's nothing you can do.

343
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,880
Tian.

344
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,220
I…

345
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,620
My head hurts more badly.

346
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,740
I don't want to chat anymore.

347
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,260
Aren't you having a headache?

348
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,400
Are you sure you want to watch TV?

349
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,490
Watching TV

350
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,950
is an amazing way to divert attention.

351
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,300
Okay.

352
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,260
What do you want to watch?

353
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,040
This one.

354
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,550
You make my heart smile.

355
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,160
A big boss like you

356
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,000
is interested in romance dramas like that?

357
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,200
Fine.

358
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,620
Let's watch it.

359
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,180
You're sick. You make the decisions.

360
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,630
How about

361
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,630
we watch something else?

362
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,970
Tian,

363
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,970
I think this one is good.

364
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,280
When you really love someone,

365
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,350
you can't help

366
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,720
but want to kiss her.

367
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,300
Then let's fast forward through this part.

368
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,080
TV dramas nowadays

369
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,140
are really inappropriate for kids to watch.

370
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,730
Let's stop watching TV

371
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:55,610
and take a rest.

372
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,470
But...

373
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,210
we are not kids.

374
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,510
Why did you take off your watch?

375
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,640
It's a little tight.

376
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,250
Why did you unbutton your shirt?

377
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,460
It's a little hot.

378
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,070
What are you doing?

379
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,190
You're still sick.

380
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,630
Tian,

381
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,960
I have something to tell you.

382
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,120
What is it?

383
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,140
Can you

384
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,660
stay?

385
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,460
Can you not go abroad…

386
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,370
(Senior)

387
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,840
That playboy

388
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,920
is so good at messing things up.

389
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,080
Hello, senior.

390
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,560
I haven't booked the flight yet.

391
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,220
Choose your seat first.

392
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,420
I don't want to give you freedom anymore.

393
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,700
I can't give Tian the opportunity

394
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,900
to bond with my rival.

395
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:35,900
Three months.

396
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,560
Who knows

397
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,610
what will happen.

398
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,300
No!

399
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,190
I can't let that happen.

400
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:33,890
Okay.

401
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,280
I see.

402
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:36,770
Bye.

403
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,370
What's wrong?

404
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,110
Why do you look so pale?

405
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,180
Tian.

406
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,220
I feel tightness in my chest.

407
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,950
I feel so bad.

408
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,790
What's wrong?

409
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:51,740
Sit.

410
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,610
You were fine just now.

411
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,240
Has your cold got worse?

412
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,440
I…

413
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,270
I feel dizzy now

414
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,280
as if I'd been struck by lightning.

415
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,900
Dizzy?

416
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,310
Has his hemophobia relapsed?

417
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,670
Are you still dizzy now?

418
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,900
I'm fine as long as you're by my side.

419
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,150
Once I think that you'll leave me,

420
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,040
my heart aches so badly that I can't breathe.

421
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,490
Is it because of your hemophobia?

422
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,940
Why did it relapse so suddenly?

423
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,310
She misunderstood.

424
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,380
Hemophobia?

425
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,280
Is God giving me a chance?

426
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:40,790
Junior,

427
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,180
how about we both take this flight?

428
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,870
We can sit together and take care of each other.

429
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,980
Take care?

430
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,760
I don't need you to take care of my girl!

431
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,380
Tian,

432
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,900
I can't live without you.

433
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,160
I think the whole house is red now.

434
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,270
My head is spinning.

435
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,390
Your hemophobia seems to have got worse.

436
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:05,680
No.

437
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,880
I'll take you to see Dr. Li now.

438
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,400
Li Huai.

439
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:10,810
No need.

440
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,310
I just need you by my side.

441
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,650
Dr. Li.

442
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,760
Everything he sees now is red.

443
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,220
Has his hemophobia got worse?

444
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,510
Worse?

445
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:34,870
Well,

446
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,390
whether it's got worse,

447
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,540
we'll know after I give him

448
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,170
further examination.

449
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,050
Miss Tian,

450
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,460
please wait outside.

451
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,400
Do you have to go to such lengths

452
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,660
to make Miss Tian stay?

453
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,110
I didn't mean to lie to her.

454
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,820
Tian mistakenly thought that I had a relapse.

455
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,110
I just chose

456
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,360
not to explain.

457
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,490
But,

458
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,840
Miss Tian

459
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,540
really wants to go abroad for training, doesn't she?

460
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,700
There is training abroad every year.

461
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,510
But after Tian

462
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,840
spends three months abroad

463
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,870
with Luo Ci alone,

464
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,530
I may lose her forever.

465
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,830
This is a special matter.

466
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,120
I want no part in it.

467
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,430
Dude,

468
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,610
my happiness lies in your decision.

469
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,550
Then just tell Miss Tian

470
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,240
that you don't want her to go abroad

471
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,870
with Mr. Luo.

472
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,750
I can't say it.

473
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,040
Besides,

474
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,350
Luo Ci is just a playboy.

475
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,050
Making me an option like him

476
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,470
is not acceptable.

477
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,860
It has always been me choosing others.

478
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,840
Besides,

479
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,110
what if I get rejected?

480
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,650
I can't believe

481
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,660
Liu Xilai, who has always been so conceited,

482
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,590
is feeling so insecure now.

483
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,710
I just don't want to waste the chance given by God.

484
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,520
I'll seal the car door

485
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,920
so Tian can't get off.

486
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,200
After I officially become Tian's boyfriend,

487
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,610
I'll spend a fortune to hire the elites in this industry

488
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,060
to be Tian's teachers.

489
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,740
Miss Tian, come in.

490
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,220
Dr. Li, how is he?

491
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,970
Is it serious?

492
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,340
Xilai's condition

493
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,590
can be greatly affected by his mood.

494
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,900
As his friend,

495
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,390
I'm very grateful for your presence in his life.

496
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,730
You made his life more colorful.

497
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,370
More importantly,

498
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,000
you made him a normal person.

499
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,430
Why do you sound

500
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,660
so grave?

501
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,010
I don't know what happened between you two,

502
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,780
but you are indeed the first person

503
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,580
who helped him get over his past.

504
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,690
This relapse

505
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,470
is caused by emotional reasons too.

506
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,150
Maybe something you did

507
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,880
made him insecure

508
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,850
and caused him to fall ill.

509
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,320
Something I did?

510
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,570
Miss Tian,

511
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,580
as I said,

512
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,790
you're the only one who can help him.

513
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,280
You need to find out

514
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,080
the reason why he's feeling insecure.

515
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:40,940
Me?

516
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,170
Tian,

517
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,270
Dr. Li means

518
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,540
your company is my cure.

519
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,260
I need you to spend more time with me

520
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,570
and take care of me.

521
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,980
Am I right, Dr. Li?

522
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,540
Well,

523
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,060
you can also find out what's bothering him

524
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,660
and bring him to face his fear

525
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,050
so he can overcome it.

526
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,800
What do you mean?

527
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,330
I'm telling Miss Tian what to do

528
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,180
to make you get better sooner.

529
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,070
Face the fear?

530
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:14,980
Dr. Li,

531
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,100
I understand.

532
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,230
You understand?

533
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,090
(Bonus Scenes)

534
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,020
There're broken cookies on that plate. Take as many as you like.
(Bonus Scenes)

535
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,700
Tian,
(Bonus Scenes)

536
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,140
(Bonus Scenes)

537
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,100
this is so unfair.
(Bonus Scenes)

538
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,550
(Bonus Scenes)

539
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,590
So, I just deserve the broken ones?
(Bonus Scenes)

540
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:36,900
(Bonus Scenes)

541
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,290
Who's the one
(Bonus Scenes)

542
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:38,350
(Bonus Scenes)

543
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,150
you're making cookies for?
(Bonus Scenes)

544
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,380
(Bonus Scenes)

545
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,310
Tell me his name.
(Bonus Scenes)

546
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,550
(Bonus Scenes)

547
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,160
Is he your senior Luo Ci?
(Bonus Scenes)

548
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,070
No, it's for Mr. Liu.

549
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:47,950
Wait.

550
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,920
You baked cookies for him?

551
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,580
Why?

552
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,230
Did he give you a hard time?

553
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,510
No.

554
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,660
You think too much.

555
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,070
He's not that kind of person.

556
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,990
Then what?

557
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,270
You fell in love with the fragile boss?

558
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,740
Let me make it clear.

559
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,160
He has abs.

560
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,250
He's not fragile.

561
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,470
You're defending him!

562
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,010
Fifty percent chance

563
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,940
that you've fallen in love with that weirdo.

564
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,610
Rose,

565
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,550
stop calling him a weirdo.

566
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,470
He's just smart.

567
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,000
His brains work differently

568
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,640
from ours.

569
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,300
Oh no.

570
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,720
One hundred percent.

571
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,320
His blind date trick worked.

572
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,690
One more thing.

573
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,490
He just doesn't know how to pursue a girl.

574
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,410
He was tricked by Assistant Tang into that blind date.

575
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,560
And he already apologized to me.

576
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,490
You're the one who complained about him.

577
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,020
You're also the one who defended him.

578
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,260
You changed so fast.

579
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,130
I don't know what to believe.

580
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,030
Tian,

581
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,540
are you sure

582
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,630
we are talking about the same person?

583
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,230
Of course.

584
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,010
But people will change.

585
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,570
When a big boss is not bossy anymore,

586
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,180
he can be very agreeable.

587
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,970
We need to let go of prejudice.

588
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,950
Now I see

589
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,330
how gentle a girl can become

590
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,080
when she's in love.
