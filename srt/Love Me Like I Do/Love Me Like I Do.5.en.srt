3
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,410
Zhao, don't cry.

4
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,460
Remember,

5
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't like red.

6
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,740
From now on, in our house,

7
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,340
no red things are allowed.

8
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,860
Therefore, Zhao, please don't buy red toys anymore.

9
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,700
Okay?

10
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,579
I'll take this Superman toy.

11
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,100
His nonsense arrogant personality

12
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,950
hasn't changed for years.

13
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,420
As annoying as ever.

14
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,620
To celebrate Zhao's return,

15
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,090
let's have a toast!

16
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,130
Come on, let's eat.

17
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,350
Zhao.

18
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,290
How is it?

19
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,430
Are you satisfied with your room decoration?

20
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,600
Not bad.

21
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,420
I remember when I was young,

22
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,880
you cried all night

23
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,710
because I changed your Superman bedroom sheet.

24
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,240
Now, I have made it up to you.

25
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,070
Brother,

26
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,050
it was an embarrassment when I was young.

27
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,650
Why are you still mocking me?

28
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,790
Xilai,

29
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,770
since young,

30
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,100
you don't like red.

31
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,480
You should not be mistreated

32
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,850
because you're taking care of Zhao.

33
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,200
Don't do this again.

34
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,760
Got it?

35
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,420
Dad,

36
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,900
who is your son after all?

37
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,490
Tell me the truth.

38
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,110
Did you pick me up?

39
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,720
Why are you

40
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,170
always so unmannered?

41
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,550
Since you're back,

42
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,600
let's go to work

43
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,960
next week.

44
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,550
Your brother is right.

45
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,630
You've grown up.

46
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,600
You should learn more from your brother.

47
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,459
I'm not going.

48
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,740
Aren't you doing well?

49
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,580
I don't want to be the second fiddle.

50
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,260
Then, what do you want to do?

51
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,460
I'll set up a company for you.

52
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,790
I want to have a job

53
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,270
that can make easy money.

54
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,720
Brother, can you make it?

55
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,260
Do you want to be

56
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,010
the feng shui tortoise in the wishing pool?

57
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:56,460
Brother,

58
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,540
you're so humorous.

59
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,010
Surprise!

60
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,530
I miss you so much.

61
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,370
Another one.

62
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,520
It's so awkward.

63
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,390
What's her relationship with Brother Xilai?

64
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,360
The house is really lively after Zhao came home.

65
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,590
This atmosphere is a bit strange.

66
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,540
Is this the Asura Field? Interesting.

(Golden Trinity Reunion Party)

70
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,710
didn't you say she's just your companion?
(Golden Trinity Reunion Party)

71
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,190
Why is she here for the family banquet?

72
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,310
I'm Mr. Liu.

73
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,210
Assistant Tian is a special talent

74
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,810
whom I hired at a high salary.

75
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,480
You flatter me.

76
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,120
It's mainly because you're special.

77
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,510
Brother,

78
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,750
did you do an inside job

79
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,280
and promote your assistant to your girlfriend?

80
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,680
You...

81
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:04,960
No.

82
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,660
Please don't misunderstand.

83
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,520
Mr. Liu and I are just colleagues.

84
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,840
That's right.

85
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
It's just that we get along differently during the day

86
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,390
and in the evening.

87
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,270
Can he shut up?

88
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,590
He is making the situation worse.

89
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,450
Mr. Liu is right.

90
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,380
I work as a toy designer in the company during the day

91
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,680
and as a part-timer after work at night,

92
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,140
where I work as Mr. Liu's special assistant.

93
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,840
Brother Xilai,

94
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,940
since Assistant Tian is working so hard,

95
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,690
you should

96
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,970
let her leave earlier and go home to rest.

97
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,630
This is part of her work.

98
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,640
Only in this way,

99
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,440
she can fully reflect her value.

100
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,550
I have good news.

101
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,470
Our marketing department is progressing well.

102
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,860
Next, we will design the trending toys for Shan Hai Jing series.

103
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,660
The main toy is Nine-tailed Fox.

104
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,430
Don't be happy too soon.

105
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,300
In the following week,

106
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,080
we need to submit

107
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,730
the design proposal of the Shan Hai Jing series.

108
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,190
Be ready to work overtime.

109
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,970
You can't go home on weekends.

110
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,980
Just like before,

111
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,910
I've booked a room for you in the hotel next door.

112
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,830
I hope that you can go and sleep whenever you have time.

113
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,810
If I don't go home,

114
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,410
my cactus will die of thirst.

115
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,750
We will have a meeting this Friday afternoon

116
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,740
for the final draft presentation.

117
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,760
I'm in charge of the design of the nine-tailed fox.

118
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,659
Jiang and Doggie

119
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,220
are in charge of other designs.

120
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,080
Any questions?

121
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,840
No.

122
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,580
Director Zheng,

123
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,140
is there anything that I can do

124
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,630
for the Shan Hai Jing series?

125
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,340
Please sort out

126
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,740
the information of the competitors again.

(Assistant Tang)

128
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,820
Go back to work.

129
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,460
I have a lot of designs to do

130
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,310
yet he still insisted on calling me here.

131
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,240
I admit that

132
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,940
designer toys are more mature in America and Japan.

133
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,860
However, China has its own advantages.

134
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,240
The intellectual property images such as mytical beast in Shan Hai Jing, the ancient legend characters,

135
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,170
and The Hundred Schools of Thought

136
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,600
are deeply rooted in Chinese people's cultural identity.

137
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,250
Take Sun Wukong as an example.

138
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,480
Although it's just a Chinese legend,

139
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,740
its endless appearance in the films and televisions

140
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,340
has made it a super intellectual property.

141
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,500
There are countless examples of such super intellectual properties

142
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,270
in China

143
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,500
waiting for us to dig, just like a treasure.

144
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,720
This sick man.

145
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,630
Although he has a strange brain,

146
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,190
when it comes to business,

147
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,010
he is doing a pretty good job.

148
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,180
I have to work hard for my career too.

149
00:08:59,460 --> 00:08:59,920
Come in.

150
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,590
Director Zheng,

151
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,210
I drafted some designs at home this weekend.

152
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,520
I would like to hear your opinion.

153
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,820
Not bad.

154
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,450
The style is unique,

155
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,580
the lines are lively

156
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,620
and the facial expression is cute and naive.

157
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,280
Director Zheng,

158
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,230
can I submit the design proposal

159
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,520
for Shan Hai Jing series too?

160
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,360
Okay.

161
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,580
I'll make a good industrial analysis report.

162
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,340
Please submit the design proposal by Friday.

163
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,340
Late submission is not acceptable.

164
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,100
Really?

165
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,580
Thank you, Director.

166
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,900
I promise.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,130

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,800
Assistant Tian,

174
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,490
Director Liu said your phone might have run out of battery,

175
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,890
so he asked me to call you.

176
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,770
(May 10, Tuesday)

177
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,250
(May 11, Wednesday)

178
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,240
Assistant Tian.

179
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,250
Assistant Tian.

180
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:45,300
Assistant Tian.

181
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,050
(May 12, Thursday)
Assistant Tian.

182
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,850
(May 12, Thursday)

183
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,780
Assistant Tian.
(May 12, Thursday)

184
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:55,060
(May 12, Thursday)

185
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,340
Just now, you all had explained your proposals.

186
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,730
Each of you has your own characteristics,

187
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,200
but

188
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,740
the interestingness and visual aspect of these proposals

189
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,940
are not outstanding.

190
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,690
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
I was delayed by something just now.

192
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,680
Since you're here,

193
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,340
tell us about your proposal.

194
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,880
I...

195
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
I'm almost done.

196
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,290
I can explain my design concepts first.

197
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:20,760
No need.

198
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,140
This is work.

199
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,620
It's not as casual as students handing in their homework.

200
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,130
Tian Tian is summoned by Mr. Liu every day.

201
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,330
She's as busy as a top.

202
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,910
Moreover, our meeting was brought forward suddenly.

203
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,280
It's understandable that she didn't finish it.

204
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,840
I want to do well in trending toy design

205
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:40,870
and become...

206
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,130
Given your current situation,

207
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,800
you can only stay in your imagination.

208
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,400
Tian Tian,

209
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,190
you are talented in design,

210
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,420
but to convert your talent into professionalism,

211
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,620
you still need a lot of time to practice.

212
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,660
If you can't,

213
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,050
you might as well give up

214
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,780
so that no one will be burdened.

215
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,380
I understand what you mean, Director.

216
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,010
I'll solve my problem.

217
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,760
Looks like I need to talk to Mr. Liu again.

218
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,280
Assistant Tian.

219
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,800
Since you are here,

220
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,620
tomorrow morning,

221
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,460
I need you to accompany me

222
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,860
to participate in a public relation event.

223
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,740
Mr. Liu, please wait a while.

224
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,730
I have a lot of work to do in the design department during the day.

225
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,190
If you can handle the event by wearing sunglasses during the day,

226
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,340
can I work as a special assistant after work?

227
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,270
Assistant Tian,

228
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,760
I can't agree with that.

229
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,200
We need to arrange tasks based on their importance

230
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,680
instead of simply dividing the tasks by time.

231
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,160
Then, after all

232
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,280
none of the business is more important than yours.

233
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,010
I can't agree with that either.

234
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,600
With the same time cost,

235
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,410
whoever can create more value

236
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,910
is the most important one.

237
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,770
As far as I know,

238
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,430
You spent most of your time in the Design Department

239
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,690
reading documents only.

240
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,290
Am I right?

241
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,260
How did you know I was just reading the documents?

242
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,260
I understand now.

243
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,510
You just want me to read the documents

244
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,680
to satisfy your wish of summoning me anytime, right?

245
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,100
Don't you know that unlimited access to the product information of Qiansheng Group anytime

246
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,500
is the pleasure that all the new designers

247
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,900
are longing for?

248
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,640
I'm a new designer.

249
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,830
Therefore, I need more practice.

250
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,690
Just like that cup of coffee.

251
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,670
It's instant.

252
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,620
Hence, it's not as tasty as the handmade ones.

253
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,100
It's indeed not good.

254
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,400
Assistant Tang.

255
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,670
From now on, the coffee in the pantry

256
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,720
will all be switched to handmade.

257
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,260
You...

258
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,700
Look, the problem is solved.

259
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,390
It's like a chicken trying to talk to a duck.

260
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,210
A chicken trying to talk to a duck?

261
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,010
She means that

262
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,130
I'm a duck?

263
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,660
I always tell myself

264
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,520
that I made the right choice.

265
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,910
But, why do I feel like

266
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,100
I'm getting farther away from realizing my dream?

267
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,970
Get to know more excellent people like me,

268
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,970
then your dream will come true soon.

269
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,880
If I get to know more people as excellent as you,

270
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,230
then I'll lose my dream soon.

271
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,300
You're right.

272
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,890
After all, I'm very rich.

273
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,220
There's nothing that I can't achieve.

274
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,320
What a nightmare!

275
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,450
Why did Assistant Tian ignore me?

276
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,860
I will never give up.

277
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,330
Mr. Liu.

278
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,100
(Plaintiff)

279
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,240
You treat me as your assistant
(Plaintiff)

280
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,610
(Plaintiff)

281
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,740
in the guise of hiring me as a designer.
(Plaintiff)

282
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,780
(Plaintiff)

283
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,790
You're crying up wine and selling vinegar.
(Plaintiff)

284
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:17,940
You're crying up wine and selling vinegar.

285
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,590
(Defendant)
You're crying up wine and selling vinegar.

286
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:18,810
(Defendant)

287
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,740
Assistant Tian.
(Defendant)

288
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,310
(Defendant)

289
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,300
You failed to find the balance between two jobs
(Defendant)

290
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,910
You failed to find the balance between two jobs

291
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,280
and didn't learn the essence of my excellent characteristic.

292
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,100
You still need to work hard.

293
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,700
Your Honor,

294
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,140
He is mind controlling me at work.

295
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,350
Assistant Tian.

296
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,680
You’re in the delusion of persecution.

297
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,040
Tian! Tian!

298
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,490
Love is presumptuous.

299
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,020
Hatred must be restrained.

300
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,830
You should not do that.

301
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,200
How can I handle the self-centered CEO?

302
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,700
Assistant Tian.

303
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,470
What are you doing?

304
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,740
Why are you here?

305
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,820
Brother Xilai.

306
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,660
I brought you some paintings.

307
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,230
(CEO Mudslide Liu)

308
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:35,150
He still wants to mind control me after work.

309
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,680
Assistant Tian,

310
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,250
it's time to fulfill your duty as a special assistant.

311
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,660
I refuse.

312
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,970
Where is your spirit of contract?

313
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,280
I'm sorry. I'm off work now.

314
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,050
In the afternoon, you said that

315
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,020
I will work as a special assistant after work.

316
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,300
But the premise is

317
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,880
I work as a designer during working hours.

318
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,910
Okay, deal.

319
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,700
I need emergency help here. Please come quickly.

320
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,240
Xian.

321
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,840
What's going on?

322
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,630
This is a rare item.

323
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,190
I'm sorry, Brother Xilai.

324
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,859
I'll repay you my father's collection,

325
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,450
the Long Quan celadon.

326
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,970
I'll go pack up.

327
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,110
How can you hang Sisley's painting

328
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,910
here?

329
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,710
Xian, your dad doesn't have this painting.

330
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,660
You

331
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,820
are not suitable for walking.

332
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,480
You'd better rest for a while.

333
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,670
The paintings that you gave me,

334
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,590
I'll set them up later by myself.

335
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,350
You're finally here, jinx.

336
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,370
Jinx?

337
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,300
Who's a jinx?

338
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,300
You.

339
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,450
The savior of Sisley's painting,

340
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,780
and the jinx of Wen Xian.

341
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,280
Come, Mr. Liu.

342
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,610
Repeat your promise again clearly.

343
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,950
I promise

344
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,060
from now on,

345
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,100
Tian Tian is a designer during the day,

346
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,290
and CEO's special assistant at night.

347
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,990
A special assistant does house chores too?

348
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,230
Miss Tian,

349
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,550
do you still have any identity

350
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,550
that I don't know?

351
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,690
Miss Wen,

352
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,160
this is all I have.

353
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,200
This...

354
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,080
Was this a disaster movie?

355
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,300
Or did someone's husky come here?

356
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,700
You...

357
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,970
Nice.

358
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,940
You found the right person.

359
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,500
Assistant Tian.

360
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,200
Can you clean this up for me?

361
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,160
Okay.

362
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,120
This is the solitary work from France performance artist,

363
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,420
Du Shang.

364
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,340
It’s priceless and the only one in the world.

365
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,330
If someone knew a little about art,

366
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,180
he wouldn't be so rude about it.

367
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,170
It's well set up here, isn't it?

368
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,100
At least it didn't end up

369
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,750
being broken into pieces, right?

370
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,150
You...

371
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,080
Brother Xilai, look.

372
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,330
She messed up

373
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,420
all the items of different masters

374
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,080
from different generations.

375
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,380
This is what I like about Assistant Tian.

376
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,420
Her way of tidying things up

377
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,130
freely without any restriction.

378
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,790
Assistant Tian, please go on.

379
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,100
Okay.

380
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:16,950
Excuse me.

381
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,830
Do you want to help me hold the ladder?

382
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Thank you so much.

383
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,280
Painting, painting, painting.

384
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:55,900
My painting.

385
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:02,960
Perfect.

386
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:06,980
Mr. Liu, I...

387
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,920
♫When my heart starts galloping♫

388
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,740
♫Without me realizing it♫

389
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,350
♫You steal the spring from my heart♫

390
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,860
♫You are the most surprising thing in my life♫

391
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,380
You've gone too far,

392
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,930
Assistant Tian.

393
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,430
Just now, I...

394
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,670
- I was worried about my painting, so... - Mr. Liu,

395
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,000
it was just an accident.

396
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,330
My work is done.

397
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,490
I should go back now.

398
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,060
Ah, it's the other way.

399
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,240
How cute.

400
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,500
I haven't kissed Brother Xilai's forehead yet.

401
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,140
I didn't expect that first forehead kiss

402
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,640
would be taken by her.

403
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,830
Damn it!

404
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,340
It was an accident.

405
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Just an accident.

406
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,730
But how should I face him tomorrow?

407
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,680
Assistant Tian,

408
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,440
your bag.

409
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,120
Thank you.

410
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,950
Unbelievable,

411
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,580
I'm not dizzy.

412
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,070
Are you crazy?

413
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,990
I can't believe

414
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,790
that I am not dizzy when I see red anymore.

415
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,380
♪ Why are the flowers so red ♪

416
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:56,800
♪ Why are they so red ♪

417
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,330
Hello, the red bedding you have ordered

418
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,540
is arriving soon.

419
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,870
It will arrive within half an hour.

420
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,760
Okay. What a perfect plan.

421
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,440
Assistant Tang.

422
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,760
Help me cancel

423
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,870
all the events tomorrow

424
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,340
and help me make an appointment with Doctor Li

425
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,470
as soon as possible.

426
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,090
Mr. Liu, what's wrong?

427
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,380
Is your condition getting worse?

428
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,810
No, no, no.

429
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,100
I'm feeling very good right now.

430
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,340
Blood... Blood...

431
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,220
So much blood.

432
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,560
-Wake up! -A lot of blood.

433
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,350
Wake up.

434
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,580
Wake up! Please wake up now!

435
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,090
Blood! Blood!

436
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,470
Don't be afraid.

437
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,700
Mom said

438
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,090
when you're scared,

439
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,550
just kiss your forehead, then you won't be scared anymore.

440
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,330
I merely saw a little girl.

441
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,570
She held my hand

442
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,270
and kissed my forehead.

443
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:13,800
But

444
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,060
no matter how hard I try,

445
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,560
I can't see her face clearly.

446
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,140
It's great progress

447
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,620
to remember so many parts of the accidents this time.

448
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,260
You don't have to be too worry about it.

449
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,220
It feels like

450
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,090
you are not so resistive to hypnosis anymore.

451
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,350
Did something happen?

452
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,320
Assistant Tian accidentally jumped at me

453
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,680
and

454
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,030
kissed my forehead.

455
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,850
Is it related to this?

456
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,540
From a medical point of view,

457
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,490
there is no scientific evidence

458
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,970
or related cases on this.

459
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,750
But your dizziness on red color is psychogenic.

460
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,730
We can investigate it from the perspective of psychology.

461
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,050
If you recreate the situation that comforted you,

462
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,460
it's possible to open your heart

463
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,180
and help you get better.

464
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,880
So, does it mean that

465
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,060
my illness...

466
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,390
is cured?

467
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,240
We're not sure yet.

468
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,040
Further observation is needed.

469
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,930
Since we are not sure,

470
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:45,100
let's seize the day.

471
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,170
(Bonus Scenes)

472
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,120
How can Zhao

473
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,490
(Bonus Scenes)

474
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,220
appreciate this at the moment?

475
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,810
(Bonus Scenes)

476
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,610
This painting

477
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:55,650
(Bonus Scenes)

478
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,190
is the solitary work of the artist, Sisley.
(Bonus Scenes)

479
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,940
I bid for it.
(Bonus Scenes)

480
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,860
(Bonus Scenes)

481
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,530
After all, it's my brother's
(Bonus Scenes)

482
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:00,560
(Bonus Scenes)

483
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,040
present of coming back to homeland.
(Bonus Scenes)

484
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,360
As his brother,
(Bonus Scenes)

485
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,630
(Bonus Scenes)

486
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,290
you can't spoil him like this.
(Bonus Scenes)

487
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,980
(Bonus Scenes)

488
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,050
Zhao, come here.
(Bonus Scenes)

489
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:11,840
(Bonus Scenes)

490
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,750
Your brother knew that you are coming back,
(Bonus Scenes)

491
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,950
so he bought this for you at a high price.
(Bonus Scenes)

492
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,460
(Bonus Scenes)

493
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,190
Did Liu Xilai love me that much?
(Bonus Scenes)

494
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:18,840
(Bonus Scenes)

495
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,120
I knew it. You bought me green foxtail.

496
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,710
Are you implying that I'm a wild grass that no one loves?

497
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,310
Liu Xilai.

498
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,610
You're really a cunning person.

499
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,160
Brother,

500
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,510
thank you for your concern.

501
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,780
I think that this plant is very unique.

502
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,070
It matches your temperament very well.

503
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,180
I feel like I am being insulted

504
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,070
but I have no evidence.
