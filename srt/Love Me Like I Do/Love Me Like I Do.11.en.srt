00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,900
(Love Me Like I Do)

2
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,740
(Running Towards Each Other Carelessly)
(Episode 11)

3
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,160
One hour and three minutes left.

4
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,660
Are you...

5
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,390
in love?

6
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,000
Is it that obvious?

7
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,450
You're with

8
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,250
Assistant Tian.

9
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,090
How did you know?

10
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,229
Haven't you heard?

11
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,100
Love is like sneezing.

12
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,900
You can't hide it.

13
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,960
That's right.

14
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,970
We like each other.

15
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,140
If everything goes well,

16
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,860
in an hour,

17
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,720
I'll spend a wonderful afternoon

18
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,050
in the cinema with Tian.

19
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,120
Usually, such illogical words

20
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,320
will harshly refuted

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,660
by reality.

22
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,320
Yes.

23
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,790
You're right.

24
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,220
Although there's a 90% chance of Tian

25
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,950
inviting me,

26
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,060
there's also a 10% chance that

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
she'll invite her friend Shan Rose.

28
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,380
So, we need to have a perfect plan.

29
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,620
We...

30
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,390
That's right.

31
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:48,800
Because

32
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,920
if the 10% chance happens,

33
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,800
it will look awkward if I go to the movies

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,320
alone.

35
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,120
If I take Assistant Tang with me, it will look too deliberate.

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,650
So, if you accompany me and we "bump into" her,

37
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,780
it'll be perfect.

38
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,530
I knew it.

39
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,710
You invited me out alone.

40
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,430
How could it be so simple?

41
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,140
You're using me as a tool.

42
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,810
But an "accidental" meeting would be good anyway.

43
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,610
Miss Shan has misunderstood me.

44
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,740
I could explain some things to her.

45
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,030
What kind of misunderstanding

46
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,840
do you have with Reporter Shan?

47
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,170
It's all because of you.

48
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,600
Forget it. There's no use telling you.

49
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,540
Your Tian

50
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,160
hasn't called you yet?

51
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,690
There's still time.

52
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,780
What will be, will be.

53
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,430
I need to stay calm.

54
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,450
Assistant Tian.

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,360
Who is that man?

56
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,960
Are you sure you're able to stay calm now?

57
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,060
Why him?

58
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,600
Reality always refutes these things so quickly.

59
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,840
Although a surprise beyond the 10% chance

60
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,640
has appeared,

61
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,240
the plan continues.

62
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,200
Look at them.

63
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,940
Senior, should we buy some popcorn?

64
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,590
Sure.

65
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,270
Aren't you in a relationship?

66
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,260
Isn't it with Assistant Tian?

67
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,190
What's going on?

68
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,500
I thought we were running towards each other in love.

69
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,560
I was too careless.

70
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,460
With your credentials,

71
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,580
being deluded that you're in a love affair

72
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,180
is normal.

73
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,300
You just need to learn your lesson a few more times.

74
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,230
My condolences.

75
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,659
It's time to test our friendship.

76
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,880
Plan B.

77
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,340
Plan "Accidental" Encounter

78
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,260
starts now.

79
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,100
Why did you ask me out for a movie?

80
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,180
Curator Fang gave me the tickets.

81
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,320
I'm just giving away a gift.

82
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,250
You should have gotten a share too.

83
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,410
Just because...

84
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,820
of this?

85
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,250
And yesterday,

86
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,490
Mr. Liu left you alone

87
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,040
and dragged me away.

88
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,210
I wanted to apologize to you

89
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,400
for his arrogant behavior.

90
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,650
He is him, you are you.

91
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,070
You don't have to apologize for him.

92
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,500
Mr. Liu

93
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,660
is used to having everyone

94
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,530
look up to him.

95
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,610
He has a bit of a narcissistic personality,

96
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,840
especially when he's with faced with

97
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,480
someone who's as good as him.

98
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,200
He's become so competitive.

99
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,190
Senior,

100
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,500
don't take it to heart.

101
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,930
It's nothing.

102
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,610
The movie is about to start.

103
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,170
Let's go.

104
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,140
Narcissistic.

105
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,780
He's so competitive.

106
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,460
He's weird.

107
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,620
Crazy.

108
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,470
Are we not

109
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,430
weird enough right now?

110
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,840
She really hit the nail on the head.

111
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,990
I'm just confident and ambitious.

112
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,480
I don't put myself in a box.

113
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,560
Assistant Tian expressed all of that

114
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,630
problematically.

115
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,600
I think you're right.

116
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,430
Assistant Tian seemed to be complaining about you

117
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,690
but she was actually standing up for you.

118
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,560
Your hope for the 90% chance

119
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,540
is still there.

120
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,360
We can't continue.

121
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,780
I can't let them, a single man and woman,

122
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,750
hang out alone in a room

123
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,060
in the darkness.

124
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,060
This counts as being alone?

125
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,300
What's the most natural way of bumping into someone?

126
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:02,780
Senior.

127
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,710
I heard that this movie is very interesting.

128
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,540
Excuse me.

129
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,680
Excuse me.

130
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,740
Why are you here?

131
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,850
What a coincidence, Tian.

132
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,650
Are you here to watch a movie too?

133
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,640
Could you be more deliberate?

134
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,150
Mr Liu,

135
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,380
don't you come to cinemas to watch movies?

136
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,440
What a coincidence

137
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,210
to meet you like this.

138
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,270
Although my teammate acted lousily,

139
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,950
my opponent's pretty high level.

140
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,100
Yes, what a coincidence.

141
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,800
Is your movie ticket

142
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,720
from Curator Fang?

143
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,320
Bingo.

144
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,020
Tian is so smart.

145
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,150
Curator Fang,

146
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,530
are you thanking me or taking revenge on me?

147
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,130
Excuse me.

148
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,620
This are the flowers reserved by the guest on seat number four.

149
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,210
Mr. Liu.

150
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,790
Are these flowers for your friend?

151
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,140
Yes.

152
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,660
They're for my friend.

153
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,730
Thank you.

154
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,700
About roses...

155
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,890
Although roses

156
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,010
represent love,

157
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,260
when there are

158
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,950
13 roses,

159
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,480
they represent friendship.

160
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,490
It looks like there are 13 roses.

161
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,180
Liu Xilai, I'm cutting you off when I get back.

162
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,520
Have some popcorn, junior sister.

163
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,270
Thank you.

164
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,100
Tian.

165
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,770
Li Huai left early.

166
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,620
So I can accompany you now.

167
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,890
Junior sister,

168
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,100
thank you for inviting me to the movie.

169
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,760
After this,

170
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,740
let me treat you to dinner.

171
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's go to the barbecue restaurant you always talk about.

172
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:15,810
Mr Liu.

173
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,400
Barbecue restaurants

174
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,060
don't suit your temperament.

175
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,740
They certainly

176
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,420
don't match

177
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,220
your haute couture suit.

178
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,860
It's okay.

179
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,020
It's very compatible with my temperament.

180
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,330
Mr. Liu, feel free.

181
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,370
As long as you're not awkward,

182
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,340
I won't feel awkward either.

183
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,280
Dad.

184
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,230
Who is your son?

185
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,700
You have

186
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,230
always been so naughty.

187
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,190
You should learn more from your brother.

188
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,860
In my eyes,

189
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,370
compared to Brother Xilai,

190
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,010
you're only a little bit lacking.

191
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,760
Since you're here,

192
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,950
why don't you train?

193
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,820
You really don't know where Brother Xilai is?

194
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,290
Him?

195
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,070
He called me yesterday

196
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,000
asking me what's the most romantic

197
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,010
way to ask a girl to the movies.

198
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,400
I guess he is

199
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,090
probably holding some roses

200
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,870
and watching a romantic movie with the girl now.

201
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,670
What?

202
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,430
Why didn't you tell me

203
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,660
such important information earlier?

204
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,920
Hurry. Which cinema? Let's go there now.

205
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:45,720
No.

206
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,120
Tell me.

207
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,680
What do you want this time?

208
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,310
I'm the Assistant Director of Qiansheng Group now.

209
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,420
I'll buy whatever I want

210
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,860
by myself.

211
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,340
Cut the crap. What are your conditions?

212
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,040
Unless

213
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,150
you beat me.

214
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,000
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

215
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,790
How can I beat you in boxing?

216
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:17,780
Yes.

217
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,580
I did it on purpose.

218
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,770
From now on, I won't be so accommodating

219
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,890
in love anymore.

220
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,160
I have something to do. I have to go.

221
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,340
Are you unhappy again?

222
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,590
You don't even listen to me anymore.

223
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,560
(Delicate CEO)

224
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:48,900
Hello?

225
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,790
I made you a little embarrassed today.

226
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,590
I'll send you Reporter Shan's WeChat

227
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,450
to pay you back.

228
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,380
What do you mean a little?

229
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,100
I've never received flowers

230
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,910
from a man in my life.

231
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,710
And why are you making it up to me

232
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,110
with Miss Shan's WeChat?

233
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,610
Didn't you want to know...

234
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,340
why Miss Shan hates you so much?

235
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,270
Ask her yourself.

236
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,080
You should give her some context at least.

237
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,410
You're making me add her

238
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,570
without any reason?

239
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,140
Hello?

240
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:38,840
Tian.

241
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,370
You have to have pork belly at barbecue.

242
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,230
Your favorite.

243
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,840
Junior, having meat at night

244
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,190
is bad for digestion.

245
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,980
Have some vegetables.

246
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,700
Vegetables are the original sin

247
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,490
when eating barbecue.

248
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,460
Don't be shy, both of you.

249
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,460
I'll do it myself.

250
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,140
Junior,

251
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,600
have some drinks to relieve the greasy taste.

252
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,260
The soul of barbecue is alcohol.

253
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,920
Why don't we

254
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,660
have a competition?

255
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,540
Sure.

256
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,460
I'm not afraid.

257
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,570
Mr. Liu.

258
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,260
Have you forgotten that a few days ago

259
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,830
you got so drunk?

260
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,930
It's okay.

261
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,310
You'll take care of me when I'm drunk.

262
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,380
Senior.

263
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,710
Don't believe him.

264
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,060
He can't drink well.

265
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,840
He's a sloppy drunk.

266
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,030
You'll be the one who's inconvenienced.

267
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,060
I can't drink well and I'm a sloppy drunk too.

268
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,790
It's unclear

269
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,410
who will be the inconvenienced one.

270
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,430
How is it unclear?

271
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,880
I'll be the inconvenienced one.

272
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,030
Again.

273
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,120
Come on. I'm not afraid.

274
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,350
I can't sit here and do nothing.

275
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,630
Assistant Tang, answer the phone.

276
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,330
I'm being oppressed. Should I rebel?

277
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,360
Hey, Rose.

278
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,550
Hurry up! Request backup!

279
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,470
You...

280
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,580
Admit defeat.

281
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,290
I can still drink.

282
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,810
I never

283
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,080
admit defeat.

284
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,780
I didn't expect

285
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,180
that you guys were not just being humble.

286
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,320
Just a few bottles of beer,

287
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,070
and you two have

288
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,260
revealed your true selves.

289
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,450
Tian.

290
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,360
Tell me,

291
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,470
who will win?

292
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,570
Me, of course.

293
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,480
Junior sister and I

294
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,580
have common topics to talk about.

295
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,630
Tian and I have a shared secret.

296
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,580
You two are drunk.

297
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,000
-No, I’m not. -I'm not.

298
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,090
No.

299
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,460
You,

300
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,390
the boss of a company.

301
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,510
You,

302
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,530
a top designer.

303
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,620
Can you not turn into childish riff-raff and quarrel?

304
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,460
Yes.

305
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,500
Tian.

306
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,870
We don't quarrel with this childish riff-raff.

307
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,130
Let's go home.

308
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,670
Let's go, Tian.

309
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
You're not allowed to hold her hand.

310
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,130
You're not allowed to look at others.

311
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,430
You can only look at me.

312
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,010
Tian, I'm here.

313
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,680
What's going on?

314
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:41,940
Stop.

315
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,450
Welcome.

316
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
How can I help you?

317
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,250
Hello, I want two rooms.

318
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,220
In this society,

319
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,930
even men are not safe outside.

320
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,540
I'm sorry.

321
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,000
We only have one room left.

322
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's a double bed.

323
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,310
Leaving these two

324
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,260
drunken kids here.

325
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,300
Is it really okay?

326
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,380
What else can we do?

327
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,359
Do you have the strength

328
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,650
to send them both home?

329
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,290
No.

330
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,040
It's over. Let's go home.

331
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,119
Tian.

332
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,319
Tell me what happened.

333
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,460
Nothing.

334
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,780
It's just two drunkards being drunk.

335
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,110
You're not allowed to look at others.

336
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,390
You can only look at me.

337
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,860
I don't think I'm imagining it.

338
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,870
Mr. Liu must have feelings for me.

339
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,890
Why are you on my bed?

340
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,600
I should be asking you that.

341
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,610
Why am I here alone with you?

342
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,410
How could Tian leave me in a hotel?

343
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,830
And with you at that.

344
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,750
You like my junior, right?

345
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,730
Mr. Luo,

346
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,370
mind your words.

347
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,040
Tian is my employee.

348
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,420
Mine.

349
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,240
I'll be frank with you.

350
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,490
I know what you're thinking.

351
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,150
Similarly,

352
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,220
I know what you're scheming.

353
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,050
You should give up.

354
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,220
Tian has to face

355
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,900
a quality man like me every day.

356
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,620
Why would she be interested in an arty-farty boy

357
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,170
like you?

358
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,670
It's useless to just talk.

359
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,830
Love is not about conditions

360
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,120
but feelings.

361
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:04,820
Fine.

362
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,920
May the best man win.

363
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,750
Isn't it all about feeling?

364
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,380
Mr. Liu, it seems like

365
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,620
yesterday's date didn't go well.

366
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,090
It wasn't as I expected,

367
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,070
but I didn't lose.

368
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,160
It's a draw.

369
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,890
Mr. Liu, let me ask you a question.

370
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,230
Weren't you watching a movie with Assistant Tian yesterday?

371
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,470
How did you end up sleeping with Mr. Luo?

372
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,980
How dare you ask me?

373
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,060
You're single. Every time,

374
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,620
you confidently promise me it'll work,

375
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,420
where do you get the confidence?

376
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,530
Mr. Liu, you can look down on single people,

377
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,130
but you can't doubt big data.

378
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,310
Tian

379
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,540
probably likes me.

380
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,620
But the arty-farty Luo Ci

381
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,610
is always around

382
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,550
to disturb her.

383
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,400
Mr. Liu,

384
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,250
I like your persistence.

385
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,340
I must eliminate this interference

386
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,730
and let Tian realize

387
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,320
her love for me.

388
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,580
Please give me another chance.

389
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,590
I've made an upgraded plan.

390
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,280
I promise to help you get her.

391
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,670
It better work.

392
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,770
(The CEO's Little Wife)

(100 Ways To Get a Wife as a CEO)

394

100 Ways To Get a Wife as a CEO.
(100 Ways To Get a Wife as a CEO)

395

100 Ways To Get a Wife as a CEO.

396
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,720
The CEO's Little Wife.

397
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,760
Prince Charming Next Door.

398
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,660
What kind of weird books are these?

399
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,730
According to big data analysis,

400
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,250
the most effective way to move past

401
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,910
the grey area period in romance is stimulation.

402
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,930
For example?

403
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,480
For example,

404
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,700
when there's no progress in the relationship,

405
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,490
a love rival, the second female lead,

406
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,700
will make the female lead feel threatened.

407
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,340
Based on CEO literature,

408
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,800
this trick is infallible.

409
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,100
It can make the female lead

410
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,630
feel the threat of a love rival

411
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,500
and face their inner emotions.

412
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,410
Is this trustworthy?

413
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,510
It's like a merger between two companies.

414
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,280
Suddenly, another company is involved.

415
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,940
Isn't it easy to fall out then?

416
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,980
Dating is not like business.

417
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,490
That's what the bestselling books say.

418
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,500
You have a point.

419
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,420
But it's so sudden.

420
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,430
Where can I find the love rival?

421
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,920
(Uncle)

422
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:23,900
Uncle.

423
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,080
Xilai.

424
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,840
The girl I mentioned last time has returned to China.

425
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,630
She asked to meet at 2 p.m. tomorrow.

426
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,270
I saw the photo. She's pretty.

427
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,600
You must trust my taste.

428
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,970
If you stand me up again...

429
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,050
I won't, Uncle.

430
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,270
I'll definitely go this time.

431
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,500
Fine.

432
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,740
What a coincidence.

433
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,260
My sweetheart

434
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,980
is not far from me this time.

435
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,680
Calm down.

436
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,920
Calm down.

437
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,740
There's just a possibility

438
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,050
that you'll get a girlfriend today.

439
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,250
No need to be so grand.

440
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,580
Mr. Liu, the car is here.

441
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,070
Perfect.

442
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,870
Assistant Tang,

443
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,090
pick one of the latest bags.

444
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,250
I can only make up for using the girl as a tool

445
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,300
with a bag.

446
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,740
It is said that bags can cure all diseases.

447
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,540
Okay, Mr. Liu.

448
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,670
Also,

449
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,460
Uncle Liu said

450
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,940
to check your belongings

451
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,750
before you leave.

452
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,100
What do you mean?

453
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,400
Uncle Liu said

454
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,020
Poker,

455
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,210
mini mahjong

456
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,040
are all prohibited items.

457
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,460
He also asked you not to go too far.

458
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:47,980
Assistant Tang,

459
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,700
is it polite

460
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,370
to speak like that?

461
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,010
I'm just a messenger.

462
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,350
I have to finish this blind date perfectly

463
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,610
and make Tian feel threatened.

464
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,970
She'll find her way back

465
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,400
from that crooked Luo Ci.

466
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,420
Assistant Tian will definitely

467
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,990
realize her love for you

468
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,350
in the face of this quality love rival.

469
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,760
(I have an important date today. Looking forward to it.)

470
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,400
What if

471
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,870
Tian doesn't see this Moment?

472
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,410
Don't worry, Mr. Liu.

473
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,210
Leave it to me.

474
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,160
Remember, be natural.

475
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:30,940
Natural.

476
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:45,780
Assistant Tian,

477
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,150
please help me like my first Moment.

478
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,100
Accompanying my boss to buy gifts for his blind date.

479
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,360
I'll give out presents if I get 100 likes.

480
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,570
So I was just imagining it.

481
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,840
Rose is right.

482
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,460
One of the three major delusions in life.

483
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,660
He likes me.

484
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,170
Hello, senior.

485
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,890
Are you free today?

486
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,580
You said you were looking for lotus perfume.

487
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,640
I made some for you.

488
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,380
You know how to make perfume?

489
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,570
I'll send you the address.

490
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,070
See you later.

491
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,550
Okay.

492
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:27,900
See you later.

493
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,790
Cheer up, Tian Tian.

494
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,000
Don't think about that Weirdo Boss anymore.

495
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,210
Mr. Liu.

496
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,500
Moments and gifts

497
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,480
are all done.

498
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,210
It's about time.

499
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,050
We'll go there now.

500
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:48,850
You were late.

501
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,950
I was wrong.

502
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,750
I'll spend more time with you.

503
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,600
His has such interesting hobbies.

504
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,540
Does Tian know?

505
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,960
No.

506
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,070
What a playboy!

507
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,720
You hid it so well.

508
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,620
As my son,

509
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,440
when did you last contact me?

510
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,790
Okay.

511
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,680
I'll keep you company.

512
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,280
Mr. Luo Ci,

513
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,800
I really like your work.

514
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,550
Can I have your autograph?

515
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:32,990
Okay.

516
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,690
Why is he here too?

517
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,860
First, the older woman

518
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,480
and now, a young girl.

519
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:40,960
Thank you.

520
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,740
What a jerk!

521
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,810
Tian!

522
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,080
Calm down. Be steady.

523
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,130
She's coming.

524
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,510
She's walking over.

525
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,980
She's going to be angry

526
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,280
and question me sadly.

527
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,150
Then she'll tell me how she feels.

528
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,290
Come on.

529
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,910
Show me your true feelings.

530
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,170
Why is he here?

531
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,710
Sorry, there was a traffic jam.

532
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,970
I just arrived.

533
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,830
My mother came back to visit her friends

534
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,700
and I accompanied her to buy some gifts.

535
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,830
It took me some time.

536
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,310
Are you Mr. Liu?

537
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:21,720
Yes.

538
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,440
Hello, I'm Gao Jing.

539
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,530
Hello.

540
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,090
This is a gift for you.

541
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,270
Thank you.

542
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,820
Nothing comes free.

543
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:36,720
Can I open it?

544
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,040
It's so unlucky.

545
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,390
I can't believe I ran into him here.

546
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,090
I have to watch him go on the blind date.

547
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,430
Mr. Liu.

548
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,210
What's going on over there?

549
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,040
The view there is unique.

550
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,170
I yearn for it.

551
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,860
Mr. Liu, you are so humorous.

552
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,770
I heard that you are

553
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,330
the CEO of Qiansheng Group.

554
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,340
My position is

555
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,430
the daughter of the hospital director.

556
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,300
I think we're a perfect match.

557
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,130
Is the daughter of the hospital director

558
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,280
a position?

559
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,210
My uncle's taste is even weirder than mine.

560
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,600
She's not as good as Tian.

561
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,470
After getting married,

562
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,450
you have to go to my home every year.

563
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,690
Miss Gao,

564
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,210
is it too early for us to talk about this?

565
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,960
Miss Gao likes me?

566
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,140
Why hasn't Tian come to take me away?

567
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,960
She saw

568
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,370
my blind date here.

569
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,930
Mr. Liu,

570
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,540
we will get married sooner or later.

571
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,620
So,

572
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,900
we need to make it clear in advance.

573
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,430
Miss Gao.

574
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,580
I don't intend to get married.

575
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,100
I just...

576
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,060
Mr. Liu.

577
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,310
Is that

578
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,930
a gift for me?

579
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,730
Miss Gao,

580
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,720
this gift is my apology.

581
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,720
I'm sorry.

582
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,950
We're not suitable for each other.

583
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,140
Mr. Liu,

584
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,840
you are so sweet.

585
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,180
I didn't expect

586
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,400
you to give me such an expensive gift at our first meeting.

587
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,560
It's Mr. Liu.

588
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,720
Do you want to say hello?

589
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,400
No.

590
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,900
He doesn't want to be disturbed.

591
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,370
Senior.

592
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,210
This perfume is like summer.

593
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,480
Thank you, senior.

594
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,980
Are you free later?

595
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,880
If not,

596
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,110
let's go to

597
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,540
the stray shelter later.

598
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:36,900
Sure.

599
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:37,670
Let's go.

600
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,150
Miss Gao.

601
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,930
I'm sorry for wasting your time again.

602
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,060
Sorry, I'm leaving.

603
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,350
Tian.

604
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,490
I need to talk to you.

605
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,720
Sorry.

606
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,680
She's busy.

607
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,070
Her schedule has been

608
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,600
booked by me.

609
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,150
Luo Ci,

610
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,850
I'm warning you.

611
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,270
No matter how much you flirt,

612
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,210
don't put your hands on my people.

613
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,310
What do you mean?

614
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,050
Qiansheng Group's people belong to me.

615
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,300
Do you have a problem?

616
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,800
Senior,

617
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,470
why don't we visit the animals

618
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,430
some other day?

619
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,160
Excuse me for today.

620
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:36,910
Tian!

621
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:37,850
Tian!

622
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,760
Let go!

623
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,410
You can talk here.

624
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,480
Tian,

625
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:44,810
I meant well.

626
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,860
I'm trying to prevent you

627
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,350
from becoming another girl who's falling into this playboy's trap.

628
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,790
Senior is not a playboy.

629
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,000
But Mr. Liu,

630
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,130
you're seeing someone else and giving them gifts,

631
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,390
and you're still messing around with me.

632
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,400
Are you jealous?

633
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,520
No.

634
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,220
You're as deludedly confident as ever.

635
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,640
Confidence comes from strength.

636
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,900
Can you cheat just because you're capable?

637
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,350
Tian.

638
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,240
If I'm a player,

639
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,650
I wouldn't have posted it on purpose

640
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,340
and ask Assistant Tang to tell you the address on purpose.

641
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,960
I sent so many love signals.

642
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,650
Didn't your wifi

643
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,500
receive any signal?

644
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,900
What signal? What wifi?

645
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,900
It's clearly just your ploy to

646
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,290
to brag about your charm.

647
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,750
Tian, you misunderstood.

648
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,960
I like you.

649
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,180
You...

650
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,200
You like me?

651
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,760
You like me and go on blind dates with others?

652
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,890
You have a big heart indeed.

653
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,880
You are the only one for me

654
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,840
in this multifarious world.

655
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,740
What?

656
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,430
I won't be fooled by you again.

657
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,230
Tian,

658
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,010
I really like you.

659
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,990
To let you

660
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,300
feel my feelings for you,

661
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,380
I've tried very hard

662
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,490
to use your ways

663
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,610
to show up in front of you

664
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,740
in a low-key manner.

665
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,470
I didn't feel

666
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,850
that you were being low-key.

667
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,150
How can you not feel it?

668
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,870
I'm so afraid of animals.

669
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,080
I still took part in

670
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,510
the stray shelter event.

671
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,700
And yesterday,

672
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,040
I asked Curator Fang

673
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,170
to reserve tickets for you.

674
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,640
I prepared everything for you to ask me out.

675
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,080
But you went with Luo Ci.

676
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,640
So, in my haste,

677
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,820
Assistant Tang advised me

678
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,660
to provoke you by going on a blind date

679
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,190
so that you can realize your feelings for me as soon as possible.

680
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,300
So, when you are in a relationship,

681
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,480
you need a general to come up with a battle plan?

682
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,170
Although there was assistance,

683
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,880
that's how I express my love.

684
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,060
Sorry.

685
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,450
Your expression of love is too weird.

686
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,300
Stop following me.

687
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,120
I want to calm down.

688
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:57,360
I've deeply understood what it means to be lost in translation.

689
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,040
So,

690
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,420
I was tricked by Assistant Tang's unreliable methods again.

691
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,700
(Bonus Scenes)

692
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,260
Why did he add me on WeChat?

693
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,000
