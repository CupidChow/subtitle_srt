(The Delicate CEO Should Take Medicine)
(Episode 14)

3
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,670
Xilai.

4
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,880
Those are what I prepared for you:

5
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,660
watermelon juice, pitaya juice,

6
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,060
strawberry juice and hawthorn juice.

7
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,280
From now on,

8
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,080
you need to follow the medical instructions

9
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,330
and face your fear.

10
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,710
What a sin!

11
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,800
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

12
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,360
Let's drink this first.

13
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,800
This is watermelon juice.

14
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,220
I am really happy that you made this for me.

15
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,380
It's sweet.

16
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,710
Take a stronger flavor.

17
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,180
This is strawberry juice.

18
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,020
This is a little sour.

19
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,290
Hawthorn juice helps you with a good appetite.

20
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:50,820
Good boy.

21
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,880
Tian!

22
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,070
I'm so full.

23
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,579
You have to cooperate with me

24
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:58,700
so that your blood sickness can be cured soon.

25
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,430
Listen to me.

26
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,680
It's killing me. I can't drink anymore.

27
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,500
Take it off,

28
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,920
or it won't be washed off.

29
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,940
Wait a minute.

30
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,490
You are taking it off here? Right now?

31
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,760
Didn't you ask me to take it off?

32
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:29,380
She looks so cute when she's shy.

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,020
I didn't ask you to take it off in front of me.

34
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,940
Put it on.

35
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,390
Do you want me to take it off

36
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,500
or put it on?

37
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,210
Whatever.

38
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,060
I'm leaving.

39
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,400
Be careful.

40
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,269
Put on your clothes,

41
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,670
or you'll catch a cold.

42
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,190
Let's call it a day.

43
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,909
She's shocked by my perfect body shape, right?

44
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,220
Tian.

45
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,140
Why do you come back so late?

46
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,810
Did you work for your delicate boss,

47
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,940
or did you take care of him in hospital?

48
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,310
Be serious.

49
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,120
But recently,

50
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,290
he is indeed sick, delicate,

51
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,020
and even picky about food.

52
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,390
If he's sick, have him treated.

53
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,410
You're not a doctor.

54
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,710
What's the use of your staying there?

55
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,570
He suffers from a mental illness.

56
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,070
He can't be cured by doctors alone.

57
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,680
I can't explain it to you clearly right now.

58
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,270
Anyway,

59
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,730
I can help him.

60
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,310
Can't you accompany him

61
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,360
after training?

62
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,220
This is a now-or-never chance.

63
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,260
You want to give it up because of him?

64
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,140
But

65
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,180
how would he go through the next three months?

66
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,360
He hasn't suffered from any fatal danger

67
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
before he met you.

68
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,460
How could it become hard for him to live without you now?

69
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,340
But he has me now.

70
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,020
Besides, his condition has worsened.

71
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,480
It's reasonable for him to rely on me.

72
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,530
I don't know whether it's reasonable.

73
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,700
I only know

74
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,340
that you've fallen in love.

75
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,350
This girl

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,860
hasn't contacted me for two days.

77
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,370
She has never been out of reach this long.

78
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,190
Is she hiding somewhere to grieve over my condition?

79
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,580
Hey, straight to the point, or I'll hang up.

80
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,560
As a vent to your anger,

81
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,050
I knew you would be irritated

82
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,530
once you picked up the phone.

83
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,570
Stop it.

84
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,580
What is it?

85
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,280
Let's go swimming this weekend.

86
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,990
I'm not going.

87
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,220
You must be there.

88
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,440
Otherwise,

89
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,310
I'll tell Xilai

90
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,810
that you

91
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,430
failed to confess your love,

92
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,760
and gave up on yourself.

93
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,370
Liu Xizhao.

94
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,800
As long as I'm here,

95
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,830
I will find a way to mitigate your sadness.

96
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,040
You are...

97
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,320
Delete your impression on me yesterday.

98
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,840
Who would have thought that you just took off your clothes in front of me?

99
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,220
I am not referring to that.

100
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,180
It was what you saw when you opened the door yesterday morning.

101
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,780
What?

102
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,300
So you are thinking about my chest muscles.

103
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,390
You are welcome to do that.

104
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,880
Be serious.

105
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:37,860
Tian.

106
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,860
Under your treatment,

107
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,050
my condition has improved.

108
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,250
I can go to work today.

109
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,290
Are you sure?

110
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,260
If I don't go to work,

111
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,580
Assistant Tang will get depression.

112
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,780
And I almost suffer from malnutrition.

113
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,409
Mr. Liu, you're finally back.

114
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,820
Mr. Liu, I'll get back to work.

115
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:00,990
Wait.

116
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,460
Tian.

117
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,880
I'd like to hear you call me Xilai.

118
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,800
Got it, Mr. Liu.

119
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,650
I'll work hard.

120
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,700
It's hard to guess

121
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,190
a lady's mood.

122
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,050
When can my identity be revealed?

123
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,960
Is there any progress

124
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,100
between you and Assistant Tian

125
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,760
that I haven't caught up with?

126
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,150
Assistant Tang.

127
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,760
Have you finished

128
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,380
your work when I was absent?

129
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,060
Tian Tian, the director said

130
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,540
that before you leave,

131
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,400
you may hand your work over to me.

132
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,040
Okay.

133
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:08,040
(Qiansheng Group)

134
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,260
How can I leave at ease

135
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,390
without his illness being cured?

136
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,360
Assistant Tang,

137
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,400
there's something wrong with the data.

138
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,130
You need to check it with the Finance Department.

139
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,100
Okay, Mr. Liu.

140
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,660
You've been busy the whole morning.

141
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,380
There's nothing urgent for today.

142
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,580
You just recovered from your cold.

143
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,980
Why don't you take a rest?

144
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,850
Only by finishing it earlier

145
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,600
can I get off work early and go on a date with Tian.

146
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,170
Mr. Liu.

147
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,330
I'm here to report my work to you.

148
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,820
Actually,

149
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,670
I'm here to care for you.

150
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,400
Gosh.

151
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,850
Assistant Tang.

152
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,050
Is there anything wrong with my sunglasses today?

153
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,370
Otherwise, why would I feel dizzy when I see red?

154
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,290
Who knows?

155
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,050
Is it getting serious?

156
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,780
Do you want to take a rest?

157
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,190
Tian.

158
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,770
Maybe I need to

159
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,630
rely on you forever.

160
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,790
I want to hold your hands

161
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,120
and grow old with you.

162
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,910
It's just a treatment.

163
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,540
Don't be so cheesy.

164
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,520
You'll get better soon.

165
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,750
I failed again.

166
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,580
Tian.

167
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,620
It's so considerate of you.

168
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,820
You even bring me the horrible juice during working hours.

169
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,950
I made this for you during lunch break.

170
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,020
You need to drink it all today.

171
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,750
It seems that I am looking for trouble.

172
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,370
Tian.

173
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,220
The recent treatment plan

174
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,310
makes me feel stressed.

175
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,660
Good medicine tastes bitter.

176
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,100
Drink this up.

177
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,510
I'll take you to

178
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,270
an interesting and relaxing place this weekend.

179
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,300
Liu Xizhao.

180
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,660
You've grown up, huh?

181
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,060
How dare you threaten me?

182
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,790
Let go. It hurts.

183
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,140
Did you tell Xilai anything?

184
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,350
No, let go of me.

185
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,340
Are you sure?

186
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,140
Liu Xizhao.

187
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,370
I'm going to kill you.

188
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,520
My foundation is not waterproof.

189
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:55,870
Liu Xizhao.

190
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,100
When will you stop your funny play?

191
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,880
I just want to vent your sadness.

192
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,800
How can you tell that I'm sad?

193
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,300
Don't think you know me well.

194
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,820
In my eyes,

195
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,050
you are just a boy younger than me.

196
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,500
You are only one year older than me.

197
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,710
One year is enough.

198
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,950
Don't think too much.

199
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,860
You heard everything that day, right?

200
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,010
So you avoided me these days

201
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,230
because you knew how I felt.

202
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,320
Okay.

203
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:40,740
Good.

204
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,370
I see.

205
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,670
You may think that I crossed the line.

206
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,570
How could I leak it?

207
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,030
Tian.

208
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,580
Is this the interesting and relaxing place

209
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,700
you mentioned?

210
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,660
-Tian, I have acrophobia. -Let's go.

211
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,620
Xilai.

212
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,290
Close your eyes

213
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,390
if you are scared.

214
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,350
Don't look down.

215
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,180
Since I'm here,

216
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,950
I want to see

217
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,840
what you can see.

218
00:14:59,310 --> 00:14:59,960
You

219
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,020
have changed.

220
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,480
How?

221
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,020
You

222
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,960
are not as distant as before.

223
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,150
You are opening your mind to others.

224
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,850
Have you heard of it?

225
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,540
If you make a wish at the highest point of the ferris wheel,

226
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,940
your wish will come true.

227
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,350
Now is the time.

228
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,620
I think I have figured out

229
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,220
the significance of this amusement facility.

230
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,010
What's that?

231
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,420
You can stay with the one you like,

232
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,200
and enjoy the whole sky

233
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,830
little by little.

234
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,990
What wish did you make?

235
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,560
Without doubt, I hope

236
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,080
that you can recover soon,

237
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,980
and that you can do whatever you want

238
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,020
in the future.

239
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,380
Did I

240
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,320
go overboard?

241
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,680
Why don't you make a wish?

242
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,620
I don't believe in wish.

243
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,530
My motto is

244
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,420
to earn

245
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,680
what you want.

246
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,660
Do your best

247
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,630
to achieve your goal.

248
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,320
This is also my motto.

249
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,280
But now,

250
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
I'm afraid of losing.

251
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,720
I never thought there would be anything

252
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,860
beyond my control.

253
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,690
But now,

254
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,850
I can't predict

255
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,030
every consequence.

256
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,560
In my opinion,

257
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,400
the meaning of making a wish

258
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,500
is to make us convinced

259
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,660
the future we look forward to

260
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,680
will finally come true.

261
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,250
You can always give me confidence.

262
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,880
Okay, I'll try.

263
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,390
Maybe

264
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,640
my wish is selfish.

265
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,400
But I hope

266
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,150
♫Warm my night with blooming flowers♫

267
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,190
Tian can always be with me.
♫Warm my night with blooming flowers♫

268
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,970
♫Warm my night with blooming flowers♫

269
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,190
♫The moment I met you♫

270
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,820
♫Love is slowly spreading in our hearts♫

271
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,850
♫A romantic scene appears♫

272
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:47,140
♫The beginning of our story appeared before my eyes♫

273
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,060
♫Colorful love♫

274
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:54,410
♫The color engraved in my heart♫

275
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:01,780
♫Your gentle eyes are staring at our future♫

276
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,380
♫My life becomes colorful because of you♫

277
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:12,090
♫The starry night shines upon hope♫

278
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,560
♫Telling♫

279
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,200
♫My love♫

280
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,090
♫Your beautiful smile wipes out my haze♫

281
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,310
♫The moment of sweet memories♫

282
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,120
What wish did you make?

283
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,780
♫When the river of time stops for me♫
What wish did you make?

284
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,060
♫When the river of time stops for me♫

285
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,070
It's a secret.

286
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,490
I'll tell you

287
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,220
when it is a right timing.

288
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,560
So petty.

289
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,200
I've told you my wish.

290
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,620
By the way,

291
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,240
do you remember

292
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,420
how you recovered from the blood sickness last time?

293
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,030
Maybe

294
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,530
we can try again

295
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,750
with the same method.

296
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,060
Is he trying to trick me?

297
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,050
But why am I looking forward to it?

298
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,720
Kiss your forehead?

299
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,440
Really?

300
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,940
Stop joking.

301
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,790
Of course, it's true.

302
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,620
Last time, after you kissed my forehead,

303
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,350
I recovered.

304
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,710
Why don't we

305
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,520
try again?

306
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,430
I'll start now.

307
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,090
Still dizzy?

308
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,410
Yes.

309
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,590
Yes?

310
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,600
I knew it wouldn't work.

311
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,220
Tian.

312
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,970
Maybe it's because

313
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,470
my condition this time

314
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,390
is quite serious.

315
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,070
Kissing forehead

316
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,800
is not effective enough?

317
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,620
What do you mean?

318
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,700
♫I'll always believe that you only belong to me♫

319
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,120
You
♫I'll always believe that you only belong to me♫

320
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,700
♫I'll always believe that you only belong to me♫

325
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,210
♫Holding my hand♫

♫I remember every step we make it our story♫

328
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,030
♫So you're my love♫

329
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:13,800
♫You are the one shining all the stars♫

330
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,220
♫In my life♫

331
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:23,480
♫I will always believe that you only belong to me♫

332
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,810

333
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,010
♫I'm so in love with you♫

334
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,180
♫I always believe you'll be here♫

335
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,290
♫My Mr. Right♫

336
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,080
♫Holding my hand♫

337
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,570
♫We'll live in forever♫

338
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,360
If I had known

339
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,570
the treatment was so good,

340
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,900
I should have skipped

341
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,940
all the unnecessary parts earlier.

342
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,970
But...

343
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,290
Shouldn't it be the forehead?

344
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,180
You kissed my forehead just now,

345
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,030
but it didn't work.

346
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,040
So kissing here works?

347
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,260
Just now,

348
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,980
I was really into it.

349
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:25,900
I don't feel anything.

350
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,700
How about

351
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,420
one more time?

352
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
It's late.

353
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,290
I should go home.

354
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,740
Leave the treatment tomorrow.

355
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,700
What time is it?

356
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,610
Why don't you stay at your delicate CEO's home?

357
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,870
What are you talking about?

358
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,270
We haven't gone that far.

359
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,660
You are hiding something, aren't you?

360
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,060
How far have you two gone?

361
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,440
Have you gotten closer?

362
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,210
What?

363
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,990
I don't even know what you're talking about.

364
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,010
Rose.

365
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,260
Tonight

366
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,310
is the deadline of submitting the training materials.

367
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,830
So?

368
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:22,940
So,

369
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,750
if I texted the director

370
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,210
saying that I would give up this opportunity,

371
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,410
would you be shocked?

372
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,100
If it's because of Mr. Liu,

373
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,030
I would not be shocked at all.

374
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,810
Why?

375
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,890
Your love for your delicate boss

376
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,230
cannot be more obvious.

377
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,620
Although dating is not as good as having a career,

378
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,040
when I think about the fact that you will end being single

379
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,200
and fall in love,

380
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,350
I'm happy for you.

381
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,160
Rose, you are so nice.

382
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,040
As long as it's your choice,

383
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,370
be it career or romance,

384
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,410
I'll support you.

385
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,420
Tian, would you like to

386
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,370
come to my home for a meal tomorrow?

387
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,420
Okay.

388
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,990
It's so good to be Tian's de facto boyfriend.

389
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,250
I feel so uneasy

390
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,220
to fool Tian all the time.

391
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,460
I may as well

392
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,570
find a chance today

393
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,720
to tell Tian the truth.

394
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,430
Tian.

395
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,570
You look so beautiful today,

396
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,920
especially this necklace

397
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,120
which suits you well.

398
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,690
Really?

399
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,740
I've been waiting for you.

400
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,940
I'm looking forward to your treatment.

401
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,460
Let's cut some fruit first.

402
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,790
I'll make juice for you.

403
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,230
Tian.

404
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:44,990
Actually,

405
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,070
you don't have to be busy.

406
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,460
Just focus on my treatment.

407
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,850
You...

408
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,220
Do you like the feeling of giving orders as a patient?

409
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,750
What's wrong?

410
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,720
Had your fingers cut?

411
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,420
Luckily the wound is not deep.

412
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,020
I'll go get the medicine kit.

413
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,170
Wait a sec, Tian.

414
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,690
Tian, I have to answer the phone.

415
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,250
I'll cut the fruit later.

416
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,400
Why doesn't he feel dizzy when he sees red?

417
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,480
Has he recovered?

418
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,580
Great.

419
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,900
My treatment must have worked.

420
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,660
I know.

421
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,010
-Confirm it with him. -I planned to tell her the truth these days.

422
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:46,430
But I couldn't find a time to see color red or blood.

423
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:50,570
No.

424
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,570
I saw blood just now.

425
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,410
But I forgot to respond to it.

426
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,220
I think

427
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,070
I've been already exposed.

428
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,400
I...

429
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,570
Tell me the truth?

430
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:13,900
Exposed?

431
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,140
No dizziness?

432
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,350
You haven't relapse into your blood sickness at all.

433
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:22,960
Tian,

434
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,650
I was going to tell you the truth these days.

435
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,280
I just…

436
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,930
Tian, let me explain.

437
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:29,730
Explain what?

438
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,820
I'm worried that you might be in danger.

439
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,110
I'm worried that you won't feel safe under the sunglasses.

440
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,860
I'm afraid I can't make it in time

441
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,770
to help you.

442
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,570
I even gave up

443
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,800
the chance for training that I've dreamed for a long time.

444
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,490
But

445
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,060
I think

446
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,470
all I have done is a joke.

447
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,020
I'm the most foolish one in the world.

448
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:53,960
Tian.

449
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,550
Calm down and listen to me.

450
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,900
It's because...

451
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,030
No matter what it is,

452
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,980
you knew this training

453
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,450
was important to me.

454
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,530
But you still lied to me and tricked me.

455
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,350
I can't accept it.

456
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:13,540
Tian.

457
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,750
It's because of Luo Ci.

458
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,650
When I knew he was the lecturer,

459
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,880
and you were going to travel together,

460
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,260
I was very anxious

461
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,640
and even suffered from insomnia.

462
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,820
You admire him so much.

463
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,180
I was scared

464
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,880
that if you spent three months together,

465
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,650
I would lose you.

466
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,310
So you pretended to be sick?

467
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,570
You never asked me about my thoughts.

468
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,460
You wanted

469
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,900
to keep me by your side

470
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,560
in such a self-righteous way.

471
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,630
Do you have any idea

472
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,460
