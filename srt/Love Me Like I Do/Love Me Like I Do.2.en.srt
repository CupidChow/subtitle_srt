(Li Huai, Personal Physician)

5
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,390
Your other indicators are normal.

6
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,840
There is nothing wrong.

7
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,390
Actually,

8
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,570
hemophobia is

9
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,210
what we usually call "blood sickness."

10
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,120
It's a common disease.

11
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,000
It won't affect your life.

12
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,220
But

13
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,040
you are more sensitive

14
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,080
to the color red

15
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,030
because you have been strongly stimulated.

16
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,550
So much so that when you see red,

17
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,210
you will experience vertigo.

18
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,660
However, a strange thing happened to me.

19
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,660
Today, I found out

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,940
that as long as I have

21
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,230
some physical contact with a certain girl,

22
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,290
even if I see red,

23
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,860
my blood phobia

24
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,040
won't relapse.

25
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:24,940
Why do you think

26
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,470
this is happening?

27
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,020
Do you know that girl?

28
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,500
I just met her recently.

29
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,420
She's like

30
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,230
a more pure barrier than my sunglasses.

31
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,530
I think this girl

32
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,190
is the key to your phobia.

33
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,610
I think

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,070
this may be a good opportunity.

35
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,790
All these years,

36
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,430
in order to hide your blood phobia,

37
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,220
your strange behaviors have been misunderstood by everyone.

38
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,079
You don't care.

39
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,800
But as a friend,

40
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,110
I still hope

41
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,640
you can overcome your phobia soon

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,900
and live a normal life.

43
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,950
I think this girl

44
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,490
is the key to your phobia.

45
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,940
This may be a good opportunity.

46

Mr. Liu.

47
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,370
After investigation and comparison,

48
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,630
it's confirmed that Kevin plagiarized.

49
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,790
Fire Kevin immediately

50
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,020
and never work with him again.

51
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,810
Okay, Mr. Liu.

52
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,770
By the way, check Tian Tian's background.

53
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,700
Remember, I want it to be detailed.

54
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:44,910
Okay, Mr. Liu.

(Qiansheng Group)

58
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,079
Since you rejected their opinions
(Qiansheng Group)

59
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,530
and were determined to enter the market for designer toys,

60
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,750
why did Assistant Tang decline the designer toy dinner party

61
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,020
for you this time?

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,090
I'm not interested in this kind of dinner party.

63
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:01,580
But

64
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,860
our exhibits

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,480
will definitely be displayed in the most prominent spot.

66
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,090
I heard that the organizer

67
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,780
has invited Luo Ci, the guru of designer toys.

68
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,410
The bosses of other companies

69
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,190
all want to meet him at the dinner party.

70
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,170
If you don't go,

71
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,720
you'll give up the opportunity to someone else.

72
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,360
Luo Ci?

73
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,640
Assistant Tang.

74
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,980
After the dinner party,

75
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,250
find a way to make an appointment with him.

76
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:23,650
OK.

77
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,550
I heard that once the party is over,

78
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,680
he'll go out of town.

79
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,870
We can't find out his schedule.

80
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,830
If we can cooperate with Luo Ci,

81
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,800
I believe the shareholders

82
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,180
will be more confident

83
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,140
in your plan for the designer toy department.

84
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:49,630
Mr. Liu,

85
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,690
it's quite tricky right now.

86
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,659
This guru of designer toys, Luo Ci,

87
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,050
is eccentric and hard to communicate with.

88
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,780
And the theme of this dinner party is Chinese Red.

89
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,340
So the decoration must fit the red theme.

90
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,730
Although we are sponsors,

91
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,720
the security level

92
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,220
is still out of our control.

93
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,000
You can't agree to it

94
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,510
just because Mr. Wen is egging you on.

95
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,740
It's indeed a big problem.

96
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,820
How about I find an excuse to reject it for you?

97
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,190
No.

98
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,420
Wen Zhicai will definitely keep an eye on this matter.

99
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,230
Besides, he is right this time.

100
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,150
Luo Ci is very important

101
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,680
for our designer toy transformation.

102
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,140
But this is a dinner party.

103
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,810
It would be strange for you

104
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,870
to attend with sunglasses on.

105
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,810
By then,

106
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,780
there will be more criticism.

107
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,730
I think this girl

108
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,490
is the key to your phobia.

109
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,100
Assistant Tang,

110
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,330
how is Miss Tian's investigation going?

111
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,890
Miss Tian.

112
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,580
I've been observing her in secret these days.

113
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,860
I found that Miss Tian...

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,740
She...

115
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
My new bike was scrapped on the spot.

116
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,260
She didn't even give me

117
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,620
a chance to save my bike.

118
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,100
Later, I investigated her by foot

119
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,560
and hid myself in the dark.

120
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,380
In the end…

121
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,270
My waist!

122
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,450
It took me a week to get well.

123
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,040
Violent maniac.

124
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,940
I had to change my strategy

125
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,300
and show up when she couldn't make a move.

126
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,430
I never expected her

127
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,290
to be a girl with such abnormal strength.

128
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,230
My investigation conclusions are

129
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,600
that you should cherish your life

130
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,200
and stay away from Miss Tian.

131
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,010
Interesting.

132
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,480
She is

133
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,530
really a lively and vigorous girl.

134
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,320
Mr. Liu, do you have any misunderstandings about the word "lively?"

135
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,250
Assistant Tang.

136
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,250
Invite Ms. Tian over.

137
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,340
Mr. Liu, Miss Tian is...

138
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,110
She looks like cotton candy

139
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,090
but has a nuclear bomb within.

140
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,100
I want to discuss

141
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,950
the plagiarism issue with her.

142
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,260
Think twice, Mr. Liu.

143
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,810
With a change in environment, let's confirm it again.

144
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,600
She looks ordinary.

145
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,030
How could she be the key to my phobia?

146
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,830
I can't lose the momentum.

147
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:07,890
Mr. Liu.

148
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,140
Is the processing result out?

149
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,860
Miss Tian.

150
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,470
Have a drink.

151
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,190
Unbelievable!

152
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:31,820
Mr. Liu.

153
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,630
Are you crazy?

154
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,010
Are you kidding me?

155
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,700
Miss Tian.

156
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,580
After investigation,

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,500
we have reached a conclusion about the plagiarism.

158
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,360
We fired Kevin.

159
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,350
Qiansheng Group has zero tolerance

160
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,280
for plagiarism.

161
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,370
Rest assured.

162
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,130
We will give you the authorship you deserve.

163
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:47,660
Besides,

164
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,230
your copyright fee won't be lower than the market price.

165
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,550
Do you have anything to add?

166
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,280
Actually, I just want justice.

167
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,490
I'm already satisfied

168
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,980
with the way you handled it.

169
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,580
Miss Tian,

170
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,860
actually, you can be more ambitious.

171
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,600
I don't mind providing you with a better platform.

172
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,330
For example,

173
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,890
take you to a

174
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,780
designer toy dinner party.

175
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,140
Really?

176
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:10,930
Yes.

177
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,730
But on one condition.

178
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,470
You need to hold my hand the whole time.

179
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,690
How dare he

180
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,820
make such a filthy request so frankly.

181
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,130
That rascal!

182
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,800
We can talk about the money.

183
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,250
Good! Bye!

184
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,940
I can pay you more.

185
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,710
Isn't he a big weirdo?

186
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,530
A pervert?

187
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,810
Isn't this the plot

188
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,570
in which a domineering boss is falling in love with me?

189
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,410
I can even write a

190
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,140
200,000-word novel in my head.

191
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,380
A famous entrepreneur in human disguise

192
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,350
has severe psychological distortions.

193
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,040
He preys on

194
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,980
innocent girls.

195
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,020
Gosh, this is so exciting!

196
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,600
She is your starry-eyed best friend.

197
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,370
She has to endure it, even if she's crying inside.

198
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,780
Alright.

199
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,010
I'll stop.

200
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,300
Maybe this matter

201
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,620
is not as bad as you think.

202
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,020
Right?

203
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,980
I, the reporter, will think of something for you.

204
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,740
But you still need to

205
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,200
be careful of that director's retaliation.

206
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,700
How dare he take revenge on me?

207
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,600
If he hadn't plagiarized my work,

208
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,900
my interview wouldn't have been ruined.

209
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,520
I plan to

210
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,020
interview with other companies.

211
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,550
That's right.

212
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,460
Rice smells good anywhere.

213
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,950
It's you, my cutie.

214
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:08,800
I thought

215
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,860
it was that psycho stalking me again.

216
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,160
Why are you so cute?

217
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,720
Good boy.

218
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,470
Who is it?

219
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,490
Mr. Liu. Miss Tian lives in this neighborhood.

220
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,900
Let me go!

221
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,940
That seems to be Miss Tian.

222
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,480
Help!

223
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,610
Miss Tian! Our Mr. Liu is here!

224
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:19,880
Mr. Liu.

225
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,160
Although the stalker has escaped,

226
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,460
thank you for your help.

227
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,330
How do you want to thank me?

228
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,100
Miss Tian, I want…

229
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,540
I'm just being polite.

230
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,350
You shouldn't have any improper thoughts.

231
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:36,870
Miss Tian.

232
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,540
I sincerely invite you

233
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,160
to that dinner party with me.

234
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,440
Maybe I didn't

235
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,990
show you enough sincerity.

236
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,300
Now I'm officially inviting you.

237
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,020
Miss Tian.

238
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,360
Think about it.

239
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,630
Thank you, Mr. Liu, for helping me.

240
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,570
Goodbye.

241
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,110
Should I send you out

242
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,900
or should you leave by yourselves?

243
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,090
Miss Tian,

244
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,460
you really won't think about it again?

245
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,320
This is a rare opportunity for you

246
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,080
to become a toy designer.

247
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,150
My senior brother, Luo Ci!

248
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,400
You should have told me earlier.

249
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,860
I would have promised to come a long time ago.

250
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,460
Assistant Tang.

251
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,830
You don't even know how to investigate a person's background!

252
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,890
Do you want to expand to South Africa?

253
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:25,690
No!

254
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,860
I'm sorry, Mr. Liu.

255
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,420
♫Every time I see you, I'll love you more♫

256
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,580
♫When my heart starts galloping♫

257
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,500
♫Without me realizing it♫

258
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,940
♫You steal the spring from my heart♫

259
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,160
Is this okay?

260
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,570
Not bad.

261
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,180
The dress code for tonight's party

262
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,200
is that guests must wear something red.

263
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,730
Here are your accessories.

264
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,060
Miss Tian.

265
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,300
A little help?

266
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,760
Do I have to provide this kind of service?

267
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,290
You can think of it that way.

268
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,210
Can you lower your head?

269
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,440
You can stand on your tiptoes.

270
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,670
Alright.

271
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,980
Behave yourself.

272
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:35,730
Miss Tian,

273
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,950
don't worry.

274
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,610
This is just normal social etiquette.

275
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,860
Are you ready?

276
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,590
OK.

277
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,590
Let's go.

278
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,660
Weird.

279
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,700
Does he have to be that nervous?

280
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:13,450
Miss Tian.

281
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,690
I hope you can

282
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,310
stay by my side all night,

283
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,210
hold my hand,

284
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,530
and never leave me.

285
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:21,980
Mr. Liu.

286
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,160
We're just holding hands.

287
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,319
Please don't

288
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,170
use such cheesy, sweet words.

289
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:28,210
Remember.

290
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,020
This is your duty tonight.

291
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,220
(Luo Ci)

292
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,660
Look!
(Luo Ci)

293
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
My senior is here.

294
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,370
His writing is just like himself.

295
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,770
I want to sign beside his signature

296
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,860
to share in his talent.

297
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,370
Such common handwriting.

298
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,580
Do you have to make such an awkward compliment?

299
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,840
Your fan filter for him

300
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,680
is too much.

301
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,370
You're just jealous.

302
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,310
Come, come to my left side.

303
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,600
Let me show you what talent is.

304
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,180
Why don't you write with your left hand if you dare?

305
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,950
Why not?

306
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:10,920
Great.

307
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,780
I can see my senior soon.

308
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,320
I'm so excited just thinking about it.

309
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,400
Are you done?

310
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,680
Hurry up!

311
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,020
Hurry!

312
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:31,270
(Liu Xilai, Luo Ci)

313
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,630
-Unbelievable! -Unbelievable!

314
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,890
You're the boss after all.

315
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,090
Why do you look so ignorant?

316
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,040
You can't imagine my joy

317
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,720
at having a plug-in.

318
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,240
Brother Xilai.

319
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,310
Xian.

320
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,830
Why are you back?

321
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,470
(Wen Xian, Famous Painter)

322
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,970
I remembered

323
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,780
that you said you were holding an art exhibition abroad.

324
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,790
Brother Xilai.

325
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,450
My exhibition is over.

326
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,950
This is...

327
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,600
My date.

328
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,680
Hello, I'm Tian Tian.

329
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,810
Hello, I'm Wen Xian.

330
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,400
I grew up with my Brother Xilai.

331
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,490
Our two families are family friends.

332
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,110
So you two were childhood sweethearts.

333
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,490
Brother Xilai.

334
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,160
Such an important dinner!

335
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,500
How can you just find a female companion like her?

336
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,250
How about

337
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,940
I go there with you

338
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,340
and introduce you

339
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,290
to some friends?

340
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,470
Miss Tian.

341
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,420
Although you came with my Brother Xilai,

342
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,350
you don't have to hog him all night.

343
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:08,920
Miss Wen.

344
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,620
Please open your big eyes

345
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,750
and look carefully!

346
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,560
He's the one who won't let go of me.

347
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:17,980
Xianxian.

348
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,560
I'm the one who invited Miss Tian.

349
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,950
She is unique to me.

350
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:22,980
I'm busy.

351
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,820
Let's meet another day.

352
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,040
Brother Xilai.

353
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,460
Miss Tian.

354
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,640
I admire you more and more.

355
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,940
You managed to escape Wen Xian's attack

356
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,000
without a scratch.

357
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,770
So you can tell she was attacking me.

358
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,950
Does Miss Wen like you?

359
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,490
That's why she's hostile to me.

360
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,620
We've known each other for generations.

361
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,810
I've known her since childhood.

362
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,130
But then, one after another, we went abroad to study.

363
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,190
So we lost contact.

364
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,390
Even if she comes back now,

365
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,210
I'm so busy.

366
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,500
I don't have time to like someone else.

367
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,900
Do you have to take the time to like someone?

368
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,680
But you are so…

369
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,260
Honest.

370
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,560
She can't possibly have feelings for you.

371
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,330
Miss Tian.

372
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,600
Are you questioning my charm?

373
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,390
Charm?

374
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,430
Look.

375
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,990
There's a handsome guy over there.

376
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,310
He's my type.

377
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,690
Go ask for his contact information.

378
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,410
I just meet the aesthetics of the times.

379
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,940
So handsome!

380
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,480
Now the taste of little girls

381
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,440
is getting worse and worse.

382
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,040
One may never turn back.

383
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,770
But he can't dodge that slap in his face.

384
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,330
Prince Charming, Luo Ci.

385
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,770
I'm so excited to see you.

386
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,500
Prince Charming, please take a photo with me. Please sign for me.

387
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,950
(Luo Ci, the Guru of Designer Toys)

388
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,710
-Luo Ci. -My senior brother.

389
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,450
Mr. Luo.

390
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,280
I'm Liu Xilai, CEO of the Qiansheng Group.

391
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,990
We'd like to talk to you about collaborating with you.

392
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,130
Sorry.

393
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,880
I'm not interested.

394
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,260
So I won't accept your business card.

395
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,790
I think you'll be interested

396
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,860
after I finish.

397
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,340
My company wishes to

398
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,290
sign all of your works

399
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,950
within the next three years.

400
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,420
We want to develop an IP matrix for designer toys

401
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,350
and create your unique toy series.

402
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,670
I'm here to have fun,

403
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,180
(Shoot five arrows onto the ten-ring and stand a chance to open the biggest blind box)
(Global limited edition trending toys)

404
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,050
not to work.
(Shoot five arrows onto the ten-ring and stand a chance to open the biggest blind box)
(Global limited edition trending toys)

405
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:39,860
(Shoot five arrows onto the ten-ring and stand a chance to open the biggest blind box)
(Global limited edition trending toys)

406
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,190
During my leisure time,
(Shoot five arrows onto the ten-ring and stand a chance to open the biggest blind box)
(Global limited edition trending toys)

407
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,660
I won't talk about work.

408
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,200
Senior.

409
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,900
I'm Tian Tian, two years younger than you in school.

410
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,880
You've always been our model,

411
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,210
since we were in school.

412
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,930
Nice to meet you here.

413
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,010
But...

414
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,060
Senior.

415
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,820
Is it too difficult

416
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,780
to play this way?

417
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,400
All five arrows must hit the ten-ring,

418
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,870
then you can open the biggest blind box.

419
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,080
Do you want to play?

420
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,550
There's no red in front of me.

421
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,770
I can have a try.

422
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,680
Mr. Luo,

423
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,210
why don't we play it together?

424
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,100
Amazing!

425
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,040
All ten-ring.

426
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,960
This is his last arrow.

427
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,260
I'm so nervous.

428
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,630
Nine-ring.

429
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,550
What a pity.

430
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,640
Don't you want to cooperate with him?

431
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,960
Can't you just pull your punches?

432
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,690
I only used half of my strength.

433
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,540
I'm already very generous.

434
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,140
Where's your business card?

435
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,260
Opportunities are for those who are capable.

436
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,500
Liu Xilai.

437
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,730
I'll remember you.

438
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,820
Sir, your prize.

439
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,050
Mr. Luo, this is for you.

440
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:32,670
This...

441
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,810
For me?

442
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:34,390
Yes.

443
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,340
I'm here only for you today.

444
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,460
So straightforward.

445
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,390
It's not really what we think it is, is it?

446
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,010
I saw that heart on the board.

447
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,000
I knew it!

448
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,500
Mr. Liu.

449
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,400
Although I have a twisted mind,

450
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,840
I'm very straight.

451
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,210
Thank you for your kindness.

452
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,350
Ladies and gentlemen,

453
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,060
good evening!

454
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,190
What a weirdo among the bosses!

455
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,250
See? You scared my senior away.

456
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,100
My excellence

457
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,270
does make my peers feel ashamed

458
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,810
and flinch.

459
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,300
Welcome to the Chinese-Red-themed

460
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,030
World Designer Toy Gala tonight.

461
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,670
Senior!

462
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,640
With the joint efforts

463
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,910
of all our designers…

464
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,080
Sorry.

465
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,620
Designer toys have already taken over the Chinese market.

466
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,200
Mr. Liu.

467
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,330
I heard you're here for a blind date.

468
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,020
Do you like me?

469
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,890
Mr. Liu, do you want to be in a relationship?

470
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,190
The we-can-actually-go-somewhere kind.

471
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,070
Mr. Liu.

472
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,960
I'm very good at playing cards.

473
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,780
I can play Chinese poker and Golden Flower.

474
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,810
We can also go watch a movie.

475
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,540
What type of movies do you like?

476
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,220
Mr. Liu?

477
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,460
Mr. Liu?

478
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,340
Mr. Liu?

479
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,600
Mr. Liu?

480
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,540
Next,

481
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,240
we're about to come to the climax of our dinner.

482
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,830
Let's enjoy

483
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,200
the carnival of our designer toy circle.

484
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,860
Mr. Liu!

485
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,890
Get out of the way!

486
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:29,700
Mr. Liu!

487
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,500
Mr. Liu!

488
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:32,920
Mr. Liu!

489
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,490
Mr. Liu!

490
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,600
Mr. Liu!

491
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:50,990
Mr. Liu!

492
00:26:59,300 --> 00:26:59,840
Mr. Liu!

493
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,430
Did you get a script for a delicate patient?

494
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,760
Why did you faint again?

495
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:15,840
(Bonus Scenes)

496
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,500
Very tasty!

498
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,900
It's really delicious.

(Bonus Scenes)

500
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:29,020
It's sweet but not too rich, with a fruity fragrance.

That strawberry one.

look more and more like like-minded meal pals.
