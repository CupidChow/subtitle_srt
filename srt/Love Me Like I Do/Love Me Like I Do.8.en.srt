00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,860
(Love Me Like I Do)

2
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,789
(Things Can Always Get Worse)
(Episode 8)

3
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,470
Here, take the medicine.

4
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,380
He went to that village for business.

5
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,750
What did that have to do with you?

6
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,210
You got nothing but a cold.

7
00:01:58,970 --> 00:01:59,570
Uncle Wen.

8
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,320
Sorry.

9
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,830
I didn't take good care of Xian.

10
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,010
It's not your fault.

11
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,060
She's always been a troublemaker.

12
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,330
I need to rest.

13
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,580
If you two are gonna keep judging me,

14
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,210
I suggest you talk outside.

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,430
Uncle Wen, I'll visit Xian tomorrow.

16
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,420
OK.

17
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,380
Uncle Wen, I'm leaving.

18
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,600
Find out

19
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,540
why the Liu brothers went to Shanshui Village.

20
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,270
Now that your disease is cured,

21
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,440
you can see whatever you want.

22
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,680
There are so many beautiful things in this world for you to see.

23
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,240
Assistant Tian. Assistant Tian.

24
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,579
Someone's here.

25
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,690
Mr. Xia Feng.

26
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,320
Maybe I should call you Mr. Luo Ci.

27
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,910
Senior, it's you.

28
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,450
Mr. Liu,

29
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,959
how did you find it out?

30
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,180
If I tell you,

31
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,649
will you sign the authorization contract?

32
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:21,779
I'll think about it.

33
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,060
First,

34
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,270
you ran into us too often.

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,060
I don't believe it's totally by chance.

36
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,660
Secondly,

37
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,820
more than once,

38
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,630
I noticed Ziyunmo paint on your hand.

39
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,130
I'm passing by.

40
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,850
I'm just taking pictures.

41
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,540
Just passing by.

42
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,740
Assistant Tian.

43
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,890
Give the authorization contract

44
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,810
to Mr. Luo Ci.

45
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,010
I said I'll think about it.

46
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,980
I've finished thinking.

47
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,350
I don't want to sign it.

48
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,100
You...

49
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,160
(VS)

50
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,820
Take care.

51
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,290
The rain is going to stop.

52
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,270
I'm busy.

53
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,490
I'll let you see yourselves out.

54
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,390
Senior.

55
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,070
What are you busy with?

56
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,110
Let me help you.

57
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,080
Let's go.

58
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,350
Mr. Luo.

59
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,550
Assistant Tian!

60
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:26,790
Senior.

61
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,210
Is this the sea of flowers you drew?

62
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,040
Yes.

63
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,810
In this season,

64
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,280
vervain is the most beautiful.

65
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,220
Vervain and that cat

66
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,390
have special meanings to you?

67
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,670
I just want to talk with you.

68
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,060
Don't be so aggressive.

69
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,159
I won't sign the contract.

70
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,120
Leave me alone.

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,370
You're a big boss who has his nose in the air.

72
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,430
I'm afraid you may step on my flowers.

73
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,730
Senior, have a rest. I'll hoe the weeds.

74
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,830
Assistant Tian.

75
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,420
We're here to work,

76
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,710
not to do gardening chores for your dreamboat.

77
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,180
Tian,

78
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,390
besides weeding,

79
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,440
the flowers also need water.

80
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:14,940
Okay.

81
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,890
No problem.

82
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,250
Leave it to me.

83
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,010
(VS)

84
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,900
Are you sure?

85
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,030
Of course.

86
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,130
It's a chance to experience ordinary people's life.

87
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,130
Have you ever done chores before?

88
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,970
You'd better take some protection measures.

89
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,159
No need.

90
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,770
This job looks very easy.

91
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,100
Let's get started.

92
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:03,900
Mr. Liu,

93
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,630
don't raise the hoe so high.

94
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,470
Watch me.

95
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,210
Yes. Come on.

96
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,720
Liu Xilai is quite interesting.

97
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,550
He's different from the other big bosses I met.

98
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,600
Hello, this is Kevin.

99
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,940
Mr. Kevin, I'm sorry.

100
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,280
Because of your record of plagiarism, we can't hire you.

101
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,780
Damn you, Liu Xilai.

102
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,260
You left me no way out!

103
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,860
(Wen Zhicai)

104
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,060
Hello?

105
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:55,970
Kevin.

106
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,340
Are you interested in making a deal with me?

107
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,870
No matter what kind of past the senior has,

108
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,130
I hope he can open his heart.

109
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,710
Maybe to let go

110
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,570
is not to forget,

111
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,250
but to remember.

112
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,020
Mr. Liu,

113
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,020
I agree with you.

114
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:16,970
Senior.

115
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,940
I was raised by my grandma.

116
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:20,730
Dafu

117
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,720
was a childhood friend my grandma gave me.

118
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,920
So that cute cat was called Dafu.

119
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,590
Later,

120
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,280
Grandma passed away.

121
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,780
In the loneliest time of my life, Dafu was with me.

122
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,570
To me,

123
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,250
Dafu was my family.

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,330
I don't want my memory to become a product.

125
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,970
Luo Ci may be a worldly man,

126
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,120
but Xia Feng

127
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,140
is just an unaffected painter.

128
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,010
Mr. Luo,

129
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,600
I respect your decision.

130
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,570
Maybe in your heart,

131
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,020
art and business

132
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,630
contradict each other.

133
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,900
But I've never taken trending toys merely as products.

134
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,550
Maybe

135
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,130
everyone who wants to buy this toy

136
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,590
has a Dafu in their hearts that they miss very much.

137
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,930
Perhaps you're right.

138
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,930
People buy this cute cat

139
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,340
because they're still missing someone and want to remember them.

140
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:18,980
Or maybe

141
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,380
they lost their loved ones in reality

142
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,160
and this toy brings them hope again.

143
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,200
Don't you want

144
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,040
to let this trending toy

145
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,910
dispel loneliness and boredom for more people?

146
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,210
I can

147
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,860
donate a part of the income from selling this toy cat

148
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,520
to the homes of stray animals,

149
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,980
so that animals can accompany more lonely people.

150
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:40,590
Okay.

151
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,850
You persuaded me.

152
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,730
I hope you can keep your promise.

153
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,420
Of course.

154
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,960
This is the social responsibility

155
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,890
that an entrepreneur should bear.

156
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,510
Yes!

157
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,780
By the way,

158
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,020
your painting in the flower field

159
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,680
is amazing.

160
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,820
Let's work together sometime.

161
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,640
Really?

162
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,500
That's great.

163
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,780
Is he poaching my assistant in front of me?

164
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,900
Assistant Tian,

165
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,010
now that the work is done,

166
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,010
we should go back.

167
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,220
This is the second gift you gave me.

168
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,120
I'll take it.

169
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,650
I rejected the first one.

170
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,010
Do you remember?

171
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,320
At the Chinese-red-themed gala.

172
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,730
You...

173
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,020
(VS)

174
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:32,510
Tian,

175
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,980
it's not easy to call a taxi here.

176
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,000
I'll arrange a car

177
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,940
to send you out of the village.

178
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,700
Thank you.

179
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,080
So you want me to expose

180
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,110
that I plagiarized Xia Feng's works in the Cute Pets series?

181
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,910
That's right.

182
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,440
But Liu Xilai is so capable.

183
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,200
If he gets the authorization,

184
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,730
I'll be making a spectacle of myself.

185
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,830
Even if he gets the authorization and comes back,

186
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,900
I still want the press conference tomorrow

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,990
to cause a stir.

188
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,670
For me,

189
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,210
that is cutting my nose to spite my face.

190
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,900
I can give you

191
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,870
a decent and high-paying job.

192
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,810
(Ye Xin, Operating Director)
(Qiansheng Cultural Development Co., Ltd.)

193
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,010
Assistant Tian.

194
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,740
Now we know that the tractor

195
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,570
travels 30 kilometers per hour.

196
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,810
How long will it take for us

197
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,390
to get to the station?

198
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,250
Mr. Liu,

199
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,790
it will take

200
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,290
about an hour to get back to the town.

201
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,320
In other words,

202
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,170
I need to keep this gesture for an hour?

203
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,950
You can say that.

204
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,310
So fastidious.

205
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,600
Mr. Liu,

206
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,550
you can sit on my coat.

207
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,230
No need.

208
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,240
My legs are strong.

209
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,810
I'm fine squatting.

210
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,190
Let's see how long you can hold on.

211
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,380
Mr. Liu…

212
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,020
How are your legs?

213
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:20,760
Fine.

214
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,660
They've just gone numb from squatting.

215
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,690
What?

216
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,290
It's exposed?

217
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,220
Tell everyone

218
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,110
not to respond.

219
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,330
I'll call my brother again.

220
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:58,970
Hello?

221
00:12:59,310 --> 00:12:59,710
Hello?

222
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,740
Hello?

223
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,750
Brother, I finally got through to you.

224
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,330
Zhao,

225
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,450
the service is spotty here. I can't hear you.

226
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,050
Louder.

227
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,670
OK.

228
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,400
I'll cut to the chase.

229
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,530
Someone told the press

230
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,140
that we used Xia Feng's work

231
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,500
to make the cat toy without authorization.

232
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,430
Public opinion is not in our favor.

233
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,560
Exposure?

234
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,740
Calm down.

235
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,760
I've got the authorization.

236
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,100
I'm on my way back now.

237
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,860
I'll clarify it at the press conference tomorrow.

238
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,760
Be quick.

239
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,360
The press conference will be at 10 tomorrow morning.

240
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,760
If everything goes well,

241
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,150
we can come back tonight.

242
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,590
Okay, Brother. Hurry up.

243
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,140
Hello?

244
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,470
The signal is bad. I can't hear you.

245
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,200
Don't worry.

246
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,500
Everything is under control.

247
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,210
Mr. Liu,

248
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,780
how can you be so calm

249
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,330
in the face of such a big problem?

250
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,100
Staying composed during a crisis

251
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,360
is a basic requirement

252
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,790
for every CEO.

253
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,470
Don't worry.

254
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,700
Don't panic.

255
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,870
After I go back,

256
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,460
all those questioning me will be floored.

257
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,830
The car is broken. We have to stop here.

258
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,370
Mr. Liu,

259
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,610
the engine is the first one questioning us.

260
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,280
My signal is spotty too.

261
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,490
The signal tower broke down a few days ago.

262
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,740
I need tools to fix the car.

263
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,770
I have to walk to the next village

264
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,530
to see if anyone can help me.

265
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,070
How long will it take?

266
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,630
It's hard to say.

267
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,300
Maybe one or two hours.

268
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,760
Maybe three or four hours.

269
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:32,810
Mr. Liu,

270
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,440
the car won't be fixed soon.

271
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,520
What should we do now?

272
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,970
Ask him

273
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,230
if there are other ways

274
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,960
to go to town.

275
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,150
Sir,

276
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
is there any other way to get to town?

277
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,520
There's a bus stop over there.

278
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,650
Walk down this road.

279
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,970
It'll take about 20 minutes.

280
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,650
20 minutes.

281
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,550
Assistant Tian.

282
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,070
Assistant Tian.

283
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,510
You said it'd take only 20 minutes,

284
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,710
but we've been walking for like half a century.

285
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,030
I didn't see

286
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,940
any bus stop.

287
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,390
I guess the driver meant

288
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,850
20 minutes by the tractor.

289
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,540
Mr. Liu,

290
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,980
you look pale.

291
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,510
Let's take a break.

292
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,580
I'm not tired.

293
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,940
I'm not out of breath either.

294
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,360
I was the champion of long-distance running

295
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,500
on the sports day.

296
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,460
What sports day?

297
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,070
The sports day of Qiansheng Group.

298
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,590
I won over

299
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,430
hundreds of employees.

300
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,550
I'm not surprised.

301
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,160
You'd be the champion in other projects too.

302
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,520
Assistant Tian,

303
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,270
you have so much confidence in me?

304
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,730
I have confidence

305
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,890
in the tactfulness of your employees.

306
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,470
Mr. Liu,

307
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,920
a storm is coming.

308
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,450
Let's keep moving forward.

309
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,290
Mr. Liu?

310
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,520
I am moving forward.

311
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,340
He's so weak. How dare he say he has abs?

312
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,100
Assistant Tian,

313
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,650
I can take it myself.

314
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,590
Thank you.

315
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,570
He's coming.

316
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,670
Mr. Liu,

317
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,830
it's said Qiansheng Group

318
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,140
used Xia Feng's work without permission.

319
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,860
Is it true?

320
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,990
Is it true?

321
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,260
Will the press conference tomorrow...

322
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,190
Please be quiet.

323
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,250
At 10 tomorrow morning,

324
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,200
the launch of the Cute Pets series

325
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,460
will start as planned.

326
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,050
Our CEO will answer your questions himself.

327
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:07,650
Thank you.

328
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,280
Assistant Director Liu!

329
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,450
(Bus Stop)

330
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,460
Work on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

331
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,550
What day is it today?

332
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,840
Sunday.

333
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,110
They can't be serious!

334
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,640
Who gave them the right

335
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,350
to work only three days a week?

336
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,940
When it rains, it pours.

337
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,280
Assistant Tian.

338
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,510
Don't be afraid.

339
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,320
I'm here to protect you.

340
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,860
Are you touched?

341
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,580
Mr. Liu, I'm touched.

342
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,170
But it's going to rain soon.

343
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,260
Can we not take shelter at an open-air bus station?

344
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,070
Mr. Liu,

345
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,350
why don't you go in and change your wet clothes?

346
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,590
I'll dry them near the fire for you.

347
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,920
Pink.

348
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,290
Clothes I buy for traveling in the wilderness

349
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,110
are one size bigger in case the limbs become swollen.

350
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,110
I think it'll fit.

351
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,910
So considerate, Assistant Tian.

352
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,910
How can I bring myself to refuse you?

353
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,130
But I've never

354
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,210
tried such a masculine color before.

355
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,180
You haven't recovered fully.

356
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,640
Why don't you stay at home?

357
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,230
My dad keeps nagging me at home.

358
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,880
It's quiet in the studio.

359
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:12,970
By the way,

360
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,230
the press accused Qiansheng Group of IPR infringements.

361
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,560
What are you going to do?

362
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,010
My brother has got the authorization.

363
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,410
He can come back tonight.

364
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,790
So, I've told the media

365
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,070
that tomorrow, at the press conference,

366
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,470
my brother will explain it to them himself.

367
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,340
Sorry that I'm not able to help you.

368
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,420
Forget it.

369
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,490
Xilai is so capable.

370
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,920
He can solve everything.

371
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,230
What are you doing?

372
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,290
Check your wound. Why are you so nervous?

373
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,680
I'm not nervous.

374
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,380
Don't touch me so casually

375
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,640
like when we were kids.

376
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,720
I'm a man now.

377
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,070
Ridiculous.

378
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,960
I'm not treating you like a woman.

379
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,340
Mr. Liu is out of touch.

380
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,070
Out of touch?

381
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,220
I just heard

382
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,900
that there was a heavy rain in Shanshui Village

383
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,520
and public transportation was affected.

384
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,180
We don't know where Mr. Liu is,

385
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,190
so we can't send a car to pick him up.

386
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,020
I see.

387
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,980
Keep trying to contact my brother.

388
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,730
Anyway,

389
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,250
send a car to Shanshui Village now.

390
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,710
Mr. Liu.

391
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:49,860
Mr. Liu.

392
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,810
Assistant Tian.

393
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,680
Assistant Tian, there's a monster inside.

394
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,640
Listen.

395
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,140
Mr. Liu, we have each other.

396
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,470
Don't be afraid.

397
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,890
Let's take a look.

398
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,030
Assistant Tian.

399
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,170
Mr. Liu, false alarm.

400
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,220
Assistant Tian.

401
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,420
What is it? What is it?

402
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,840
Mr. Liu.

403
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,650
the mouth of this empty bucket

404
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,380
is facing the ventilation.

405
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,270
And the wind outside

406
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,420
blew in and made a howling sound.

407
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,970
The sound echoed in all these buckets

408
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,570
and through this empty house,

409
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,970
becoming a little bit scary.

410
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,300
Assistant Tian,

411
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,950
usually, I don't get scared so easily.

412
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,120
I just didn't expect

413
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,910
such a coincidence to happen.

414
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,390
It's indeed a coincidence.

415
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,990
Why do I feel that we've switched roles?

416
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,230
I'm really not scared.

417
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:11,540
Mr. Liu.

418
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,500
Have some ginger tea. It can warm you up.

419
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,170
Thank you.

420
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,610
Assistant Tian.

421
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,940
You are like Doraemon.

422
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,900
I just made full preparations

423
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,480
before we set off.

424
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,180
The signal here is so weak.

425
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,410
We can't send a message for help.

426
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,810
If we can't make it

427
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,750
to the press conference tomorrow,

428
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,610
Assistant Tang

429
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,860
may beat me into a pulp.

430
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,810
How on earth do people here live?

431
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,390
Do they not use electricity?

432
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,150
Do they not use the Internet?

433
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,730
Given the circumstances,

434
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,340
we can't leave here by ourselves.

435
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,300
We have to find a way

436
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,050
to tell someone to pick us up.

437
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,940
I'll figure something out.

438
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,250
I'm trapped in Peng Town.

439
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,310
Come immediately.

440
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,160
I allow you to drive

441
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,740
my high-end pickup to save me.

442
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,240
Damn it, he's showing off again.

443
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,890
Is he…

444
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,840
playing an antenna?

445
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,600
Take care of the old lady as I told you.

446
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,660
She should be fine.

447
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,530
Okay, thank you, Dr. Li. Goodbye.

448
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,110
Bye.

449
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,050
I'm trapped in Peng Town.

450
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,110
Come immediately.

451
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,850
I allow you to drive my

452
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,340
high-end pickup to save me.

453
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,380
I'm afraid

454
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,210
I can't have the honor of driving your high-end pickup.

455
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,450
I happen to be visiting a patient nearby.

456
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,850
I'll go pick you up later.

457
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,230
Mr. Liu,

458
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,780
you've been holding it like that for a while.

459
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,910
Isn't your arm sore?

460
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,360
A little bit.

461
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,400
But compared with the importance of signal,

462
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,460
it doesn't matter.

463
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,480
You got a point, Mr. Liu.

464
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,870
Then keep holding it.

465
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,680
Assistant Tian.

466
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,430
Assistant Tian.

467
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,640
I have a signal.

468
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,720
I have a signal!

469
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,320
I have a signal!

470
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,800
♫It took a long time to see you again♫

471
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,090
♫Memories have come out of my head♫

472
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,810
This posture again.

473
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,580
♫A wonderful face emerges in my mind♫

474
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,340
So familiar.
♫A wonderful face emerges in my mind♫

475
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,290
♫A wonderful face emerges in my mind♫

476
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,400
Thank you, Assistant Tian.

477
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,210
I was too happy just now

478
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,660
and slipped…

479
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,480
It's okay.

480
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,580
Are we under some spell or what?

481
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,920
Why did it end up with him kissing my forehead every time?

482
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,130
Why is Assistant Tian's forehead

483
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,350
sweet?

484
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,460
Rose, thank you for going to Peng Town for me.

485
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,390
It's no big problem.

486
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,810
Wish you get better soon.

487
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,500
Bye.

488
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,630
Watch where you're going!

489
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,580
I won't let you get away with scraping my car.

490
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,400
It's dangerous to drive so fast when the road is wet.

491
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,200
Do you hear me?

492
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,590
It's him?

493
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,220
Sorry.

494
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,870
The road is slippery. I lost control of my car.

495
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,020
Look at what you did.

496
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,550
Saying sorry is not enough.

497
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,430
Don't you know there is a limit speed on this road?

498
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,360
I drove too fast.

499
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,930
I'm really sorry.

500
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,510
But I'm in a hurry to pick up a friend.

501
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,220
I have to go now.

502
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,180
How about this?

503
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,480
This is my number.

504
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,140
Call the insurance company.

505
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,770
Tell me how much I need to pay you.

506
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,520
Sorry.

507
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,340
Call me.

508
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,130
You...

509
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,240
What's going on? You're leaving just like this?

510
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,390
(Tixin Private Clinic)

511
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:09,990
What a small world.
(Tixin Private Clinic)

512
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,280
What a small world.

513
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,420
It turns out that Li Huai is the most reliable one

514
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,820
at this perilous moment.

515
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,120
All we need to do now is wait.

516
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:21,660
Great.

517
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,710
If Dr. Li can't make it here

518
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,190
before dawn,

519
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,440
we'll walk to the town to take the bus.

520
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,620
Assistant Tian,

521
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,770
I admire your tenacious personality very much.

522
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,120
Mr. Liu,

523
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,180
have you finished your chocolate?

524
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,720
I have another good thing.

525
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,870
It can help you feel energetic.

526
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,640
What is it?

527
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,060
Careful.

528
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,250
Self-heating hot pot, your must-have product at home and on the road.

529
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,760
Assistant Tian, you're not only good at drawing

530
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,540
but also talented in design.

531
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,860
Not only considerate

532
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,580
but also reliable.

533
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,390
-Not only… -Mr. Liu.

534
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,180
Are you making sentences with not only…but also?

535
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,480
I'm just speaking my mind.

536
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,270
Can we

537
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:24,950
start eating now?

538
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,310
It smells so good.

539
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,380
I never knew this cocky big boss

540
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,020
had such a cute side.

541
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,860
It's so delicious.

542
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:52,950
It's raining heavily in Shanshui Village.

543
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,540
(Bonus Scenes)
It's raining heavily in Shanshui Village.

544
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,080
(Bonus Scenes)

545
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,140
My brother is perhaps trapped there.
(Bonus Scenes)

546
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,220
(Bonus Scenes)

547
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,860
I wonder
(Bonus Scenes)

548
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,110
(Bonus Scenes)

549
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,370
if he can make it to the press conference.
(Bonus Scenes)

550
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,540
(Bonus Scenes)

551
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,670
We went there so confidently that day.
(Bonus Scenes)

552
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,220
(Bonus Scenes)

553
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,010
In the end,
(Bonus Scenes)

554
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,840
we just wasted half a day in Shanshui Village

555
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,790
and came back without achieving anything.

556
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,150
It's our failure,

557
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,010
so we should make up for it

558
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,540
I think

559
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,500
it's time to show everyone what I'm capable of.

560
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,620
In accordance with the theme of this press conference,

561
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,390
Mr. Liu will be dressed in this cat costume during the whole meeting

562
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,790
and answer questions through this AI toy

563
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,220
made by Qiansheng Group.

564
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,100
No.

565
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,180
My brother has been weird enough in his daily life.

566
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,240
If we do that to him,

567
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:40,870
I'm afraid

568
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,870
my dad would kill me.

569
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,480
Then what's your plan?

570
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,990
Fire! Run!

571
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,680
Why can you make your appearance like James Bond

572
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,540
while I have to push a garbage can?

573
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,530
That's not the point.

574
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,590
The point is

575
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,260
that due to an emergency,

576
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,590
the press conference has to be postponed.

577
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,210
That's weirder.

578
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,050
Even if you're not arrested by the police,

579
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,770
when Xilai sees the news

580
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,580
that you set his company ablaze,

581
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,620
he'll kill you as well.
