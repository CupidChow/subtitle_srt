(Nice to meet you, please don't fake it)
(Episode 1)

3
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:56,930
Someone said

4
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:59,830
dreams are what people call the unachievable.

5
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:00,950
I don't think so.

6
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,880
The point of a dream is to give one direction.

7
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,440
One should set out towards the light.

8
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,680
The harder you work,

9
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,210
the luckier you'll be.

10
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,350
It's another great day.

11
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,820
I have to do well

12
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,450
for today's interview.

13
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,780
Let's go!

14
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:21,960
Come on!

15

(Tian Tian, Illustrator)

16
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,420
In this world,

17
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:39,820
time is ruthless

18
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,170
and fair.

19
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,550
No one ever gets an extra minute.

20
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,020
Only those who can control time

21
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,620
can control their own lives.

22
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,700
I truly believe in this.

23
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,790
Those who calculate time in minutes

24
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,210
have 59 times more time

25
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,300
than those who calculate time in hours.

26
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,100
That's right.

27
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,050
I'm someone who lives by the minute.

28
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,580
Perfect.

29

(Liu Xilai, CEO of Qiansheng Group)

(Qiansheng Group)

31
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,150
Yes, come in.

32
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,020
Please take off your brooch.

33
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,630
Thank you for your cooperation.

34
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,310
Why?

35
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Because it's red.

36
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,640
Hello.

37
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,210
Your lipstick is too bright.

38
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,140
It doesn’t meet the makeup guidelines of Qiansheng Group.

39
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,140
Please remove it.

40
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,200
Young man,

41
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,890
have you heard that

42
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,860
makeup is like plastic surgery?

43
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,130
If I remove it, I'll be disfigured.

44
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,220
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,920
You can choose to wipe off your lipstick

46
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,560
or leave.

47
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,350
It's just an interview.

48
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,230
Must you be so strict?

49
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,620
I heard that Mr. Liu of the Qiansheng Group

50
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,550
doesn't like red

51
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,060
because a master told him

52
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,240
that gold is good for him but red is bad.

53
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,910
So,

54
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,240
when you're in Qiansheng Group,

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,520
you can't use red.

56
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,150
Especially

57
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,170
bright red.

58
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,510
Why is Mr. Liu so weird?

59
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,790
How unlucky.

60
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,040
The work that I brought for the interview is red.

61
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,460
Assistant Tang.

62
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,710
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

63
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,560
Are you saving money for me?

64
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,560
Mr. Liu, you're funny.

65
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,250
This batch of custom made sunglasses

66
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,460
are made with special materials.

67
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,820
The red light filter is enhanced.

68
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,280
You should try it on first.

69
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,440
(Tang Sai, CEO's Special Assistant)

70
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:52,870
Mr. Liu.

71
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,350
The house, the company,

72
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,580
and some specific places you often go to.

73
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,980
I promise there's no red.

74
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,620
As for other occasions,

75
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,220
you can wear the sunglasses.

76
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,580
(CEO of Qiansheng Group, Liu Xilai)

77
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,840
Mr. Liu, as we all know,
(CEO of Qiansheng Group, Liu Xilai)

78
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,470
Qiansheng Group is the largest toy company

79
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,600
in the Asian market.

80
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,320
Why did you choose to enter

81
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,050
the niche designer toy market?

82
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,100
Because it's profitable.

83
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,420
Director Liu is so humorous.

84
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:16,980
Indeed.

85
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,010
Designer toys have become a

86
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,510
mainstay of Gen Z's spiritual consumption.

87
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,040
So,

88
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,390
what advantage does Qiansheng Group have

89
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,670
compared to all the designer toy workshops?

90
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,870
The advantage lies in our rich capital.

91
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,680
We'll start with 100 million yuan

92
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,410
for research and development.

93
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,780
Mr. Liu is so brave at such a young age.

94
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,180
No wonder you're the idol of the young generation.

95
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,060
It's not much of an exaggeration

96
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,220
to say that you're the dream guy of a billion girls.

97
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,050
Do you have a message

98
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,810
for them?

99
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,080
Youngsters,

100
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,690
spend less time dreaming

101
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,820
and more time doing.

102
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,150
Now, let's talk about

103
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,900
the classic works of the Qiansheng Group.

104
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,890
For example, Tang Fei’s Deep Palace series and

105
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,020
Fang Jingjing's Winter Story series.

106
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,420
Sorry.

107
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,560
It's Tang Fei's Winter Story series.

108
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,600
Director Liu, what are you doing?

109
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,900
It's a waste of time

110
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,580
to have an interview with someone who's unprepared.

111
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,420
Assistant Tang,

112
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,830
don't accept requests

113
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,470
for such unprofessional interviews anymore.

114
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,730
I haven't even asked

115
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,630
about those rumored taboos.

116
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,020
Tang Fei's Winter Story series.

117
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,030
(Tang Fei, Designer)
Tang Fei's Winter Story series.

118
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,010
Tang Fei's Winter Story series.

119
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,940
I want my work

120
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,300
to become a classic too.

121
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,920
(A new designer toy will be launched soon.)
(Designer: Kevin)

122
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,940
What's going on?

123
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:58,320
Hello.

124
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,490
Excuse me,

125
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,540
is Designer Kevin from your company?

126
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,760
Of course.

127
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,040
He's the director of our toy design department.

128
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,170
He's very talented.

129
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,030
He's also the interviewer today.

130
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,450
(Name: Tian Tian)
(Resume)

131
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,620
(Kevin, Design Director)

132
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,650
Tian Tian.

133
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,500
Based on your resume,

134
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,160
you used to be an illustrator.

135
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,120
Why do you want to be a trending toy designer now?

136
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,950
Because illustrations are two-dimensional works,

137
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,010
while designer toys are three-dimensional presentations.

138
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,620
So, being a toy designer

139
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,310
has always been my dream.

140
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,900
Qiansheng Group is not a dream-making company.

141
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,230
We don't want dreamers.

142
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,180
We want people with extraordinary creativity.

143
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,980
I understand.

144
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,110
For example,

145
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,870
the Cute Pets series

146
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,280
designed by Kevin on the publicity wall

147
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,390
is very creative.

148
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,230
But there's one thing I don't understand.

149
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,659
Can I ask Kevin?

150
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,220
Go ahead.

151
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,770
What does the

152
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,000
thorned rose at the lion's feet

153
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,540
symbolize?

154
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,200
It represents the young and energetic youth

155
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,260
who step on the thorny road full of roses.

156
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,660
They turn the tide and grow towards the sun.

157
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:15,650
Kevin.

158
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,800
I have another explanation

159
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,180
for the thorned roses.

160
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,820
Personally, I love The Lion King.

161
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,250
So,

162
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,500
I've used a lion instead of a tiger,

163
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,170
and a rose instead of a multiflora rose

164
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,660
to create a cute illustration

165
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,940
called Thorned Roses.

166
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,490
Why is your design

167
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,799
so similar to the illustration I did three years ago?

168
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,490
Miss Tian,

169
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,990
are you trying to blackmail me?

170
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,270
I'm not.

171
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,610
I have evidence.

172
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,000
In my illustration,

173
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,980
there's an easter egg.

174
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,890
You can look at it again.

175
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,820
You're being unreasonable.

176
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,590
Security. Where's the security?

177
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,810
Are you feeling nervous? Guilty? Why are you calling security?

178
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,580
If you dare to plagiarize,

179
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,590
then dare to admit it!

180
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,990
You're talking nonsense.

181
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,850
Security! Where is the security?

182
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,360
Don't touch me.

183
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,760
I can walk by myself.

184
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,550
But I, Tian Tian,

185
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,710
will never let your

186
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,770
shameless acts of plagiarism slide.

187
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,380
(Qiansheng Group)

188
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,790
Why don't you let me in?

189
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,980
I want to see your boss.

190
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,450
Sorry.

191
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,630
I was informed that

192
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,630
I can't let you in.

193
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,750
Why?

194
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,200
I was plagiarized.

195
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,930
Plagiarism, you know?

196
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,510
It's like someone took your child away from you,

197
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,440
saying you didn't give birth to it.

198
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,630
No matter who gave birth to the child,

199
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,430
please leave.

200
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,340
I...

201
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,650
Ridiculous.

202
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,210
Hey, Rose.

203
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:03,960
Tian.

204
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,050
Is the interview over?

205
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:05,890
How did you do?

206
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,250
Did you impress them

207
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,020
with your talent?

208
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,860
I almost killed someone. Let's not talk about it.

209
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,650
Rose, I was plagiarized.

210
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,840
Plagiarized?

211
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,060
Hello.

212
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,440
It's too noisy on your end.

213
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,520
I'm going to defend my rights.

214
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,050
Let's talk at home tonight.

215
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,740
I don't believe that no one cares about this.

216
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,670
He dared to chase me away after plagiarizing my work.

217
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,830
Sorry, we can't let you in.

218
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,360
Forget it. I'm not going in.

219
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,320
Then tell me

220
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,700
what time does your boss going to work and leave the office?

221
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,370
No comment.

222
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,510
You...

223
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,640
The CEO has arrived.

224
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,910
Security, get ready.

225
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,340
Alert! Alert!

226
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,900
So he is Mr. Liu.

227
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,620
I'm really stunned by

228
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,770
the arrogance of this king of cockiness.

229
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,890
Mr. Liu, please wait.

230
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,000
Mr. Liu.

231
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,520
Kevin, the Design Director of your company,

232
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,000
copied my design.

233
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,890
Do you know about this?

234
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,730
Let me show you.

235
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,940
He plagiarized this series.

236
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,980
No need, I'm not interested.

237
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,870
My time is expensive.

238
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,940
Are you going to let it be?

239
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,380
If every matter in the company

240
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,910
had to be handled by the CEO,

241
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,460
then this company

242
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,570
would have shut down.

243
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,490
But as the CEO,

244
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,990
allowing your subordinates to plagiarize

245
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,190
would also cause the company to shut down sooner or later.

246
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,640
Boss.

247
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,030
Mr. Liu.

248
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,960
-Boss. -Mr. Liu.

249
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:44,790
Mr. Liu.

250
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,080
Mr. Liu.

251
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,340
Boss.

252
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:47,990
Are you okay, Mr. Liu?

253
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,830
No way.

254
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:49,790
This...

255
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,390
He fainted?

256
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,100
Mr. Liu.

257
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,150
Tian Tian has bad character

258
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,030
and hit others.

259
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,110
She's trying her best to get people's attention through blackmail.

260
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,510
Even you, Mr. Liu, have not be spared.

261
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,040
I don't want to hear your flimsy explanation.

262
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,710
Give all the information about this series of toys

263
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,770
to Assistant Tang.

264
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,940
The company will decide.

265
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:07,480
No.

266
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,580
Assistant Tang,

267
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,330
investigate this matter.

268
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,340
Okay.

269
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,390
Mr. Liu,

270
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,130
you haven't fainted because of the color red in a long time.

271
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,160
Do you want to call Doctor Li?

272
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,700
Hello.

273
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,580
Miss Tian.

274
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,410
Kevin.

275
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,460
How do you know my phone number?

276
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,480
I know your phone number

277
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,080
and your family background.

278
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,560
It's all on your resume.

279
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,890
Before you mess around,

280
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,870
you should think about your future.

281
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,180
Are you threatening me?

282
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,400
Listen.

283
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,000
You messed with the wrong person.

284
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,260
I'm stubborn.

285
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,420
Those who cross my boundaries

286
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,420
will be punished.

287
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,560
Plagiarism is my bottom line.

288
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,540
I will protect my rights till the end.

289
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,060
Give me a bank account number.

290
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,720
I'll transfer you some money.

291
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,320
Let it go.

292
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,250
Ridiculous.

293
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,810
You can't threaten me so now you want to tempt me?

294
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,680
No way.

295
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,210
Tian.

296
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,850
If he knows your address,

297
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,120
will he take revenge on you?

298
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,920
If he dares to,

299
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,120
I'll make sure

300
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,590
he doesn't get his way

301
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,470
and loses even more!

302
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,500
I know you're hot-tempered.

303
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,720
But I'm afraid you'll suffer

304
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,110
if you go up against someone like that.

305
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,180
The company has no evidence

306
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,310
that he plagiarized it either, right?

307
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,980
Rose.

308
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,540
I have solid evidence.

309
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,880
But I'm not close to the CEO.

310
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,350
I'm now known as the top troublemaker.

311
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,530
I can't even enter the gate of the Qiansheng Group.

312
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,800
You have me.

313
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,360
It's time to use my skills as a journalist.

314
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,630
I will help you find out

315
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,740
the CEO's schedule

316
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,810
so that you can take advantage of it.

317
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,890
Mr. Liu.

318
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,610
Uncle Liu called just now.

319
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,180
He wants you to free up an hour.

320
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,290
Again? I'm busy.

321
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,240
Uncle Liu knew you would say you were busy,

322
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,770
so he checked your schedule

323
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,370
and said it will only take one hour.

324
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,420
Assistant Tang,

325
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,200
do you know

326
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,930
how much it would cost Qiansheng Group

327
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,330
for me to waste an hour?

328
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,610
Uncle Liu said

329
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,150
Qiansheng Group is a big company.

330
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,250
We're not afraid of loss.

331
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:34,580
Okay.

332
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,070
Just one hour.

333
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,250
Mr. Liu,

334
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,130
I heard that this time, your blind date

335
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,540
is an extremely beautiful girl.

336
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,070
In school,

337
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,960
she received more than 50 love letters every day.

338
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,710
Everywhere she went,

339
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,850
she was stopped by people confessing their love for her.

340
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,420
So,

341
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,590
the boys in this school

342
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,550
did nothing

343
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,470
but wrote her love letters.

344
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,470
According to the information, that's right.

345
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,400
Assistant Tang,

346
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,660
notify HR.

347
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,050
Do not hire

348
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,000
any boys from this school.

349
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,030
Okay, Mr. Liu.

350
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,200
Hello, Rose.

351
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,940
Are you sure

352
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,860
Liu Xilai will show up here today?

353
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,700
You can doubt my character,

354
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,510
but you can't doubt my professionalism.

355
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,390
It's such a waste that

356
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,840
I'm not a paparazzi, given my abilities.

357
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,170
Okay.

358
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,990
I'll do my best to protect my rights.

359
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,160
Sorry, madam.

360
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,470
The club is only open to members.

361
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,530
Please show me your membership card.

362
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,190
I...

363
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,780
I'm here for an interview.

364
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,650
Hello, Mr. Liu.

365
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,450
I'm Qian Qian.

366
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:06,369
Hello.

367
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,790
Mr. Liu, what do you

368
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,369
enjoy doing for leisure?

369
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,609
Let me guess.

370
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,329
Golf?

371
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,480
Yachting?

372
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,069
Or...

373
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,070
Do you know how to play Golden Flower?

374
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,140
A straight.

375
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,520
Straight flush.

376
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,840
Since he is the CEO of Qiansheng Group,

377
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,610
I'll take the initiative.

378
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,550
Her game etiquette is so terrible.

379
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,490
She even wanted to peep at my cards.

380
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:11,590
Mr. Liu.

381
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,130
Actually, I'm not good at playing cards.

382
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,590
What should I do?

383
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,080
I promised my uncle

384
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,130
that I'd only go home after an hour.

385
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,580
Otherwise,

386
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:23,930
Let's...

387
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,450
Read.

388
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,190
He has such a beautiful woman by his side and

389
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,370
he wants to read?

390
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,270
Is he blind?

391
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,170
Mr. Liu.

392
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,900
What book are you reading?

393
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,950
Do you want to read it?

394
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,340
A Hundred Years of Solitude.

395
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,070
What the hell?

396
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,210
Am I really

397
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,470
such a bore?

398
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:49,800
Mr. Liu.

399
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,640
Actually,

400
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,590
you can talk to me.

401
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,810
You'll find that

402
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,770
I'm not only good looking

403
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,450
but also sophisticated.

404
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,980
Miss Qian, do you want to chat?

405
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,110
You can chat with the AI robot

406
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,710
developed by my company.

407
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,140
Have a good chat.

408
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,310
It can satisfy all your desires for a chat.

409
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,960
And it's not difficult

410
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,920
to get it.

411
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,890
We can give you a 15% discount.

412
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,040
Here, try it.

413
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:28,890
Hello.

414
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,450
So what if he's the CEO of Qiansheng Group?

415
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,410
He's a weirdo.

416
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,460
Is he crazy?

417
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,360
I...

418
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,310
My stomach hurts.

419
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,260
Excuse me.

420
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,410
I need to go to the toilet.

421
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,500
Assistant Tang.

422
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,630
I am seriously unhappy.

423
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,140
I demand that Qiansheng Group

424
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,440
punish the plagiarist severely.

425
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,090
I want justice!

426
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,340
(Say no to plagiarism)
I want justice!

427
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,600
(Say no to plagiarism)

428
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,450
Mr. Liu.

429
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,870
Why are you...

430
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,360
Why are you overreacting?

431
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,290
Why is he staring at me like that?

432
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,390
Is he really crazy?

433
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,800
Why don't I feel dizzy when I see red

434
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,860
once I touch her?

435
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,180
Mr. Liu.

436
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,550
Why is Miss Qian…

437
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:45,880
You...

438
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,310
Why are you here again?

439
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,790
What are you doing?

440
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,180
Get up.

441
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,120
Don't take advantage of my Mr. Liu.

442
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,640
Wait.

443
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,630
She can't leave.

444
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,400
Do you think you're the only one with sunglasses?

445
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,680
Kevin's image of the cutesy stone lion

446
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,290
was plagiarized from this illustration three years ago.

447
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,120
Each of my illustrations

448
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,770
contain an easter egg.

449
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,180
Among the thorned roses in this illustration,

450
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,180
there's a hidden "Tian" logo.

451
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,940
This is the evidence.

452
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:31,630
Look.

453
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,100
I really don't feel dizzy.

454
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,770
Unbelievable.

455
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,860
Mr. Liu,

456
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,760
do you also think it's shocking?

457
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,010
This was completely plagiarized.

458
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,110
Mr. Liu.

459
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,260
Look.

460
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,430
This little lion's eyes

461
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,260
and this little lion's eyes…

462
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,600
Unbelievable.

463
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,520
What's going on?

464
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,190
Mr. Liu, please take a look.

465
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,530
The eyebrows of this lion

466
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,600
and this little lion's eyebrows…

467
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,700
Miss Tian.

468
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,410
Have some water.

469
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,600
Stop interrupting.

470
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,390
Is he even listening to me?

471
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,870
Unbelievable.

472
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,600
Is he seriously ill?

473
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:46,900
Mr. Liu.

474
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,640
Miss Tian.

475
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,200
You are right.

476
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,990
Is he trying to brush me off?

477
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,040
Forget it. I'll put up with it.

478
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,200
Unbelievable.

479
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,930
I can't bear it!

480
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,500
Mr. Liu,

481
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,060
I don't think being plagiarized

482
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,030
is so unbelievable!

483
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,650
You keep saying it's unbelievable.

484
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,750
Unbelievable!

485
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,380
Are you mocking me?

486
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:23,890
Miss Tian,

487
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,370
I've been listening to you carefully.

488
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,520
Don't worry.

489
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,070
I will investigate it as soon as possible

490
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,050
and give you a fair response.

491
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,820
I hope you can keep your promise.

492
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,720
Don't give me a perfunctory response.

493
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,380
Otherwise,

494
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,710
I will use the law and the media

495
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,190
to defend my rights.

496
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,350
Are you okay?

497
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,780
What happened today was such a surprise.

498
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,150
It's really

499
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,640
a miracle.

500
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,420
Help me make an appointment with Dr Li.

501
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,610
He's quite happy.

502
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,070
(Bonus Scenes)

503
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,520
Tian, wake up. You'll be late for your interview.
(Bonus Scenes)

504
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,780
I was up a long time ago.

I'm almost at the bus stop.

507
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,650
I didn't wake you before I went out

508
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,800
since you were up late last night.

509
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,330
I'm calling to tell you that

you'll have bad luck today. Be careful.
