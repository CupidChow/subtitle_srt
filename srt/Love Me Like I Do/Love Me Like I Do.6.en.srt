(A world of two alone)
(Episode 6)

3
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,520
Li Huai.

4
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,320
Look.

5
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,950
The sky is red,

6
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,680
and it's drizzling.

7
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,050
How romantic.

8
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,300
First of all,

9
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,160
the sky is blue.

10
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:54,610
Secondly,

11
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,770
the rain will stop soon.

12
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:57,820
Finally,

13
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,540
can you lift this umbrella a little higher?

14
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,400
I really can't see the road ahead.

15
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,400
Did you notice that?

16
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,340
I don't feel dizzy anymore.

17
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,479
So,

18
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,410
this is the reason why you asked me to cancel the client appointment

19
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,290
(Drifting Racing Club)
this is the reason why you asked me to cancel the client appointment

20
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,110
so that you could bring me here?

21
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,670
Listen.

22
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,720
I won't go with you.

23
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,850
This is too embarrassing.

24
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,090
It's so early in the morning, it'll be full of parents and their kids.

25
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,550
Soon, there will be a pair of good friends in there too.

26
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,079
Let's go.

27
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,200
Take a look at the country Sir has built for you.

28
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,130
Impossible.

29
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,340
I'm not interested in

30
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,430
extreme sports like this.

31
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,490
I won't go with you.

32
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,020
It’s not up to you.

33
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,430
-When you force it, things don't end well. -Let’s go.

34
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,790
We're wearing the same suit.

35
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,970
I guess my long legs must have offended him.

36
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,250
I have a partner too.

37
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,040
Let's compete.

38
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,410
Sure. I'm not afraid.

39
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,550
Rookie.

40
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,910
Do you still want to compete?

41
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,840
Let's do another round if you dare.

42
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,590
The winner will draw a turtle

43
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,930
on the loser's face.

44
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,880
Come on. I'm not afraid of you.

45
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,520
Have you heard of a saying?

46
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,290
You will not get into trouble if you do not seek trouble.

47
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,580
Will I lose to a kid?

48
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,980
I was just warming up.

49
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,820
Now, Sir will bring you to get our country back.

50
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,740
I'm not coming.

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
It's not up to you.

52
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,450
Is this the country that you led me to get back?

53
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,500
Will you die if you don't act tough?

54
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:55,720
When I was young, every time Zhao mentioned go-karting,

55
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,520
I got excited.

56
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,200
I thought it would be fun.

57
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,850
As it turns out,

58
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,800
there are thugs in kart racing too.

59
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,180
Assistant Tian, wait.

60
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,180
Has Mr. Liu contacted you?

61
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,090
No.

62
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Strange.

63
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,970
All these years,

64
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,740
it's the first time that Mr. Liu has taken time off

65
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,000
because he had to rest.

66
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,510
He's not here.

67
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,650
That's great.

68
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,000
But

69
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,960
would such a self-centered person

70
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,110
be embarrassed because of yesterday's accident?

71
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,670
Unbelievable.

72
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,350
Look at the pretty color

73
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,090
of this chili hot pot.

74
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,810
So we're having Chongqing hot pot for our first meal today.

75
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,610
Young man,

76
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,420
don't be so rigid.

77
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,400
It's good to relax sometimes.

78
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,100
Research shows that

79
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,270
excessive consumption of hot peppers

80
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,660
will irritate the intestinal mucosa

81
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,480
which will lead to abscesses in the digestive system,

82
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,480
causing abdominal pain, diarrhea,

83
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,550
duodenal ulceration,

84
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,150
hematemesis and stomach...

85
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,450
Weird. It's not spicy at all.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This Super Spicy hot pot is nothing.

87
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,460
Try it.

88
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:24,830
Really?

89
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:46,800
Liu Xilai.

90
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,750
Are you human?

91
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,210
Don't be so childish.

92
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,430
You fell for it.

93
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,920
It means you're too naive.

94
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,300
I'm going to change it to clear soup.

95
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,030
Impossible.

96
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:57,510
I've been eating

97
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,220
clear soup hot pot, the most scorned hot pot, for years.

98
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,100
Finally, I can look at red things

99
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,230
and you're asking me to eat that again.

100
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,040
Red things?

101
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,930
I didn't expect the chili hot pot to be so spicy.

102
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,990
It's really painful and satisfying.

103
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:13,900
Fine.

104
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,510
For your new lease of life

105
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,010
and your first chili hotpot,

106
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,160
I'm giving it my all.

107
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,240
Waiter.

108
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,530
Sour plum drink please.

109
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,230
You're so relaxed today.

110
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,190
Yeah.

111
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,030
Something is missing.

112
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,020
Strange.

113
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,490
Unexpectedly, Mr. Liu didn't look for Tian Tian today.

114
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,600
It's not right.

115
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,090
Yes.

116
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,470
Usually, the phone would ring a few times.

117
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,780
Stop guessing.

118
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,160
Mr. Liu is not in the office today.

119
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,360
No wonder.

120
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,780
Tian Tian has become more efficient today.

121
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,540
What am I thinking?

122
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,410
I should focus on work.

123
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,240
Unbelievable.

124
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,490
There're so many movies showing now.

125
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,800
Why did you have to choose this?

126
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,900
Zhao likes it.

127
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,540
You are so obsessed with your younger brother.

128
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,850
Superman! Superman! Superman!

129
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,290
Lower your voice.

130
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Lower your voice.

131
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
That's Zhao's favorite superhero.

132
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,910
Batman! Batman!

133
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,070
Can you stop talking?

134
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,330
What's wrong with you?

135
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,610
This is the last time.

136
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,750
My favorite superhero.

137
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,510
Wonder Woman.

138
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,850
My favorite superhero.

139
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:35,980
Zhao.

140
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,800
What should I do?

141
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,560
Brother Xilai is in a relationship.

142
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,210
Take this!

143
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,650
Liu Xizhao.

144
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,140
Did you hear me?

145
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,050
Come on.

146
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,500
Who else would like him except you?

147
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,750
The most special day.

148
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,100
A commemoration.

149
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,220
Who are you commemorating? With who?

150
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,280
Or is it an anniversary with someone?

151
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,550
Look.

152
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,220
Miss.

153
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,980
What can you see

154
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,610
from a picture of hot pot?

155
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,520
Give me your phone. Hurry up.

156
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,720
My qualifying match!

157
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,480
Look.

158
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,590
Two sets of cutlery

159
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,710
and hand cream.

160
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,620
Which man would carry hand cream with him?

161
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,430
Sherlock Holmes Xian.

162
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,500
Why didn't I notice

163
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,700
your potential to be a detective?

164
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,320
I have a feeling that

165
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,650
this person is definitely Tian Tian.

166
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,510
Who knows.

167
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,830
Maybe Tian Tian

168
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,660
is at Brother Xilai's house now.

169
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,240
Why are you looking at me?

170
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,040
I'm not going.

171
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,770
Xilai is still taking a shower.

172
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,500
A shower?

173
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,560
Come in.

174
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,980
Close the door.

175
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,620
Where are you going?

176
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,650
To do the laundry.

177
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,330
But...

178
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,760
But Brother Xilai is taking a bath.

179
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,260
Besides,

180
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,740
why are you washing clothes at Brother Xilai's house

181
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,350
in the middle of the night?

182
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:42,640
No.

183
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,170
I got hot pot oil on my clothes.

184
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,140
If I don't wash it now,

185
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,740
I can't wash it off tomorrow.

186
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,790
So you are the one

187
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,990
who went on a date

188
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,950
and had hot pot with Brother Xilai.

189
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,450
Unfortunately,

190
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,450
it's me.

191
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:04,820
Have a seat.

192
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,150
So

193
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,550
you two had hot pot together.

194
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,380
I'm relieved now.

195
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,660
Brother Xilai.

196
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,330
Why did you go out

197
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,990
without inviting me and Zhao?

198
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,770
What sort of friend are you?

199
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,320
We're the Golden Trinity after all.

200
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,920
Only you still think about the Golden Trinity.

201
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,190
He

202
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,530
has gone solo.

203
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,220
It's just the two of them now.

204
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,370
Don't be jealous.

205
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,800
I love you the most.

206
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,960
No need.

207
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,560
Your favorite?

208
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,070
I don't want to be that.

209
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,430
You two.

210
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,050
Why did you look for me

211
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:55,780
at this hour?

212
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,910
Because you posted that...

213
00:13:59,180 --> 00:13:59,820
Uh...

214
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,920
It's all because of Zhao.

215
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,550
He wants to learn from you,

216
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,140
how to enjoy life and work at the same time.

217
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,540
Have you figured it out?

218
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,190
No.

219
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,100
Don't talk nonsense.

220
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,340
You didn't mean what you said.

221
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,650
Don't worry.

222
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,180
I'll arrange for you to come to work tomorrow.

223
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:21,980
I refuse.

224
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,060
I haven't had enough rest.

225
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,700
Mr. Liu.

226
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,680
Today's schedule and workplan

227
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,280
have been sent to your phone.

228
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:38,860
Zhao.

229
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,640
Did you stay up late again yesterday?

230
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,080
I never get up before noon.

231
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,280
Getting up early ruins the day.

232
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,290
(Crazy Devil Brother)

233
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:16,880
Brother.

234
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,720
Stop sending me messages.

235
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,780
I'm very sober now.

236
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,490
(Design Department)

237
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,990
Jiang, let me tell you.
(Design Department)

238
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,070
For this year's West Coast Art Exhibition,

239
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,270
there'll be various types of works like paintings and video art.

240
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,600
Unfortunately, it's hard to get tickets.

241
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,500
It's such a pity every year, although it's worse this time.

242
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,230
I'm going to miss the chance to rub shoulders with the greats again.

243
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,220
Strange.

244
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,330
Why did he pretend that he didn't see me?

245
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,330
Is he trying to cover it up?

246
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:07,940
Fine.

247
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,480
Then we can avoid embarrassment.

248
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,790
Assistant Tang.

249
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,460
Two tickets for the West Coast Art Exhibition.

250
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,180
Do you want to give it to Assistant Tian?

251
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,500
Is it so obvious?

252
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,580
I wanted to see it

253
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,480
so I'm buying one for Assistant Tian since it's convenient.

254
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,660
Don’t try to guess what I’m thinking again.

255
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,190
Okay.

256
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,530
Get one for Zhao too.

257
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,890
Let him get some artistic influence.

258
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,180
I...

259
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,370
What did I do this morning?

260
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,030
I'll post it on my Moments.

261
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,079
(Another beautiful day.)
(Ignorant)

262
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,540
Hello?

263
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,980
What's going on?

264
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,010
You don't get up before noon, do you?

265
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:23,760
Thanks to you,

266
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,380
today is my first day of work.

267
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,130
Well...

268
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,510
You can't avoid it

269
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,000
forever.

270
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,850
It's not my fault.

271
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,700
Aren't you ashamed at all?

272
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,900
Doesn't your heart hurt?

273
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,940
It hurts.

274
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,780
So, just wait.

275
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,090
I'm coming to visit you.

276
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,090
Are you that kind?

277
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,940
I think

278
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,580
you're using me as a tool

279
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,850
to visit your Brother Xilai, right?

280
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,790
I'm glad you know that.

281
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,220
I'll buy you something delicious.

282
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,880
Wait for me.

283
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,540
You're the best. Bye.

284
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,960
I'll inform Assistant Tian now.

285
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,100
I'll ask her to go to the art exhibition with you tomorrow.

286
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,920
Wait.

287
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,220
The exhibition will be held for three days.

288
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,020
Go ask

289
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,010
for Assistant Tian's work schedule.

290
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,810
I'll accommodate her schedule.

291
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,190
Why?

292
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,220
I've always been a good boss who cares about my employees.

293
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,880
What's wrong with accommodating my employees?

294
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,570
But

295
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,000
you don't get dizzy anymore.

296
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,940
Why do you still value Assistant Tian so much?

297
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,870
Assistant Tang,

298
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,730
if one day, I suddenly tell you

299
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,150
that I don't need you anymore,

300
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,080
Would you be sad?

301
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,290
That's like a bolt from the blue.

302
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:48,750
So,

303
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,580
Assistant Tian probably won't be able to accept

304
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,470
a sudden drop in her importance.

305
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,810
I plan to find a suitable time

306
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,600
at the exhibition

307
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:58,990
to tell her.

308
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,070
They did pretty well

309
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,940
to get this set up in a hurry.

310
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,530
From now on,

311
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,220
this will be your office.

312
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,740
When you were young,

313
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,470
you always complained to uncle

314
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,290
that you don't have what I have.

315
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:35,880
Now,

316
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,550
you will have

317
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,370
everything that I have.

318
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,770
Got it, brother.

319
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,470
But can you stop talking about our childhood?

320
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,200
You've grown up, so I can't talk about it now?

321
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,050
By the way, do you know

322
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,420
what you're doing today?

323
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,020
Slacking.

324
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,070
I mean, figuring out the company's business.

325
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,090
Xian.

326
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,560
Why are you here?

327
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,020
Brother Xilai.

328
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,780
I was afraid that Zhao would be sleepy

329
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,640
on his first day

330
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,460
so I brought him some coffee.

331
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,480
Do you know, there's a job

332
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,080
called the delivery person?

333
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,760
Two cups of skimmed milk

334
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,910
and no sugar, right?

335
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,510
Be careful.

336
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,600
It's okay.

337
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,650
If this spills, there's another cup.

338
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,510
I don't drink coffee with milk.

339
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,610
Really?

340
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,450
Drink more milk to replenish protein.

341
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:31,850
Drink.

342
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,430
Thank you, Xian.

343
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,770
You guys continue.

344
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,090
I have to go. I have something to do.

345
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,500
Wait, Brother Xilai.

346
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,900
I have a gift for you.

347
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,110
Come to my studio this weekend.

348
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,030
This weekend? I have plans.

349
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,280
Maybe another day.

350
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,590
Why does Brother Xilai have plans this weekend?

351
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,340
It's definitely a date.

352
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,970
Please.

353
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,050
I advise you

354
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,470
not to be so imaginative.

355
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,120
You're so close to him now.

356
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,230
Why don't you ask Brother Xilai

357
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,660
what he did this weekend.

358
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,800
What else can he do?

359
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,430
He's probably going to the art exhibition.

360
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,090
He even asked me to go with him,

361
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,320
to gain exposure.

362
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,490
The West Coast Art Exhibition?

363
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,350
Zhao.

364
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,430
How can I miss out on

365
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,190
gaining exposure and visiting art exhibitions?

366
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,220
How about this?

367
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,930
This weekend,

368
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,920
I'll go with you and Brother Xilai.

369
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,240
I'm not going.

370
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,310
Last time, because of a misunderstanding,

371
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,740
you made me lose my life of unemployment

372
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,870
to an office worker.

373
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,900
Can you help me this time?

374
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,630
I'll buy you a big seafood meal.

375
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:54,940
I'm so angry.

376
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,590
This year's new limited edition Iron Man.

377
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,190
I already have it.

378
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,510
The entire Lego Star Wars series.

379
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,100
Deal.

380
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,120
Deal.

381
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,180
Go on.

382
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,140
Just pretend nothing happened that day.

383
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,470
He didn't feel awkward.

384
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,930
Why should I feel awkward?

385
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,400
Sorry.

386
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,890
I got up late.

387
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,100
Assistant Tian protected me on her own accord.

388
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,760
Should I tell her

389
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,440
about my recovery so soon?

390
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,630
Just in case she gets embarrassed.

391
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,270
Assistant Tian,

392
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,180
we're working so well together.

393
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,690
Do you have to do this?

394
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,320
Kill me.

395
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,010
It'll cheer you up.

396
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:09,910
(Artist: Luo Ci)
(Twin Flowers)

397
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,770
This is senior Luo Ci’s painting.
(Artist: Luo Ci)
(Twin Flowers)

398
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,060
How can such a young man

399
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,840
be so talented?

400
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,890
I often ask myself this question too.

401
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,070
It's really hard to answer.

402
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,790
Brother Xilai.

403
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,770
You've spent your entire IQ

404
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,760
on ways to accidentally run into him.

405
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,130
Brother Xilai, you're here for the exhibition too?

406
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,370
What a coincidence.

407
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,960
Xian, you're so well dressed today.

408
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,800
Of course.

409
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,780
It's in my nature to be refined.

410
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,420
It's in your nature

411
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,840
to pretend to be refined.

412
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,810
Brother Xilai really invited you this weekend.

413
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,100
I have work to do. I'm accompanying Mr. Liu at the exhibition.

414
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,470
As if you understand the exhibition.

415
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,690
Why does Brother Xilai need you

416
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,150
to accompany him to an exhibition like this?

417
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,350
Just in case.

418
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,110
You...

419
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:04,860
Look.

420
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,140
Isn't this the beautiful painter,

421
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,430
Snow Queen, Wen Xian?

422
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,900
She is so pretty in person.

423
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,520
Hello.

424
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,030
Goddess,

425
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,840
do you also like Last Dinner?

426
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,300
Last Dinner

427
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,850
has a strong sense of style and lines.

428
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,140
Every character's expression is dramatic.

429
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,740
The lights and candles shine together.

430
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,260
This girl is something.

431
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,410
It's one of the best pieces to do that.

432
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,870
Well said, Goddess.

433
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,830
Can I take a photo with you?

434
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,470
Okay.

435
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,880
Me too.

436
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,310
Let's go.

437
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,270
Mr. Liu.

438
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,780
I need to use the bathroom.

439
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,870
With my temperament,

440
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,380
I would never hold that.

441
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,900
You don't have to hold this.

442
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,340
Just put on your sunglasses and stay here.

443
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,390
Okay.

444
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,620
There are many people here.

445
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,950
Put it on before I leave.

446
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,970
Assistant Tian looks

447
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,550
really good today.

448
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,480
Mr. Liu.

449
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,770
Are you okay?

450
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,680
I'm fine.

451
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,790
You're wearing sunglasses for an indoor art exhibition.

452
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,350
Really?

453
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:00,730
Hey.

454
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,750
Can you keep your voice down when you're gossiping?

455
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,900
Not everyone wears sunglasses

456
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,830
just to act cool.

457
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:06,960
Then why?

458
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,470
Does he think he's a star?

459
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,110
Isn't he that viral CEO?

460
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,840
He's quite handsome in person.

461
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,500
What's the use of being handsome?

462
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,030
Let's go.

463
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,150
Weirdness is contagious.

464
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:20,570
You...

465
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,060
Assistant Tian, forget it.

466
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,520
Geniuses always have to bear all kinds of misunderstandings.

467
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,080
I was like them before.

468
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,870
But now,

469
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,750
I'll be your sunglasses.

470
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,810
No one will say anything anymore.

471
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,520
Assistant Tian,

472
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,760
thank you.

473
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,190
Actually,

474
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,050
my illness...

475
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,770
This painting

476
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,380
is similar to the Cute Pets series

477
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,910
that Kevin was in charge of before he left.

478
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,300
I wonder if he got the authorization of Xia Feng.

479
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,540
We didn't sign any authorization for this painting

480
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,650
with anyone.

481
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:13,940
Are you sure?

482
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:14,930
Yes.

483
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,440
I remember every contract

484
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,170
that I read.

485
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,940
Assistant Tang.

486
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,670
Within three minutes,

487
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,770
I want to see all copyright collaboration records

488
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,100
of the Cute Pets series.

489
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,350
Okay, Mr. Liu.

490
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,840
You don't feel dizzy anymore?

491
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,010
Assistant Tian.

492
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:05,870
Let me explain.

493
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,560
Actually, I asked you here today

494
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,760
to tell you this.

495
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,110
But I was afraid you can't accept it

496
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,740
and that you would feel like you're less importance

497
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,740
That's why I...

498
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,790
Great.

499
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,970
I can finally stop being your special assistant.

500
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,090
I can focus on designing.

501
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,950
Why are you so happy?

502
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,040
(Bonus Scenes)

503
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,430
Okay.
(Bonus Scenes)

504
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,120
(Bonus Scenes)

505
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,680
we will launch the new products
(Bonus Scenes)

506
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,940
according to our plan.
(Bonus Scenes)

507
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,460
(Bonus Scenes)

508
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,320
One last thing.
(Bonus Scenes)

509
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:41,810
(Bonus Scenes)

510
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,270
Let me introduce the new Assistant Director
(Bonus Scenes)

511
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:44,940
(Bonus Scenes)

512
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,620
Liu Xizhao.
(Bonus Scenes)

513
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,090
Stop talking.

514
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,150
That's right.

515
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,840
He was parachuted.

516
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,660
He's my younger brother.

517
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,720
He's doing this on purpose, isn't he?

518

Hello, everyone.

519
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,210
I just came back from studying abroad.

520
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,600
I look forward to working with you.

521
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,790
Don't be modest.

522
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,060
My brother, Liu Xilai,

523
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,790
is undoubtedly capable.

524
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:18,630
End of meeting.
