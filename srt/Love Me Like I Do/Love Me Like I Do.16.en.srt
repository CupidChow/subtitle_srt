1
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,830
(Love Me Like I Do)

2
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,759
(You are my sense of security)
(Episode 16)

3
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,600
I can't believe I had an erotic dream.

4
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,470
Tian, your passion for love

5
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,350
can only be shown to me.

6
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,200
Also, I have a surprise for you.

7
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,950
From Xilai, who loves you more every day.

8
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,940
It is not a dream.

9
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,370
Today we will have an amazing game

10
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,440
for our team building activity.

11
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,430
The Queen's Treasure Hunt.

12
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,230
You must be very curious

13
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,950
about the whereabouts of four male guests.

14
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,750
They are guarding the treasure,

15
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,440
waiting for you to find them according to clues.

16
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,000
Your company has various team building games.

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,800
It is not easy to calm down

18
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,890
with such a quick-witted assistant.

19
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,060
Assistant Tian,

20
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,350
this is your clue.

21
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,480
The gift is unique.

22
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,800
Please cherish it.

23
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,000
Mr. Wen.

24
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,970
Mr. Liu rejected the new toy proposal again.

25
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,490
This is outrageous.

26
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:45,630
Mr. Wen,

27
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,380
I'm afraid

28
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,280
we'll lose our position in Qiansheng Group.

29
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,880
It's OK. I'll take care of it.

30
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,620
Kevin.

31
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,370
The election of CEO will be held

32
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,400
in two weeks.

33
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,780
Instead of awaiting our doom,

34
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,090
we should take the initiative.

35
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,590
Don't worry, Mr. Wen.

36
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,560
I know what to do.

37
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,320
I knew you were here.

38
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,060
You little salted fish who loves sunbathing.

39
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,270
I'm not interested in

40
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,470
such a childish game.

41
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,210
How could you find me?

42
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,910
Because

43
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,100
I know you

44
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,490
really well.

45
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,340
Sitting on the beach is so comfortable, right?

46
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,530
Take your time.

47
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,630
I'm leaving.

48
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,750
Liu Xizhao.

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,970
Stop it.

50
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,650
You like me, don't you.

51
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,260
So what?

52
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,440
You don't like me.

53
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,100
Don't you say you know me well?

54
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,360
Why can't you tell that I'm pursuing you?

55
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,340
Actually,

56
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,990
I heard what you said on your birthday.

57
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,000
I was really confused back then.

58
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,810
I never knew you liked me.

59
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,450
These days when I hid from you,

60
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,310
I recalled many things.

61
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,250
I found that in my memory,

62
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,230
you were the one who share my happiness with me

63
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,630
and accompany me.

64
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,260
Actually, I can't live without you from long ago.

65
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,390
Do you really want to

66
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,150
let go of my hand?

67
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,010
I've never let go of your hand.

68
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,990
I have always been waiting for you to hold my hand.

69
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:39,540
Okay.

70
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,230
From now on,

71
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,720
I'll be your only cute fan.

72
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,700
No, I am older than you. "Cute" is not appropriate.

73
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,680
This bracelet...

74
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,659
What are you doing, Liu Xizhao?

75
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,540
-Let me see how many characters you carved. -You are really petty.

76
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,620
♫Every time I see you, I'll love you more♫

77
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,750
♫When my heart starts galloping♫

78
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,610
♫Without me realizing it♫

00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,970
♫You steal the spring from my heart♫

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,710
♫You are the most surprising thing in my life♫

81

♫Write a beautiful end to the story♫

82
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,580

♫Send you sunny days all year long♫

84
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,960
Thank you for your assistance.

85
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,360
Let me help you in return.

86
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,990
Love you.

87
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,450
They send me this movie ticket,

88
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,860
just because I'm Rose?

89
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,930
Rose.

90
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,180
Actually, there is another reason.

91
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,250
My English name is

92
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,950
Jack.

93
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:19,870
No.

94
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,680
It's just a coincidence.

95
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,700
Don't mix it with the reality.

96
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,430
(Titanic)

97
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,720
On this day,

98
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,760
a girl named Tian Tian

99
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,180
came into my life by accident.

100
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,020
But at that time, I didn't know

101
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,659
I was destined

102
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,580
to meet her.

103
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,110
When you fell into my arms for the first time,

104
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,390
I thought you were trying to rip me off.

105
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,040
Since then,

106
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,860
it seems my career has been on a roll.

107
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,860
This girl

108
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,440
has become my most helpful assistant.

109
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,350
I made this dessert

110
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,320
for you.

111
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,270
Little girl, do you want to try it?

112
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,680
How sweet is it?

113
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,340
Double sweet.

114
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,400
What a beautiful balloon!

115
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,530
In the eyes of outsiders,

116
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,860
I've always been a strategist.

117
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,230
But in fact,

118
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,260
I am afraid of red,

119
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,570
afraid of losing,

120
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,450
and afraid of the feeling of out of control.

121
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,350
It was this girl who changed me.

122
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,430
I became more secure

123
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,720
and could put myself in others' positions.

124
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,050
I was also less distant.

125
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,690
Tian.

126
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,860
Would you like to

127
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,900
have a date in the sky with me?

128
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,700
Tian.

129
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,390
Since young,

130
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,420
I have been too conceited

131
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,960
to care about others' feelings.

132
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,300
But from the moment I fell in love with you,

133
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,650
I've learned to change.

134
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,840
Because of you,

135
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,600
I realized the meaning of life.

136
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
♫Memories have come out of my head♫

137
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,280

♫Memories have come out of my head♫

168
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,220
I'm your boyfriend.
♫My Mr. Right♫

169
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:34,750
I'm your boyfriend.

♫Holding my hand; we'll live in forever♫

171

I will love you forever.

172
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,680
♫Holding my hand; we'll live in forever♫

173
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,370
I will love you forever, too.
♫Holding my hand; we'll live in forever♫

174
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,680
♫I remember every step we make it our story♫

175
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,220
Xilai.
♫I remember every step we make it our story♫

176
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,220
♫I remember every step we make it our story♫

177
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,620
♫So you're my love♫

178

♫You are the one shining all the stars in my life♫

179
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,940

180
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:12,660

181
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,610
♫I'll always believe you'll be here♫

182
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,520
♫My Mr. Right♫

183
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,120
No matter it's now or the future,

184
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,050
both of us are the only to each other.

185
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,800
Be careful.

186
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,610
Who are you? Why did you hit him?

187
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,070
Be careful.

188
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,830
Xilai.

189
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,500
Xilai.

190
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,680
Help!

191
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,700
Help!

192
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,160
Someone is beating others! Call the police!

193
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,080
Xilai.

194
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:47,810
Xilai.

195
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:54,950
Xilai.

196
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,050
Xilai.

197
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,550
I really regret

198
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,890
that I was always so with work

199
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,850
that I didn't have enough time with you.

200
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,850
Dad, wake up.

201
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,850
Dad, wake up!

202
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:18,770
Wake up!

203
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,500
Wake up! Please!

204
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,580
Hang in there.

205
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,700
The ambulance will be here soon.

206
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,760
Blood! So much blood!

207
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,230
Blood.

208
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,520
Mom once said,

209
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,960
"You won't be afraid if someone kisses your forehead".

210
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,860
Xilai.

211
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,590
You're awake.

212
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,220
Do you still have a headache?

213
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,700
You've been in a coma for two days.

214
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,610
Can you see me clearly now?

215
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,380
Tian.

216
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,780
When you were young,

217
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,070
did you save

218
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,630
a boy who had a car accident?

219
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,960
Not really.

220
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,930
When I was young,

221
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,900
on my way to my grandma's,

222
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,150
I did run into a car accident.

223
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,010
A little boy

224
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,050
was trapped in the car.

225
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,430
I was worried.

226
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,860
So I stayed with him.

227
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,180
What's wrong?

228
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,390
No wonder you can cure my hemophobia.

229
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,200
I'm the little boy who had a car accident.

230
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,510
It turns out

231
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,350
that my subconscious has already chosen you.

232
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,710
My sense of security

233
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,960
came from you.

234
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,310
Now it seems

235
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,520
everything happens with traces.

236
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,910
Thank you for growing up safely.

237
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,560
My little boy.

238
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,660
Thank you for holding my hand

239
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,780
and the comforting kiss back then.

240
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,640
My little girl.

241
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,000
Doctor, how is my boyfriend?

242
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,550
The patient's head was severely injured.

243
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,970
He has a minor concussion.

244
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,830
But other indicators are normal.

245
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,030
As long as he is taken good care of,

246
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,690
I believe he'll recover soon.

247
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,020
By the way, there's another good news.

248
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,020
His hemophobia

249
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,270
has no sign of relapse.

250
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,270
I think he's completely recovered.

251
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,350
Great.

252
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,750
Thank you, doctor.

253
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,460
Xilai doesn't have to suffer from hemophobia any more.

254
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,860
I'm going to throw away all his sunglasses.

255
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,330
Mr. Liu.

256
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,320
Who did this?

257
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,620
I didn't see it clearly.

258
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,400
But that man

259
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,740
was fully armed and had a clear target.

260
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,560
I don't think

261
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,700
he attacked me out of impulsion.

262
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,800
It could be intentional.

263
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,920
Intentional?

264
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,870
Who wants to harm you?

265
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,100
I'm not sure yet.

266
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,710
I have a suspicion.

267
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,020
But I can't prove it yet.

268
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,210
Assistant Tang.

269
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,730
When can I be discharged?

270
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:26,890
Mr. Liu.

271
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,300
No matter how urgent it is,

272
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,900
your health is the priority.

273
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,380
That's right.

274
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,090
You

275
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,530
need to take a good rest.

276
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,850
As for work,

277
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,900
Assistant Tang and Vice President Liu will help.

278
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,460
It's not for work.

279
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,150
I want to retire and live in seclusion.

280
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,880
-Seclusion? -Seclusion?

281
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,450
It's too extravagant.

282
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,580
In the past,

283
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,800
I was still obsessed with materials.

284
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,920
What about now?

285
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,390
The world

286
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,660
is a vanity fair.

287
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,020
Tian.

288
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,340
I want to live in a place of idyllic beauty.

289
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,320
We can enjoy nature

290
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,190
and seek for the real meaning of life.

291
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,030
After this accident,

292
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,240
you seem to have no interest in this mundane world.

293
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,700
Mr. Liu.

294
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,080
I'm going back to the company.

295
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,810
I'll send the documents to you when it's done.

296
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,310
No need.

297
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,290
Send all the documents

298
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,500
to Zhao.

299
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,880
Anyway, my tenure will be finished

300
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,150
in two weeks.

301
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,110
I plan to recommend Zhao

302
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,200
as the CEO of Qiansheng Group.

303
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:03,950
Xilai,

304
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,060
I'm sorry

305
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,420
for having you in such an accident.

306
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:08,859
Uncle.

307
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,079
Don't worry.

308
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,020
The doctor says I'm fine.

309
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,140
Nothing serious.

310
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,550
Then why did you say

311
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,670
you would let Zhao be your successor?

312
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,730
I suddenly realize

313
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,700
I may lose everything all of a sudden.

314
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,240
Compared to reputation that's not concrete,

315
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,869
being with the person I love

316
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,740
and enjoying life are the most important.

317
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,920
Before this accident,

318
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,650
I put too much effort into work.

319
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,810
It's time for me to take a break.

320
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,410
Why should I move on

321
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,120
while you take a break?

322
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,910
I won't do it.

323
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,800
Look.

324
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,740
Look at him.

325
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,890
How can he

326
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,190
take on his responsibility in this way?

327
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:44,670
Dad.

328
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,640
Don't shame me like this.

329
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,170
Uncle Wen thought that I would have a great career in the future.

330
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,900
I can surpass him in a few years.

331
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,320
-Mr. Wen. -Mr. Wen.

332
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,090
My dad praised you like that?

333
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,340
Zhao.

334
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,660
Be more careful.

335
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,060
Don't flatter yourself.

336
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,550
Don't you know what you're capable of?

337
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,170
I don't care.

338
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,280
My career depends on myself.

339
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,480
I don't rely on anyone.

340
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,050
Uncle.

341
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,710
Zhao looks childish,

342
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,580
but he's very responsible.

343
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,330
He doesn't care what others think,

344
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,020
but he cares about the recognition from you and Xilai.

345
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,410
So I hope you can

346
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,820
think highly of him.

347
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,370
Don't underestimate him.

348
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,060
Zhao, are you feeling better?

349
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,830
I feel much better

350
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,110
when I know you are on my side.

351
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,260
I must protect my boyfriend.

352
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,460
By the way,

353
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,140
what if Xilai really let you take over the company?

354
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,140
What would you do?

355
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,140
Dad.

356
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,630
Uncle Wen, I…

357
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,340
Why are you nervous?

358
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,940
I won't intervene

359
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,580
in your relationship.

360
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,600
Besides, I feel relieved

361
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,590
if Xian stays with you.

362
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,390
Dad, what are you talking about?

363
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,330
Uncle Wen.

364
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,380
I have to go back to the company.

365
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,380
He left.

366
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:30,840
Xian.

367
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,030
You just said

368
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,690
Mr. Liu wanted to leave everything

369
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,850
to Xizhao?

370
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:37,660
Yes.

371
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,440
But it seems Xilai has a sequela

372
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,690
after he woke up.

373
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,160
He's changed a lot.

374
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,430
Maybe it's just a flash of thought.

375
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,960
Then I should visit Mr. Liu.

376
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,240
Dr. Li.

377
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,000
Xilai.

378
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,280
What's his condition now?

379
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,320
Mr. Liu used to be a workaholic.

380
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,460
But he cares about nothing now.

381
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,150
This is too extreme.

382
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,220
In fact,

383
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,130
many people who have experienced fatal accident

384
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,520
would have extreme changes to their personality

385
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,410
after they wake up.

386
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,170
There are so many people

387
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,580
like Xilai who got totally enlightened

388
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,840
and want to enjoy life.

389
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,200
Totally enlightened.

390
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,420
See flowers bloom and wither in the fog.

391
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,760
Stare at the moon in the water.

392
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,340
It's all in vain.

393
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,460
Give him a change of environment,

394
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,990
and let him rest for a while.

395
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,600
He will get better like this.

396
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,230
Mr. Liu.

397
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,500
Paris, Venice, or Maldives.

398
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,530
Where do you want to go on vacation?

399
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,810
I'll arrange it right away.

400
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,890
I just want to find a quiet place

401
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,220
to have simple meals

402
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,800
and cultivate myself.

403
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,520
I didn't expect

404
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,250
Mr. Liu, who was so calculative,

405
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,760
wants nothing now.

406
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,480
Not true.

407
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
I still want Tian.

408
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,030
My hometown is a small town in a valley.

409
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,420
It's quiet and tranquil.

410
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,750
People live in harmony.

411
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,560
Isn't a small town in a valley

412
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,740
too down-to-earth?

413
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,090
It's good.

414
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,110
I like it.

415
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,740
Be happy and life will be long.

416
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,920
Enjoy longevity, with Tian by me every day.

417
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,470
Is he making poems now?

418
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,380
Thank you

419
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,190
for coming to see me.

420
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,590
Don't mention it.

421
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,760
You are the core of Qiansheng Group.

422
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,200
The whole board of directors care about you.

423
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,910
I'm fine.

424
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,420
Please tell them

425
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,820
and let the board rest assured.

426
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,150
Okay.

427
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,370
Xilai.

428
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,510
Xian told me

429
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,160
you planned to let Xizhao manage the company.

430
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,080
Yes.

431
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,010
There are two weeks before the CEO election.

432
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,970
I plan to give myself a break in advance.

433
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,270
I'll let Zhao be the acting CEO.

434
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,940
Aren't you doing well?

435
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,210
Why do you suddenly have this idea?

436
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,430
The board is waiting for you

437
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,390
to bring Qiansheng to a new height.

438
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,900
Maybe

439
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,980
after one experienced an accident,

440
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,660
they have a further understanding of life.

441
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,010
When I was in a coma,

442
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,610
I dreamed about my dad.

443
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,090
He told me before he died, his biggest regret

444
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,620
was not spending enough time with his family.

445
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,100
I don't want to have

446
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,280
the same regret with my dad.

447
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,270
Xilai.

448
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,570
Think twice.

449
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,760
Uncle Wen.

450
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,110
Don't worry.

451
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,500
I'll still be a shareholder

452
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,050
even if I am not the CEO.

453
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,710
If the company needs me,

454
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,670
I will do my best.

455
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,490
Besides,

456
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,950
I believe

457
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,190
Zhao won't let you down.

458
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,710
Hello, dad.

459
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm on leave these days.

460
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,410
I want to stay at home for a few days.

461
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,410
My dear daughter,

462
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,760
your uncle and I have signed up for a senior tour group.

463
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,160
It'll be half a month before we are back.

464
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,360
You're getting more and more carefree.

465
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,100
All right, I'm hanging up.

466
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,900
I'm boarding.

467
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,260
Our tea shop is left unattended.

468
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,550
You can come back and look after the shop.

469
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:29,880
Okay.

470
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:41,720
Mr. Liu.

471
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,100
Are you really going to abandon me,

472
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,980
a hard-working and competent assistant?

473
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,290
What are you talking about, Assistant Tang?

474
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,580
The CEO often changes, but the assistant remains.

475
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,580
In ancient times,

476
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,860
you would be the one accompanying three generations of emperors.

477
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,990
You should be happy.

478
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,410
You're right.

479
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,030
I've made it through Uncle Liu and you.

480
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,320
And then there'll be Vice President Liu.

481
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,980
So you should assist Zhao well

482
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,740
and take care of the company.

483
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,900
I'll meet you

484
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,940
after finishing today's appointment by patients.

485
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,350
Then I'll give you psychological counseling whole-heartedly.

486
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,010
As for the medical fee, I'll give you a discount.

487
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,590
No, I'm not sick.

488
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,000
Miss Tian.

489
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,190
He's not stable yet.

490
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,190
Keep him company.

491
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:21,750
No problem.

492
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,920
(Tian's Tea House)

493
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,110
Xilai.

494
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
My home is a little small and shabby.

495
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,100
Make do with it.

496
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,510
I think it's more down-to-earth.

497
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,140
After so many years of hard work,

498
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,150
I can finally have a good rest.

499
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,540
It's hard to imagine you've changed this much.

500
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,700
You were Mr. Liu,

501
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,260
who kept talking about money

502
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,900
and business.

503
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,060
But now, your characters change so rapidly.

504
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,890
People change.

505
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,560
You once said

506
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,190
that there was a whole biological chain between us.

507
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,920
But now, you are my girlfriend.

508
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,340
I was careless.

509
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,850
That's why people need to watch their mouth.

510
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,070
I yearn for the place my girlfriend used to live.

511
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,300
What a wonderful marriage life!

512
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,440
What did you say?

513
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,210
I mean

514
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,060
this is a relaxing way of living I've been longing for.

515
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,490
Did Vice President Liu cast a spell on you?

516
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,170
I remember

517
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,270
you despised his life as a golden turtle in the wishing pool.

518
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,090
(Golden Turtle in the Wishing Pool)

519
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,650
Now Zhao and I

520
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,700
have more common topics.

521
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,840
We're getting closer.

522
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,130
My dear cousin.

523
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,870
Are you really leaving?

524
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,110
I'm not ready yet.

525
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,040
It's too sudden.

526
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,470
I have faith in you.

527
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,960
I've thought about

528
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,680
what Xian told me before.

529
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,220
You have many strengths.

530
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,150
But

531
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,190
you are outshined by me before.

532
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,910
If you have any problem in the company,

533
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,300
just ask Assistant Tang.

534
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,470
He is the person

535
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,410
you can trust the most in this company.

536
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,210
But I...

537
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,190
No buts.

538
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,800
It's the time for liver detoxification.

539
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,770
Staying up late is bad for your liver. Go to bed early.

540
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,060
Detoxification?

541
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,430
Is this who my cousin is?

542
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,130
He retired as a health expert.

543
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,100
Xilai.

544
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,940
Your bed is made.

545
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,240
Tian.

546
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,290
I'm practicing the 24-hour Health Maintenance.

547
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,160
It's 7 p.m,

548
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,710
time for a walk.

549
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,100
Do you want to join me?

550
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:10,250
No.

551
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,860
I'm too tired after a long trip.

552
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,670
After you absorb the essence of the sun and the moon,

553
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,150
go back to the room to sleep.

554
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:16,970
Actually,

555
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,890
if you agree,

556
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,700
I can have another activity.

557
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,220
No need. You may continue cultivating.

558
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,190
(Bonus Scenes)

559
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,530
Control yourself. You're still on a diet.
(Bonus Scenes)

560
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,070
(Bonus Scenes)

561
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,670
Miss Shan.
(Bonus Scenes)

562
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:39,280
(Bonus Scenes)

563
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,140
I saw that you didn't eat much at dinner,
(Bonus Scenes)

564
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,920
so I made a healthy meal for you.
(Bonus Scenes)

565
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,150
(Bonus Scenes)

566
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:43,820
I promise
(Bonus Scenes)

567
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,070
(Bonus Scenes)

568
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,210
you won't gain any fat
(Bonus Scenes)

569
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,810
after this meal.
(Bonus Scenes)

570
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,220
(Bonus Scenes)

571
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,680
Really?
(Bonus Scenes)

572
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,730
(Bonus Scenes)

573
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,630
This kind of diet meal
(Bonus Scenes)

574
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,780
is perfect for people like me, an inhabitant of the Fatty Planet.
(Bonus Scenes)

575
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,050
I had a classmate
(Bonus Scenes)

576
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,580
(Bonus Scenes)

577
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,310
who liked to call herself an inhabitant of the Fatty Planet.
(Bonus Scenes)

578
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,710
Her surname is Shan, too.
(Bonus Scenes)

579
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,660
(Bonus Scenes)

580
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,120
Really?
(Bonus Scenes)

581
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,940
(Bonus Scenes)

582
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,070
What a coincidence.
(Bonus Scenes)

583
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,700
(Bonus Scenes)

584
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,950
But she is much heavier than you.
(Bonus Scenes)

585
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,010
Her name is Strong.
(Bonus Scenes)

586
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,180
(Bonus Scenes)

587
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,120
It sounds interesting.
(Bonus Scenes)

588
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,700
(Bonus Scenes)

589
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,330
She didn't like to be called by that name.
(Bonus Scenes)

590
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,090
So I called her Fatty.
(Bonus Scenes)

591
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,130
(Bonus Scenes)

592
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,530
I didn't mean to mock her.
(Bonus Scenes)

593
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,150
(Bonus Scenes)

594
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,700
But she was very angry when she found out.
(Bonus Scenes)

595
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,730
It was just a joke.
(Bonus Scenes)

596
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:22,300
(Bonus Scenes)

597
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,490
But somehow,
(Bonus Scenes)

598
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,180
(Bonus Scenes)

599
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,180
she transferred to another school.
(Bonus Scenes)

600
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,270
(Bonus Scenes)

601
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,430
She must be very sad.
(Bonus Scenes)

602
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:27,980
(Bonus Scenes)

603
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,780
Girls love beauty during their adolescence.
(Bonus Scenes)

604
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,200
But everyone around her thought she was ugly and fat.
(Bonus Scenes)

605
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,130
She was not ugly.
(Bonus Scenes)

606
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:33,420
(Bonus Scenes)

607
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,020
She looked very attractive.
(Bonus Scenes)

608
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,110
(Bonus Scenes)

609
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,810
She was just a little bit heavy.
(Bonus Scenes)

610
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,020
You've always been so mean.
(Bonus Scenes)

611
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,670
(Bonus Scenes)
